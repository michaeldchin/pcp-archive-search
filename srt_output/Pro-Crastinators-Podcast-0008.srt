1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But I'm not working.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm doing nothing.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
My dick I'm jerking.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Myself I'm sucking.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I am an asshole.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I am a stupid.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I've got a deadline.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't wanna do it.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hi, I'm Digibro.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nate wanted me to edit this video because he's trying to edit his video.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And he doesn't want to procrastinate his video by editing The Procrastinators Podcast about procrastination.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So I put it off for a day and a half to play Bloodborne.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now I'm trying to finish it up.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But I'm just gonna let Jesse's song do all the work for me.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's quite the burden.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a hard knock life.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Being a genius.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hey everybody, welcome to The Procrastinators Podcast.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm Digibro and I am supposed to be working right now.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But I'm not doing shit.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What are you guys doing? Who are you?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm Guy. I'm the best guy ever.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know, it's come to my attention recently that I've been putting a lot of work into these podcasts, eating up like all my weekend time.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So I've been literally, The Procrastinator Podcast has been causing me to procrastinate from my best anime evervids and all kinds of shit.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So how's that for a medic shit?

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Likely excused. Hippocrite, what's going on with you?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's me. I'm Hippocrite and here I am.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you supposed to be doing right now?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm supposed to. I'm supposed to be relaxing after a hard day's work, but I didn't do the hard day's work yet.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Isn't that the worst?

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When it's like, the whole day has gone by and it's like, I don't know, like nine o'clock at night and you're like shit.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I kept pushing shit back and now it's nine and I'm supposed to be done and I still have everything I was supposed to do today.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I need to make an appointment to get my oil changed, my fucking car and I haven't done it for like four weeks now.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So it's not even like...

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I guess I can't ask this question. You guys both take a lot of work on your videos, yeah?

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Like your content takes pretty considerable...

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I just work really slowly in the writing phase, but yeah.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But both of you guys are pretty infrequent uploaders, so that time has really felt strongly.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know, I feel like guys who must have it good in terms of feeling like they're working all the time,

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
there's got to be guys like YMS where it's like, it takes them an insane amount of effort to put out their video,

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
but they still get out one a month, so...

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, that's the dream.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It feels like the amount of work and the amount of time it takes are very equivalent and I bet he feels pretty fulfilled that way.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, and I bet he's really fucking busy.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I believe him when he talks about how Mahardi works and how he's fucking grinding away all the time.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
At the same time, me and DeVu have talked about how we think that YMS possibly...

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The way he schedules his work or the way he does it probably takes longer than it needs to.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He seems like his process is overly complicated and that's part of why it takes so long.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He has to do his research. It takes him a while to find all that shit.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It results in good things. Sometimes it goes too far with the Senecti thing that he admitted was bullshit,

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
but you know, it's a rarity.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
YMS is what I say when I go to the doctor and they tell me I have multiple sclerosis.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
YMS more like, what a mess, am I right?

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, zaydam.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, it's weird for me because my videos take very little time to make.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I envy that so much.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The thing is that everyone thinks I'm really prolific,

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but I could be doing so much more that I always feel like I'm sitting...

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The amount of videos I put out, people always leave comments like,

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
oh, this must have taken so much work and it's like...

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I mean, you're talking about editing stuff.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're pretty quick at writing a whole thing down and then recording it.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, well, it's that I just have a lot of general knowledge about things,

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
so it doesn't take me a long time to research,

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and I know exactly where to research when I do,

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
so there are times when I spend more time on it when I go out and try to find interviews and stuff,

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
but with anime, there's not a lot of that in existence.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
With YMS, I imagine he has to go through hours of behind-the-scenes documentaries.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He probably watches all these event...

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The After Earth video, I was like, where did you find all this shit?

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, I know, it's crazy.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's got all these TV interviews with Will Smith and shit,

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and I'm like, with anime, you've got the one translated interview that exists on the internet.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Anything that comes out goes through ANN, so it takes five minutes to find it all.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, I'm experiencing this now, making a video about a game currently,

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
but the reason that I focused on anime,

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think I generally have more of a historic attachment to anime.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I've got strong feelings for anime, but my point is,

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
when I was thinking about how to make the channel,

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I was deciding should I focus more on anime and more on video games,

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and the thing that pushed it over the top was definitely like,

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I do not want to have to fucking play a game and get footage and record it and download it.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm like, if I could just tour it to show, that's a million times easier, way better.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And right now, I just had to replay to get the exact footage I need this game several times.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's taken hours, so it's like...

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, that's exactly why I don't want to do more game videos,

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
because it just takes so long, not just because games are longer.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Imagine you're making a Bloodborne video, and that game, if you make a mistake,

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
you have to play the whole game again.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's like, Jesus Christ.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, the thing is, for me, I prefer, and I wish more game videos would be this anyways,

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and we kind of talked about this in the review rules video,

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
that I want to see more game videos that are just about specific aspects of a game,

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and I think you could get way...

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to be able to play a 20-hour game once, and get all the footage,

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and then make three videos out of it, instead of making one.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then it would feel a lot more justified, and a lot less...

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
With the Dark Souls and Bloodborne video I just put out,

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
it was about very specific things, and it was very general,

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
so for a lot of it I just used whatever,

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and I took 45 minutes of my own Bloodborne footage,

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
just of showing off all the weapons,

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
because I just wanted you to have a sense of how they all worked,

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and getting a few of the mechanics that I needed,

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and then other than that, all of the footage was either from the let's plays that we did

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, or just cutscene videos,

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
because every cutscene in the game is online,

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
so I would just search all the cutscenes, or pull other people's playthroughs,

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
because those are games that people have a lot of let's plays of, and stuff like that,

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
so yeah, just sort of cobbling together whatever footage I can find,

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
but certainly if I was doing a comprehensive analysis of Bloodborne,

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I would have to either play through it five fucking times,

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and have 70, no, probably over 100 hours of footage to sort through.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Like at the very least, if you want the three endings,

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that's three playthroughs right there, and you can't go back, there's no going back.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The whole recording a lot of gameplay footage is the entire reason why GRPG exists on my channel.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right, right, because you have it.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, I mean, I don't want to record a whole GRPG, because they're like the longest games ever, for a review.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, you meant because you don't have the footage, because that's the show where you don't show anything.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, I don't show any footage, it's an excuse.

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, right, okay, I see.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
For other things, I would just play the whole game, and since they're not usually too long, it'd be like, I don't know, nine hours.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I do think a lot of people are being like, because I know that, and Nate,

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I know you're the kind of guy who you really want every video to be like your perfect vision, and to be like a perfect video.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
True, but that doesn't mean it's an all-encompassing thing.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, and I think it's overboard with a lot of people, because I think we've gotten to a point where YouTube videos,

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
they have to impress you, but they don't have to be perfect anymore.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I think there was a time where if you wanted someone to sit down for 20 minutes, then you had to be sequelitis and really blow their mind with animation and stuff.

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But Noah Caldwell-Gervais, that dude does 45-minute videos with no editing in his audio,

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and the video is like, you can tell that he'll just turn on a game, play it for 45 minutes, and then just slap the footage he has in there.

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It very rarely matches up to what he's saying, which as a result for me, I don't usually watch the video,

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and therefore I usually completely lose track of what he's saying, because it's so unedited that I just can't possibly give a fuck.

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So what we're saying really is if you want to get your own obstacles out of your way, if you're going to do something like this,

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
my approach is obviously the wrong one for making YouTube videos.

139
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't know that it's the wrong one, it's just that I'm just saying that these days you can do less and get away with it.

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Ultimately, the reason you're doing your videos that way is not to do it smart, it's because it's what you want to do.

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's right, I got a job when I work at it, so that I can make the videos that I want to make.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Because if you just wanted this to be a business decision, then you would just fucking make 5-minute chunk videos.

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And make fucking Digi Bro videos. Nobody wants to do that.

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, that's the funny thing, because in the month of January, I finished writing and doing all the audio for my Asterisk War series,

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and they're all being edited by the DeVue.

146
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So in January, all I had to do was let him make videos for me, and I was going to make enough money off of those.

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
As long as he made 3 videos, I'd make enough, and I knew he would do that, even though I have to pay him,

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and I made a decent amount through ad revenue.

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I should be doing a lot more, because I should be trying to have a buffer of money.

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I should be trying to make enough money that I can save some, or think about my future and put some money into my future.

151
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But I was just like, eh, I can skate by letting DeVue edit 3 videos for me.

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I put out some stuff that was all non-patron videos, stuff that wasn't deep enough for me to patron it,

153
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
because I'm very particular. I'll only patron something if I think it's up to snuff.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So then this month, it was like, alright, I gotta get back in the game.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I gotta actually make one of my own videos, and I wrote that Dark Souls in Bloodborne 1,

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and I was so scared of editing it, I was like, oh, it's going to be a nightmare.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The video was like 12 minutes long, and the editing took like maybe 4 hours.

158
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, that's a dream.

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But there was so much more of me putting it off, because I thought it was going to be so much worse than it was.

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I was like, oh, I can't possibly, I'm going to need beer, and I drank half a beer,

161
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and then did the whole first half of the video in one sitting, and I was like, oh, that wasn't so bad.

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
A lot of it is just starting is the hardest part.

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's definitely true.

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's a lot worse when you don't know exactly what the footage is going to be,

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
or what you're going to have to put in there, because when you know exactly what it's going to be,

166
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
because me and Davoo have both taken up this method where we download everything we need before we start,

167
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and then it's helpful in two ways.

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Firstly, that you can just plug everything in very easily,

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and secondly, that it's incentivized for you to finish the video faster,

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
because you need to get all these fucking files off your computer.

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
For instance, the Hideaki-Ano video, where there was footage from everything he ever worked on,

172
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
so I downloaded every single thing he'd ever done, and I knew exactly which clips I wanted for which part.

173
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So editing that didn't take very long, in spite of how long the video was,

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
because I had all the clips right there, and I needed them off my computer.

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That is a very wise way of doing things.

176
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I usually find myself downloading materials like that,

177
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
but I pretty much always just try to get what I know the base thing I'll need,

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
like game footage or the whole show, or whatever that's going to be,

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and then just the way that I do shit, I end up editing in a lot of extra shit,

180
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
so I have to go through all that whole process of downloading and waiting.

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's what I used to do, because it used to be that I'd get to a point in the video

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
where it's like, okay, well, nothing in the show really reflects this,

183
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and now I've got to go find something else, so now when I first start, I'm like,

184
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
alright, this clip, this line in the dialogue I know is not in the show.

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's go find a clip before we start editing, because it really takes you out of the groove

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
of editing when you're putting shit together, and then suddenly you hit a roadblock

187
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and you don't have the footage, and you have to go find it somewhere,

188
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and it's like, you completely stop what you're doing to go make something else.

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Man, it's just, I do that, my whole editing process is just a continuous series of that.

190
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, that's what it used to be for me, and I'm glad that Me and DeVu sort of changed gears a bit,

191
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and now the only stuff that he really has to, because he puts together a document

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
for all these Astroscore videos where he'll write down everything he'll need for each line,

193
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and then me and him go through it and find all this shit, so if there's a bunch of shows that he...

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
because there's a lot of, I make references to lots of things that he doesn't know,

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
because he's not an anime fan, or not a long time anime fan anyways.

196
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I've been wondering how he dealt with that, not really, yeah.

197
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, in the early days, because a lot of the older videos he did for me,

198
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
it was interesting because he would use stuff that I'd never even seen before.

199
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Like, in the one where I explained what is anime and what isn't,

200
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
he brings in all these Tizuka clips from shows I'd never heard of,

201
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
because he was doing his own research.

202
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I would write the video, and then he would have to go re-research the video

203
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and learn it all for himself, and it had some interesting results,

204
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but for these Astroscore ones, when there's parts where I'm like, you know,

205
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
there's, I'll say something like, in other generic anime of this type,

206
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you know, and then he has to ask me, okay, what are other generic anime of this type?

207
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll give him a list of like five shows, and he'll go download clips from those shows.

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll come to you sometimes, and be like, did you, I need like a super robot moment,

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
like what can I use? I did that a couple times with the grown login one.

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah, for the getter robo clips.

211
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And the G Gundam, which was actually one of my favorite moments in that whole thing.

212
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Man, the fucking King of Hearts, holy shit, that was like the coolest thing that ever happened.

213
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That was amazing, yeah.

214
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I need to watch that show, and I don't want to sink fucking, what, like 24 hours of my life

215
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
into watching that show.

216
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, it's fucking long, it's like 50 episodes.

217
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's 50 episodes, so 16 and a half hours, probably, 17 hours.

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's a long ass show for not needing to be.

219
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You can skip a lot of it, like, there's a lot of episodes that if you can tell early on

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
that it's not going to be, like, because there's a lot of just stupid one-off episodes.

221
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hey, this is a good example of something that incentivized procrastination,

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
because I'm the kind of guy who is really uncomfortable with skipping anything in a show

223
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
when I'm going to watch it.

224
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And as a result, I keep being like, I'll do it later, I'll get to that.

225
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I wish that I'd seen G Gundam by now, but I haven't, because I've got this obsession

226
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
where I'm like, I have to watch it all, it's 50 episodes, it's a long ass time.

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
For me, it's all about measuring exactly how much do I give a fuck

228
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and how much am I going to miss out on, because unlike you, I spoil myself for a lot of stuff.

229
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And a big part of that, I make it sound sometimes like I just go out of my way to spoil myself,

230
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
but it's more like I hang out in the community for long enough

231
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and you're going to get spoiled for everything.

232
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Like, there's not a gamer alive who doesn't know about Eris dying in Final Fantasy 7

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
because it was spoiled like a week after the game came out in a magazine.

234
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So if you even read gaming magazines, you'd know.

235
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
A bunch of cock knobs, we'd do that, fuck them.

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And it became like a really infamous spoiler that everyone knew it.

237
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So like no one's going into that game not knowing that.

238
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And like, there's a lot of stuff that I just glimpse on TV, because I grew up,

239
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
G Gundam was on Cartoon Network when I was like 13.

240
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So like I'd seen a bunch of it, I got the point, you know.

241
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And so when me and my friend finally like marathoned the whole show,

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
then there was a lot of episodes where we'd be like,

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
oh, this is an episode about Neo-Mexico, which is never going to be relevant again.

244
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah, let's skip that, you know.

245
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Because a lot of them are like...

246
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's racist dog, that's racist.

247
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, a lot of them are like really corny sob stories.

248
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You know, it'll be like, oh, Neo-Mexico's sister was captured by the cartel

249
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and he has to fight and then it gets all emotional.

250
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh my god, Jesse Wood joins us.

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Wow, that's really funny.

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, hey, what's up?

253
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Alright, Jesse.

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Now we got to sync our audio with Jesse Wood.

255
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Alright, on the count of three say procrastination.

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
One, two, three.

257
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Procrastination.

258
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That sounded terrible.

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Jesse, what have you been procrastinating on joining the podcast by doing?

260
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I want to die.

261
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can't escape the dream through death.

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Is that an answer?

263
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No, I guess it's not.

264
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Are you saying you're procrastinating on dying?

265
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, just do it already, faggot.

266
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Procrastinating on life because I'm dead inside.

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I do like the idea of, you know, I've been wanting to kill myself for years

268
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
but it's just so much effort to load the shotgun.

269
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Well, that's not quite exactly the reason that guys like Sato and NHK don't do it.

270
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But at times they're like, man, I just want to die but it's such a fucking bother.

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't want to go through all that shit.

272
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's a different sort of thing, I guess, though.

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Man, let me tell you guys, I have been the least motivated to do anything that I've been in years.

274
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's been swell.

275
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And by swell, I mean it's been hell.

276
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hell in a swell.

277
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I've been pretty unmotivated myself.

278
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, you know, I was telling that story earlier, Jesse wasn't here,

279
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
but I was talking about how in January DeVue had all my work covered, so all I did was play.

280
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It was kind of cool because I finally got around to playing all the Souls games

281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
just because I didn't feel like I had to do anything and I was like, fuck it, I'm just going to do this.

282
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It wasn't even like, I thought I was just going to play Bloodborne and then play the Witcher 3

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
because those are the two games that I really wanted to play.

284
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And then I got so hooked on Bloodborne that I was like, I have to finally do Dark Souls.

285
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And then after I did Dark Souls, I was like, I have to finally do Demon Souls.

286
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And then you got to Dark Souls 2 and you're like, I do not have to play Dark Souls 2.

287
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's exactly what happened.

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm still struggling with it.

289
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I kind of want to try to play the PS3 version and see if it's less frustrating than Scholar of the First Sin,

290
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but I suspect it's not.

291
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I thought they'd have made it better because it was already pretty shit in the original version.

292
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah, well, they tightened up a lot of things, but they also added a lot of enemies.

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't want to talk about Dark Souls 2, it's stupid.

294
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, I do want to talk about what I want to talk about.

295
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What I want to talk about is a better game than Bloodborne, which is a piece of shit.

296
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh no.

297
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How can you even say that shit?

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
How can you say that in my life?

299
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Jesse is an advocate of, he's a star.

300
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It'll be okay.

301
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Jesse will beat Bloodborne one day and he'll like it.

302
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You know what?

303
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't even want to argue.

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're right.

305
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's the best game ever.

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You were singing about how tough the heart it was and how much you loved it,

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
raping you in your face constantly.

308
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Who are you?

309
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What happened to that handsome young man?

310
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Shut up.

311
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Who is this guy?

312
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No, but Jesse did make a good point earlier,

313
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
because I knew the answer to that when I said,

314
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
we were arguing earlier for the people listening to the podcast,

315
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and I said, what happened to the guy who sang the song about liking games

316
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that are hard in the Demon's Souls video?

317
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And I know exactly what happened to him.

318
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He got older and doesn't have time for shit anymore,

319
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and isn't into doing that, which is the same for me.

320
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's why I've always said that I don't think any game is hard if it's a good game,

321
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
because the only thing that makes a game hard is that you have to learn how to play it

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and do the same thing until you know what to do.

323
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The hard thing is just having the patience for it and wanting it.

324
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I guess there's some games that are probably just so hard in terms of dexterity

325
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
that if it's a certain kind of platformer game

326
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
where you just have to be able to move your hands fast enough.

327
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
DDR is hard for really fat people.

328
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah, I'm completely uncoordinated, so DDR is really difficult.

329
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I mean, I guess I could eventually learn it,

330
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
but I don't know if I'd ever be able to move my legs that fast

331
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
without literally beefing up myself and getting strong for the sake of DDR,

332
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
which again would make it easy.

333
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's just a matter of what you're willing to put yourself through.

334
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I no longer have the patience for anything.

335
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I hate exerting any effort whatsoever for anything.

336
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I hate doing anything or having to do anything.

337
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I can't stand learning new things.

338
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's like poison to me, the concept that I might have to learn something new

339
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
or read a set of instructions or work my way around something.

340
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Just for this very podcast, I had to go figure out how to make audio

341
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
two keyframe transitions and animate that thing.

342
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't even know what that is.

343
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I taught Demu, I showed them the shit.

344
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Look at us, Jesse, we're all learning things.

345
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You gotta get out there and mix it up.

346
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
With Bloodborne though, because I didn't play Bloodborne for all that time

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
because I thought it was too hard.

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I played it when it first came out and the loading screens were really, really bad.

349
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Every time I died, I was just like, I don't want to play this anymore.

350
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The loading screens are way too fucking long.

351
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The reason I ended up playing it was just that I learned everything about it

352
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
from watching Victor play and watching other people play.

353
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I was like, well, what I came to realize is that that game is so much fun

354
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
just to play that I didn't even care if I made it anywhere.

355
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I figured that I could just play every level over and over again

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and it would always be fun because the combat is fun.

357
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's kind of what I did.

358
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I just played through the first area until I was so overpowered

359
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
that there was nothing that they could do to me.

360
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Then I went to the next area and I played that until I was so overpowered

361
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that there was nothing they could do to me.

362
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Then by that point, I was so overpowered that the entire game was easy.

363
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I never had to fight a boss more than three or four times at the absolute most

364
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and just kind of steamrolled the whole game.

365
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There was a guy in a...

366
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
No, go ahead.

367
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Well, what I was trying to talk about ages ago

368
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
is conversely to all of you who are all feeling very unmotivated.

369
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I have recently become...

370
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm not feeling unmotivated.

371
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But you said you were.

372
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You said you were unmotivated for stuff.

373
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I never said that shit.

374
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
They were saying it.

375
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I never heard that.

376
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Jesse, I think.

377
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Whatever hippo.

378
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't...

379
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I have become much more motivated to do stuff

380
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
like progress in some sort of work every day, much more recently

381
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
than I have ever in my whole life.

382
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I've been going into...

383
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I've got a university and I'm doing an animation for my final film.

384
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
For my final year.

385
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You know what I...

386
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And I've been going in every day to the library to work on it from,

387
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I don't know, like 12 to 6 and then coming back and then playing games

388
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and it's been cool.

389
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, that's the dream.

390
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You know, hippo, I remember a few years ago

391
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
when you were always talking about how unmotivated you are

392
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and a lot of the problems you had.

393
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And I kept saying, you're going to turn 22 or 23

394
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and then you're just going to suddenly be motivated.

395
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I am 22 now.

397
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah, because I remember having this conversation

398
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
because I felt the same way.

399
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And then you'll turn 26 and you'll never be motivated again.

400
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Well, because when you're up until your early 20s

401
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
your brain is just not finished developing yet.

402
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And for me, when I was a teenager and when I was 20 and 21

403
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I just had no desire to do anything.

404
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And then it just kind of clicked and I was like,

405
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
oh, now I want to do stuff all the time.

406
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Now I don't ever want to not be doing something.

407
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Well, it's not that I love doing stuff.

408
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I do love doing stuff, but it's always been difficult

409
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
to get into that groove.

410
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, the mindset.

411
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So I've just been figuring out how to force myself into that mindset.

412
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Getting into a pattern like that is the best thing.

413
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The most productive time of my entire life, by far,

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
was when me and my brother were doing T-Bab episodes

415
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
every Saturday morning.

416
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We would crank those motherfuckers out.

417
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And we were highly motivated.

418
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We were fucking achieving our dreams.

419
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It was awesome.

420
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
As unmotivated as Jesse is,

421
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
he is still producing a lot of content without even trying to.

422
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I should rephrase it.

423
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's not that I'm unmotivated.

424
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's that I'm sick and tired of being motivated.

425
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And I wish I could be unmotivated.

426
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's like an addiction.

427
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Creativity is a serious addiction for me.

428
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I can't stop it.

429
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's kind of how I felt when I played all the Souls games.

430
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It was like I had to physically rip myself away from that obsession

431
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
with I have to be making something.

432
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It just gets me to a point where I just realize

433
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
it's too much effort to organize my thoughts

434
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
because my thoughts are like a swirling ball of chaos.

435
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It takes effort to organize it into concise little videos and shit.

436
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And I realize it gets to the point where

437
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'll never be able to make videos as fast as I can write videos.

438
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So no matter what I do,

439
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll always have a backlog of 50,000 fucking ideas that I want to do.

440
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So eventually, I just got to say,

441
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
someone come here and kill me.

442
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Come to my house and put a gun in my asshole and pull the trigger.

443
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
If that really is an issue,

444
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
you should consider getting an editor or something.

445
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't know how that would work.

446
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
For me, for all the time you see videos coming out on my channel,

447
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
all the time I'm not making them is me obsessing over what I should be making.

448
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Every time I finish a video, my immediate thought is,

449
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
okay, what's the next one?

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And then it's just this long period of figuring out what the next one is.

451
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
There's no celebration when you post a video.

452
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
There's a window of a couple hours after we're at peace.

453
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There's a window where I...

454
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
For me, it's as long as the comments last.

455
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because basically, comments typically last about two days

456
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
before you stop getting new ones or they slow down considerably.

457
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And there's that initial point when you post a video

458
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and then you get a couple hundred comments,

459
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
at least for me I do because I get a lot of comments on my videos,

460
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and that early period where I'm just reading all the new comments

461
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
as they come in and responding to them really actively,

462
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
that's the big come period where it's just like,

463
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
okay, I have finished this thing, it's done, now I get to enjoy it.

464
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
My sense of peace only lasts until I see the first comment.

465
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's a window we can believe in.

466
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well, most of my comments are positive,

467
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
so for me it's always like...

468
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Because by the time I'm done with the video,

469
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I've always totally lost faith in it because I've now heard it 20 times

470
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and I'm questioning it already.

471
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So with the Dark Souls and Bloodborne one,

472
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I guess another way to put it is that I become so familiar with the idea

473
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
that it doesn't seem like a revelation to me.

474
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It seems like something I've known forever.

475
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
All the time.

476
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So I put it out and I'm like, what the fuck?

477
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Everyone knows this clearly.

478
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And then it's not until people start commenting

479
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and they're like, wow, you really opened my eyes.

480
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I never thought about this and I'm like, okay, cool.

481
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah, that's a relieving thing to say.

482
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I legit thought my both girl and Logan videos were complete garbage

483
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
when I released them.

484
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
My friends are just going to make fun of me.

485
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
What was I thinking releasing this piece of absolute trash?

486
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
No, they were great.

487
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It came out okay though.

488
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But I don't feel like I'm the arbiter of if my videos are even good.

489
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I guess nobody is.

490
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah, I mean, we all kind of feel like that.

491
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I feel like that every time I make a video.

492
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's one of those things.

493
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You just got to have people reassure you that it's actually cool

494
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
because they haven't seen it yet.

495
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You got to gaze into the void and then hope it gazes back favorably.

496
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You've been spoiled for your own content.

497
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I definitely have a lot of...

498
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I am the arbiter of whether or not my content is good

499
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
because who the fuck is going to know

500
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
whether or not I achieved my goals better than me?

501
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That's true.

502
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's not like I trust anyone else's judgment over myself,

503
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
but I just don't trust my judgment either when it's being released.

504
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Who's opinion am I going to take on my videos?

505
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
My commenters? My commenters are fucking scum.

506
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They're idiots. They're morons. I hate them all.

507
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I have two different types of videos

508
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
that I have the ones that I know are good because I like

509
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and I have the ones that I'm okay with because everyone else likes them.

510
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
All of my really long videos, I deeply love

511
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and I don't care what anyone else thinks.

512
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
My psychopaths videos never got a whole lot of attention,

513
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
but I thought they were the best things I'd ever written

514
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
and I still think they're better than anybody else's content, you know?

515
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I make no qualms about judging my own stuff against everybody else's.

516
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I wouldn't do that in a video because it would look incredibly arrogant, you know?

517
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But like...

518
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I've made videos right now.

519
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah.

520
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Well, it's not like a top ten video.

521
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Like when I did my top ten videos, YouTube videos of...

522
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Top ten people. Did you think sir? Shit.

523
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Right. If I had done that and I included my own work,

524
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
then it would have had my psychopaths theories in it.

525
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It would have definitely had the Hidey Ikeano videos in it.

526
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It probably would have had my Evangelion analysis in it.

527
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You know, maybe even my Nanoha one.

528
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I almost wish that you had done that just so people could watch that

529
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and be like, wow, fuck this guy.

530
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Right.

531
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, it would have been funny.

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Maybe you should release a corrected version with just your videos.

533
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I mean, I make my videos because I want someone to make something that I want to watch.

534
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You know, it's like the whole point of me doing them is

535
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
no one else has done this idea yet and this idea is what I want to exist.

536
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So I have to do it.

537
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You know, I've had plenty of videos that I...

538
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I've had plenty of videos that I didn't do specifically because someone else did it.

539
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You know?

540
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Right.

541
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Like I would never want to do a video on Aldenoa Zero because

542
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
between demo and anime addicts, they both did great ones.

543
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Although anime addicts channel has completely been taken down by YouTube.

544
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So I...

545
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Because he was a guy who like, he did a bunch of great videos

546
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and then like quit because real life got in the way and he went off to go become an engineer.

547
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And then I think in the time since he stopped doing videos,

548
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
he got three strikes and his channel got taken down.

549
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Just didn't pay attention or something.

550
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yeah, while he was gone.

551
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So yeah, like we've lost the best breakdowns of Aldenoa Zero

552
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and what's it called?

553
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That fucking... that Watanabe show that wasn't good.

554
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Zankono Terror.

555
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

556
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He had great videos on those and they're gone now, but like...

557
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Too bad.

558
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I wouldn't want to cover something that someone else already did a great job on.

559
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I cover it because I don't think anyone else has said what I want to say.

560
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And so it only makes sense that those would be some of my favorite videos

561
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
because it's something I wanted to see.

562
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
That's true.

563
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, generally, I generally don't look at the reviews of the games that I want to talk about

564
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
because I just want to talk about them.

565
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's never really... I want to, you know, make a big splash with this one

566
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
or I want to blow people's minds.

567
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I just want to talk about the games I like.

568
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You got to shoot for the moon because even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.

569
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, I never thought of that.

570
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But, you know, it's just...

572
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Something about the way... well, never mind.

573
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I was going to make a Bloodborne reference, but you're not far enough in the game.

574
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Nothing is...

575
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I've seen the whole thing.

576
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Relieving to me, then when one of you guys is going...

577
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
says you're going to make a video on something that I also want to make a video on

578
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
because I feel like I can trust you all to make a good video on it, and then I don't have to.

579
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Oh, I've had a lot of...

580
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I've told Nate...

581
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I've told Nate that he's going to do a fucking Undertale video.

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm like, thank God, take all my Undertale notes, throw them in the fucking trash, throw a match in it, because I don't care.

583
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, no, I told Nate before that, like, uh...

584
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I mean, that's also why I didn't do an Undertale video, because when I played it, I was like...

585
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, man. All this pressure.

586
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It's going in the trash.

587
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
When I played through the game, I was like...

588
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I feel like I could knock something out on this really quick, and it would be...

589
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It would get a lot of attention, but I didn't want to undercut Nate,

590
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
because I felt like he would say all the things I said, but do a better video.

591
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I promise it is coming.

592
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm working on it all the time.

593
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So, like, immediately...

594
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm never going to do a Girl in the Gone video, because you did the perfect...

595
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I mean, I already have one where I compared it to Kill Out Kill, but...

596
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I don't think anyone else could do one without at least acknowledging the king in the room.

597
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Who could follow that up? Nobody.

598
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I did my one where I compared it to Kill Out Kill, which is a great video on its own,

599
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
but I would never try to do a full-on analysis, because you covered everything.

600
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And when you said you were going to do Ghost in the Shell standalone complex, I was like, cool.

601
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I don't have to go in depth on that show, because he's going to do it,

602
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
and I could go do something that you will never do.

603
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah, please.

604
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I guess when it comes to, like, things that you want to see exist.

605
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Because, like, I don't know.

606
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't know what I'm saying.

607
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Well, I was just going to say that...

608
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I've said this several times before, but when I was making the Girl in the Gone video,

609
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I did watch, like, every video I could find about it,

610
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and found them woefully inadequate.

611
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So I felt, you know, the need to do it.

612
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I mean, I've done it both ways.

613
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Because, you know, I like watching analysis videos all the time.

614
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So, like, inevitably, if a good one exists, then I'm going to see it.

615
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But usually, I have to do a video because I haven't seen a good one.

616
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And if I haven't seen one at all, it's very unlikely I'm going to find one.

617
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Because, like, I follow all the people who I think are doing really great work.

618
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So even if, let's say, I was going to do some show and, like, a bunch of people have reviewed it,

619
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
but if it's not anyone I follow, then there's a good chance there's not any good reviews of it.

620
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Or any that I would want to see.

621
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So, like, yeah, it's not like I'm going to cancel my video just because a lot of people covered it.

622
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It has to be someone good.

623
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I have notes for my Japanese anime, Girl in the Gone.

624
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And all the notes say, it just says, Gundam Lagann.

625
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Nice.

626
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And then under that, it says, fuck it.

627
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And that's the whole...

628
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You should release it as that.

629
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So, apparently, between the first joke and then Nate made his video.

630
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Now, let me tell you, you were on to gold with that first line.

631
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You should follow that and see where it logically leaked.

632
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Did you already do Attack on Gundam?

633
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah, he did.

634
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
How did you not watch Girl in the Gone in, like, ten years?

635
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's been, like, ten years.

636
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Every show about big dudes just eat Gundam Axe.

637
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It was going to be, like, a running joke that everything is Gundam for my Japanese anime.

638
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Which is great.

639
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I like that joke.

640
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But I hardly ever make them anymore, so it's taking a while.

641
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Especially because, like, I can't tell if you...

642
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I should just make the whole video.

643
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It should just be Gundam Lagann, fuck it, at the end.

644
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah.

645
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
My favorite thing about that joke is that I'm not sure if you've ever seen any Gundam before.

646
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I've never seen Gundam.

647
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Any of them.

648
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Perfect.

649
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Even better.

650
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
No, I saw a little bit of Gundam.

651
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And I never will, because if I do it, I'll ruin the joke.

652
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, you don't want to know.

653
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah, no, you don't need to.

654
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Like, I don't see you ever trying to wrap your head around Gundam.

655
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's a bit much.

656
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Does Gundam stand for something?

657
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Is there meaning in that word?

658
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Uh, I think the Gundam is made of Gundaneum.

659
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's just got a damn gun on it.

660
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh, it's named after Gundaneum.

661
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay.

662
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah.

663
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Of course, of course.

664
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I believe that's the case.

665
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's when you see the gun, they go, damn.

666
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Damn.

667
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Gundam.

668
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's a gun.

669
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's a gun on a den.

670
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They shoot the den.

671
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The damn gun.

672
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
The damn gun.

673
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
None of us are going to get that, because I don't watch weeb shit.

674
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Uh, so, I mean, so, like, what we're saying is, I think, like, the whole point of this

675
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
was, like, content is, there's all these obstacles.

676
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You gotta pick your shit.

677
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah, the point is, we are doing our best just to wait.

678
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah.

679
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Videos are coming, guys.

680
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Well, I think this is something everybody can relate to who's done creative work.

681
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah.

682
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
We all procrastinate.

683
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Or even not creative.

684
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Just, like, you gotta do your homework, and it's like, fuck it.

685
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I don't want to do that shit.

686
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That's happening to me, like, just last week.

687
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm taking this class forever.

688
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I never did my homework.

689
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Me neither, dude.

690
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Actually, that was the worst period of my life.

691
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Like, procrastination was really the cause of my, well, I don't know if it was the cause,

692
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
but it was like, what was perpetuating my depression back when I was in high school?

693
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That's interesting about that, though, because procrastination really does just, like, okay,

694
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
what is procrastination at the end of the day?

695
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You have goals that you want to accomplish.

696
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
If you just don't do them, that's procrastination, really.

697
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So, like, yeah, if you aren't doing in your life what you want, then, yeah, you're gonna

698
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
be depressed.

699
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Well, what drove me nuts back in high school was that, because I would fall into this loop,

700
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and I'm sure a lot of people are gonna be like, oh, my God, you're making me cry because

701
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
this is my life.

702
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah.

703
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So, back in high school, you know, I'd get a lot of homework, and then I'd come home,

704
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and I would have that feeling like the homework is the only thing I should be doing.

705
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But I wouldn't want to do it.

707
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But as a result, I wouldn't do anything else, because I felt like I should be doing my homework.

708
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Oh, shit.

709
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But I wouldn't do the homework.

710
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So, every night, I'd come home, and I'd just sit on Instant Messenger talking to my friend

711
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
on who was a Hikikomori at the time, like, full-blown, like, as in not in school, not

712
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
in anything, just in his room, pissing in bottles.

713
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Has he seen NHK by any chance?

714
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh, yeah.

715
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
We bonded over NHK when we first met.

716
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,500
That's sort of how we became friends was by talking about that show, because he was a

717
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
full-blown Hikikomori, and I was a borderline one.

718
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,500
I was still in school, but he had to drop out because he had a medical ailment where

719
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,000
he got headaches that were, like, insanely intense every morning.

720
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah.

721
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
That sucks.

722
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So, we would sit there on Messenger, and I would just tell him, like, you know, I wouldn't

723
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
watch any anime because, like, because to me, I've always regarded watching anime as,

724
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
like, a goal.

725
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Like, that is accomplishing something to me, because it's always been, like...

726
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's better than doing nothing.

727
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's better than just jacking off or something.

728
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Right.

729
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,500
Well, I've always been writing an anime blog, and, you know, even back before it was my

730
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
job, I was very passionate about doing it.

731
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:56,000
So to me, watching an anime was always a part of doing my job and, or getting things done,

732
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
but I wouldn't do it because I'm like, well, I can't really watch anything because I should

733
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,800
be doing my homework, and I just sit there all day and do nothing and just be super depressed

734
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,500
and fucking want to kill myself by the end of the day.

735
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
That's a very familiar feeling, and I think every person here can probably relate to it.

736
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,500
I resent the idea that watching anime is better than jacking off.

737
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh, a lot of the times it's the same activity.

738
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Sure, you do have something physical to show for it at the end of jacking off.

739
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,500
I'll give you that much.

740
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Yeah.

741
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Talking about jizz, people.

742
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Talking about jizz.

743
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Don't even get me started on jacking off as a method of procrastination.

744
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Yeah, it's...

745
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,500
I actually, I think I jack off more to procrastinate than to actually satiate my human needs.

746
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Well, I'd say jack off once a day is probably, like, the maximum you need to do to get yourself.

747
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Oh, man.

748
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I...

749
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
All right.

750
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
I'm just saying need.

751
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
I'm saying need.

752
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Okay, yeah.

753
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,000
There is no maximum.

754
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Let's stop that kind of thought right now.

755
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,500
I'm saying to satiate your needs.

756
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,500
I actually think there is, like, I mean, there's obviously a physical capability maximum where

757
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,000
you jerk off so many times you can't anymore.

758
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But I've actually had that moment in the song Long View by Green Day where he says, like,

759
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
when masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely.

760
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And I've had that moment where I jacked off so many times that it just wasn't actually fun anymore.

761
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And I was like, I'm done.

762
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Like, this is the most bored I've ever been in my life.

763
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I mean, you've got issues of chafing to deal with as well, and you know, there's all kinds of shit.

764
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,500
If you're going to go long, you've got to prepare.

765
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,000
Well, it's just like, when you go, like, two days in a row and all you really did was jack off all day,

766
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
that's when it gets to that point where you're like, what is my life?

767
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,500
What am I doing?

768
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
See, I haven't actually done that yet.

769
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't jack off all that much.

770
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,500
Hey, no more procrastinating.

771
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
I procrastinate on my jacking off.

772
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,000
I have made by working on a goal before.

773
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,500
I've had several times where I've tried to hit the 12 in one day.

774
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Oh, okay.

775
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
I procrastinate jacking off by joining a church.

776
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
You know what?

777
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I think jacking off might be the only activity that I do just for fun, not trying to make something out of it.

778
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,500
Yeah, okay.

779
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,500
It's pretty often the one I jump to.

780
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
And well, because there's a line in there.

781
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Because everything else, like, I can't do anything unless in my brain, I'm telling myself that it's for a video.

782
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,000
If I want to sit down and play a video game, I have to tell myself, well, I'm going to do a let's play,

783
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
or I'm collecting notes for a review.

784
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Oh, shit.

785
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Text just pledged the best guy ever, five bucks.

786
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Thank you, text.

787
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
That's how it is for me too, Jess.

788
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And it was a true revelation when I managed to play the Souls games and not feel that way.

789
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And it was only because DeVoo was doing so much work for me that I felt like I had time.

790
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And I was able to just sit down and enjoy all three of them.

791
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And then, of course, I had a bunch of ideas for videos anyway.

792
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So I was like, no, I got to make the most out of the three weeks that I spent playing video games

793
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,500
because it's a healthy process, I think.

794
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Yeah.

795
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,500
I mean, it's a lot better than if I hadn't played them at all and was sitting around for three weeks.

796
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
But even Jersey Office has become...

797
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Unless you're no longer some asshole who says it's his favorite game and hasn't even beaten it.

798
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Right.

799
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Even Jacking Office has sometimes become a thing that I did to try to accomplish a goal.

800
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,500
Because in The Venture Brothers, there's an episode where there's this group called The Sphinx,

801
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
and Brock Samson was a part of it.

802
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,000
And they're all like...

803
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
The guy is like...

804
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The leader of the group's like, we don't keep any secrets here.

805
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Men sound of them.

806
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
They're all like saying things that they did that are like secretive.

807
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,000
And Brock Samson goes, I once jacked off 12 times in one day just to see if I could.

808
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And I was like, 12 times, huh?

809
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's pretty hard.

810
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That sounds pretty rough.

811
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Never have actually made it.

812
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's a lot harder than it sounds.

813
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's probably above most human's capability, really.

814
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I think I made it to 10 months.

815
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Do you have to take like a five minute break in between?

816
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You can take whatever breaks you want.

817
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
If you came, that's what I would count.

818
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,500
This is why everyone should play Starless.

819
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Yeah, this is very related.

820
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Go play Starless.

821
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I don't think I could jack off to that game.

822
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
You never know until you try, my friend.

823
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Well, yeah, okay.

824
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Well, I guess if I was actually trying, I could probably do it.

825
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
I mean, some of the scenes are very pleasant, you know?

826
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,500
That was kind of my prize for putting up with all the food.

827
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Now I've just got in my head the idea of playing games while jacking off

828
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
like as a skill thing.

829
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Like a speed runner would jack off while playing.

830
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That's why they made Bayonetta playable with only one hand.

831
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You can just play that game.

832
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Better yet, Dead or Alive 2.

833
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I've been there.

834
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You can play Dead or Alive 2 entirely.

835
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Well, the problem is you can only do that with the right hand.

836
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You can only play it one-handed with the right hand.

837
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Luckily for me, I'm left-handed.

838
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's more of a you did it to say you did it thing

839
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
than it is an actual, like, I'm going to do this as a regular activity thing.

840
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
What I meant, though, was like, you know those speed runners and those live streams?

841
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah.

842
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,500
I bet anything Lobos could beat Dark Souls while jacking off.

843
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
I would bet anything on that.

844
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Can you do it with only one-half and eight-press?

845
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Have you ever heard of Lobos, either of you?

846
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,500
Yeah, I've heard of him.

847
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,500
He's like a famous speed runner guy.

848
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,500
He's the guy who does challenge runs of Dark Souls.

849
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:02,500
And he's done, like, every retarded, insane, like, you know, level one, no items, no weapons,

850
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
fighting the final boss on level eight plus seven.

851
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,500
I think I might have seen his YouTube channel if he has one.

852
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,500
Yeah, he's...

853
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Because I saw him do, like, a run where he was level one and he had that, the, you know,

854
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,500
the chest helmet thing that drains your health slowly.

855
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,500
And he played the entire game like that with no weapons.

856
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,500
Yeah, he will do any retarded challenge you can come up with.

857
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Because I'm pretty sure, I mean, when I thought about it, it makes sense because I'm sure he gets,

858
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,500
he's a sponsored Twitch player, so he's getting paid to just be on Twitch.

859
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,500
So it really doesn't matter how much time he wastes fucking around in a game.

860
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Like, yeah.

861
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Because some of those runs, like, you'll see the final, like, you'll see the video on YouTube

862
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,500
where he beat it, and that'll be a 45-minute video.

863
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,500
And then you're just thinking, think of all the times he died with one hit left.

864
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
So many.

865
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
And how many days this must have taken.

866
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,500
But if he gets paid just to play the game, then it really, it doesn't matter.

867
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
He can play it all day and it's his job.

868
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
That's true.

869
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
What's up with...

870
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:09,500
If you were a professional streamer, you know, like, I get the feeling that, like, streaming won't last forever.

871
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,500
And what...

872
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
I mean, how much money do these people make?

873
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Are they making enough to, like, save for the future?

874
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,500
I really don't know.

875
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Are they hoping to, like, transition to something else?

876
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,500
Or maybe streaming will just last forever, and I'm just being a Debbie Downer.

877
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,500
Let me ask you guys, have any of you ever watched the YouTube channel Crazy Russian Hacker?

878
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Once or twice, yeah.

879
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,500
So Crazy Russian Hacker is a guy who does these really terrible life hack videos.

880
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Yeah.

881
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:38,500
And he's, like, this Russian dude, his motto is,

882
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
safety is my number one priority.

883
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Right.

884
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,500
He's, like, partly it's the accent and partly he's, like, borderline retarded.

885
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Oh, that's not true.

886
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,500
He's a football.

887
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,500
He's definitely an idiot.

888
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,500
There's videos that reveal that he's probably an idiot.

889
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
Okay, well, I haven't done the research, so maybe...

890
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,500
He also made a whole video about how the proper way to eat a, quote, muffin, and it was a fucking cupcake.

891
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Wait, who are we talking about?

892
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,500
He's Russian.

893
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Maybe it's a language barrier.

894
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Crazy Russian Hacker.

895
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Anyway, this guy makes these terrible life hack videos, and they're all stolen.

896
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
It's all ideas from around the internet.

897
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
He puts out a video every fucking day.

898
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
He just finds a life hack.

899
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Is it someone's intellectual property, though, to, like, have a method of how to do it?

900
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
Not really, but it's, I mean...

901
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
I'd like him to get credit, though, I guess.

902
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,500
All right, here's the thing.

903
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Look.

904
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Yeah.

905
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
I don't think he gives credit.

906
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,500
He just makes life hack videos.

907
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
It's just obvious that he got them from other places.

908
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,500
I mean, and who the fuck can come up with a life hack every day?

909
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Most of them are stupid and repetitive and dumb, right?

910
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Well, my friends have been watching him, like, ironically, for years.

911
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,500
They, like, they'll make, like, they'll just send each other his videos as a joke and stuff like that.

912
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Sure.

913
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Because it's so stupid.

914
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Well, the thing is, he's huge now.

915
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Dude has five million subscribers, almost, right?

916
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Yeah.

917
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Puts out a video every single day, and all of them have half a million views.

918
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Now, recently, apparently, you know, my brother Victor's been watching him for years, and he

919
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,500
was, like, originally, he was doing these in his mom's kitchen at her house, right?

920
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,500
Well, he'll have this intro where you see him going into a house, and Victor's, like,

921
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,500
it's this really nice house in the mountains, and what I gradually realized is that that's

922
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,500
his house.

923
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,500
He has bought a really nice house in the mountains on the back of this YouTube money,

924
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
and I was, like, I was, like, show me his channel.

925
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
How much is it?

926
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Let me try to figure out how much he's making.

927
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Now, I know that a thousand views is about a dollar.

928
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Yeah.

929
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Five hundred thousand views is about five hundred dollars, and he puts out a video almost every

930
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:37,500
day, meaning he makes almost five hundred dollars a day on ad revenue, and he's bought

931
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:43,500
himself a house in the mountains with that money, from which he does life hack videos

932
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:49,500
that probably cost ten dollars to make in his kitchen, and I thought, what are we all doing

933
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,500
with our lives?

934
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Really?

935
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,500
That's the...

936
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Being stupid.

937
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,500
Yeah.

938
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,500
I mean, we can't all be that guy.

939
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,500
We can't, like, emulate him and hope to achieve that kind of success.

940
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
Those sorts of things just happen.

941
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,500
But, I mean, I have no problem with him profiting off such a thing.

942
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,500
I just wonder, you know, how far is it going to go?

943
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:13,500
It just makes me wonder, what are we thinking when we're putting so much into these videos?

944
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Right.

945
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Yeah.

946
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Totally.

947
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,500
And, like, all we really need to do is, every single day, look up something on the internet

948
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:25,500
that sounds like it would make a good video, spend ten dollars at Walmart buying water balloons,

949
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:30,500
and then, like, explaining how a water balloon can be used as a tampon or something.

950
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
That's all you have to do.

951
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
I'll tell you what it is.

952
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,500
It's entirely ego.

953
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:40,500
I make the kind of videos that I make because I see myself as a smart guy, and I'm like,

954
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
of course I'm not going to make shitty videos.

955
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,500
I'm going to make the fucking best thing in the world, and I am directly financially hurt

956
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,500
by making that decision.

957
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Well, the sad thing is that, like, I've had a lot of times where I've sat there and gone,

958
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:56,500
like, it would be so easy to open up an alternate channel and just not associate it with my identity,

959
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,500
or even if I don't even care, fuck, associate it with my identity, use it to promote me,

960
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,500
and I could easily be cranking out videos all the time that were just, like, cheap,

961
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,500
but it's, like, knowing that it would take away from the time I spend on my main content,

962
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,500
or that it could eventually, because, like, you know, because we've all seen what happened

963
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,500
with Game Grumps, where it was like, they didn't think it would take away from it,

964
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,500
but then once it was the main revenue stream, then it was like, well, we might as well

965
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,500
spend more time on Game Grumps, because it makes a lot more money.

966
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
Why the fuck wouldn't we, you know?

967
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
And so, like, there's always that fear.

968
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,500
But then at the same time, I would totally love to have Game Grumps positioned.

969
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,500
I'd love to have some easy fucking job that prints money, and I could just do,

970
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,500
I could take my sweet time on the passion projects, you know?

971
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,500
I shit on Game Grumps a lot, especially to you guys, because I think it's lazy

972
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,500
and not particularly valuable, and, you know, we've all got our different feelings about it,

973
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,500
but, yeah, there's no doubt that...

974
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
I mean, you've kind of taken the...

975
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,500
You're basically doing that because you have a real job,

976
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,500
so you're basically doing another job, you know?

977
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,500
I like to think that my life choices were made based on this core belief

978
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
that I have then, you know, extrapolated into how I live my life.

979
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,500
So, it's not like I decided that, then decided the Game Grumps were shit, or whatever.

980
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Yeah, but I just mean that, like, if I could turn YouTube into a job,

981
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,500
because it is my job, you know, but I don't handle it like a job,

982
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,500
I handle it like art, and there's times where those conflict with each other

983
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,500
where, like, I can't make a video that would take a month to make

984
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,500
because I just won't make enough money, you know, it can't happen.

985
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,500
I mean, how you told me right after I released my GERD Live video,

986
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
like, you wish you could make a video that would one-up it,

987
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,500
but, you know, it would take four or five months to do, so it's not even worth it.

988
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Ben, my problem, my whole career, is the videos, the kind of stuff that I'm interested in making,

989
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,500
I know it's not the kind of stuff that is successful.

990
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Yeah, and you have to ask yourself, like, is that wise?

991
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Like, are we just being stupid by making these kind of decisions?

992
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
Even if it weren't successful, it would just...

993
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:01,500
The most important thing that I'm looking at right now is I've decided to make a whole concept album

994
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,500
about my friend Pete for no reason, and that's more...

995
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,500
That's not gonna make a lot of money.

996
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,500
No, no one's gonna get it, people are gonna think it's retarded,

997
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,500
but it's way more important to me, artistically, than anything else that I could be doing right now.

998
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,500
And that's exactly why I don't make a lot of music, because, like,

999
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,500
if I wanted to really, like, sit there and just polish an album,

1000
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,500
and I mean, I make music really fast when I do it,

1001
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:31,500
so even if I just set aside a week, I could probably make a pretty decent rap album,

1002
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,500
but I had to set aside a week, you know, and I can't necessarily do that.

1003
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,500
And, you know, that's why I was saying earlier about, like, YMS,

1004
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,500
that I kind of envy getting into a cycle where, you know,

1005
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,500
people are paying you enough that you can make one video a month and make it perfect, you know, and...

1006
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Yeah, that's the dream.

1007
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Well, I'm very envious of these guys, like, I kind of look down on them in sort of a snobbish way,

1008
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,500
but I'm also envious...

1009
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Who have YMS or the...

1010
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,500
...of guys who you watch their channels,

1011
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,500
and it seems like they're only interested in making one specific genre of video or one kind of contract,

1012
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,500
because that's good for them, because that's what works.

1013
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,500
People like consistency.

1014
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,500
Yeah.

1015
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,500
But I can't help but look at it sort of snobbishly, like,

1016
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,500
how can you call yourself an artist when you're just making the same shit over and over again?

1017
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,500
That, I think, is overly simplifying.

1018
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,500
Like, you're like always studying in Philadelphia, right?

1019
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
Like, that's the same formula.

1020
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Yeah.

1021
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,500
It's not, like, the highest art, obviously,

1022
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,500
but I don't think it's fair to just say that, out of hand, it's a lower form.

1023
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,500
Well, I'm saying I'm envious of it, because I kind of wish that I had that,

1024
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,500
because I can't do things that way.

1025
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,500
I'm incapable of focusing on one thing.

1026
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:49,500
I've told a friend of the show, Mother's Basement, who we had on a few weeks ago,

1027
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,500
like, that I'm...

1028
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Because he...

1029
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,500
I'm envious of him because he likes everything to be a series.

1030
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Yeah.

1031
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Like, he does what's in an OP, now he's doing, like, he's doing a bunch of different types of analysis,

1032
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,500
but they're all a series.

1033
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,500
What's in a scene?

1034
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,500
What's in a level?

1035
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
What's in an OP?

1036
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,500
You know, like, and he wants it all to be these ongoing things.

1037
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,500
And I'm like, man, if I could do that, it would be so much...

1038
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,500
It would make my life so much easier to know, at the end of every week,

1039
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,500
that I can, you know, that the same video will come out.

1040
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,500
And it's like, I just...

1041
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,500
There's never been a concept that I wanted to do for that long.

1042
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,500
And I tried, at the end of last year, I've told you guys about this.

1043
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
I don't know if I've mentioned it on the podcast,

1044
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,500
but at the end of last year, I tried to come up with a plan, like a syllabus,

1045
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:39,500
to have one video come out every week, all year, for 2016.

1046
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,500
And I had eight different series, which would come out bi-week, bi-monthly, rather.

1047
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:49,500
And so it would be like, you know, you'd get four series one month, four series the next month,

1048
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
and then you get each series again.

1049
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:56,500
So each one would only have, like, four videos for that series coming out, or, no, six.

1050
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
Six videos per series each year.

1051
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,500
But it would be eight different series.

1052
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,500
But, like, even within that structure of those, I kept boiling it down to, like,

1053
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,500
well, I don't really want to do this one, or, like, I don't have enough ideas for this one to last.

1054
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,500
So in the end, I was only left with, like, three that I still kind of want to do.

1055
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:17,500
And even then, just a prospect of making something, and then knowing that in two months,

1056
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,500
I'm beholden to make the same thing, is, like, too much for me.

1057
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,500
Because, like, what if two months from now, I want to do something else,

1058
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,500
but I have to make this fucking series, you know?

1059
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
Yeah, put yourself in that position.

1060
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,500
Do you have to have, like, a series with a time release schedule?

1061
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,500
Uh, I guess not.

1062
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:40,500
But, like, the concept at the time was that I was going to try to write all 52 videos before the year started.

1063
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
Like, just write them all at once.

1064
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,500
And I wrote, like, four of them, and then just kind of gave up, but, yeah.

1065
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
I'm kind of actually trying to do that as well.

1066
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,500
I want to write a bunch so that I can have one come out every month.

1067
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:58,500
For guys like us, Kim, who have a harder time writing, that's probably a wise way to go.

1068
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
Yeah.

1069
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Writing is hard, and I hate it.

1070
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,500
Writing's easy for me.

1071
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,500
Editing's hard.

1072
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,500
And for me, the hardest thing is caring for a long time.

1073
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,500
Like, the reason my videos get done so fast is because as soon as I'm done writing it,

1074
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,500
I don't care about it anymore, so, like, it stops being interesting.

1075
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,500
Like, those videos that I did write for last year, um, you know, I have them all,

1076
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,500
and they're still good scripts.

1077
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,500
But the idea of trying to make videos out of them now,

1078
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,500
now that I'm, like, not that hype about it anymore, is, like, really difficult,

1079
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:35,500
where I've got, like, a few that, um, like, one of them was the Top 10 Directing Tricks in Avangelion,

1080
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,500
which is a great script, and people really want me to do another Avavid,

1081
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,500
but, like, I put it in the editing bay, and I was just like,

1082
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:50,500
Why did I write this months ago and not, I should've just edited it immediately as soon as it was done, you know?

1083
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:55,500
As soon as I wrote it, back when I was still impressed with myself that I had written it, you know?

1084
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:00,500
I have had times where I caught a second wind where I read an old script and, like, forgot how good it was

1085
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
and wanted to make it a video again.

1086
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:10,500
That is nice, but, yeah, it's good to capitalize on your creative spark when it hits as best you can.

1087
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
I never have, like, ideas for scripts.

1088
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:18,500
I always just go into thinking, like, I want to talk about this because I know I like it, but why?

1089
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
Yeah, that's interesting.

1090
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:28,500
It's sometimes really difficult to understand why, because I'm not very good at analyzing, like, myself and games and stuff,

1091
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:33,500
but I just, I don't know, it's fun to talk about, so I still do it.

1092
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Well, I need to write a video for this.

1093
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:42,500
What happens is that, like, I'll be, I'll just get something in my head and then I'll go, I gotta go and write this down before I forget it.

1094
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:48,500
Then I'll write it, and then as I write it, more just pours out, and it goes, like, really easily.

1095
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,500
And before I know it, oh, great, I have another entire fucking video I have to make.

1096
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Yeah.

1097
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:01,500
For me, it's always having the, sort of, the first sentence, like, there's two ways that the videos come about.

1098
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:10,500
Yeah, well, yeah, like, for that one, for instance, it was that I was bothered that the discussion on what is anime and what isn't was always being had,

1099
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:17,500
and then I thought, like, here's how I would approach the argument, and then once I've thought about that, I always construct the first sentence,

1100
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
and then I go from there.

1101
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:25,500
So, like, yeah, with the anime as a Japanese colloquialism, like, that line was stewing in my head for days.

1102
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
That's just a meme now, that's a hilarious line to me.

1103
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,500
Yeah.

1104
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:35,500
And it's often times that what'll happen is, I'll get the phrase, and then I'll go take a shower, and then while I'm in the shower,

1105
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,500
I'll spend the entire shower just constructing the first sentence, or the first paragraph.

1106
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Oh man, I do that too, but I'm always scared that I'm gonna forget things before I get out of the shower.

1107
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,500
It's anywhere where there's, like, no internet or no distractions.

1108
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,500
You know where my sanctum of inspiration is?

1109
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,500
Toilet, it's the toilet, right?

1110
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
No, no, it's Walmart.

1111
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,500
Cause, like, that's a good one.

1112
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,500
Walmart is, like, where I go, like, it's usually, like, four in the morning when I go there.

1113
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,500
No one's there.

1114
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,500
Cause you have one in walking distance.

1115
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Yeah, and whenever I'm there, I'm just kind of an autopilot walking around.

1116
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:14,500
And when I'm in Walmart, like, I'll wander around Walmart aimlessly for, like, 30 minutes, or 30 minutes to an hour,

1117
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:21,500
not by anything, but then I'll have, like, 10 entire videos in my fucking head, and I gotta go home and write all of them.

1118
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:28,500
I have a road next to my house that's, like, a mile long, and I'll walk down it almost every night and have a cigarette,

1119
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,500
and, like, and that's where I usually try to come up with concepts.

1120
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:37,500
But what happens is, if I don't have an idea for a video, then all I think about is, like, stuff about my life,

1121
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,500
or, like, drama, or something I've been into, or something, like...

1122
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Yeah, yeah.

1123
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:46,500
Like, a lot of the times it's just me thinking about how pissed off I am at somebody on the internet,

1124
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,500
and, like, running through all the social reasons that I would be mad and, like, what it says about society as a whole,

1125
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
and just getting so, like, angry.

1126
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,500
And that's the kind of stuff that becomes...

1127
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,500
You should, hey, everyone's making beef videos these days. Let's capitalize on that now.

1128
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Well, all of that stuff becomes Digi Bro's discussions, you know, like...

1129
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,500
Yeah, yeah, that's inappropriate.

1130
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,500
Anything I think about that can't be made into, like, a good video just becomes a Digi Bro's discussion.

1131
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:14,500
But, like, when I'm in the middle of writing, then I'll often go for a walk to figure out what the next paragraph is gonna be.

1132
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,500
The one that I did that the most with was the PsychoPass videos,

1133
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,500
because there's, like, there's parts in there where I just drop, like, all these heavy concepts in a row,

1134
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,500
and it was just, like, I write a paragraph and then go outside and walk around, have a cigarette, come back in,

1135
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:32,500
just, like, keep walking around my house and doing laps and shit, like, trying to think of the next sentence.

1136
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,500
That was the most, like, I ever felt, like, a writer, you know, like...

1137
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,500
Yeah, yeah.

1138
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Because it comes so naturally to me that a lot of the times it's just I sit down and I pump something out,

1139
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,500
and I'm like, well, okay, but then, like, that was the one script where it was, like,

1140
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,500
I really had to struggle to think of how I'm gonna put this idea to words,

1141
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:53,500
and it was the biggest come in the universe to actually do it.

1142
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Whoa, you said you sit down and you pump something out, and it was the biggest come in the universe.

1143
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Yeah.

1144
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,500
Awesome.

1145
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Yeah, it's the PsychoPass and the Kaon videos.

1146
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,500
Those were the ones that I had, like, the most, like, like, revelations when writing it,

1147
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,500
where it was like, how do I put this?

1148
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,500
And then I'd come up with the perfect phrase and be like, oh, my God, I finally did it.

1149
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,500
I can finally explain what's so good about Kaon, you know?

1150
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Like, with Kaon, it was the phrase I kept saying throughout the whole video.

1151
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,500
I kept saying, the more you watch of it, the more you like it,

1152
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,500
and I said it so many times because it was such a revelation to me at the time that I was writing

1153
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,500
that that was, like, totally how I felt about it.

1154
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,500
I get so self-conscious of, like, my big lines whenever I'm going over a script,

1155
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:39,500
especially after I've recorded it, and it's like, oh, God, I hope people don't hate me for overselling it.

1156
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,500
Yeah, yeah.

1157
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:49,500
There's a few lines in the Astroscore series where I either, like, if I think it's a corny line,

1158
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,500
then I oversell it on purpose to show that I acknowledge that it's a corny line,

1159
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,500
and then if I think it's really cool, then I just, you know, play it straight and...

1160
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,500
Yeah.

1161
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,500
Like, the lines that you did in part nine were definitely good,

1162
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:06,500
but just, like, as a guy who makes kind of dramatic videos sometimes like that,

1163
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,500
I just, I pictured myself doing that, and I was, like, projecting myself.

1164
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,500
I was like, oh, I hope people don't think this is great.

1165
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,500
But it wasn't at all. It was deserving.

1166
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,500
Oh, apparently it was haunting and deep, and I got so...

1167
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,500
Yeah, that was good.

1168
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,500
I got, like, a few hundred comments about how...

1169
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,500
Those marks.

1170
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,500
I got, like, a few hundred comments about how that was my best video ever,

1171
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,500
and it made them so emotional, and it was so depressing, which is great,

1172
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
because that's exactly the intention.

1173
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,500
I told DeVue, I was like, part nine has to depress people,

1174
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
and I actually redid all the audio on it,

1175
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,500
because the original one I did was more in line with the rest of the series,

1176
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,500
and I was like, it has to be, like, really sobering and dark

1177
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
and make you feel like shit afterwards,

1178
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,500
and a lot of comments said that that happened, so I'm glad.

1179
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:55,500
A lot of them, specifically because they were eating McDonald's when they watched it,

1180
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,500
I got, like, ten comments to the effect of I was...

1181
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,500
Or I ate McDonald's just before watching this, and now I feel really self-conscious,

1182
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:02,500
and I was like, perfect.

1183
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,500
I bet there were quite a few Monocles dropped at that moment.

1184
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,500
Yeah, and then I had to point out to those people, like,

1185
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,500
I ate McDonald's in the video.

1186
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,500
You know, I wrote this video, and then I had to go buy and eat McDonald's,

1187
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,500
and, like, and do that for the video, you know.

1188
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
I felt just as bad as anybody.

1189
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,500
Yeah, man, it's funny, it's just that that exact sort of thing

1190
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
is really what I plan on doing with my...

1191
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,500
And I've already got footage for it to do, like, a bunch of shit like that,

1192
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,500
so it was probably my favorite moment of anything you've done in your entire filmography.

1193
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,500
The live-action segment.

1194
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Yeah, just to, you know, make a...

1195
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,500
You know, you've seen a million Digi videos.

1196
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,500
He makes this change.

1197
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,500
It's this related thing, the speech, the music.

1198
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,500
It was just, yeah, good stuff.

1199
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,500
Fun fact about that, it was totally half-assed and last minute.

1200
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,500
That's great, that's great.

1201
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,500
Because it was like, Javu went,

1202
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,500
I don't have any ideas for this segment.

1203
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,500
You should do a live-action segment, and I said,

1204
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,500
okay, then I got Victor, and like...

1205
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
Because Victor hates doing live-action for me,

1206
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,500
but I was like, dude, this is the Astroscore,

1207
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,500
it's my best video series, we have to nail it, you know.

1208
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
And he just took a bunch of random shots of me.

1209
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Also, you're probably just like, you're going to McDonald's buying food,

1210
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,500
so that's what, like, ten minutes, you know.

1211
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,500
I was amazed by how many people were like, legitimately impressed with the filmography of that,

1212
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,500
because it was not like, it wasn't staged or directed or anything,

1213
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,500
it was just like, Victor just pointed a fucking camera at me while I got dressed,

1214
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,500
and it just happens to be a fairly nice camera, so the visuals look clean, you know.

1215
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:31,500
I happen to think that my filmography that I did in my, what was it,

1216
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:37,500
like that little update, or the Final Fantasy 7 one where I was filming me driving,

1217
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:42,500
I think that came out great, and that was me nearly killing myself driving in my car.

1218
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:46,500
But my point is that I did actually set up a bunch of stuff,

1219
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,500
like I had my DS at home, like paused on the exact screen,

1220
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:55,500
and then I drove out to get footage, and yeah, so it worked out really well.

1221
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:00,500
But it's like, just even doing live action footage when you're guys like us who do a lot of editing,

1222
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:05,500
I'm not saying that makes it look better, but it's, you know, if you do even these, it's going to be...

1223
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,500
It's just unexpected, and it shows up cool, and I told Victor like,

1224
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:13,500
the only shot that I really care about is that we see the golden arches coming up in the distance,

1225
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,500
which I didn't even end up using, because it didn't come out right,

1226
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:22,500
because I thought it was a much taller sign, but the one that we went to had one of the little signs,

1227
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:28,500
because to me it was so important, because what I'm trying to evoke there is that the reason...

1228
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,500
Right, you see the arches and it recognizes you.

1229
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,500
Well, to go in deep a little bit, the reason that so many places like that are they all look the same

1230
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,500
is because they want it to be the same no matter where you are, where it's sort of atemporal.

1231
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:46,500
Actually, one of the only good idea channel videos of the last two years was the one he did on hotels

1232
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:53,500
and how they kind of exist outside of reality, because it's like you're always going to the same hotel,

1233
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:57,500
like they're all the same place, because they try to be, which would have been an even better video

1234
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:03,500
if he had done it about Walmart or something, because that's explicitly what they try to do.

1235
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,500
They want it to be so that no matter what town you're in, you go into Walmart and it's always reliable,

1236
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,500
and I've been to a lot of conventions or to concerts in other cities,

1237
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:20,500
and when you do that, you almost always eat at McDonald's or Wendy's, because you recognize it and you know what it is.

1238
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,500
There's probably a thousand great local restaurants near you, but you have no idea what they are,

1239
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,500
so you're just like, oh McDonald's, yeah, but we didn't even really get that shot.

1240
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:37,500
I really like that you had one shot in mind, because I don't want to spoil things for the future here,

1241
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:43,500
but I've got the one piece video I'm working on, and I too had exactly one image and went out and got it

1242
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,500
and then just got all this other shit, so when that comes out, listen back to this,

1243
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,500
and this is me telling you how great that's going to be, and it was all from just one image in my head.

1244
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,500
And you recorded it like a year ago.

1245
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:57,500
At this point, it's probably been seven months, and the Ghost in the Shell footage has got to be almost a year now,

1246
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,500
so it's one of these days.

1247
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:07,500
Every best guy ever video is like the product of like an entire film pre-production cycle.

1248
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
Pretty much.

1249
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,500
I mean, Guru in the Gaon itself...

1250
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,500
Guru in the Gaon, the video took four months to make, and Guru in the Gaon...

1251
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,500
It took four months to edit, it took months and months before that to write.

1252
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:23,500
But Guru in the Gaon, the TV series, had like, I think four years of pre-production,

1253
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,500
and then it was made in like six months.

1254
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,500
Because they said...

1255
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,500
I remember Imaishi saying they'd spent so long pre-planning it,

1256
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:37,500
and they had like way more ideas that just kind of got left on the cutting room floor.

1257
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:42,500
They originally had done all this research into what an underground society would be like.

1258
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:46,500
I love what they did with that, but they definitely could have done more if they wanted to.

1259
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,500
They said that they had done all this research into moles and how they see,

1260
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,500
and like what it would be like if people lived underground,

1261
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,500
and like they were gonna flesh it out and make it this whole world,

1262
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,500
and they were like, eh, they just get through all that.

1263
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:03,500
Yeah, and then like he said that actually making the show was like really fast,

1264
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,500
because they had everything planned out, so it's just like they zoomed through it,

1265
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,500
and it took no time.

1266
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,500
I like that a lot. It's good stuff.

1267
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,500
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1268
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:17,500
I actually just remembered that this is a podcast, and we're recording.

1269
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,500
Yeah, we're about at the end of it.

1270
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
Yeah, I figure we can wrap it up soon.

1271
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,500
This is about procrastination.

1272
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,500
Well, let's finish it later.

1273
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,500
I don't wanna.

1274
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,500
Well, date was demanding that we keep these shorter than the last one.

1275
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,500
I got an Undertale video to edit, alright?

1276
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
I think I had time to suck my own dick like the rest of you.

1277
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,500
Alright, last time was too long,

1278
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,500
but it was also a topic that I was really passionate about,

1279
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,500
and I kind of wanted to do that podcast for a long time,

1280
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,500
so that's why I wanted to let it run long.

1281
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,500
Jesse's list just...

1282
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,500
And Jesse had a million things on his list.

1283
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:59,500
And since last week, I watched a video by the Nostalgia Chick.

1284
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:04,500
She actually did every single thing on my list that I hated in one video.

1285
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,500
It was honestly inspiring.

1286
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
Your message needs to be heard.

1287
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
The people, hopefully they'll...

1288
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,500
Oh, by the way, there's something else that I wanted to touch on.

1289
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,500
Some wonderful commenter last week

1290
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,500
went through the trouble of giving us all individual ratings

1291
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,500
for our performance in that podcast.

1292
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,500
And you know, he gave everyone else...

1293
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,500
You know, did you got like a 9?

1294
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,500
He gave me a 2 out of 10.

1295
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,500
Really, motherfucker?

1296
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,500
I thought he gave you like a negative 2 out of 4.

1297
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
He gave me a negative 2.

1298
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,500
2 out of 10.

1299
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,500
Yeah, I was so horrible in that podcast.

1300
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,500
I only carried the entire conversation

1301
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,500
and made everyone laugh constantly.

1302
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,500
You piece of shit.

1303
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,500
Oh, the horror that I carried the conversation.

1304
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,500
I made everyone laugh constantly.

1305
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
The horror, the agonizing horror.

1306
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,500
I'm so bad.

1307
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
I'm like power glove bad, right, dipshit?

1308
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,500
You piece of shit.

1309
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,500
I thought not only that Jesse did the best in that podcast

1310
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,500
because he actually had a list,

1311
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,500
but also that it was the best he had been in any of the podcasts so far.

1312
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,500
Yeah, that's the thing.

1313
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
It was definitely his best performance thus far in this...

1314
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
I deserve a 12 out of 10.

1315
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,500
And yeah, he had lots of hilarious moments.

1316
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:20,500
I legitimately lost my shit watching the video back at parts.

1317
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,500
Anyway, alright, each of us,

1318
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,500
let's sign off by saying what we're gonna stop procrastinating

1319
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,500
and get back to doing.

1320
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,500
Jesse, what are you gonna get back to doing after this podcast?

1321
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,500
Finish your Adam's Family retrospective.

1322
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,500
Make some bloopers.

1323
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
Don't spoil it, it's gotta be a secret.

1324
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,500
No one can know about it.

1325
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,500
We can bloop that out ourselves.

1326
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,500
No one can know my secrets, because if they know about it,

1327
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,500
then I'll never finish it.

1328
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
Well, you just gotta finish it before the video comes out.

1329
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,500
Before this video comes out.

1330
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,500
That's fucking impossible.

1331
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,500
Well, did you just editing it?

1332
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
Who knows how long it'll take?

1333
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
Like five minutes.

1334
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,500
I think I edit a lot faster than you guys.

1335
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,500
Cut that out.

1336
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,500
That's because I put in an effort.

1337
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Take that out of the podcast.

1338
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,500
I'm not getting back to doing anything.

1339
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
I'm gonna be procrastinating forever.

1340
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,500
As soon as this podcast is done,

1341
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,500
I'm gonna get back to playing Honey Pop

1342
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,500
and jerking off forever.

1343
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,500
Hi, Hippocrite.

1344
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,500
What are you gonna get back to doing?

1345
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,500
I'm gonna get back to writing episode,

1346
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,500
or not episode two,

1347
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,500
but the Ratchet and Clank 2 review,

1348
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,500
which I've been working on.

1349
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,500
Fun fact, me and Victor just recorded

1350
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,500
five episodes of Ratchet and Clank 2.

1351
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,500
Let's play.

1352
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Oh, shit.

1353
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,500
Wait, but seriously,

1354
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,500
what's up with that Kingdom Hearts video?

1355
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,500
I don't know.

1356
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,500
I'm gonna release that later

1357
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
when I've released an actual video.

1358
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,500
Okay, fair enough.

1359
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Because of my last few, just been whatever.

1360
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,500
Alright, Nate,

1361
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,500
what are you gonna get back to doing?

1362
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,500
I'm gonna edit the shit out of everyone.

1363
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,500
It's...

1364
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,500
When is this fucking video gonna be done, Nate?

1365
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,500
It's coming, god damn it.

1366
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,500
I work hard every day.

1367
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,500
How much can possibly be left?

1368
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,500
I don't understand.

1369
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,500
So hard for my money,

1370
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,500
so you better treat me right.

1371
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,500
How many hours does it take you

1372
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,500
per minute of editing?

1373
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,500
I'm curious.

1374
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,500
Because this video is like 25 hours to do 30 seconds.

1375
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,500
Oh my god, what the fuck were you doing?

1376
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,500
I was editing.

1377
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,500
I have a vision.

1378
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,500
I can't see what was your vision.

1379
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,500
This guy was giving me shit.

1380
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,500
I was like, oh man,

1381
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,500
this is gonna be the best blue glow ever.

1382
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,500
He's like, oh what, it's like a 6 out of 10?

1383
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,500
This is coming from a guy

1384
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,500
who makes like one video every three years.

1385
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,500
He's sitting there doing nothing.

1386
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,500
Everything the world ever needs or wants.

1387
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,500
Bull.

1388
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,500
Do they criticize Da Vinci

1389
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,500
for taking a while in the Sistine Chapel?

1390
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,500
I don't think so.

1391
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:39,500
I crap out a Sistine Chapel every two days.

1392
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,500
A poo covered Sistine Chapel.

1393
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,500
I actually have to go crap out

1394
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,500
a Sistine Chapel for real.

1395
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,500
In the toilet.

1396
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,500
That wasn't a metaphor for my next video.

1397
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,500
I just have to take a shit.

1398
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
I have nothing planned tonight.

1399
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,500
I'm probably gonna,

1400
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
I honestly have no idea.

1401
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
I have no idea what I'm gonna do tonight.

1402
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:02,500
So that's it for this episode.

1403
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
Everybody say goodbye.

1404
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,500
Goodbye.

1405
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Goodbye.

1406
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,500
Fuck you.

1407
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,500
We did it.
