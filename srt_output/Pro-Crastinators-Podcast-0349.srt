1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome everyone to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you can't believe it, it's the podcast yet again.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's another five, it's another five man, five man clusterfuck of a podcast.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Five hours.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You'll get what you wanted, audience.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Five man, five hours, five seasons in a movie.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We're going, we're going to the, we're going to, we're going to Disney World.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Cheesy Manfredo is here and so is Oblivionfall.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Wow.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What, woke virus?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm suffering from the broke virus.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Eight we all brother.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I was playing Battle Network.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I was playing, I didn't stream for a whole month and then I played Mega Man Battle Network

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
again the other day on stream and the running joke in that game for, in the stream there

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
is that Wiley is spreading the woke mind virus and that's what's making the machines go haywire.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's the bit.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's, we have fun here.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I wouldn't, I wouldn't be.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We have fun on twitch.tv slash stcomics.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Subscribe.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I wouldn't be surprised that Wiley is spreading the woke virus.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
As you say, it is a particular set of people with a very, very distinguished feature in

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the center of their nose that Wiley obviously shares with a specific group of people.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In the center of their nose.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is Germanic.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wiley is Germanic.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In the center of their face.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In the center of their face, I mean.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the center of their nose is that distinctive mole.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He's good Germanic.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We all know what that means.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You know, it'd be a really funny like Mandela effect if it turns out that like, like let's

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
say someone tweets out, hey, do you all notice that Wiley Sprite has like a yarmulke and then

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
everyone goes back to all the old Mega Man.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh my God, it's always been there.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What the fuck?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh no.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait, what the fuck?

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's just always wearing a yarmulke.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That wasn't a bold spot.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, he was wearing a yarmulke the whole time.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mega Man, the rootless, the rootless cosmopolitan's are destroying society.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Go fight, fight them for everlasting peace, Mega Man.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Damn, this is fucked up.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There were themes in these games we never even picked up on.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Damn.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That is fucked up.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is deep.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I totally missed it.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's crazy.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's like the goblins.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Just like the Harry Potter goblins.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe Kanye was on to something here.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, when he talks about Mega Man.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah.

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, he said he loved all of you.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When Kanye had his Mega Man video essay.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Kanye said he loved all robot masters.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's loved them all.

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He loves each and every one of them because he's a Christian.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I love all Reploids, Maverick and non-Maverick.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There's good people on both sides.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I love Sigma.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I love him.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sigma made some good points.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I love Sigma.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What did Kanye say?

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is awesome.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Stupid.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is awesome.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I love war criminals.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is great.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm having a great time with my friends on the podcast.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Speaking of war criminals, I'm going to become one right now.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Go on.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going to talk about a dream I had.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's right.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm pulling a maze.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, not a dream.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't worry.

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's quick.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This was like right before I woke up and there was a character in there who was either

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Ben St. or Cheesy Manfredo or Chris Reagan.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
One of the three.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know which one.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The iconic trio.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's Reagan.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know why.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll keep it brief.

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I was at an apartment complex and there was just a big stretch of apartment buildings

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that somehow I had spray-painted like a giant mural of like 30 or so popular female characters,

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
butts just all posing on the side of his building.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The mural was so good.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It was just so nice and free-dimension and their butts were poking out and I spray-painted

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
this whole thing.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Your dreams are just like your real life.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The paintings extended into the fucking rooms and if you walk through like the top floor

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
of the apartments, like we're like around where the bus were, like each room that one of the

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
characters was like against, like the entire inside of a room would be like painted like

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
in the theme of like whatever media property they're from and someone had labeled the doors

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
safe for work, not safe for work since I'd done that.

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And for several days, the apartments had not noticed, but then they did notice.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then I was running to escape because I realized people were coming and the guy who

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
was either Ben St. or cheese and Manfredo or Chris Reagan ran up to open a gate to let

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
me out.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The guy walking next to me, there's a guy in a white shirt, one of those undershirts that

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you usually wear a suit over, the white shirt with the buttons at the top sort of thing.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It was Joe Biden who was wearing his aviated glasses.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He was speed walking next to me.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He's like, the butt heist, we've got to cover the butt heist.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And I'm like, oh, no, the butt heist.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And I went to grab my phone because I wanted to record Joe Biden talking about the butt

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
heist because I thought this is going to be so fucking funny.

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Joe Biden talking about a butt heist and looking at these giant anime butts.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then I couldn't find my phone.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And I woke up.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I was having a dream yesterday morning and I was, I was, I don't remember what it was,

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but I had the, I remember I was like half asleep.

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was like, huh, this is nice.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm having a dream.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't remember what it was.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And then my alarm went off and instantly, instantly I forgot what the dream was.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And instantly I was sad again because I remembered that the previous night, my brother, Nate Bestman,

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
betrayed me by not raiding my stream, even though he could have done it.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He had every opportunity to raid my stream and he refused.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He callously refused.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What kind of, what kind of a, what kind of a, what kind of a brother?

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What kind of a brother wouldn't raid your own stream?

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wouldn't raid his own brother's stream?

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Calously refused.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
All right.

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And all you've done for him is how you refuse.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
True.

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I literally had, okay, oblivion.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I linked you a video that I really liked the other day.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know if you got around to watching it, but.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh shit.

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You did link me a video that I did.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I recommended you a video.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's okay.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, I found this channel.

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The channel, the guy is called Geno7 and his, his bit is that he's basically doing what's it called.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's like every frame of painting, but instead of about like video and movie making,

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
it's, it's about like sound design and composition is his, is his thing.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He did a video.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He just had one that was like a hit and it's about the sound design of Wario Land 4.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And in, in that video, he talks about the ending theme song for the good ending is this song with lyrics,

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
which is unusual for a, for a Game Boy Advance game.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But there's a song with lyrics and the song is about the opening line is,

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, the dream that I had last night melted into my pillow and all I'd gathered turned into sand.

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And that was me.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I woke up and the dream that I had last night melted into my pillow.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It was exactly like that.

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You know, you're right.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wow.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What do we think?

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think, I think that's horrendous.

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Last week, you talked about Homer having that dream about the invention and then Marge woke him up

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
because oh, it's a couple minutes before we usually go to bed.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wake up so you can go to bed again in five minutes.

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I experienced like that only it was morning.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I had a dream where this was like maybe five or six days ago.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I was in some kind of, some kind of glade, some kind of forest glade at night.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And they were like bioluminescent glowing like pink flowers and shit.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It was really cool.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And Princess Luna and Princess Celestia were just sitting on a hill and they were hot.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Wow.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And I started fingering them and it was great and we were going to have sex.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Jesus.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And then Kai woke me up in the middle of my dream and I'm like, why?

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I never have sex dreams.

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
How fucking dare you?

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You screamed at him.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You screamed at him so loud.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You took this from me.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I woke up and I immediately attacked him.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I went into attack mode.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Kai never usually wakes me up.

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is this the dream cast?

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh my gosh.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Dream cast?

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Dream cast?

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't have any dreams.

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I never have dreams.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh no.

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't remember them.

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Dreams.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I had one weird one recently, but I just forgot it.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So I'm not going to say it.

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wacky.

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yo, I just, that guy, that channel, I really was really impressed by what the content

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
on offer on that Geno7 channel.

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And it's interesting because he had like, he had like 3,000 subscribers, right?

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Tiny channel.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I found this Wario video.

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,500
I think when I found it, it had like maybe 50K views, you know, a somewhat respectable

203
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
amount of views.

204
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,000
I think it has now hit like 100K.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,500
And I looked at the rest of his channel.

206
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,860
The rest of his channel has like 2,000 views, 4,000 views, even though the video, there's

207
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,380
only a few videos, but like they're all really good.

208
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,840
And I feel like I've discovered, I feel like I discovered a diamond in the rough.

209
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,540
Like I feel like I found this channel right as, it seems poised to blow up.

210
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,500
It seems like it's good stuff and it could blow up.

211
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
And I feel like I found it like before.

212
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,700
For that Wario thing, I just didn't click on it because I'm like, eh, everybody makes

213
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,500
videos about stuff these days.

214
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
It's really good.

215
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,000
I need to watch that video because I've been needing long videos to watch that are good.

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,500
I tried watching the Riku was gay video and I just, it was too rambly and I didn't like

217
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
the person's voice.

218
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh, me too.

219
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm so glad.

220
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
I didn't have to be the one to say it.

221
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
You're so homophobic.

222
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
I am homophobic.

223
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Hey, people who have bad arguments against the video, stop right now.

224
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,820
It's like, I don't like that.

225
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,780
Start with your strong arguments and then address the strong counter arguments and then address

226
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
the weak counter arguments.

227
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,300
They were doing it backwards.

228
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,540
I can't really complain because my Mega Man video starts with like way too much introduction.

229
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,020
Like I ramble way too much at the beginning of that video.

230
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,020
So I'm guilty of it.

231
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,420
But your video needed to be eight hours long, Ben.

232
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,260
That, okay, okay.

233
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:48,060
The Riku video, I think like the arguments, like the content is good and the evidence

234
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,460
is there and there's a compelling case and I am fully convinced that there is a compelling

235
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,740
case that, yeah, Riku is gay.

236
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Same.

237
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,380
I'm kind of interested to hear if there's like a counter argument, like if someone

238
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,900
else has like, well, actually here's all this evidence that points to Riku isn't gay.

239
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,860
Kairi is the real love interest.

240
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:15,260
I'd be interested to hear a counter argument, but place side by side all the clips of Riku

241
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:22,620
not being interested in women and being in Tessora like are pretty compelling, right?

242
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,580
The second I heard like, oh, what if Riku's gay, I'm like, hmm, has he ever known of a

243
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
touch of a woman?

244
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
No.

245
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
And he never would.

246
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
It's just obvious.

247
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,580
It's obvious.

248
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:39,460
It's fun that it's not like, oh, it's a silly Japanese game and you can read that into it

249
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,860
because haha, it's like translation and it's like different culture or whatever.

250
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:53,860
It's like explicit from interviews of the, you know, the intent is more clear than you

251
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,860
would assume.

252
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
And it's interesting.

253
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,740
It kind of seems that way, even though like the initial setup when you start the game,

254
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,540
it seems like it's a love triangle where these two boys both like the girl.

255
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:12,460
That's what it sort of presents itself as immediately, but then like it never, it never

256
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,380
again really backs that up ever.

257
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,500
It's interesting.

258
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,620
If you got to the end of the video, I think in the description, I actually didn't get

259
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
all the way.

260
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,820
I got like three quarters the way through it.

261
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,060
Well, the thing I mentioned about the sleeping realm theory, the theory that's like about

262
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:38,020
Kingdom Hearts 3, I forget the broad strokes, but it was also interesting.

263
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,060
That's at the top of the description of the Rikus game video.

264
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,180
Check that out.

265
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,260
It's even harder to listen to.

266
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:52,220
So you may have more difficulty with it, but like there's a Google Doc and it's just,

267
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,220
it's great.

268
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,020
I don't know how to explain it because I'm not the one who made the video, but I like

269
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
it.

270
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
Maybe I will.

271
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:06,460
I like all that Kingdom Hearts stuff because it's so, the games are so cryptic in like

272
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,820
a stupid way, but well, I say it's stupid.

273
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:19,260
It's cryptic in, you know, deliberately cryptic way, and it's like weird how much, how many

274
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,900
things go into the presentation of these ideas that make them subtle and like hard to see,

275
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,500
but they're clearly deliberate.

276
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,060
Even things like, oh, a cutscene shows this shot and then this shot, and this is like,

277
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:39,100
you can infer from the choice of shots, a theme based on this other information and

278
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
stuff.

279
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,380
It's like, why would they, like, obviously everything in a game is created like deliberately.

280
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,260
Everything is put there deliberately, but like, you would assume some things are just

281
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,100
arbitrary, just like, oh, let's just put it wherever.

282
00:13:54,140 --> 00:14:00,980
The fact that the theory goes into like, actually, there's a lot more hidden meaning throughout

283
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:07,780
the game that you wouldn't really think of, but when you, you know, it's a good theory.

284
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
It's a good compelling theory.

285
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,260
It's just like the Riku video.

286
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,900
Wait, I thought you were talking about the Riku video.

287
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Well, I'm talking about, that's the thing.

288
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,700
It's like, it's the similar sort of thing.

289
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,260
It's a theory specifically about the nature of Kingdom Hearts 3.

290
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:29,420
And Riku is gay isn't necessarily related, but the Riku is gay video is like, it has

291
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,580
elements of that theory near the end.

292
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,620
If you didn't get to the end, you probably wouldn't have seen all that, but like, it's

293
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
good.

294
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Yeah.

295
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:45,580
I could, I had gripes, I had gripes with the presenter.

296
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,980
I kind of didn't like them.

297
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,860
I would assume you would, but like, that's just because you're bigoted or something.

298
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
That's right.

299
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,860
That's right.

300
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,620
Listen, I'm going to, I didn't like, didn't like the, didn't like the fursona, didn't

301
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:06,260
like the avatar, thought it was underanimated, but over expressive in a way that was distracting.

302
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,620
Didn't, yeah, didn't like, they, they, they rambled.

303
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,940
They kind of, they kind of went on tangents about, I didn't like, okay, when they talked

304
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:22,380
about like a lack of gay representation, I found it almost like infuriatingly naive,

305
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,980
the way they talked about like Disney, I don't know, the sense that I got was like, like

306
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,420
they were, they wanted to do Disney apologia.

307
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,780
Like they wanted to be like, oh, Disney just wasn't ready.

308
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,980
Disney wasn't ready to put gay people in their movies, but now it's 2023 and now, you know,

309
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
times have changed.

310
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,100
And it just seemed like they weren't acknowledging the fact that like Disney does, makes these

311
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,260
decisions about like, they do this bare bones representation thing, you know, for like a

312
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,740
cold calculated money making purposes.

313
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,980
He seemed like he was absolving them of, of their responsibility in this arena.

314
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,780
And finally, the one thing about the attitude that I kind of annoyed me, and I don't know

315
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,580
if this is going to sound stupid, I feel like people might think, call me stupid for this.

316
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,140
But the way that he talked about when Riku was gay, he would always like have a little

317
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,900
sly expression, so like, hey, Riku did something gay, Riku acted gay.

318
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,620
And it felt dirty.

319
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,300
It made, it gave me a feeling like it was like a dirty secret that was being like sneakily

320
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,940
shared with me.

321
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,860
And it made it sound like being gay was like this, this dirty thing.

322
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,180
The way that he, the way that he like snickered about it every time that it, that it reared

323
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
its ugly head.

324
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,260
I think that's just like Tumblr culture.

325
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,180
I don't like it.

326
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,620
It's the, it's the sort of like, ooh, look at that con, look at that con and it made

327
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,940
him squee and, and he was going to glomp Riku.

328
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,340
He was going to glomp him.

329
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
Yeah.

330
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
Because he's such a little squishmallow.

331
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Yeah, yeah.

332
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,340
Squishmallow.

333
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
And I just, I just.

334
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
Oh, I like that word.

335
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,340
I just can't, I just can't, I just can't cotton, cotton to it.

336
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,820
It's not, it's not copacetic.

337
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
I don't know.

338
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Okay.

339
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Okay.

340
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
I'm done.

341
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
I'm, I'm, I'm coping.

342
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
I'm done coping.

343
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Done coping.

344
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,220
You guys, you guys haven't asked.

345
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
The argument was compelling.

346
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,860
You guys didn't ask me what my opinion was on the Riku.

347
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
Did you watch the video?

348
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
It was a gay video.

349
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
Die.

350
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,180
I didn't watch the video, but it did make, I did make this epic meme right now that expresses

351
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,540
my feelings on the video that I didn't watch.

352
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,540
Check it out.

353
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
I'm going to kill you.

354
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
What's it?

355
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,540
Yo.

356
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
True.

357
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,540
It's the first time I've seen an old kingdom of hearts characters R.K.

358
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Um, yeah.

359
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
Yeah.

360
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
I thought they were all the gay one.

361
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,300
I thought they were all the, they don't, well, they are.

362
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,220
I mean, you could, you could scratch that to all like Final Fantasy adjacent characters

363
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,220
too.

364
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
I mean, those black robes.

365
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
Especially the white robes.

366
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,100
You don't need, you don't need eight hours to tell me Riku is gay.

367
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,580
I assume they all were gay.

368
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,020
I don't need an eight hour video.

369
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,820
I, I even big brain.

370
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,340
I already, I assume organizations are gay by default.

371
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,540
Sephiroth, Sephiroth is gay for his mom because he like is his mom.

372
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,540
That's the only gay that's okay.

373
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,540
If you think about it.

374
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Yeah.

375
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,220
Which means his mom is a, is a, is a man at that point.

376
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
Definitely.

377
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Yeah.

378
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
Definitely.

379
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
That's what I'm saying.

380
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
Allyship.

381
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
And that's, and that's where I draw the line.

382
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Franklin.

383
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
That's where I fucking draw the line.

384
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,460
The fucking, the fucking organization 13, like their black robes, they always had a

385
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:33,980
bit of like, like, uh, what's the, leave it to, SMM culture, the, the leather and the

386
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
zips.

387
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,580
The, the, the, instead of just being made a cloth, you know, like a Jedi robe.

388
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
That's just got punk.

389
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,100
All, all goth punk stuff is very like SMM.

390
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Yeah.

391
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
It's inspired.

392
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,540
It's derived from queer spaces and all that stuff.

393
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
True.

394
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,540
It's great.

395
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Goth.

396
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,540
Shit.

397
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,460
There's no such thing as, uh, straight fashion.

398
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,740
All the cool shit is gay.

399
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Straight people.

400
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,420
There's no such thing as white culture and no such thing as straight fashion.

401
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,420
It's true.

402
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,420
I agree.

403
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,420
True.

404
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,780
You know what?

405
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Actually disagree.

406
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,780
Straight.

407
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
Straight.

408
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,940
Straight fashion is like a graphic tee with a Batman logo.

409
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,940
That's straight fashion.

410
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
Yeah.

411
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
I see your eyes.

412
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Oh, you know what?

413
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,940
You've turned me around.

414
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,940
That's a great.

415
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:26,180
Straight, straight fashion is a guy in like an old, an old, like black and white movie

416
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,380
like prison uniform, like black and white stripes with a little like cap.

417
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
That's it.

418
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Straight fashion.

419
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,140
No, that's a twink uniform.

420
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,540
That's the, that's the Hamburgler uniform.

421
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,540
Like, like, like what the three stooge, like what the three stooge's would wear if you

422
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,180
if you sent them to prison.

423
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,180
Just them though.

424
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,180
They only wanted to wear that if they got arrested.

425
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
Everyone else is dressed normal.

426
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,380
Everyone dressed in prison orange, but they get the stripes because they're just wacky.

427
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,620
They're just wacky like that.

428
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
Yeah.

429
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
If you're wacky enough, you're in prison.

430
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,660
You get the funny costume.

431
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,340
That's what that's what they put on the Joker.

432
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,100
The way I'm wearing the stripes because he's so wacky, you know, watch out.

433
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,300
This one's the wacky inmate.

434
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
To the Joker.

435
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,300
He's kooky.

436
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
He's loco.

437
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Black is the new orange.

438
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,300
Oh my God.

439
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,140
And then he eats it like an orange.

440
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,140
He peels it and he makes juice out of it.

441
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
I don't want to.

442
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
That's how wacky he is.

443
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
Stripes on a white shirt.

444
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,140
I want to white stripes on a black shirt.

445
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,140
I remember what he said that.

446
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
Yeah.

447
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,700
And then Batman's like, Batman's like, you're out of line Joker.

448
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,220
He starts breaking his arms.

449
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:39,580
He remember when I remember when I discovered putting bacon grease on on green lentils.

450
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,580
Remember that?

451
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,580
Yeah.

452
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,140
That magical moment that we shared.

453
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,380
I found a new way to do it.

454
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,100
Put lentils on bacon grease.

455
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,940
You can put lentil grease on bacon because to get bacon grease, you have to make bacon

456
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,460
and then you have to save the grease and it's kind of a hassle.

457
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
But guess what?

458
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,500
You can just take bacon when you make when you make your green lentils in your rice cooker.

459
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,700
You can just take bacon and cut it up and just throw the raw bacon in the water with

460
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,140
the lentils and then the bacon cooks in the lentils.

461
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,820
The rice cooker cooks the bacon.

462
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
It's a miracle.

463
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Ben, the year is 2020 free.

464
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,700
You said this last week your dementia is setting in.

465
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Wait, I did?

466
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
No, you didn't.

467
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
Yes, you did.

468
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,740
I was waiting for you to say throwing in the bacon with the lentils and the rice cooker.

469
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
I'm going to kill myself.

470
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
I'm going to fucking do it.

471
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
I don't remember.

472
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Maybe I just wasn't listening.

473
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,180
I don't remember you saying you put bacon in the rice cooker.

474
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
Oh my God.

475
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
Bye.

476
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,980
No, you definitely said that on the last episode.

477
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,820
I listened to it yesterday.

478
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
It's over.

479
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
I caught up to it yesterday.

480
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
Oh, no.

481
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,820
It's fucking over.

482
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,660
That both means that you have to mention I am completely absent-minded and I wasn't

483
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,540
listening and I was very rude if that's the case.

484
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
No.

485
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
It was like a free hour conversation.

486
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,780
I'm going to miss one or two things.

487
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,460
I can't live with myself.

488
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,980
I actually just listened to the last episode right before jumping into this one and I totally

489
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
forget.

490
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,980
Do you remember?

491
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
I forgot everything.

492
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
Do you remember my bacon story?

493
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
I forgot everything you guys talked about in the last episode.

494
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
Bacon and the lentils.

495
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,180
I mean, so did I.

496
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Bacon and lentils.

497
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
The lentils.

498
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
The rice cooker.

499
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
The rice cooker cooks the bacon.

500
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
The rice cooker cooks the bacon.

501
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
It's just.

502
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
It's so convenient.

503
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,860
Why don't they call it a bacon cooker?

504
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,620
Why don't they call it exactly?

505
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Exactly.

506
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
You're exactly right.

507
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
What if you make rice out of bacon?

508
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
Bacon.

509
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,620
Then it would be epic.

510
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,620
I don't know.

511
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,220
I don't know what would happen if you did that.

512
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,380
Did you chop like bacon into rice shakes?

513
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Wait a second.

514
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,380
Ben, you don't have a grease jug?

515
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,220
You don't have a grease jug in your kitchen?

516
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,220
I have a Thai small mason jug, a small little glass jar.

517
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
No.

518
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,860
You're going to go and get yourself a big ass jug of oil, get an oil jug, and then you

519
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,220
just put that oil back in the jug and any extra oil you just put in there.

520
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,340
You just drink the oil straight from the jug.

521
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,340
Yeah.

522
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,740
I have an oil jug.

523
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,220
You don't have an oil jug?

524
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,220
Come on, Ben.

525
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,220
I have an oil jug.

526
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
It's called.

527
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
My penis.

528
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
Cotton balls.

529
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,220
Oh, God.

530
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,620
Check out this video.

531
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,940
Check out this video that I posted.

532
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,900
This is another one from GNO7.

533
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
This video.

534
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
It's OK.

535
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,700
Did you see that defunct land?

536
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,100
Not defunct land.

537
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Where he finds the...

538
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,460
That is defunct land.

539
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,180
Yeah, I watched that.

540
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
That was good.

541
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
That was a good video.

542
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
Incredible video.

543
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,460
That video is basically like that.

544
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:36,260
But it's about this one guy who worked at Cartoon Network and is responsible for all

545
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,580
the iconic sounds of that era of Cartoon Network.

546
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,940
That's great.

547
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
It's such a good video.

548
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
Is he the one that put out...

549
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm glad that this is really engaging and popular because it's like...

550
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:54,900
I mean, no, but it's only got 4,000 views, only 4,000 views on this masterpiece of a video.

551
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:01,740
Well, I hope it gets more, but like the idea that like uncovering the hidden talents behind

552
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,460
things that we just take for granted, it's like, yeah, they do deserve credit.

553
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,140
We do need to do that more.

554
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,660
People don't deserve to be buried alive.

555
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,660
OK.

556
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,660
It's my...

557
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,620
Like that guy who makes all the good voice mails.

558
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,620
Who is he?

559
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,620
It's not...

560
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Oh my gosh.

561
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,620
Oh my gosh.

562
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,620
I'm going to kill you.

563
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,620
I'm going to kill you.

564
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,140
It's not quite as good as the defunct land one because it's not like it's a mystery.

565
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
Like this guy is...

566
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,100
This guy, he's not like famous, but like he is known in the industry, like people know

567
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
who he is.

568
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,980
So it's not like he had to search for him.

569
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,380
It's just kind of like a piece about this guy who sort of did all this amazing work

570
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,860
and you probably never heard of him.

571
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,820
But I like the content online is being made about stuff like that because like, I wouldn't

572
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,580
think to look up who made the guitar sound.

573
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,220
In fact, I want to know that.

574
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,020
You know that classic Hanna-Barbera era like guitar smash?

575
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Yeah.

576
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
Ding!

577
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
I guess so.

578
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Yeah.

579
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,140
Well, all sorts of cool stuff.

580
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,220
Sounds are very often overlooked.

581
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,220
True.

582
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
Overlooked and undercooked.

583
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,220
Sounds are of a sort of texture.

584
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,220
Sounds...

585
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,220
You were talking about...

586
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,820
Yeah, sounds can't be overlooked.

587
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,700
You can't look at a sound.

588
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Stupid.

589
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
No, you can't.

590
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
You can look at the waveform.

591
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
No.

592
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Overheard.

593
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Shut up.

594
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
That's not true.

595
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
That's not true at all.

596
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Shut up.

597
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
Yeah.

598
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,820
So, Ben, you're talking about channels that you just know are going to blow up the moment

599
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
you see them.

600
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,220
I had that experience a while back with this channel, Kid Leave Stoop.

601
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
I've heard of this.

602
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
This was like the first second.

603
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,220
Possibly from you.

604
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,220
I don't know if I ever mentioned it.

605
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Maybe not.

606
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
Actually, I feel like I've...

607
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
2.5 million views?

608
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
I remember watching this one.

609
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Yeah.

610
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,460
It's blown up now because it's been like over a year, but when I found this, it had like

611
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,620
less than 10,000 views and it was just really like a well-made video and I'm like, this

612
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,140
guy is going to get big and I guess he did.

613
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
Yeah.

614
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,140
137.

615
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
137.

616
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,140
Yeah.

617
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,420
I think Geno7's got the sauce.

618
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,460
I think from what you're saying, it definitely sounds like he's got the sauce.

619
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,460
Yeah.

620
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
Yeah.

621
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,260
That's my prescription.

622
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,980
The next video in the channel is what if bowling stayed illegal?

623
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
What?

624
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,140
That's what it says.

625
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,540
What if bowling stayed illegal?

626
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,500
What if bold people stayed illegal?

627
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
In the description?

628
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,540
No, the next video in the channel.

629
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,940
That's the title.

630
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,140
Of Kid Leaves Soup?

631
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,140
Yeah.

632
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Yeah.

633
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
What if bowling stayed illegal?

634
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
It's a video.

635
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
Oh, wait a minute.

636
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,380
I saw this Simpsons Missing Bus Stop video.

637
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,380
Oh.

638
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,380
I've seen that one.

639
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
That was good too.

640
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
Oh, yes.

641
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
I did see that.

642
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,780
I haven't seen a good...

643
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,780
You know what?

644
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
I like videos.

645
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
What would you call these?

646
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
Bowling stayed illegal.

647
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
What the fuck does it mean?

648
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,180
Are these still video essays or what do you even call these types of videos?

649
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,300
Are these still video essays or...?

650
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,380
Bowling was associated with gambling or other shit, and in America it was banned.

651
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,500
Nine-pin bowling was banned, and the way they got around the law was to create 10-pin bowling.

652
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
It's technically a different game.

653
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
That's why it's ten-pin bowling.

654
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
I'm not joking.

655
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
No, I did not.

656
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
I never heard that before.

657
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,060
That's like cocaine's illegal, so we invented cocaine too, which is technically another

658
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,060
drug.

659
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Well, no, it's just...

660
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
Actually, that's like...

661
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
That's like painkillers, actually, I think.

662
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,540
This guy has the Simpsons in like half of his video thumbnails, but it's just like that

663
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:30,820
episode of The Simpsons where they put uranium in the farm, in the crops, and they combine

664
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,180
tobacco and tomatoes to make tobacco.

665
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,900
It's technically a different vegetable, even though it's just...

666
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,500
Was it uranium or was it that he just was mixing seeds?

667
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,420
I thought he was just mixing seeds.

668
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,820
No, he got some stuff from the power plant and put uranium or plutonium or something

669
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
in the seeds.

670
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,820
Oh boy.

671
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
And it could cause a crossbreed.

672
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,700
I haven't seen a good video, I say, in a while.

673
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,380
The last one I watched wasn't really that good.

674
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:03,660
It was called Why Nintendo is so overprotective of its intellectual property.

675
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,660
That seems...

676
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,180
Because if you know nothing about Nintendo history, it's a super interesting video, but

677
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,260
after I was done watching it, he says that like, oh, the reason why it's because they

678
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,340
have this one lawsuit where Universal Studios wanted to sue them for using the word Kong,

679
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,900
but they didn't own the rights to it and that kind of scared them off.

680
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,980
That's why they didn't really merchandise or spread themselves thin.

681
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,700
And then after I was done watching the video, I was thinking like, wait a second, what about

682
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,380
the Super Mario Bros. Super Show era, where they were putting everything on macaroni in

683
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,860
the live action movie?

684
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,020
He did not mention that era at all.

685
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,900
He skipped over it.

686
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,260
And I'm like, wow, I mean, I would have argued that it wasn't even necessarily that lawsuit

687
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
that did it.

688
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,060
I do think it was probably just the live action movie that really scared them off from like...

689
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,940
Did you see the trailer for the new Mario movie?

690
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,300
The little promo that they had?

691
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,300
Yeah.

692
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Yeah, it looks really...

693
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
It looks really cute.

694
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
A little advertisement.

695
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,300
Yeah, it looks really cute.

696
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,300
I am...

697
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,300
I'm not gonna lie.

698
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,300
I like...

699
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,740
I'm gonna watch it, but like a part of me feels like, God, I wish I was like 12 years

700
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,580
old, because I'd be more excited about this, because I feel like I'm not that excited for

701
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
it.

702
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,700
Even though it seems like this would be something I would want, and it looks like they're stretching

703
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,620
beyond and doing more kind of lore stuff, like they even have like the whole Kong race

704
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
there and everything.

705
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,740
And I would have ate that shit up as a kid, but like...

706
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
Yeah.

707
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Now I'm kind of like...

708
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,740
Like, I don't know.

709
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
I don't know.

710
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
It's like...

711
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
It's...

712
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
I mean, I'm gonna watch it.

713
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
I'll probably like it, but I'm not...

714
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
I don't feel that excited about it.

715
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
I just...

716
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
I don't know.

717
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
I guess I moved on.

718
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
You know?

719
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
I never...

720
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
There's...

721
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
I didn't...

722
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,140
Care for Mario in the first place, so I'm just interested.

723
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,380
I didn't really care about the movie at all.

724
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,420
I thought it was gonna, like, whatever, but I gotta say, seeing that new trailer, there's

725
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,860
something that warms my heart a little bit about the fact that they're sticking to the

726
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,740
old, like, their plumbers from Brooklyn, like, backstory.

727
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
I...

728
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,740
I love the live-action movie.

729
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,740
I...

730
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
I get the more I love that.

731
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
Yeah.

732
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
Like, live-action movie.

733
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
It's great.

734
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,220
I genuinely love the live-action movie as a kid.

735
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,740
Like, I watched it a bunch of times.

736
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,740
I'll tell you...

737
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,740
I'll tell you this.

738
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,740
Something about, like, it feels like the Mario movie is being made by people who are, like,

739
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,220
fans of Mario, and not gonna lie.

740
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,220
I feel like...

741
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,500
Cause there's, like, a big, like, group of people who love, like, those last two live-action

742
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,660
Sonic movies, and, like, like, everyone I know who loves it is not gonna listen to

743
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,660
this podcast.

744
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,620
So, I could say this.

745
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,940
I feel like it was a big cope.

746
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,140
I feel like liking those movies was, like, a massive cope.

747
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,500
Because they're just unironically, like, what if Alvin from Alvin and Chipmunks was a superhero?

748
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,820
It's, like, what the Sonic movies are.

749
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,660
And I'm tired of pretending they're not.

750
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,540
I'm tired of pretending they're not that.

751
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
Cause it's...

752
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
It's really...

753
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
It doesn't...

754
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
It wouldn't even fucking...

755
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
It wouldn't even fucking matter.

756
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
I'll...

757
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
I'll be honest.

758
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
What?

759
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
It wouldn't even...

760
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
It wouldn't fucking matter.

761
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,540
It wouldn't fucking matter.

762
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,540
I'll tell you this.

763
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,540
He wouldn't do anything.

764
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
I'll tell you this.

765
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
If they removed Sonic from that movie...

766
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,980
Like, if they removed everything, like, that was Sonic the Hedgehog related, I wouldn't

767
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,700
even be able to tell that it was supposed to be a Sonic movie to begin with.

768
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Hmm.

769
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Oh my gosh.

770
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,180
If you take everything Sonic related out of something, you wouldn't know it was Sonic

771
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,180
the Hedgehog.

772
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,180
No, no, no.

773
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,180
Not like that.

774
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Like, because it's certain...

775
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,460
Like, Sonic stories have, like, a certain way about, you know.

776
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,460
Like, like...

777
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
Oh.

778
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Here's how...

779
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,740
You're saying the movie didn't feel Sonic.

780
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,740
No, it didn't really...

781
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740
Didn't feel...

782
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,740
I mean, the fact that, like, we have, like, kind of like a human character that we're

783
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
following...

784
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
I mean...

785
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,140
Like, like an oven in the chipmunks.

786
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
This guy is just Dave.

787
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,380
This guy is just Dave from oven in the chipmunks.

788
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,860
Everything wrong with the Sonic movie that you're describing is down to just that one

789
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,860
human character.

790
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,860
Just for one.

791
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Not even all human characters.

792
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
I don't think so.

793
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,860
Even like, the one dad guy.

794
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,860
No, it is down to him.

795
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,780
He has a weird hexagon-shaped face.

796
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
I want to punch him.

797
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
I hate this face.

798
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Personally, I think he's handsome.

799
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,780
But, like...

800
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Even, like, robot...

801
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
Even, like, dog...

802
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
Well, let's find out whether or not he's handsome.

803
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,780
He's in Doctor Eggman.

804
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,540
He looks like an NFT profile picture.

805
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,100
Like, I don't mind Jim Carrey, but, like, he does not look like...

806
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Dude, I'm not sure...

807
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
Jim Carrey is Eggman.

808
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
I love Jim Carrey.

809
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
It's so weird.

810
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Jim Carrey is Eggman looks...

811
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
He's good.

812
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
Jim Carrey is Eggman looked kind of neat.

813
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
I thought that looked cool.

814
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
I mean, I didn't see the movie.

815
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
I really enjoyed him as Eggman.

816
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
I'll tell you this.

817
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,660
If, like, if that design existed and it wasn't tied to a Sonic movie, I would never even

818
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,620
say tell that that was supposed to be Eggman.

819
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,620
Hmm.

820
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,100
Well, doesn't he look more like Eggman in the second one?

821
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,180
Doesn't he, like, become fat or whatever?

822
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
No, he doesn't.

823
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
He stays skinny.

824
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,180
He does become fat.

825
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
But he gets the costume.

826
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
Like, like, he looks more like classic Eggman.

827
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
He gets the must...

828
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,180
Yeah.

829
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:53,900
There's, like, little, like, classic Eggman-isms going for him, but it doesn't get too, like...

830
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
You know what?

831
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,340
I kind of think, and I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

832
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,900
about, but something about the fact that Jim Carrey kind of doesn't look anything at all

833
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,500
like Eggman, and yet, you know, from the trailers I saw, he kind of sort of was...

834
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,820
I think it's like a weird outside the box.

835
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:16,260
I would say it's a weird outside the box, maybe even inspired casting choice that I would

836
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,260
never have thought of.

837
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Like, I'm a...

838
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
I like it.

839
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
I think I like it.

840
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
I enjoy it.

841
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
I'm entertained.

842
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,620
And in interviews, Jim Carrey was like, I really, really hope that in the next movie

843
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,620
they let me be fat.

844
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:32,780
He said, I mean, I'll tell you this, I mean, I thought the second movie was better than

845
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,500
the first one, but the first one wasn't even, like, a high bar, so it was like...

846
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,580
It went from, like, eh, to, all right, for me.

847
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,940
You know, I just want to have fun with these movies.

848
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,740
I'm not expecting them to be, like, good films, just want to have fun.

849
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,740
They've been fun.

850
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,180
I'm just trying to have fun with your wife.

851
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
Too bad.

852
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Oh, yeah.

853
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
Okay.

854
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
She's your gay now, huh?

855
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
She's your gay.

856
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Who was I coming into last night?

857
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Boom.

858
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Got him.

859
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Dead.

860
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
You're almost as gay as Riku.

861
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
I would say.

862
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,100
I didn't say, I didn't say I wasn't, I didn't say I wasn't also a Kingdom Hearts character.

863
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:15,140
I, when I saw they would cast, what's this, Jim Carrey's Eggman, I was like, what the

864
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
fuck?

865
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,140
Weird.

866
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,140
Interesting.

867
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
Neat.

868
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,340
When I saw that they cast Jack Black as Bowser, I thought, neat.

869
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,900
And then I heard him, and I was like, oh, you know what?

870
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,340
It is Jack Black, but it kind of sounds, it just kind of sounds normal, kind of just sounds

871
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
like Bowser.

872
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
Honestly, it's not.

873
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
When they said?

874
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,340
It's not that weird.

875
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
It's not that weird of a voice.

876
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,500
When they said Jack Black Bowser, I thought, oh, perfect.

877
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
That just works for me.

878
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
If you, if you're...

879
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Yeah, it just works.

880
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
It just works, but it doesn't really, it's not really interesting.

881
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I don't know.

882
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,860
I think Jim Carrey as Eggman is interesting.

883
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,860
I'll tell you this.

884
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,660
I'm pretty like, you know what, ultimately, I feel like if you like Sonic, you like those

885
00:34:52,660 --> 00:35:00,140
Sonic movies, and I kind of relate in the way that, like, if you notice, a lot of DC

886
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:06,460
movies have very kind of like, interesting like casting choices, and I think the biggest

887
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,220
example would be like Arnold Schwarzenegger as like Mr. Freeze, right?

888
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
And like, oh, I love that.

889
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,220
That.

890
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,220
I love that they went in that turn.

891
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,220
Okay, okay.

892
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,940
And with that, I mean, that was like, because Arnold was like the biggest star of the freaking

893
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
era.

894
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,420
No, but like, if, but think a bit like this, Mr. Freeze, whereas Jim, Jim Carrey is not

895
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,860
exactly like an A-lister anymore.

896
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:32,220
You know what's so funny is that that version of Mr. Freeze was created because the, that

897
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,100
first Tim Burton Batman movie came out, and in the, in the show, in that episode, Heart

898
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,380
of Ice, which is like a 10 out of 10 episode, I watched it like three times last month in

899
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,380
a row.

900
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,260
Mr. Freeze isn't like a bodybuilder Austrian guy.

901
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:54,940
He's like a little, little fucking little cancer nerd in a super suit, you know, in, in, in

902
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,260
which, in the animated series, yeah, animated series.

903
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Yeah.

904
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
Right.

905
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,140
So it's like, oh, to choose a bodybuilder to play that character is a very out there choice,

906
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
you know.

907
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,140
Yeah.

908
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,820
Well, I mean, it's a different, okay.

909
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,020
Mr. Freeze is from the animated series.

910
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
Like he was made for.

911
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
He is.

912
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
Not from an older.

913
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,260
He existed, but he was more of a goofier character called like Mr. Zero.

914
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,260
And then in the animated series, they're all like, Hey, what if we just reboot his old

915
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
origin story?

916
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,540
Let's, let's literally rip off the movie, the abominable, the abominable Doctor Fibes,

917
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,180
which has the whole origin with the wife.

918
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,780
And like, let's give that to Mr. Freeze.

919
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,820
And the re, and if you ever, if you rewatch that episode, I really recommend you rewatch

920
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,580
Heart of Ice because that's a real, that's still a really good episode.

921
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,780
Mr. Freeze has like this little, his voice does like, it sounds like it sounds mechanical

922
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,820
because it's coming out of like a speaker and they, and that's like lifted directly

923
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:57,380
from the movie, the abominable Doctor Fibes, because that character, that character connects

924
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:02,460
like a speaker into his fro and he, and he talks out of like a fucking like phonograph

925
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,900
and it, and it sounds like that.

926
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,900
Yeah.

927
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,220
Like one of those things that like people that had to get their tracheas removed because

928
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,700
they got throat cancer, like when they put the microphone to their throat.

929
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,660
It's like the movie was made, like, I think in the 60s.

930
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,300
So it's like a, it's like a speaker.

931
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,300
It's like a fucking, it's those old timey, like the fucking open bloom flower looking

932
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,380
speakers that that's like connected to a record player.

933
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
Yeah, yeah, that movie is great, too.

934
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:32,420
That movie is like, imagine if it's like it saw, but like if the Jigsaw killer was

935
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,140
like a goofy super villain who was played by Vincent Price, if anyone knows Vincent

936
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,860
Price, the 10 out of 10.

937
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,220
Of course, of course, I know Vincent Price.

938
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,380
Well, come on.

939
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,660
He's a classic boy.

940
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,820
Well, well, I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think.

941
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,180
Was OK.

942
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:57,980
So it casting Jim Carrey as Eggman is like, OK, we need we have a goofy villain from

943
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,420
a well-known franchise and we're so we're going to and we're going to cast this sort

944
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,980
of like comedian, this like this well-known comedian, but who's like like past his prime.

945
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,740
Like he's not really a big movie star anymore, even though everybody knows who he is.

946
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,700
Is that kind of what they were doing with Arnold in ice?

947
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,580
Like was Arnold kind of already sort of like an old star and they were like,

948
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,420
let's bring Arnold back for this fucking weird like superhero role.

949
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,460
I can't remember if like Batman and Robin was one of the last films.

950
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Because if I remember correctly, Arnold didn't really bring that much to like the

951
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,820
Mr. Freeze, like Mr. Freeze is not like a very he didn't really act a lot.

952
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,980
Well, he kind of delivers like ice puns.

953
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,660
I mean, he yeah, he like he, you know, he acted as much as Arnold can act, you know.

954
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,940
Right. Right.

955
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,700
And the ice puns is all part of the charm, which is very funny how like

956
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,060
the the original character of Mr.

957
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,460
Freeze was like a very goofy like his original suit was like yellow and pink

958
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,420
and he had more like a bubble helmet.

959
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,340
And yeah.

960
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,860
And then they make them all super serious in the Batman animated series.

961
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,820
And then they make him goofy again in the live action.

962
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,700
Yeah, they take they take the new serious backstory,

963
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,980
but they make him ridiculous again by cat by making him Arnold in hard advice.

964
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,460
Isn't there a part where like he's a he's a doctor and someone calls him

965
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,020
like Doctor Freeze and he says, actually, it's Mr.

966
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,180
Isn't there? Yeah, yeah, there's this.

967
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,900
Yes, there is a part like that. That's that's a fucking that's I'm sorry.

968
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,860
There's this really good bit in that episode

969
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,300
where I'm and I it's in like I'm looking for right now in the animated

970
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,380
gifts, but there's like a bit where like and I was listening to the director's

971
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,420
commentary of that episode where it's like so Mr.

972
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,140
Freeze is trying to kill the guy who like, you know, is the reason why he's in

973
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,860
that fucking suit, right?

974
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,060
And they're they're attacking his building with his like giant freeze cannon

975
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,500
and Batman stops the cannon and Mr.

976
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,180
Freeze with his cannon already kind of like froze the door shut to the building

977
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,340
so he can't get in and and I was looking to the director's commentary

978
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,140
and they thought like, oh, how do we heat Mr.

979
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,540
Freeze has to be inside that building for the for like the ending of the episode.

980
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,580
So how do we get him inside that building?

981
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,500
And they think of this very clever bit where it's like, OK, what he's going to do

982
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,020
is going to walk up to a fire hydrant and the fire hydrant is going to like kick

983
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,500
it, it's going to it's going to break open, right?

984
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,700
And then water is going to spray out and then Mr.

985
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,340
Freeze is going to like push his gun into the water stream

986
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,420
and turn it on and that upstream will freeze like the water.

987
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,620
But the like the frozen ice would push Mr.

988
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,380
Freeze upward and it's kind of hard to describe.

989
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,620
But when you see it in action, like here's what it looks like.

990
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,420
And it's like really fucking clever, like way to get him inside the building.

991
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,260
You see what you see what I mean?

992
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,500
Let's see here. All right, I'm watching.

993
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,420
There he goes. Yeah.

994
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,140
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense. Yeah, it's it's really it's really dope.

995
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,180
Like fuck, I miss listening to directors commentary.

996
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,820
This is I think it would honestly, I think it would make a little more sense

997
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,500
as if he just kind of jumped on top of the water and just froze a little bit of it.

998
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,460
And then the water pressure might just push the little ice platform,

999
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,300
like I rocket it up, I guess. I don't know.

1000
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,500
I don't I don't know. I get it.

1001
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,540
I think I'm I think he'll just fall down because of his suit

1002
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,540
would be too heavy for a stream.

1003
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,980
OK, the physical of it is kind of like. I'm sure.

1004
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,900
How does how does how does a physics of us make sense for?

1005
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,300
Yeah, the physics are what is the ice with the ice block.

1006
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,180
It's ultimately what we stop flying.

1007
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,540
Or is it like a tube?

1008
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,540
It what it what it is is that it's slowly getting it's getting frozen,

1009
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,580
but only like.

1010
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,780
OK, what already came out.

1011
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,220
So that kind of like pushes him up.

1012
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,580
Here's what I think. Here's what I think.

1013
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:46,460
The the water once it leaves the the the hydrant is in is in a free fall.

1014
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,340
It's going to travel in a parabolic arc.

1015
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,820
So if he freezes a chunk of it and then like holds on to it somehow,

1016
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,980
you know, assuming that it has like a lot more mass than he does,

1017
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,540
he's just going to be pulled along in its parabolic arc as it flies.

1018
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,700
It's it's very goofy physics.

1019
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,060
But as long as it kind of makes sense, it's fine.

1020
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,980
I mean, this is the same universe where he has like a giant mechanical

1021
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,620
robot suit that he's in, right?

1022
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,380
And he has like a made up disease.

1023
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,900
So, you know, it's fine. It's fine.

1024
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,980
I get it. I'm I'm I'm the episode is based.

1025
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,260
The episode is really good.

1026
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,340
While watching it, I was like being I was being one of those like

1027
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,420
the whole you I was being I was jerking off.

1028
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,580
I was like being like they don't make them like they used to villains.

1029
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,460
Don't like quote poetry anymore.

1030
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,580
They don't like they don't fucking hold villains.

1031
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,380
Don't hold you hostage and then like fucking like, you know,

1032
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,180
do like fucking poetry around you about like, oh, woe is me.

1033
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:45,660
Did you did did you hear that they released like a new

1034
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:51,260
edited version of like Roald Dahl's books and like they just change.

1035
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,340
Now, did you hear about they unironically did the yeah, I know what you're talking

1036
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,420
about, they did the meme.

1037
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,100
They should they change they changed a bunch of stuff and they genuinely

1038
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,100
like put in like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1039
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,820
But they fucking they made them woke and mean that in like a weird bad way.

1040
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,780
Like they took out like pretty innocuous things and like made them like

1041
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,820
aggressively like inclusive.

1042
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,460
They did like like what kind of a not I'll find the I'll find the example

1043
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,580
that they did the thing where it's like, I'm quoting the sick animation clip.

1044
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,100
But it's kind of like back in my day, it was all about Chef Boyardy.

1045
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,980
Now it's now all they eat is Chef Boyard girl.

1046
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,060
That's that's unironically like that's unironically like what they did.

1047
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,260
And it's like, this is so why like.

1048
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,820
OK, OK, OK, I found that a sick animation.

1049
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,860
I still saw a sick animation made a little thing about that.

1050
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,980
I don't know if he came up with it.

1051
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,660
Sounds like something that I'm exactly quoting like a sick animation short

1052
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,180
that he made recently. Yeah.

1053
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,940
I've really been liking those shirts you've been making.

1054
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,940
Those are really funny.

1055
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,500
Yeah, it's just non sequitur, a little little character.

1056
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,340
I wish she was my friend.

1057
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:06,700
So here. Here's here's here's three bits that were changed.

1058
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,140
I only saw the first one.

1059
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,340
The first one is the one that but the other two, I guess, are similar.

1060
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,820
Yeah, here. Here's some examples of changes they made to these twenty twenty two

1061
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,620
editions of of a role doll.

1062
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,300
Yeah, OK, the first one you let's change.

1063
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,060
You can't go around pulling the hair of every lady you meet,

1064
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,340
even if she is wearing gloves, just you try it and see what happens.

1065
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,060
What is that?

1066
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,980
Yeah, they couldn't and they couldn't.

1067
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,020
They didn't want to say that.

1068
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,780
Besides, they're so they changed it to besides, there are plenty of other reasons

1069
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,660
why women might wear wigs and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.

1070
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,220
Have that that changes the meaning of the as a like what like what?

1071
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,700
As Joseph, why is that change?

1072
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,620
I'm looking at the.

1073
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,380
Oh, they they also change stuff from from Matilda, too.

1074
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,340
I think they did.

1075
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,180
Yeah, they did it to a bunch of which is so weird.

1076
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,140
So the first one is like they really change to work.

1077
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,620
So the was already woke.

1078
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:09,100
I don't know why like they're doing the more female CEOs bit.

1079
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,020
Why they're really girl, even if she's working as a cashier in a supermarket

1080
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,060
or typing letters for a businessman, even if she is working.

1081
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,020
I why? OK, I don't even under.

1082
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,340
I don't even know the context of this line.

1083
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,260
So I don't really guess.

1084
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,020
I guess the idea is because it's like kind of reinforcing

1085
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,540
like old gender norms kind of stuff.

1086
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,420
And these books are so popular, they're so circulated.

1087
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,260
Yeah, I'm not justifying.

1088
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,580
I'm not justifying like the rewrites of it.

1089
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,780
It's just ultimately you should you should still tell kids,

1090
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,740
hey, by the way, those were written like when people those were written

1091
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,780
before the Mormon Church decided like people were people.

1092
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,940
They like like if it's talking about witches and like you can't tell

1093
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,460
even if they're doing normal woman things like being a cashier

1094
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,660
or typing letters for a businessman like that, I guess that's fine

1095
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,420
to change because it's old fashioned.

1096
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,020
The first one I'm trying to like that I don't get.

1097
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,740
It's like you can't go around.

1098
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,620
You can't go around pulling hair to see if they have a wig.

1099
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,940
Just try and see what happens.

1100
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,180
So it's saying don't do that.

1101
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,460
Besides, there are plenty of other reasons why one might wear wigs.

1102
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,260
Like why couldn't they like that?

1103
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,460
Why can't they change?

1104
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,860
They couldn't they didn't need to delete the first bit.

1105
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,780
They could have just added.

1106
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,300
I mean, OK, I would like if they really wanted to do that.

1107
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,980
Like it's not like this is why the first one is saying wigs is a bad thing.

1108
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:40,700
Anyway, I mean, I don't even see the need for like, oh, we got to put a line

1109
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,860
in there about how it's OK to wear a wig.

1110
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:47,340
Nothing about the first line suggests that it isn't OK for someone to wear a wig.

1111
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,060
Yeah. What I was saying is don't don't mess with people who wear wigs.

1112
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,540
It's already saying not to mess with people right over that.

1113
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,620
Like it's it's fine.

1114
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:02,260
Yeah, I assume these are like some of like the most baffling

1115
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,860
and like pointless and irritating changes.

1116
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,660
Maybe some of the other ones I might understand more because apparently they just

1117
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,780
I don't know, the new additions have a bunch of I really I really hate the second one

1118
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,540
because like it's it's not the fact that it's like I see where like you could

1119
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,900
interpret the second one as the original being a bit problematic.

1120
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,100
I don't agree with the cashier thing.

1121
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,260
Everyone weighs in girls of both cashiers and always have been.

1122
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,260
I don't get that.

1123
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,260
But like the typing letters for a businessman, it's like,

1124
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,420
oh, working under a man.

1125
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,860
It's like, OK, I can see if I've been in a shoe.

1126
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,660
But why can't you just say instead of running a business,

1127
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,660
you could also just say working in an office because like they're describing

1128
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,180
normal like average Joe jobs and being a CEO or a top scientist

1129
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,500
or not average normal person jobs.

1130
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,340
Maybe if I read the context, something about this would make more sense.

1131
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,740
But yeah, it really seems like they changed the meaning from

1132
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,380
work talking about someone just having a job to talking about someone

1133
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,540
like being a big wig, a fricking for.

1134
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,260
Yeah, girl boss top and like that's a different

1135
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,620
that's a different scenario you're describing, especially if the context is

1136
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,060
like, oh, you know, witches could be ordinary people.

1137
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,100
Now it's witches could be billionaires.

1138
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,580
Yeah, we were more rich billionaires.

1139
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,300
Are they fucking billionaires?

1140
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,460
You mean J.K. Rowling?

1141
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:20,300
Oh, my God, goblins, the goblins.

1142
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,020
I bet there were some problematic goblins in Roald Dahl's books.

1143
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,580
Probably the first one is like our kind of goblins design.

1144
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:35,420
Yeah, it's it's sort of odd because in the witches, like I can't remember

1145
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,620
the book, the book itself, like the idea that witches don't have hair

1146
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:44,820
and they wear wigs inherently is sort of like playing into

1147
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,740
like this idea that not having hair is a bad thing.

1148
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,980
Wearing wigs isn't is a sense of like, oh, you're kind of you could be a secret

1149
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:58,740
secret bad person, like that's that's already into like the the reason

1150
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:03,380
the witches are like that is so like changing just this line to say, by the

1151
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,060
way, there's nothing wrong with wearing wigs, but also in this story,

1152
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,340
the bad people always wear wigs.

1153
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,820
Are the witches bad in the witches?

1154
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,980
I have they are they eat children.

1155
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,740
They're they're OK.

1156
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,540
It's like a little boy, I think.

1157
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,500
And he's like, I I'm just a little boy.

1158
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,540
And then there's these witches.

1159
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,580
Like, I will eat you.

1160
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:27,180
There was something I do vividly remember the plot synopsis like a little

1161
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:31,620
boy who's raised by his grandma and his grandma says, like, oh, yeah,

1162
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:36,300
witches exist and they eat kids and they disguise themselves as regular women.

1163
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,700
And I first see them believe it, but he has an encounter with like a weird

1164
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,020
woman who's trying to lure her down his treehouse where he's like, look,

1165
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,180
I have all these snakes.

1166
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,700
And he's like, what the fuck?

1167
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,380
And eventually they go to a hotel and the kid accidentally like witnesses

1168
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,780
like a witch conference and then the witches find them and they turn them into

1169
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,260
like a no, not witch.

1170
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,940
Yeah, witch, which witch gone for the tournament to a mouse.

1171
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,660
And then the kid figures out, oh, we should we should like slip the mouse juice

1172
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,900
to the witches, but they all turn into mouses.

1173
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,100
And then we can just all stop.

1174
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,540
Definitely.

1175
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,620
We can always just stomp them to death or something.

1176
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,580
I don't know how they kill anyway.

1177
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,780
So they do that.

1178
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,140
They stomp the witches to death.

1179
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,820
And then Jesus and the ending bit.

1180
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,700
You know what the ending bit?

1181
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,620
It's very interesting, like the direction they go because this feels kind of

1182
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,340
dark for a kid's like story.

1183
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,540
But the thing is so he doesn't turn back into a human.

1184
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,180
He stays a mouse and they figure out that a mouse has like only like,

1185
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,580
like maybe a five year or 10 year lifespan.

1186
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,060
They have a short lifespan, right?

1187
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,300
And the grandma says like, oh, I'm not going to live long.

1188
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,860
So we're probably going to die around the same time.

1189
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,780
So it's fine that you stay a mouse.

1190
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,700
The end.

1191
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,180
Cool.

1192
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,020
Just die.

1193
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,340
What?

1194
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, to the kid.

1195
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,860
Because they can't turn him back from being a human.

1196
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,860
So they assume that you're not probably live a full mouse life, which is kind of

1197
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,060
short. So we're going to die around the same time.

1198
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,740
I've watched the film.

1199
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,340
There's a film that I remember.

1200
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,620
And the film he turns back into human.

1201
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,100
I don't remember if it ends differently.

1202
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,260
And the film he turns back into a kid and then the book he doesn't.

1203
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,740
Yeah.

1204
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,420
Yeah.

1205
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,900
Have you have you read the sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?

1206
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,580
The The Great Glass Elevator.

1207
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,420
Yeah.

1208
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,740
Yeah, Charlie and the Great.

1209
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,300
Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is so it's I read it as a kid.

1210
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,900
And like, it's so fucked.

1211
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,820
There's aliens.

1212
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,300
They go to like the International Space Station and like there's aliens there.

1213
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,300
And there there's a part where there's a part where

1214
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,100
Wonka makes this like juice.

1215
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,060
He makes this like gum that like turns you young and the grandpa parents

1216
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,020
like eat so much they eat too much of it.

1217
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,100
And they ate the unaged to before they were born.

1218
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,460
So they have to travel to like the fucking ghostly

1219
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,460
like afterlife spirit realm to like find their souls and spray them with like

1220
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,380
sap from a from a from a thousand year old pine tree to like

1221
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,620
re-age them back to the land of the living and it turns them old again.

1222
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,980
And they're like, can I have some more so I could be young?

1223
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,980
And they're like, no, you ate it all the first time.

1224
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:57,900
No, you're just old now.

1225
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,180
Sorry, you fucked up.

1226
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,380
Jesus Christ.

1227
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,180
It's a lot of weird, weird shit in that one.

1228
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,620
Aliens, aliens are canon in in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

1229
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,700
Makes sense.

1230
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,540
I believe it.

1231
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,100
I mean, they have Oompa Loompas.

1232
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,300
Oompa Loompas were just like pygmy people, which is like a real

1233
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,500
it's a real group of people that I don't I don't really I used to exist.

1234
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,980
Maybe they they maybe still exist.

1235
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,660
No, they're there. The problematic goblins.

1236
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,860
They're like, um, you know, the real problematic is not thinking back

1237
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:34,380
to Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

1238
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,220
And like, Wonka does do it.

1239
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,060
Do I'm going into the jungle and I'm stealing the people that I mean,

1240
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,980
I mean, that's not Tim Burton.

1241
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,940
Like that's in the original book.

1242
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,500
I know, I just decided to think it.

1243
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,620
I haven't read the book.

1244
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,060
So I'm just thinking of the land and the Oompa's.

1245
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,980
There's like all these creatures that eat them.

1246
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,180
And and really, Wanker's like, yeah, it's humbling with me and my factory and work.

1247
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,060
It's straight up.

1248
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,540
The Oompa Loompas are a tribe from like the African jungle that are like savages

1249
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:09,900
and they were being attacked by, yeah, freaking creatures in the wild.

1250
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,900
And he was like, hey, I'll give you a factory to live in.

1251
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,140
And if you just become my, sure you, we don't call it slavery.

1252
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,620
You know, you can just live in my factory and work there.

1253
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:24,260
And it's better than it's better than being eaten by Jaguars, right?

1254
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,660
And they're like, yeah, I'll like, let's do it.

1255
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,540
I like, thank you.

1256
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,460
Thank you, White Saviour, for rescuing me from the fricking from the fricking

1257
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,060
dangers of the wild. It's so funny.

1258
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,860
I love it. It's so funny how like all kind of like major classic

1259
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:42,180
like British literature, like kind of justifies colonization slightly in a way.

1260
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,860
It's a major cultural exercise.

1261
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,820
Even fascinating people, like even like Alan Moore, who's very like critical

1262
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,620
about like the British government and as like an anarchist and like League

1263
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,980
of Extraordinary Gentlemen, he forgot to read.

1264
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,500
He didn't realize that like, oh, having so much of all the universe,

1265
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,900
pop culture centered around British pop culture kind of like creates

1266
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:12,900
this land of like whiteness and subtle, very so subtle,

1267
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,660
like colonization, justification.

1268
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,420
Luckily, though, everyone goes to space and lives forever.

1269
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,900
It's easy. It's very easy to just kind of fall into that sort of thinking

1270
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,620
without even realizing it when that's just the culture.

1271
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:34,380
That's why in my Marvel Universe fanfic, the Queen dies back back

1272
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,580
when the IRA put that bomb in her car.

1273
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:40,100
It actually kills her in my alternate universe.

1274
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,380
I did that happen in real life.

1275
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,060
They the bomb wasn't the blast wasn't big enough to kill her.

1276
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:50,140
And I think it was either was the wrong car or it was the blast just wasn't big enough.

1277
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,540
So they like missed a chance.

1278
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,860
I never got a DVD box out of the crown, so we'll never know.

1279
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,660
I have.

1280
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,660
Wait, where'd you go then?

1281
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,860
Let's see.

1282
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,140
I had to did some.

1283
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,500
OK, shit.

1284
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,820
I already already talked about the bacon in my lentils.

1285
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,580
So that was it. That was all I had.

1286
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,900
That was the only one you're going to bring it up before you go to stand up.

1287
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,460
Mike, can you get your cue cards?

1288
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,900
Hey, I know now hold on now, hold on.

1289
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,220
I might have mentioned this already already in this episode,

1290
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,260
but did I mention the bacon in my lentils?

1291
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,340
Actually, OK, interesting.

1292
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,580
I've been I've been doing experiments.

1293
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:36,220
I've been doing experiments on quinine and time in my room.

1294
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,420
I bought OK, I explained that I want for the to achieve a certain visual effect

1295
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,380
in a in a in a video that I want to record.

1296
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,580
I thought about painting my teeth with quinine.

1297
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,340
To make them look weird.

1298
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:58,380
And so to achieve this, I bought 12 liters of tonic water

1299
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,500
and I boiled it down to like 100 milliliters.

1300
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:07,940
And I have I put it under a black light and I did things to it.

1301
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,460
I did I did fucked up things to it.

1302
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,620
Oh, no. Here we are.

1303
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:16,300
Here we are. So so the OK, OK, so it glows blue under the black light.

1304
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,140
If you boil it down, it glows blue brighter.

1305
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,420
But if you boil it down even more, it it starts to glow less

1306
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,780
and it glows it glows on one side, but like the light sort of like diffuses

1307
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,780
and it doesn't glow all the way through.

1308
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,740
And I think the reason why is that the concentration of the other chemicals

1309
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,420
in it, specifically like the aspartame or whatever,

1310
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,940
because I got the non sugar kind, is like occluding the quinine molecules

1311
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,140
and preventing them from fluorescing.

1312
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,740
So I tried this, right, because it's acidic.

1313
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,260
There's citric acid in there.

1314
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,620
So I did the baking soda vinegar volcano thing

1315
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,340
and I put baking soda into it to try and neutralize the acid.

1316
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,900
And what happens when you do that is it creates carbon dioxide and sodium citrate.

1317
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,500
And sodium citrate is a salt and an emulsifier.

1318
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,460
It is what they put in cheese to turn it into American cheese.

1319
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:11,980
So I put baking soda in the stuff and it bubbled and this is amazing.

1320
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,300
I couldn't believe this.

1321
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,340
The quinine glows blue.

1322
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:19,420
But when you put the baking soda in, it turned green.

1323
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,780
It now it now fluoresces green under a black light.

1324
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,180
And I don't know why that is because it's still like the quinine is not in like a compound.

1325
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,820
The quinine should be the same.

1326
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,380
So I have no idea why it changed color, but it did.

1327
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,260
I should have taken a picture.

1328
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,020
I wish I had a picture to show you.

1329
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,340
So like my mistake, you know, but it looks like it's like a different

1330
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:42,380
chemical reaction or somehow the wavelength got affected.

1331
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,420
I don't know.

1332
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,740
I didn't think that the quinine would change form at all in doing this.

1333
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,100
But like, I guess it did.

1334
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:55,060
But visually, it looks really good because it turns it turned when I added

1335
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,060
the baking soda to it, it turned not just like it's like a slightly green.

1336
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:04,660
It's like a whitish, greenish, yellowish, like milky white pale glow.

1337
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,620
And it looks it actually looks really good.

1338
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,100
So it looks it looks.

1339
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,060
Yeah, I'm going to.

1340
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:10,740
I don't know.

1341
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,820
I'm going to see what.

1342
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,460
Smear that all over your face.

1343
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,660
This is what I've been doing this week.

1344
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,140
I've been like I've having all these I'm turning on the black light

1345
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,460
and I'm like putting like powders into all these glowing vials and they're

1346
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,500
like fizzing and boiling and like glowing at me and changing color.

1347
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,620
And I'm just like, you should be recording this.

1348
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,100
That'd be good.

1349
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,660
I should be recording this because that's like slime experiments.

1350
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,380
It'd be good.

1351
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,780
Also, also the origin also Ben real quick.

1352
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,300
I'm going to take a picture of the origin story of Ben Slime.

1353
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,580
It would you mean the you mean the cop killer, the cop killer.

1354
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,420
Who?

1355
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,940
No, no, I don't fuck with that commie bullshit.

1356
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,540
Give me give me one minute.

1357
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,460
I'll be right back.

1358
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,620
Then I can't spare one minute.

1359
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,740
I can't spare one minute.

1360
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,140
Oh, there's a thing I was going to bring up, but I already forgot what it was.

1361
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:02,900
Were you going to bring up at man and the wasquantum manium now in feeders?

1362
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,260
Quantum manium.

1363
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,420
I love that pun.

1364
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,340
I saw I saw that movie high when it like an early screening of it.

1365
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,780
And the whole time I was thinking like, God, when is this going to be over?

1366
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,300
What if it was Ant-Man or the wasp?

1367
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,900
And like, you didn't know which movie you're going to be seeing.

1368
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,460
You have to choose the gender.

1369
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,340
Oh, it's like, oh, it's like Pokemon or the wasp.

1370
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,980
And it's either about one or the other, but you don't know which one.

1371
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,540
It's it's it's like clue.

1372
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,260
It's like the movie clue when it released in theaters.

1373
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,860
I had like each theater had like a different ending or they're like

1374
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,100
or they're like seven different endings.

1375
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,900
But like it was random which theater got what for like who the color was.

1376
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:44,140
You know, would be a I always thought would be a pretty cool like experiment was

1377
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:49,140
um and there was like a comic that basically had like like two comics

1378
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:52,980
were made that were using the same script, but it was like two different

1379
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,100
interpretations of the same script.

1380
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,500
And like two different artists.

1381
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,860
Yeah, two different artists.

1382
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,420
And you could like design the characters however you want, right?

1383
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,620
But it'd be like the same characters in both stories.

1384
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,100
And the plot beats would be the same up until the ending.

1385
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,740
Both versions would have different endings.

1386
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,420
I always thought that'd be a really cool experiment and you can kind of do

1387
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,620
like a Pokemon thing where you call one like red version.

1388
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,420
The other one blue version or something, you know.

1389
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,620
Dude, everyone buys the same comic twice.

1390
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,380
What if you do it to like the only difference is like the hair color.

1391
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,060
But like in this in the script, you get around it by like use.

1392
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,460
They're like aliens and they they don't say blue or red.

1393
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,340
They say like one of them is like blue hair and pronounce the other

1394
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,260
where one or other one is like no hair and no nouns.

1395
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:36,780
What one would it be?

1396
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,860
What would be day version and the other one be them version?

1397
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,260
That's that's or like or like you could like as long as like maybe

1398
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,740
if there's like a part of the story where it's like a character is like,

1399
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,780
hey, I like your blue shirt.

1400
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,020
You could like it'd be kind of like Mad Libs kind of, you know.

1401
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,180
The entire script and Mad Lib like verbs.

1402
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,180
This this could work.

1403
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,140
This this could work.

1404
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,220
I just have to figure out an angle.

1405
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,220
No.

1406
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,220
OK, I'm back.

1407
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,220
I'm back.

1408
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,820
I'm back. Let's let's let's see.

1409
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,020
See these glowy's.

1410
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:16,900
All right, so it looks that it looks really well, it looks really.

1411
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,220
OK, static.

1412
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:21,020
So you can see it in the big like cup there.

1413
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,140
You can see how it's only glowing on one side

1414
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:26,780
because like it's like sort of dark and like I think the light just doesn't

1415
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,300
like get all the way through it.

1416
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,820
Here's here's like a better.

1417
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,020
Like a better shot.

1418
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:35,860
I would.

1419
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,180
This is really nice.

1420
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,780
Just yeah, just as images.

1421
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,700
You should make a wall.

1422
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,860
I'm going to post this.

1423
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,540
Actually, it actually looks really cool in the photo.

1424
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,980
It looks like much more vivid in.

1425
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,660
OK, OK.

1426
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:51,300
Well, in these pictures, it looks really, really purple in in person.

1427
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,580
It doesn't look quite this purple, but also the liquid like glows brighter.

1428
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,940
Liquid seems brighter in person than it does in these images.

1429
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:02,580
Maybe that's your eyes, your human eyes, not being able to see purple.

1430
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:05,420
I'm going to post these images on Twitter and be like,

1431
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,260
yo, is it normal if your cum glows green under black light?

1432
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,540
Is that is that normal?

1433
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:14,140
Oh, yeah, Ben, you're talking last episode about wanting to go for a bit

1434
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:18,180
of a James Lee asphatic with these things you're doing.

1435
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:23,060
Yeah, but like the glowing like eyes and teeth is a what I want.

1436
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:27,660
If you if you want, since I'm a I have a bit of a I'm a little bit of a visual

1437
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,980
effects boy. Oh, you have expertise to share.

1438
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:37,140
Yeah, or maybe like you could send your footage my way and I could see about

1439
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:43,060
like making the glowy bits like look extra like glowy and fuck around with it.

1440
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,660
I would. That sounds like fun.

1441
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,100
I think that might be cool.

1442
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,700
Do you do you have any?

1443
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,100
I don't know.

1444
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:53,420
Do you have any tips on like how to how to make it work in a in a like how to get

1445
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:57,020
that so that you could do that to it?

1446
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,300
Um, I mean, there's a lot of methods I could try.

1447
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,700
I'd probably experiment and then like let you know what works.

1448
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,540
I probably do it in After Effects.

1449
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:10,980
I'm going to. Yeah, my my idea is just is just like paint

1450
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,660
the glowing liquid onto the parts of my face that I want to like.

1451
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,900
Yes, obviously, emanate that's a good idea.

1452
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,660
That's that's the plan.

1453
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:28,220
Yeah, my my thinking is like in post, we could enhance it even more.

1454
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:33,140
Like, yeah, I could like have it take the bright parts of the image

1455
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:38,060
and like have those like have like a bit of a kind of glow or a bloom sort of effect.

1456
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:43,220
I'd like not not in the gross to PS free bloom era video games.

1457
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,060
Right.

1458
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:48,020
I might my plan was to try and like enhance the effect in post,

1459
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,820
but like I'm sure you have more.

1460
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,700
I'm sure you you probably know how to do that better.

1461
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,260
And also, I think you have better software because like I only know I only have Vegas.

1462
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,260
That's all I know how to use.

1463
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,620
Oh, yeah, Vegas is it's a program struggle to do that kind of thing in Vegas.

1464
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,580
Yeah, for sure. OK, that'd be sweet.

1465
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,500
Yeah, I'll see I'll see what I get.

1466
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,460
I'll let you see it.

1467
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:07,460
That'd be awesome.

1468
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,860
I want to fuck around with whatever you got when the time comes.

1469
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:14,380
And then you can look at my result and say yes or no.

1470
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,060
No trash.

1471
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,620
Let me get this out of my.

1472
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,820
Yeah, my idea.

1473
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:25,300
I think I said that my idea is that I want to do that it's going to be an ad

1474
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,780
for the Slime and Punishment book, but it's going to be like as the cop killer.

1475
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:35,460
And so I want to have a real like sort of eerie sort of glowing atmosphere to it.

1476
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,540
Yeah, are you going to do a funny voice?

1477
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,820
I will do maybe a slightly funny voice.

1478
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:46,260
And then maybe I'll add some weird like monstrous kind of oblivion.

1479
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:50,780
Maybe if you would like to add some monster voice sounds to my voice.

1480
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:55,220
That might be cool to I could I could for your voice into manipulator

1481
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:02,300
and have it have that kind of like tractor growly effect to track tractor growly.

1482
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,500
I don't know how to explain it.

1483
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,780
I guess the cop killer, he would say his voice would be sort of like ragged

1484
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:13,980
and like rough and horse, but also sort of maybe like sort of like sort of inhuman,

1485
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:19,180
sort of like maybe not mechanical, but maybe sort of like maybe a little

1486
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,980
bling or oily or or or echo.

1487
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,340
He's like he's kind of turned on, but he's shy, you know, or maybe he would have.

1488
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,900
No, he doesn't have sex.

1489
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,820
He never he never has sex or even thinks it took you a while.

1490
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:34,380
It took you a while to react to the fuck.

1491
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,380
I just. Yeah, because I couldn't I just couldn't put it together.

1492
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,020
It just didn't compute.

1493
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,580
But the cop killer doesn't have a penis.

1494
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,780
Maybe he would have sort of like he would have that thing where like he would sort

1495
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:48,340
of have like multiple voices, you know, like like Dorman, like Dorman in in

1496
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:52,380
Shadow of the Colossus, how he was like multiple voices speaking out of the same

1497
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:57,420
voice, I don't know, maybe you'd have a little bit of that like reverb thing going on.

1498
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,140
He is he's multitudes.

1499
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,060
I don't know. I'm just I'm just throwing ideas out there

1500
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,260
because he's a communist because he's a communist, you see.

1501
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,420
I'm just being silly.

1502
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,420
I'm just being I'm just I'm just kidding, unless.

1503
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,260
What else was I talking about?

1504
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,180
Nothing. That's it.

1505
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:25,500
Um, can you can you just tell me what this whole this whole perfect comic party thing is?

1506
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,660
Can you explain?

1507
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,220
Perfect comic party. Great question.

1508
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,860
The answer is no. Moving on.

1509
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:39,700
Perfect comic party is an incentive structure to get myself and Ben to actually work in our comics.

1510
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:43,620
And the idea is we will make chapters

1511
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,220
and then put them in a PDF together.

1512
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,980
And it'll be like, oh, it's our little shonen jump kind of moving.

1513
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,380
That's that sounds cool.

1514
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,340
That would be really cool.

1515
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:59,100
You guys can even put it up early on like the Patreon for people.

1516
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,860
We could. Yeah. Yeah, I think.

1517
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,380
Yeah. Well, I mean.

1518
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:09,860
Well, why post it? Well, I posted early.

1519
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,500
Well, you know, incentivize people to. Yeah, you're right.

1520
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,900
You're right. I hate I hate our patrons.

1521
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,940
I don't want them to have. Oh, boy, they don't deserve it.

1522
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,020
Yes. Speaking of comics, it's it's out.

1523
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,780
It's fine. The first by the time this drops.

1524
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,300
Cheesy one of Big Paglacci is all out on Twitter.

1525
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:35,020
Isn't. Yeah, um, I was sad when you posted it because I saw you posted

1526
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:38,260
in Big Paglacci and I was like, oh, my God, it's here.

1527
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:43,420
And then I tried to read it and it wasn't all the way out.

1528
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,060
And I was like, no, I can't read the whole thing yet.

1529
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,380
It was act one. Yep.

1530
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,900
How much of it do you have done?

1531
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,260
Oh, I act to act to by the time this video drops,

1532
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,180
act two should already be starting like on Twitter.

1533
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,980
I thought the whole thing will be posted on my Patreon, obviously.

1534
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,020
But I currently like the whole thing.

1535
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,180
Yeah. Or you mean the whole act to it?

1536
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,940
Don't it's only two acts.

1537
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,940
So two is shorter.

1538
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,540
Oh, OK.

1539
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:13,620
And I only have six pages left to draw.

1540
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:17,020
And I'm pretty sure to get that all done by the time this video drops.

1541
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,300
If it if it doesn't if it doesn't drop,

1542
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:26,660
I recommend you check my Patreon or I actually have the whole thing on my Instagram

1543
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,300
because Instagram has this feature.

1544
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,900
Instagram basically has kind of like the the little like you could put a story,

1545
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:37,300
which is like a little tiny video kind of like that thing that Twitter

1546
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,940
that was trying out where like, oh, you can put kind of like a little

1547
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:43,780
quick clip that stays up for 24 hours above like

1548
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,180
if you're doing Twitter mobile will be there.

1549
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:48,660
Instagram so has that feature.

1550
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:52,500
And I literally like put every page in McPaglacci on there.

1551
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,580
And then I collect it together in a reel.

1552
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:57,740
And if you go to my Instagram profile,

1553
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:01,540
it's like right there in a collection and you can just read all of act one.

1554
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,700
It's literally literally I just dropped all of act one on Instagram.

1555
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:09,060
And and all of act one is also on my

1556
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:15,580
band discord, I but also and I've been slowly updating it on Twitter.

1557
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:20,100
It should be all out by now by the time this video is out.

1558
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:25,020
Currently, as we're recording, I have like four pages left of act one.

1559
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:28,260
And I'm going to drop those off tomorrow.

1560
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,820
But it's it's been pretty good.

1561
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,620
What do you what do you think of it so far, Ben?

1562
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:37,420
I think I mean, I think the idea is really funny.

1563
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:39,020
I really like it.

1564
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,620
And also, yeah, I was reading.

1565
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:44,900
I guess I've only read through what was up when I caught up, which was.

1566
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,900
Oh, God, can I spoil it?

1567
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,020
Can I say what happens?

1568
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,780
Or yeah, go ahead. It's fine.

1569
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,260
The part where I got to the part where Ronald

1570
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:57,660
Ronald catches the hamburger and birdie in the in the back room.

1571
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,860
And and I don't know.

1572
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,980
It's pretty good. I don't know.

1573
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:05,700
It's like, hey, Paythos, I don't know.

1574
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,340
I thought I'm I'm compelling.

1575
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:10,820
Hey, I was like, hey, maybe this this opera was pretty good back in the day.

1576
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,820
I don't know.

1577
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:14,020
Might have might have been interesting.

1578
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:18,660
I really do love hearing people say that, like, oh, please,

1579
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:22,940
cheesy, drop the pages early because, like, I'm so tempted to just look up

1580
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,100
what happens on Wikipedia or something.

1581
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,780
No, I want to know.

1582
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,580
The people are very in fraud.

1583
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,420
And Act 2 is Act 2 is pretty good.

1584
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:36,820
I have I have a couple more Easter eggs and cameos in Act 2.

1585
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:40,220
There's a there's a lot in Act 1 during that big splash page.

1586
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,380
I'm not going to name them all.

1587
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:45,140
Uh huh. Uh huh. Right.

1588
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,780
But people figure it out.

1589
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,300
Right.

1590
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,300
But yeah, I'm happy.

1591
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,940
Splash page. You mean like the first one when with like the big parade?

1592
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,020
Yeah. Yeah.

1593
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,020
Yeah. Yeah.

1594
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:56,180
There's a there's like a lot of cameos I put in there.

1595
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,860
Of characters that only appeared in one commercial never again.

1596
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,340
Right.

1597
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:06,740
There's a there's a couple of deeper cuts in Act 2.

1598
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,580
Fascinating.

1599
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,860
Yeah. Fascinating.

1600
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,100
No, I'm liking it a lot.

1601
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,020
I think I think it rule.

1602
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,140
I think I'm a I'm a MacPaliachi fan.

1603
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,260
I'm a I'm a head. Yeah.

1604
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,620
Yeah. I'm hoping a Paghead.

1605
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,460
Paghead. I'm I'm I love MacPaliachi.

1606
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:29,660
I love the way he's abusive to I love that he's a groomer.

1607
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,100
I like that he's just a groomer.

1608
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,100
Yeah, he's straight.

1609
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,220
He's straight. He's straight up.

1610
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,460
He's straight up a judge turpin.

1611
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,660
What do you what?

1612
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,660
The the.

1613
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,780
Sweet Sweetie Todd.

1614
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1615
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,660
La Mal.

1616
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:48,220
It's so funny you mentioned Sweetie Todd, because I was joking with my part

1617
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:51,500
or being like, if this if this gets really popular, I'll do like

1618
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,180
an adaptation of Sweetie Todd, but all the characters are like

1619
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:00,180
the Chuck E. Cheese and Rock a Fire explosion animatronics or something.

1620
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,860
OK. And what I'll do is that I'll do that.

1621
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,460
Every character that Sweetie Todd kills is actually

1622
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:11,620
an animatronic that was decommissioned and isn't used anymore.

1623
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,220
Right. Interesting.

1624
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,580
Maybe maybe I probably am not going to do that.

1625
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:21,380
I got like a bunch of other ideas, but I'm glad people are liking it so far.

1626
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,820
I like it a lot.

1627
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,340
It's great.

1628
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,980
I do recommend that our listeners check out

1629
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:30,260
McPagliacchi, McPagliacchi.

1630
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,740
This is this is my this is my comeback

1631
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,660
from the disaster of clown milk.

1632
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,780
This is the comeback right here.

1633
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:41,100
Yeah, true, true.

1634
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,820
Yeah, cool.

1635
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,780
Yeah, they exactly.

1636
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,140
Well, epic.

1637
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:48,260
It's good and I appreciate it.

1638
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,780
Thank you for your work on it.

1639
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,820
Thank you. OK. Yeah.

1640
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,140
Yeah, did you read it?

1641
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,300
I read it when you first dropped it.

1642
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,820
So I'm only a few pages in.

1643
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,100
I haven't seen the bit with Burger Boy.

1644
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,580
What's his what's his name?

1645
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,780
The hamburger hamburger burger boy.

1646
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,820
But yeah, I will read the rest of it soon.

1647
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,140
It's good. It's it's it's a funny idea.

1648
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,500
I don't know the opera, but it's obviously like

1649
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,780
no, no, no serious thing, but with silly people in it.

1650
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:26,060
It's they there's like a version on it.

1651
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,900
There's a version in like several parts on YouTube.

1652
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,060
In case you want to go watch it,

1653
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:35,620
I recommend you watch it after you're done reading my version,

1654
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:39,100
because each version is like slightly.

1655
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,180
I've seen different.

1656
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,940
I've seen two different versions of the opera

1657
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,180
and I kind of pick and choose parts because

1658
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,900
that's that's the awesome thing about like operas or plays

1659
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,060
is that they're always different every time you watch them.

1660
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,180
And and even they can even have all the same like cast members,

1661
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,220
same set, same bill, the same everything.

1662
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:00,540
It's always it's still like always very different because it's a live performance.

1663
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:03,660
Yeah. And even like stuff like even like seating,

1664
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:08,380
even like where you're sit sitting in the theater is like changes to so.

1665
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,700
I mean, that changes in regular movies.

1666
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,060
Sure. Sure.

1667
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,540
Wait, no, but like in a regular in a regular movie,

1668
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:19,220
you like to they choose the shot and wait, no, no, no, no, no, it doesn't

1669
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:22,060
because in a movie, even if you're sitting in a different spot in the theater,

1670
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,260
the shot in the movie is the same.

1671
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,140
There's a there's a parallax, I understand.

1672
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,340
Yeah, like right.

1673
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:31,300
They choose what there's there's someone choosing what you

1674
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,900
focus on while in a play.

1675
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,860
You could sit closer, you could sit in the back, you know, it's like.

1676
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:40,260
And sometimes you decide you want to just throw shit at the actors

1677
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,340
and just see what they do.

1678
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,140
Like tapping on the on a fishbowl.

1679
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:48,020
I've been to like plays where like the seats are like surrounding

1680
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:52,140
the kind of theater and it's like it's interesting, you know, but true.

1681
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:57,380
Hey, I definitely had that thought when I'm like in the theater at the top part.

1682
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:01,300
And I'm like, oh, you know, if I arc it right, I could hit the middle of the stage

1683
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,460
from here. I really could. I could throw my drink.

1684
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,860
It'd be so funny.

1685
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,740
I shouldn't do it, though.

1686
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:10,220
I've had that thought at the top of a tall building.

1687
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,460
I think, haha, you know, I could just jump off the edge.

1688
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,260
You know, I would all be over.

1689
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,460
Finally, I shouldn't do it, though.

1690
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,420
I'm not going to do it, though.

1691
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,500
I'm not going to do it unless.

1692
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:25,380
Unless someone pushes me and I can't help it.

1693
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,740
Saying that it's wrong to want to kill yourself.

1694
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,340
That's your right, Ben.

1695
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:36,220
It's it's if it's if if wanting to kill myself is wrong, then I don't want to be right.

1696
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:39,420
You know, that's so that's so that's so funny.

1697
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,780
Because I actually I do this thing.

1698
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:46,620
I do this terrible sin where I rewatch I re listen to old episodes of the PCP.

1699
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,380
Oh, no.

1700
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,380
No.

1701
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,700
Which one?

1702
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,180
You know, there's a full you once shame on us.

1703
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,060
Listen to us once shame on us.

1704
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:56,900
Listen to us twice.

1705
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,100
Shame on you.

1706
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,140
I re listen to the to the suicide episode.

1707
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,700
Oh, well, give you are on there.

1708
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,620
Then was it? I don't.

1709
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,380
Yeah, I don't think I was on that one.

1710
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,500
Yeah, you weren't on that one.

1711
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,940
And it's like, like, God,

1712
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,260
I think I really do think the key here is that you guys just we need to get back

1713
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:21,860
to like just having like seven people on one episode talking over each other.

1714
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:23,500
I think that was the magic spice.

1715
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:28,020
It did. Yeah, it had a it had a it had an energy to it for sure.

1716
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:32,460
I think I think Ben, you should just like over invite people to the podcast.

1717
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,460
I don't know.

1718
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,580
I don't I haven't really like invited anyone in a while.

1719
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,700
Yeah, I asked.

1720
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,540
I did ask I did ask one person not that long ago if they wanted to come on.

1721
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:47,060
And they said they said they were nervous or whatever.

1722
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:51,460
They didn't want to do it. I said, OK, you better invite as many people as you can

1723
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,300
before you start pissing off people.

1724
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,260
You can't get pancakes or no more.

1725
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:00,860
Can we get can we get can we get the the the jilted former members

1726
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,180
of the pizza party podcast?

1727
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,580
Can we incorporate them?

1728
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:08,620
Can we merge them into the amoeba that is the the PCP universe?

1729
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,420
It depends.

1730
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:13,900
You've got to like word it right, because well, the thing is,

1731
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,660
I don't think Jim or Izzy taught the pan.

1732
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:20,620
No, like because the thing they weren't they were already barely talking.

1733
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,620
I like him very much anymore.

1734
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:25,620
Like, um, yeah, exactly.

1735
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:29,140
And Pan just seems like a.

1736
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,780
He just seems like a guy that exists.

1737
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,100
I don't see me.

1738
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:36,180
He doesn't see how I could dislike him or like he's completely neutral.

1739
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,340
I think I don't know.

1740
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,700
You know what? I'm just speculating.

1741
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:43,620
I kind of get a feeling sort of a Doug Walker, like he doesn't know what he's

1742
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:46,860
doing and probably that sucks for everyone that works.

1743
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:50,060
Then I don't know. This is the feeling that I just in the fall in the fallout

1744
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,660
of the Pete of the pizza party podcast, everybody seems really upset

1745
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,780
with how everything was done.

1746
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,820
It's it's he's a real name.

1747
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:00,460
You could say I think I agree.

1748
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:04,100
He's he's being he's being a huge Nate, not not not that bad.

1749
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,500
It's it's you would rate your streams.

1750
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,620
If you pan pizza would have rated my fucking stream.

1751
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:14,140
It it it's so funny how it's like

1752
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:19,340
former members got kicked off without like pan telling them just because

1753
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,420
a guy showed just because that peanut showed up and it was like,

1754
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,740
dude, I will literally do everything for you.

1755
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:27,860
You just have to show up and pants like, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.

1756
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,700
And Daphne was just like and wait, wait, OK.

1757
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:31,700
And Daphne was like that.

1758
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:34,180
And Pan was like, OK, sure, whatever, do whatever you want.

1759
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,780
And then Daphne was like, OK, well, I'm kicking off the former members.

1760
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,940
They're gone now. And Pan was like, whatever.

1761
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:41,340
Like, is that how it went?

1762
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:48,140
Well, how it went was that like, oh, my God, I I saw like how it went

1763
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:52,860
was that the former members found out they weren't going to be on

1764
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,980
because of the tweet that dropped of it getting rebooted.

1765
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:01,020
And Pan never told Izzy, who was supposed to be in charge of the new podcast.

1766
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:05,380
Anything. OK. And then after that, Pan like started apologizing like, oh,

1767
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:06,820
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1768
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:09,500
The tweet, the tweet that dropped was from Daphne,

1769
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:13,380
saying the Pizza Party podcast has been reworked and now I'm on it

1770
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,940
and my friends are on it and the old guys are gone.

1771
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:17,820
Or am I or is that not right?

1772
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:22,420
That's they never mentioned anything about the old people being gone.

1773
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:23,780
They just didn't say.

1774
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:27,940
So Daphne just tweeted, the Pizza Party podcast will now be these new people.

1775
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,180
And that's the and that's the announcement.

1776
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:32,540
Lol. He said he'd be in charge.

1777
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,460
I don't like Daphne.

1778
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,340
I everything.

1779
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,820
The more I learn about him, the worse the worse he seems.

1780
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:43,460
Oh, I'm going to I'm going to give you some exclusive dirt on Daphne.

1781
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:44,740
That is not public knowledge.

1782
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:48,500
I don't see. I think that if I think that Daphne would never

1783
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,540
betray you like that.

1784
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:54,260
So I really think that it's really, really despicable.

1785
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,380
No, I'm kidding.

1786
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:58,500
I think that is a is a snake and he would betray anyone.

1787
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:03,140
He would betray his own mother for a nickel, just like shadow from Final Fantasy Six.

1788
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,340
I haven't spoken to Daphne.

1789
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,340
Several of my friends have.

1790
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:10,620
My friend made who is who I've mentioned a bunch.

1791
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:14,340
He he was in a video about Pennsylvania that Daphne did.

1792
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:18,260
You know, I think it was remember the artist of fury on art.

1793
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,860
They're like that really good artist who yeah, also like said,

1794
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:26,460
like a whole bunch of extremely like extreme was that was that the person who was like

1795
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:30,900
I can't they were like, were they like pretending to be black or something?

1796
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,700
Or no, they were.

1797
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,580
No, they're they're actually black.

1798
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,260
I thought I thought there was no way to really clarify if he was black or not.

1799
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,100
No, they posted pictures of themselves.

1800
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,900
They posted pictures of their hands.

1801
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,900
Didn't they just their hand?

1802
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,820
It looked dark to me.

1803
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,220
Oh, well, I trick it a little trick.

1804
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,540
Well, if I trust him, go ahead.

1805
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:54,140
I'm not I'm not going to just assume someone's white because they said the n word.

1806
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,620
That that's the tell.

1807
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,260
That's the tell.

1808
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,420
I'm just I'm saying I'll get gone.

1809
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,940
And I saw their hair, too.

1810
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,940
It looked like, you know, it.

1811
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,740
OK, I just I just I just remember I feel like I heard that

1812
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,140
he said some stuff and people said, you shouldn't say that you're not black.

1813
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,420
And he said, yes, I am.

1814
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,580
And other people were saying, I don't think he is.

1815
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,460
And so that's what just what I remember.

1816
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,260
And then he posted pictures.

1817
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:22,420
OK, didn't post his face.

1818
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,100
We saw his arm and saw his hair and stuff.

1819
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,380
And it looks looks pretty black to me.

1820
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,140
Sure. I don't care about the n word

1821
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:32,340
stuff, particularly because that's up in the air.

1822
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:35,060
He did like post a bunch of like pictures of nooses

1823
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,820
saying ha ha trans people and yourselves.

1824
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,060
He was doing that shit.

1825
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,300
He is a he is an actual piece of shit.

1826
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:43,500
I do not like him and I do not want to defend him even a little bit.

1827
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:47,980
The thing that the issue I have with Daphne in that video is the way he.

1828
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,620
Oh, God, maybe I shouldn't mention this.

1829
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:53,380
It's the way he roped teleperte into being on there.

1830
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,620
Because teleperte doesn't like to comment on this sort of stuff.

1831
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:01,620
He just he's just not comfortable talking about sort of controversial topics.

1832
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:05,940
It's just not something that he was comfortable doing.

1833
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:09,260
And Daphne is like, hey, can I call you real quick?

1834
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,780
And he's like, and he's like, OK, can I record you and tell you?

1835
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:14,300
He's like, yeah. And then he's like, OK,

1836
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:17,580
look, look at all these screenshots of things if you're in our art did.

1837
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,220
Now, tell me, give me the sound bite.

1838
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:23,180
Give me the sound bite of you saying that you're disappointed in him.

1839
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,420
And tell you sitting here thinking I don't want to be here.

1840
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:30,940
But like he was just kind of pressured in because he wanted to want to be

1841
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:34,380
able to put a sound bite of he wanted to be able to have like

1842
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:38,140
here's teleperte saying that like how disappointed they are in so and so.

1843
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:43,020
Yeah, it's like it's like it's just kind of weird to do that to someone who

1844
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:47,100
without like like just putting someone on the spot and being like,

1845
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,580
hey, you're going to be in my video, I'm going to use you as the bludgeon.

1846
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:53,580
You're going to be the bat that I'm going to use to like like smack this guy

1847
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,420
and be like, oh, look, this artist you look up to is disappointed in you.

1848
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:58,140
It's like, I don't know.

1849
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:04,260
I feel like you should like that person's consent to be in like a drama video.

1850
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,220
If they don't want to be in a fucking drama video.

1851
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:09,700
Yeah, even if like even if the criticism is extremely fucking valid.

1852
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,180
I don't like I feel it's a good thing to do.

1853
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:18,500
I mean, I mean, yeah, if teleperte wanted to make a comment on that, then like cool.

1854
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:23,940
But if he like didn't want to end up like extracted it from him for for use

1855
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,540
in his content, then that seems weird and bad.

1856
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:29,980
Teleperte seems very.

1857
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,140
Non confrontational, I guess.

1858
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,940
So he seems like he's quiet.

1859
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:37,300
I don't know.

1860
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,060
He's just a quiet like I just want to draw.

1861
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,060
Right.

1862
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,340
I just want to draw and chill.

1863
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,580
OK. I know.

1864
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:49,060
I know on two occasions, Daph Pina has tried has talked to two different

1865
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:54,100
friends who are who of his who are black and to ask them, can you like voice over

1866
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:59,860
this line where like it's a criticism on a white person about like them being like

1867
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,060
racist because Daph didn't want to do it.

1868
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:05,140
And he's all thinking like, oh, if I get a black person to voice it, you know,

1869
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,380
it sounds more like, you know, oh, this is a big no, no.

1870
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:12,300
And the both he's trying to make the race war real.

1871
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:16,260
And and like and like both both black people that I'm aware of said no.

1872
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:16,820
But he did.

1873
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:21,260
I think he did found like one black person who said yes to like doing a scab.

1874
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,700
Scab.

1875
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:26,020
I'm I found OK.

1876
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:31,820
I found this like Reddit post that is on the rebel taxi Reddit.

1877
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,700
And it's I read it.

1878
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,340
I reread it.

1879
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:38,660
And like, there's some fuck shit that I forgot about where like there was an

1880
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:43,700
opportunity, there was like an opportunity where Pan could have told Izzy and Jim

1881
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,260
what was going to happen.

1882
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,540
But he just stayed silent.

1883
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:50,620
So OK, I'm it's just I can't I can't believe it.

1884
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:54,100
Like is is is it is am I right in that?

1885
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:58,540
Like Daph just said, hey, let me take care of the podcast.

1886
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:02,180
And Pan was like, OK, and then nothing else was said.

1887
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,340
And then the announcement comes out that's like, there's a new cast.

1888
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,140
OK, so that's how Jim and Izzy find out.

1889
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,620
Like, that's insane.

1890
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:14,900
So so there was a there was a voice call like because Izzy was

1891
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:18,460
hand said to Izzy that, oh, you could be in charge of the podcast

1892
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:22,220
at Momo Con of last year after they did their panel.

1893
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,860
And then Izzy was like getting ready for that.

1894
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:29,940
And then suddenly she's getting like DMs and like that Pina is like

1895
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:34,340
a voice calling her and giving her all these suggestions for the podcast.

1896
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,180
And she's like, what the fuck are you doing?

1897
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:37,980
Like, why are you telling me all this?

1898
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:44,780
And he and like Izzy was, I think, and then after that, they

1899
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:47,380
weren't another voice call with Jim and a bunch of close friends.

1900
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:51,060
And Izzy was trying to clarify with Jim and Pan.

1901
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:54,660
Like, do you want like the podcast to be something where like we're trying

1902
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,580
to make money or do you just want to just be a friend thing?

1903
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:00,580
Because up until that point, the whole time, the the Pizza Party

1904
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,620
podcast has just been a friend thing.

1905
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:05,340
It's just something that like an outlet for them to talk, right?

1906
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:09,420
Right. And Jim said they wanted Jim wanted to be a friend thing.

1907
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,700
And Pan never really gave an answer to like what he wanted, apparently.

1908
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:19,300
Right. And so then, like, meanwhile, like Izzy is keeps getting

1909
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:23,060
like DMs from Pan from Daft Pina and she's not replying to them

1910
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,220
because she's like, who the fuck are you, dude? Fuck off.

1911
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,660
Like, I don't know why you keep DMing me, right?

1912
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:30,660
And then like, and then Jim.

1913
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,980
I think, OK, I'm looking at it right now.

1914
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,860
And I turned out he couldn't swim.

1915
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:43,140
Yeah. So I think I think Jim then texts Izzy and he's like,

1916
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,260
did you know about the podcast reboot?

1917
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,860
And like, they both found out due to, like, the tweet

1918
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,700
and they had they both had no fucking idea.

1919
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:55,780
So the long and short of it is that Daft just pretty much booted them

1920
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:58,100
with without telling them.

1921
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:04,100
Ultimately, I guess I think what happened was that if I like, I don't know.

1922
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:08,460
I mean, I guess like to give Pan like a modicum of credit.

1923
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:13,340
What I assume happened is that he was probably approached by Daft

1924
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:16,820
to run the podcast. He he said yes.

1925
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:21,500
And I think maybe that maybe I have no idea for this for me.

1926
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:26,140
But maybe Daft brought up the suggestion that, oh, I'll tell Izzy about it.

1927
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,020
Like, I'll be the one to break the news to Izzy.

1928
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,580
And Pan was like, all right, dude, yeah, yeah.

1929
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,820
And this is the whole time.

1930
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:35,420
The whole time, like, Daft is trying to send messages to Izzy

1931
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:39,700
and she has like no idea why, because no one told her that he'd be newly in charge.

1932
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:43,220
And then like out of out of nowhere, they were dropped.

1933
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,820
Without fucking realizing this is so stupid.

1934
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,020
This is so stupid. I'm sorry.

1935
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,100
I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to give Pan any credit.

1936
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,220
Like, what the fuck is wrong with everyone in this?

1937
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:55,220
Like, I'm sorry, if you're if you're if you're pan in the situation

1938
01:27:55,220 --> 01:28:00,260
and you have any fucking fucking integrity or a fucking cell in your fucking brain,

1939
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,740
you hear about this and you go, oh, what the fuck?

1940
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,940
Why did you do that? Well, Daft, get out.

1941
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:08,180
You know, you you.

1942
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:10,060
Yeah, I told you you could take over the podcast,

1943
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,140
but I didn't think you were going to kick the host.

1944
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,340
Obviously, you can't do that. Leave.

1945
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,300
Undo undo everything that has been done.

1946
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:22,820
It's my podcast and I and I'm like, like, oops, made a mistake.

1947
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:25,580
Let's let's hit the reset button on it.

1948
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:28,660
I don't know, unless he didn't want to do the podcast anymore, for some reason.

1949
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:31,380
Like, why does any of this mean that I have ownership?

1950
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,460
Yeah, I won't do the labor, but I will make the decision.

1951
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:37,180
I think sure pan ironically is like, hold on.

1952
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,660
Like I was I was thinking about it over.

1953
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:41,940
And I was looking back to all the times

1954
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:43,340
I was thinking back to all the times

1955
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,340
Pan said he doesn't care about this podcast.

1956
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:49,060
And at the time I was thinking, oh, that's why he's so nonchalant

1957
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,940
about the podcast, because he doesn't care.

1958
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:56,260
But maybe what he actually meant was I really don't care at all about the pot.

1959
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,100
Like, yeah, podcasts like this.

1960
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,340
He actually does not.

1961
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,780
Does he actually just not care and not give a fucking out?

1962
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:03,020
Want to do it?

1963
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:06,100
I it's the thing is that if so, then I guess I don't do it.

1964
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,060
I mean, he just he just does it ultimately.

1965
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:13,980
And and then the thing is that like the thing that I don't know.

1966
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:18,420
I think that like, I think that got a bunch of shit, too,

1967
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:22,060
because everyone everyone figured out easily about the whole just stop video

1968
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,460
and how like, oh, obviously, that is fucking pulling the strings here, right?

1969
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,780
And then just stop clarified.

1970
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:31,460
And then like Veronica drops her version of the video and she's all like, oh, yeah,

1971
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:36,420
that is like the cynical little asshole who's like always trying to manipulate shit.

1972
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:37,060
Right.

1973
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:40,580
And just like all these things like dumped on the same week for Daph.

1974
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:42,860
And Daph was getting so much bad press press.

1975
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:47,660
If you look at the last Twitter post that Daph made, where he talks about

1976
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:51,140
because his recent video was he did like he did a video about the A.I.

1977
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:52,580
Seinfeld thing. Yeah.

1978
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:55,180
And the majority of people in the comments are replying with.

1979
01:29:56,620 --> 01:30:00,700
They were playing with that one picture of Quagmire and Brian having dinner.

1980
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,740
And they're all like, they're all like spamming that image to Daph

1981
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:10,900
because in Veronica's video, she she sent that image to Daph to make fun of him

1982
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:14,020
because she was trying to say, oh, you're Brian in this picture.

1983
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:17,420
Yes. And and and Daph got really mad about that.

1984
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:20,540
So everyone's just spamming that to him. Right.

1985
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,060
You are the soy jack. You are the Brian.

1986
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:26,060
And and ultimately.

1987
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:30,220
I'm looking here at the end of like Izzy's whole post about.

1988
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:33,740
About Pan. I mean, I mean, some.

1989
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:37,300
Pan Pan owns the whole operation.

1990
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,780
All Pan would have to do is just say.

1991
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:41,580
We'll just keep doing it.

1992
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,700
We like never mind.

1993
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:45,380
We'll just keep doing the pizza party podcast as before.

1994
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:47,740
There's literally nothing stopping him from just doing that.

1995
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:51,260
I think so. I guess he just doesn't want to, which is fine.

1996
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,980
I guess.

1997
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,700
Yeah, I'm going to call this now.

1998
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,460
I'm going to call this now.

1999
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:59,660
They're going to reboot the podcast again because I'm looking at

2000
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:02,540
like people talking about the new lineup and everyone says that.

2001
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:09,220
Oh, this Dumsville guy who's like mango, who's like Pan's boyfriend friend.

2002
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:10,820
This guy called Dumsville.

2003
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:13,180
He apparently has like a pretty bad history.

2004
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:18,300
So he like he's probably going to get in some drama or some shit or someone else.

2005
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,420
No, it's just so like.

2006
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:22,020
Well, it was I don't know. It's so funny.

2007
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:25,620
Like they said, OK, the podcast is rebooted with a new cast.

2008
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,620
And then, OK, no, never mind.

2009
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:30,740
The new the rebooted podcast is now we're rebooting it again.

2010
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:32,300
But now with my boyfriend.

2011
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,500
Oh, never mind.

2012
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,740
No, OK, that's not the pizza.

2013
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,900
That's actually a new podcast with a different name,

2014
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:39,060
but it's still with the new cast with my boyfriend.

2015
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,580
OK, now that's canceled.

2016
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:42,540
And now we're going to we're going to go back.

2017
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:44,020
I don't know. Do you think they're just going to go back?

2018
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:46,220
What I want to know is where's the podcast?

2019
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:50,100
Wait, in all of this, in all of this, the question nobody's answering.

2020
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:52,660
Where's the fucking podcast?

2021
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,740
It keeps moving.

2022
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:57,100
It's finally happening. If finally we lost it, we lost it for good.

2023
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,700
There's no I mean, I'll say, I'll say this,

2024
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:03,060
the podcast is probably going to keep existing as long as like and and like

2025
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:05,340
Manga are dating, OK?

2026
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,700
But that's not that's not the pizza party podcast.

2027
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:10,180
That's the P3. That's a PPP.

2028
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,900
It's the P3.

2029
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,940
It's the P3 podcast.

2030
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:14,780
It's a nightmare.

2031
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,020
It's a fucking nightmare.

2032
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:18,580
The podcast is harder to find and more elusive than ever.

2033
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:20,940
I'll I'll say this.

2034
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:22,340
I'm kind of.

2035
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:26,700
Um, oh, the podcast melted

2036
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:30,140
into my pillow and all the gathered

2037
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:34,420
I'm not really saying I'm not really looking forward

2038
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:37,060
to this new podcast if you couldn't tell.

2039
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:41,820
But that being said, like the thing is that because like, look,

2040
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:45,500
I'm like very neutral with everybody on this.

2041
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:50,300
OK, even even someone like even like Mango, I think I think they're they're right.

2042
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:52,860
They're like they're whatever.

2043
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,180
They they seem chill again.

2044
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:55,340
I've talked to them in the DMs.

2045
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,660
They seem chill enough.

2046
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:02,820
That being said, I have listened to Mango Mango talk on like on like Twitter

2047
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:08,900
spaces and he mostly just talks about all the all all the sex that he's having

2048
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,460
with Pan. That's funny.

2049
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:14,620
I mean, whenever I whenever I briefly followed Mango unfollowed him

2050
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:18,020
because he was annoying, like most of his posts are just about how he's

2051
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:20,380
Pan's boyfriend and I just find that insufferable.

2052
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:24,140
That's I'm pretty sure that's what it's going to he's going to be like

2053
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:28,020
on this podcast, which is like, oh, God, I'm not I look forward to this.

2054
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,940
Awesome. That I'm going to keep commenting, though.

2055
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:37,060
No, Jim, no, watch on the new episodes, because I still think that's super funny.

2056
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:39,140
And I need it. I seriously needed to catch on.

2057
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,860
I you know what? You know what?

2058
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,100
Maybe I'll maybe I'll stop by and maybe I'll drop it.

2059
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,780
No, Jim, no, Izzy, no, watch.

2060
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:49,300
No, Jim, no, Izzy, no, Ken, no, no, no, no, watch, no, no, no, watch.

2061
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,100
Yeah. No, darling, bring it back.

2062
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:54,860
He's he's he's he's now a little bit less controversial than daffy.

2063
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:57,220
No, bring it back. Free our boy.

2064
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,020
Oh, God, it's it's epic.

2065
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:02,100
It's it's great.

2066
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:08,940
You know, it's all all my podcasts are changing before my eyes, you know, it's funny.

2067
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,500
Oh, you know what?

2068
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,700
Gibb, I was trying to build a website.

2069
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:19,620
I was trying to build I was I was building a little website on my computer.

2070
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,020
There's not much to it.

2071
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:26,620
It's pretty much just like a page with like a list of links

2072
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:30,020
to like download the episodes.

2073
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,700
Oh, yeah, the MP3 use.

2074
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,540
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

2075
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:38,540
I'm kind of just envisioning that like the PCP website will just be like a landing page

2076
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:41,500
with just like two columns.

2077
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:46,820
And on the left is all the PCP episode MP3s listed in like reverse chronological order.

2078
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:50,020
And if you want to listen to the latest one, you just click the top one and it downloads

2079
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:56,020
and on the right side is, you know, the the to soon to be filled

2080
01:34:56,740 --> 01:35:01,740
list of a perfect, perfect comic parties, PDFs, and you download them

2081
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:05,500
and like not much else to it, really.

2082
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:10,860
I think that's kind of my vision for the the the the PCP website.

2083
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:16,180
Just simple hub, just a simple hub for our content.

2084
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:19,060
Yeah, imagine that.

2085
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:23,860
Anyway, simple and clean, simple and clean and gay.

2086
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:27,100
And the way the way it should be tonight.

2087
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,820
That song. I'm hard. Yes.

2088
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:34,860
You know, it's I've always found it so I've always found it so weird

2089
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:40,060
that that song is about like it's about like, yeah, it's about like red flags

2090
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:44,020
in a relationship and like hesitancy to commit and like uncertainty

2091
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:48,900
in a game that's like thematically just about like love and friendship are good.

2092
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,940
And we love love and friendship so much.

2093
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,500
Isn't that weird?

2094
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,700
It is weird. I think it is.

2095
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:59,420
I always thought that like the lyrics of that song, like I love the tune of it.

2096
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,820
I love the song, but the lyrics of it are like

2097
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:06,780
weirdly like mature and like morally gray and ambiguous

2098
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,460
compared to the content of the game.

2099
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:11,820
It's OK. It's a Japanese game.

2100
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:14,340
And I kids, kids don't listen to lyrics.

2101
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:18,900
Ever. That's that's true.

2102
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,900
When I was in when I was in elementary school,

2103
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:25,140
the two most popular songs were about like jizzing,

2104
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,380
like just coming on on women.

2105
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,980
What are you fucking talking about?

2106
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,580
What the fuck are you talking about?

2107
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,100
Wait, you don't know.

2108
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:33,180
You don't know little fuck.

2109
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:34,180
You don't know little John.

2110
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:37,380
Ah, ski, ski, ski, ski, ski, ski, ski. Oh, wait.

2111
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,380
And oh, wait, no, that's true.

2112
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:40,500
You're absolutely right.

2113
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,420
And then and then the other one. My balls.

2114
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:45,300
That one, the other the other classic one

2115
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:49,020
was a daddy Yankees, a gasolina,

2116
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:52,740
which was about like a woman who loves it when you come a lot on her.

2117
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,460
I don't even know that one.

2118
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:56,380
Oh, that's a little bit.

2119
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:57,380
That's a little bit too.

2120
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,740
That's a little bit too ethnic for you. Honkies, huh?

2121
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:01,460
I would say, yeah.

2122
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:03,020
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

2123
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,140
That's what I was going to say.

2124
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:07,860
You got caught. I don't like he's too black sounding for me.

2125
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:08,780
I don't like singers.

2126
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:11,580
You got you got got copy and white again.

2127
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,660
Because of 4K on 4K.

2128
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:16,620
Oops, got him.

2129
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,900
Ben saying copy and white again.

2130
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:21,500
Don't you like don't you like that part in American Psycho

2131
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,660
where Patrick Bateman is racist?

2132
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:24,740
It was pretty good.

2133
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,740
I want to get a T-shirt of Pat.

2134
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,820
I might just make this T-shirt myself and sell it.

2135
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:32,180
Where and because I feel like this would be a really good T-shirt to wear

2136
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:35,340
nowadays because the Jewish community needs it.

2137
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,820
But it's that's the quote.

2138
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:40,300
Why is I like, well, well, cool, cool with the anti-semitic remarks.

2139
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,380
Just on a show with the anti-semitic remarks.

2140
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,700
OK, and it'll be a picture of Christian Bale.

2141
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,980
I don't have a yarmulke like, oh, cool with the anti-semitic remarks.

2142
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:51,300
Yeah. Only he should be only he should be a goblin.

2143
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:55,660
He plays a goblin.

2144
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:57,780
I heard that.

2145
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:02,140
Because in the original obligatory Patrick and Naidman,

2146
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:07,620
but I heard that in the fucking new Hogwarts,

2147
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,820
I almost called the new J.K. Rowling Patrick,

2148
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:12,780
Patrick Bateman would have would have Ray Patrick Bateman would have raided my stream.

2149
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:16,460
He would have.

2150
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,220
I heard in the new Harry Potter game,

2151
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:22,740
there's even more like Jewish comparisons to the bad guys are goblins.

2152
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:25,180
They're there a while ago.

2153
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:27,420
It's a goblin rebellion.

2154
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,940
OK, OK, there's a goblin rebellion.

2155
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:35,500
And I know that there's that horn that is supposedly similar to like a Jewish horn.

2156
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,260
That is described in the game as just being like annoying.

2157
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:40,220
They have horns.

2158
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,940
Have you been watching much more at Ben?

2159
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,220
No, no, no, no.

2160
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,500
Like a musical horn like oblivion.

2161
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,660
You don't watch curvy enthusiasm.

2162
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:51,660
There's a whole episode where Larry David is giving the Jewish horn

2163
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:53,500
that calls all the Jews when he sounds it.

2164
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,180
Is the real that's a real episode.

2165
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:59,060
That's a real. OK, OK,

2166
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,020
for I from what I've heard,

2167
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,820
I know that like the center of the of the plot is yes,

2168
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:06,500
it's about like the goblins have a rebellion.

2169
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:09,980
But I've also heard that there's sort of a twist at the end.

2170
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:12,140
And like, it turns out the goblins were framed,

2171
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,180
like the goblins are actually not bad.

2172
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:18,100
They're being like framed or manipulated into doing something, whatever they're doing.

2173
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,500
Also, OK, that star.

2174
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:27,460
I know the reason that's there is because this scene was just filmed

2175
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:32,060
in like a real building and that's just what the floor of the building that they I know.

2176
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,340
It was a real bank. It was a real bank.

2177
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:36,300
So you're saying it's real.

2178
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:39,980
You are J.Q.ing right now, Ben, by saying what?

2179
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:42,140
No, what? No.

2180
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:46,220
Got it. Listen, I'm just listen.

2181
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:48,300
I'm just trying to I'm just defending J.K. Rowling.

2182
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,740
OK, I'm just saying I'm just saying she's good, actually.

2183
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,460
I'm just saying I listen.

2184
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,940
I might like a lot of important things to say about women.

2185
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:58,220
Obviously, they just picked a bank and probably didn't even think about it.

2186
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:59,420
And that's how I got in there.

2187
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:03,380
And it's just really they probably probably no one was even thinking

2188
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:07,340
about the whole, you know, of a drawing of I mean, it's enough.

2189
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:12,740
I don't think it's it's honestly enough that like the bankers of the wizarding world

2190
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:16,020
are the goblins described as they are in the book.

2191
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:20,740
It's like the comparisons, the sort of like.

2192
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:24,620
I could. Yeah, you know, you know, what this is.

2193
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,500
Yeah, did you have to read it like this way?

2194
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,740
You know what I think this is?

2195
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:30,580
OK, it's what what you were saying at the cheesy.

2196
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:34,580
You were saying about how was it Grant Morrison?

2197
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:38,060
Alan Moore is Alan Alan Moore.

2198
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:43,180
Like even he, despite being like against, you know, he sort of falls into the.

2199
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:45,620
Yeah, he sort of falls into the tropes.

2200
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,700
I don't know. I think that's what that's what this goblin thing is.

2201
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:52,100
It's like, yeah, the goblins do look like an anti-semitic stereotype.

2202
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:55,020
And it's not like anyone set out deliberately to make them that way.

2203
01:40:55,220 --> 01:41:00,020
It's just like our cultural conception of a greedy part of a greedy banker.

2204
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:03,580
Is like so inextricably tied to that that image.

2205
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:05,740
You know, that kind of came out that. Yeah.

2206
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:08,500
That kind of reminds me of, you know, the game,

2207
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,660
Peaks the Tower that came out, by the way, great game.

2208
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,180
There was a character. I know what you're going to say.

2209
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:14,900
I saw I saw the I saw the picture.

2210
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,180
There was a character called Mr.

2211
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:19,300
Pinch and people were saying this is like anti-semitic caricature.

2212
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:22,940
And it's you know, it's so annoying when like people hear that and they say,

2213
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:25,620
like, oh, actually, you're anti-semitic because you say it looks like a Jew.

2214
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:27,820
And it's like, no, we're not saying it looks like a fucking Jew.

2215
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:29,860
We're saying it looks like a Jewish stereotype idiot.

2216
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,540
There's those are two different things.

2217
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,980
That being said, someone said, like, Mr. Pinch.

2218
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:37,380
Yeah, I'm going to find an image of Mr. Pinch posting right now.

2219
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:39,740
But anyway, everyone was everyone was saying

2220
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:43,100
he's actually based on Ebenezer Scrooge from the Christmas Carol, right?

2221
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,380
I looked up the name Ebenezer.

2222
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:46,900
It's a Jewish name.

2223
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:49,060
So that makes me think like God.

2224
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:52,420
And like Carousel's Carol is like, even even chickens.

2225
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,500
Yeah, even chickens couldn't.

2226
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,020
Yeah, because it's like there's all these like subtle things that like we

2227
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,500
like people are saying, oh, it's OK.

2228
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,380
It's not anti-semitic is based on Ebenezer Scrooge.

2229
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:03,820
And it's like, well, Ebenezer Scrooge himself is anti-semitic.

2230
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,740
It kind of a character, right?

2231
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:07,660
You can't cancel Dickens.

2232
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,420
I mean, think about it.

2233
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:10,300
He's a rich guy who doesn't celebrate Christmas.

2234
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,780
Oh, gee, whiz. I wonder who it was. Oh, my God.

2235
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,420
Oh, my God. He was there.

2236
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:20,660
He was there at Golgotha, it's nailing our savior to the cross.

2237
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:23,100
It was him. It's all these subtle things.

2238
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:26,100
It's just so yeah, it's just in serious.

2239
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:28,140
You got to question everything, you know, like.

2240
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:33,260
I like my main question is not like in like in like the like the fucking

2241
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:36,380
early 2000s or late 90s or whatever, when they filmed the first Harry Potter

2242
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:38,820
movie, were they like intentionally doing that?

2243
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:41,860
You know, I think it is like you said, like they just they just went with the

2244
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:43,500
tropes and didn't think about it.

2245
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:48,220
What it what confuses me is that after all the discourse in current year

2246
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:51,620
where people are thinking about this shit and people are like aware of this shit,

2247
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:56,340
why would they then in the new game that just came out, give the goblins

2248
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,700
a musical instrument that looks like a traditional, you know, Jewish thing?

2249
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:03,700
That's the that's the spicy question that I'm wondering.

2250
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,860
Don't I don't know.

2251
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:12,220
It's like you could say, I mean, it is true that it's like it's

2252
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:17,300
culturally like passed down unconscious biases that we just don't really think

2253
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:20,700
about J.K. Rowling had that when she designed the goblins the way they did.

2254
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:25,580
But it's also like, oh, and she just turned out to be a massive bigot as well.

2255
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:29,100
In a different way, it's right now.

2256
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:32,220
Right, you know, I like to believe

2257
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,380
because she was neoliberal the whole time.

2258
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,180
That's why, you know, the huge Neolib.

2259
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:44,780
Like, I, you know, even like I want to fucking even like I'll say it even

2260
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:49,100
like in villain verse, I have like very kind of unconscious things like the main

2261
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:52,780
character is this goblin guy and he's like the source of all evil, right?

2262
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:55,180
And it's like, damn, like what?

2263
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:57,780
Like, because the thing is, I love is the villain Jewish.

2264
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:02,740
The villain isn't Jewish, but he's like part of the original first

2265
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:06,500
like people that showed up on his planet and, you know, that could go back to like,

2266
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:09,540
oh, well, Jews are kind of like the oldest religion almost.

2267
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:16,100
Oh, yeah, I've I've I've seen I've seen the history of history of Earth,

2268
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:20,580
spirit science and I know about the Hebrews coming from Mars or whatever.

2269
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:23,820
And the thing is that he's like a goblin guy who loves gold.

2270
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:24,780
And it's like, oh, my God.

2271
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:28,340
It's the thing is like, I love the villain as a character and I love

2272
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,300
and I love the Jewish people.

2273
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:34,900
Me, me, I, you won't find a bigger, you won't get there.

2274
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,100
And I love Sigma and I love X.

2275
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,900
And I love you won't find a bigger, a bigger

2276
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:43,300
a Hebrew like myself out there.

2277
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:45,100
I'm saying that right now.

2278
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:49,300
I'm a huge ally, you know, I like, look,

2279
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:52,260
if it was up to me, I would have converted to Judaism.

2280
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,940
But, you know, they won't allow it.

2281
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:55,180
They won't let me.

2282
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:56,540
They said, I'm not funny enough.

2283
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,100
You won't give them your foreskin.

2284
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:00,540
They said I'm banned from temple after the incident.

2285
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:02,980
They said I'm not funny enough to be Jewish.

2286
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:05,020
So, you know what? And they know better.

2287
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:06,460
You know, they've been around here the longest.

2288
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:07,460
They know better.

2289
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:11,700
That being said, I I am going to rethink a lot of different things.

2290
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,220
Because I feel like I feel like there's like enough in Villainverse where it's

2291
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:18,220
like, OK, it's it's it's not I'm not trying to be anti-Semitic.

2292
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,980
I just love goblins. I just oh, I love goblins.

2293
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:21,820
Yeah, I love goblins.

2294
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:23,660
I love little green characters.

2295
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:25,860
I think I think, I don't know.

2296
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:29,780
Some some people say that, like, goblins are always anti-Semitic,

2297
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:33,460
no matter what. And like, I think that that can't possibly be true.

2298
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:36,860
I think there's definitely versions of goblins that are OK.

2299
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:39,180
And there's a lineage, but that doesn't necessarily mean

2300
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:42,020
that every depiction is with that intent.

2301
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:44,900
I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to it's just a cultural thing now.

2302
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:46,460
It's it's like a little creature.

2303
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:50,940
Those goblins I see now are just short green woman with huge tits.

2304
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:56,940
And this is how this is how I'm going to redeem the villain is how I'm going to redeem him.

2305
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:59,620
He is going in a future chapter.

2306
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:00,900
And this is this is not a joke.

2307
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:03,620
This is 100 percent not ironic in a future chapter.

2308
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:07,340
I am going to make him mention that he has a foreskin.

2309
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:12,020
Boom. Problem solved.

2310
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:15,300
Like a boy eating pork or something.

2311
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:16,780
And maybe that's how we defeat him.

2312
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:20,860
They tug on his foreskin and he screams, no spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

2313
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:22,180
Have him have him eat pork.

2314
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:26,060
Just just every whenever you can just have him do something that's not kosher.

2315
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:31,460
Yeah, exactly. I'll have him do so much like anti kosher stuff.

2316
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:33,140
And you know what? Let's be honest.

2317
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:36,220
Like a real Jew wouldn't create this massive

2318
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:38,940
galactic operation that the villain would have.

2319
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:41,060
Come on, that's a little too much work. Come on.

2320
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:45,780
Was he didn't he fuck like a giant bug?

2321
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,300
Yeah, he did. Planet.

2322
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:49,100
Does that kosher?

2323
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:51,740
Is that maybe we are.

2324
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:53,500
Is that Haram?

2325
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,900
If I'm going to go, I should, I should go back in time

2326
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:58,060
and redraw that image where we see the villains.

2327
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:00,380
You should have a free Palestine sticker.

2328
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:01,820
Yeah, exactly.

2329
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:05,460
It'll be like, finally, I've collected all the villain balls.

2330
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,220
And I'm like, yeah, free Palestine.

2331
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:12,220
Just just make him like he's like he's the he's the most.

2332
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,260
OK, he's the most evil creature in the world.

2333
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:18,180
But even he there's he's not even he can be completely evil.

2334
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:20,780
He does support Palestinian liberation.

2335
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:22,700
It's the one thing that he's good about.

2336
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,380
And it proves that he's not Jewish also.

2337
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:30,220
And you can be Jewish and hate Israel.

2338
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:32,660
There are two different things.

2339
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:34,420
I don't understand what you're talking about.

2340
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:37,660
We're just we're just trying to do as many anti stereotypes as possible.

2341
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:40,700
That's all we're just. Yeah, we're just trying to be as we're just we're just

2342
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:42,140
trying to be as not Jewish.

2343
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:44,700
We're just trying to be as anti Semitic as possible here,

2344
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:46,540
because we're not every look.

2345
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:48,580
Everything I do, I do it.

2346
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:50,740
I do it for the Jew.

2347
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:53,900
All right, everything I do, I do it for the.

2348
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:57,260
And that's that's not being ironic.

2349
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:00,460
What if no, what if he what if he is circumcised

2350
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:04,620
and he but he just he kept the foreskin and he keeps it like in like a case

2351
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:06,980
and like he has a guy who like goes to the case

2352
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:09,180
and like cleans it off or like display.

2353
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:10,540
He has the most foreskin.

2354
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:13,580
You have you have to you have you have to show it.

2355
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:16,020
You have to show it so that we can see that.

2356
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:18,380
Yes, it is still attached.

2357
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:19,700
It's the only way.

2358
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:21,220
It's the only way I'll figure out a way.

2359
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:23,100
Oh, no, I'll figure out attached.

2360
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:24,460
It would have to still be honest.

2361
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:28,100
You know, speaking of like like little goofy characters.

2362
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:33,420
You know, I'm going to give a pretty brief hot take here.

2363
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:36,900
And this is going to get me like this is going to get me canceled.

2364
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:38,380
We haven't yet.

2365
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:41,900
We haven't we haven't gone far enough on this episode.

2366
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:46,900
I like I really like I think this design is really cute.

2367
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:48,260
But I know.

2368
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:49,740
But I know it's terrible.

2369
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:52,780
It's a terrible design that we should not keep reusing.

2370
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:56,340
And OK, do you guys know what a golly walk is?

2371
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:58,740
You guys know what a golly walk is?

2372
01:48:58,740 --> 01:48:59,340
Golly.

2373
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:01,300
Yes, I know what a golly walk is.

2374
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:05,580
Yeah, it's the dragon quest slime face, but with black face as well.

2375
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:10,460
Yeah, exactly. It's I hate how cute this is, but I know it's terrible.

2376
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,460
And we shouldn't do this at all.

2377
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:15,100
That being said, I see what you mean.

2378
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:16,140
I see what you mean.

2379
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:19,060
I mean, yeah, it is for it is friendly looking.

2380
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:20,380
It is very friendly looking.

2381
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:27,180
It's it's not that that same like the eyes of a black cat sort of sort of face.

2382
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:31,500
It's like there's there's like ways to kind of like redeem this.

2383
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:35,420
It's just don't do the like I feel like once you do the oblivion.

2384
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:38,860
Yeah, I'm kind of with you oblivion.

2385
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:39,940
I've had it. I've had it.

2386
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:43,060
Only when she only when cheesy Manfredo is here,

2387
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:45,860
does imagery like this appear on the PCP.

2388
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:48,900
Yeah, in the chat now.

2389
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:49,900
I'm not.

2390
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:51,540
I'm.

2391
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:53,820
Explain yourself, putting me.

2392
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:55,660
You're putting me on a list, cheesy.

2393
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:59,220
There's this whole there's this whole bit in in Alan Moore's book,

2394
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:01,820
League of Externary Gentlemen, where like, because everything,

2395
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:04,900
every like piece of fiction is canon, one of these guys shows up,

2396
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:07,260
a gollywag shows up, and he's like on the good guy's team.

2397
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,700
He's like a good person.

2398
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:11,260
And at the whole time, I'm thinking like, this is bad.

2399
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:13,820
But I mean, at least he's like a good guy, right?

2400
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:17,660
But then like later in the book, it talks about the lore of the gollywags.

2401
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:21,020
And they're like, oh, there are a race of aliens that were enslaved.

2402
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:24,140
And I'm like, OK, all right, buddy, all right, Mr.

2403
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:27,900
Buddy, look at these these non-humans.

2404
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,820
Oh, God, I hate that so much.

2405
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:33,100
Fucking like League of Externary Gentlemen is kind of like for every

2406
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:38,660
like for every like one step of a progressive direction, it takes like two steps back.

2407
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:42,300
Right. Like, oh, he's shining a light on care.

2408
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:43,460
Oh, there's a trans character.

2409
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:46,860
He's shining a light on like characters that wouldn't have spotlights

2410
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:48,260
in the books that they're in.

2411
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:51,900
Oh, he's like reevaluating like British neoliberalism.

2412
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,460
Oh, it's a commentary on fascism.

2413
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:57,220
Oh, all this stuff, all this stuff about culture is worth keeping.

2414
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:59,060
It's great. It's awesome. It's base.

2415
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:03,420
But then he doesn't really question that maybe some of the imagery we have

2416
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:08,940
of like older like pop culture isn't really worth keeping because it's kind of like.

2417
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:12,020
Like it kind of like stamp.

2418
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:15,220
It kind of like pushes a very like races or bad narrative

2419
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:18,580
because there's like certain kind of like characters that pop up in the book

2420
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:20,660
because it's like, oh, it's all pieces of fiction.

2421
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,220
And it's like, oh, yeah.

2422
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:25,980
And then he has like Fu Manchu as one of the bad guys in the first book.

2423
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:27,900
And it's like, oh, boy.

2424
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:31,780
And yeah, it's a lot of it's a good book, but it's oh, boy.

2425
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:35,060
Speaking, speaking of being base and progressive,

2426
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:40,220
I went to a I went to a protest march rally this week.

2427
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:44,460
Actually, actually, Munchy invited me to come with him.

2428
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:46,740
He alerted me this was going on.

2429
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:47,900
There was a shooting.

2430
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:51,020
There was a police, a quote unquote police involved shooting.

2431
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:56,460
If you know what I mean, a student at UMass

2432
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:00,020
who was cutting himself with a knife.

2433
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:04,820
So like and like cops showed up and he like fled from them

2434
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:10,300
and they pursued him and like cornered him and they say that he lunged at them.

2435
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:15,820
But they who knows if that's true, but they did shoot him and he died.

2436
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:20,580
So it's just assisted dying, you know, it's actually progressive.

2437
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:23,740
If you think they were giving him a hand, they could see he was trying to do

2438
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:26,260
something like, hey, hey, hey, buddy, hey, buddy.

2439
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:28,060
Nina, Nina, help, need a little help.

2440
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:33,420
Cops are terrible and much stronger than cops are terrible at helping you

2441
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:35,060
in any way, except for killing yourself.

2442
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:39,260
They're like, good at that's like the only good at it's like, it's like, OK,

2443
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:43,940
I don't know. I just kind of think that, you know, yes, this guy was having a crisis

2444
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:45,460
and he was cutting himself and he had a knife.

2445
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:50,620
And I kind of think that probably it was likely that nobody would have died

2446
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:53,580
if some dudes with guns hadn't like pulled up in a squad car and been like,

2447
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:57,060
freeze, motherfucker, you get the fuck over here.

2448
01:52:57,580 --> 01:53:00,780
You know, I feel like that probably exacerbated the situation.

2449
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,260
And maybe he would not have perished if not for it.

2450
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:06,220
But we but we'll never know.

2451
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:09,380
So we will never know it's impossible to know it is impossible.

2452
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:11,500
No, we can only speculate.

2453
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:15,460
So we did we did a little march and we yelled we got the, you know,

2454
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:19,420
that's that's what went up in front of the police station, held up a big

2455
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:23,020
portrait of him and said, pop cops, we're not fond of you.

2456
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:25,900
We did it.

2457
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:29,740
You said we said, hey, on why we wish you would research.

2458
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:31,860
We wish you would reconsider your methods.

2459
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:35,460
And then we left.

2460
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:38,420
And that was it. There was.

2461
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:41,340
I just reminded myself, there is this.

2462
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:42,260
Weird YouTuber.

2463
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:43,500
I don't remember his name.

2464
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:47,260
He does like very dry videos, like responding to conservatives on issues

2465
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:50,380
like gay marriage where like there's some guy would be like, well,

2466
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:55,820
a God said this thing and I'm not anti gay.

2467
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:58,820
I'm just anti being gay, you know, some right.

2468
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:02,940
Yeah, yeah, of course, slimy, weasley little argument like that.

2469
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:06,580
And he'll be like, I'm actually and he'll he'll respond with like pretty good points.

2470
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:11,100
But like, you don't know the video, you don't have the name of this dude.

2471
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,580
I could find it.

2472
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:16,100
I it's his name's like free letters or something.

2473
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:18,060
OK, it's very dry.

2474
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:20,980
Like the videos are very like like low effort.

2475
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:24,500
They're not like particularly smart or like engaging.

2476
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:26,300
OK, it's just like background noise.

2477
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:28,740
But one of the videos talking about gay stuff,

2478
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:32,780
every time he mentioned gay marriage, you'd also or like or like, you know,

2479
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:36,900
gay rights, he would say gay rights and euthanasia or assisted dying

2480
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:39,300
or I forget the term he used because I don't know that.

2481
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:42,580
Apparently, apparently there's a politically character.

2482
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:47,340
Oh, is it or is it the Canadian thing made of medical assistance in dying?

2483
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:48,980
Is that it? I don't know.

2484
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:50,940
I don't know. But like the video was about gay rights

2485
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:52,580
and the guy who's responding to is about gay rights.

2486
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:55,460
Like, see, this is why I don't like it when you say this thing

2487
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,460
about gay rights and assisted suicide.

2488
01:54:57,460 --> 01:55:00,340
And he would always like add and assisted suicide

2489
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:03,300
every single time he mentioned gay rights and it was weird.

2490
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,420
I'm like, what does this video have to do with that?

2491
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:09,820
And also also, why aren't you mentioning the issues

2492
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:13,020
with assisted suicide being a thing under capitalism

2493
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:16,020
where people would be pressured into any of their lives over their

2494
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:19,740
like medical bills and other shit in recent like months?

2495
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:23,900
I've seen I've seen it talked about that, like, I guess there was a thing

2496
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:29,020
in Canada was doing, yeah, like, like the Canadian government was giving,

2497
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:32,780
like, yeah, assistance, suicide assistance to people.

2498
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:36,340
And like some people were saying they were like pressuring people,

2499
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:38,540
like poor people into committing suicide.

2500
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:40,820
That was the story I was I was seeing.

2501
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:42,580
I don't I haven't really looked into it.

2502
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:45,380
But that's just the word on the street and the grapevine.

2503
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:47,420
That's what I mean.

2504
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:49,420
I mean, I have to take these memories of a grain of salt

2505
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:52,980
because it is my parents who are very conservative.

2506
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:56,300
But like when my dad like spoke out against what would like

2507
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:58,860
because me and my dad used to drive me places and we'd just talk about

2508
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:00,980
philosophy and ethics and other stuff.

2509
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:02,940
And he was a pretty smart guy on most things.

2510
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:07,380
Like the stuff he would always mention is like, yeah, like the issue

2511
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:10,580
with it is that like usually when it's being implemented in countries,

2512
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:14,140
like they they'll have like all these safeguards and stuff to make to try

2513
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:17,860
and prevent, you know, people who are poor or people who are just like,

2514
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:22,060
you know, who are suffering because of like, you know, like poverty

2515
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:25,020
or like because of like medical bills or everything, like they'll try

2516
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:29,700
and not have doctors sell you that as the cheaper alternative to getting

2517
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:34,860
like, you know, cured and how that at least according to him,

2518
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:38,220
how that usually doesn't work and it usually gets out of hand.

2519
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:41,260
Like like in fury, like it's a good thing, but like in practice,

2520
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:42,260
it doesn't usually work out.

2521
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:44,300
And you're talking about it was the suicide.

2522
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:45,340
Yes, it's a suicide.

2523
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:49,540
So I at the time I figured, oh, well, it's just universally bad.

2524
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:53,740
And I realized, oh, well, most of the problems with it are probably due to capitalism.

2525
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:59,300
Yeah, but like, you know, like I wouldn't want that in America

2526
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:03,740
right now where if someone's like, oh, do you want $50,000 of medical debt

2527
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:04,980
or you can just kill yourself?

2528
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:09,180
Like I wouldn't want to, I would want to, you know, between the two issues

2529
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:12,500
to solve there, I'd rather solve the debt problem than just to be like,

2530
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,260
ah, nah, nah, nah, bro.

2531
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:18,700
Just just like, yeah, but I don't know.

2532
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:20,860
I thought it was weird that this video just kept mentioning that

2533
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:22,260
in conjunction with gay rights.

2534
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:25,740
So this is this is the guy who was supposedly he like someone else

2535
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:27,020
was being like anti gay.

2536
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:29,540
And this was a guy who was trying to be like pro gay,

2537
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:32,780
but he kept like mentioning the suicide of the why.

2538
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:33,420
Yeah, why?

2539
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:37,780
I don't I don't get it was just out of what I feel like subliminal messages.

2540
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:40,140
What's that?

2541
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:45,100
I'm like, it's really important that gay people are allowed to be gay

2542
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,740
and also kill themselves and also you're allowed to kill yourself.

2543
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:50,580
And they can also kill themselves.

2544
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:54,860
Them specifically for gay people to be able to do that and and serve.

2545
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:58,700
I want I just I love gay people and that's why I want them to be able

2546
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:01,540
to serve in the military and kill themselves.

2547
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:05,180
And that's it, nothing else.

2548
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:09,220
I want those two rights for them and no others, please.

2549
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:13,780
Amazing.

2550
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:16,020
Well, yeah, very mysterious, very baffling.

2551
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:20,540
What's was that kind of one video that kind of someone uploaded

2552
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:23,380
at the start of like the BLM protests like two years ago

2553
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:29,020
where this guy was like screaming and yelling and he seemed to be pro BLM.

2554
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:32,140
But he's unironically said like, yeah, yeah, like, you know, all,

2555
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:35,140
you know, like, you know, Black Lives do matter, you know, like it doesn't

2556
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:36,020
matter what race you are.

2557
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:39,700
We all could like be a stupid N word with a hard R and people were like,

2558
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:41,020
whoa, whoa, what the fuck?

2559
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

2560
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:45,740
You thought he was being you thought he was cool, but then he fooled you.

2561
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:48,060
Well, he has he has the right energy.

2562
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:51,420
His language just isn't it gives it appropriate, buddy.

2563
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:52,620
Sure.

2564
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:56,660
You like you like black people, but that's very nice.

2565
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:58,380
Oh, oh, hot dog.

2566
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:00,660
Oh, all right.

2567
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,780
I'm going to get canceled and like I have not seen.

2568
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:04,460
I've not seen the video in question.

2569
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:06,420
I don't think I'm going to get him.

2570
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:10,340
Daphne is going to mention this podcast in the cheesy takedown video.

2571
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:12,500
Well, he fucking better.

2572
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:13,820
He's going to be like, oh, yeah.

2573
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:15,180
Yeah, we need the views.

2574
01:59:15,180 --> 01:59:16,500
If Daphne. Yeah.

2575
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:19,860
Yeah, like, please, please, please cancel us, Daphne, please.

2576
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:22,660
If he if he wanted to cancel you,

2577
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:27,220
he would probably say Cheesy Manfredo is

2578
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:32,860
evil because he made a comic that says that famous people on Twitter are bad.

2579
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:35,580
And I'm a famous person on Twitter and I'm a big Twitter artist.

2580
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:38,980
And he was a jerk and he said rich people are bad

2581
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:42,700
and people with lots of followers are bad and that offended me.

2582
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:46,540
And that would be his main complaint about you, I think.

2583
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:49,460
That's epic in my in my opinion.

2584
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:54,460
He Cheesy said the Galway was pretty cute.

2585
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:56,020
But I said it was cute.

2586
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:56,820
He said it was cute.

2587
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:59,340
Pretty kawaii. It's but it's racist.

2588
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:01,540
So is Cheesy racism?

2589
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:03,300
Is Cheesy saying that racism is cute?

2590
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:04,020
I don't think so.

2591
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:07,460
And then he's going to get like I, Daphne, and actually against racism.

2592
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:09,540
You're going to get like a black content creator,

2593
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:13,620
a black content creator to read like a quote against me.

2594
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:16,860
He's going to get like Barrett Barrettist Joe or something.

2595
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:20,340
He's going to he's going to he's going to he's going to message me

2596
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:22,740
on Discord to be like, Hey, Ben, can I talk to you real quick?

2597
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:24,340
Can I record you? OK, cool.

2598
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:27,380
Hey, what do you think about Cheesy and all say, Oh, Cheesy?

2599
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:28,740
Yeah, I gave that guy.

2600
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:32,420
I gave that guy 800 bucks to have that comic made and he still hasn't made it.

2601
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:34,420
And he'll say, OK, great, got it.

2602
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:38,580
Oh, oh, oh, she's so scam artist.

2603
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:39,940
She's she's a thief.

2604
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:42,460
She's a demon. She's a she's a monster.

2605
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:44,500
Oh, God. Yeah.

2606
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:50,500
No, it's not my fault. It's social media. It's been destroying my mind.

2607
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,560
And the only the only cure is if I get if I get a hundred K followers,

2608
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:58,560
that's the only cure that will fix it. I swear.

2609
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:01,140
There's a hundred. I'll be good.

2610
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:04,940
The saddest thing that I have had to witness recently is

2611
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:10,500
that guy on Twitter, the guy, the autistic guy who is obsessed with

2612
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:14,340
yours six girlfriends being blue Simpsons ninjas.

2613
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:16,140
No, sexy and for free.

2614
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:18,480
You know what I'm talking about? Ben Hughes. Ben Hughes.

2615
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:25,140
He has lately he keeps posting about like how upset he is that he fell under 10,000 followers.

2616
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:27,940
Like he's really bothered about it.

2617
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:30,240
And he keeps posting like, help me.

2618
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:33,240
I'm under like, please get me over 10 and I'm like, ah,

2619
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:36,280
I just hate seeing it every single time.

2620
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:38,920
You should every painful each one of those posts where you saw like,

2621
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:41,420
come on, guys, let's get this guy up back.

2622
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:43,420
Let's get him back to 10 K guys.

2623
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:45,780
What's this? What's his handle?

2624
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:49,220
It's been Ben Hughes something.

2625
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:51,120
Oh, I found it recently.

2626
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:52,580
So sending Ben Hughes to one of my other.

2627
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:54,580
How do you spell Hughes?

2628
02:01:54,580 --> 02:01:56,820
H-U-G-H-E-S.

2629
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:58,320
All the bends on Twitter.

2630
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,020
Oh, yes. We can't trust them.

2631
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:02,580
I think maybe maybe it's not maybe it's just S.

2632
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,580
Huggies. Yeah.

2633
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:08,020
Here, here, I found him.

2634
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:09,220
Oh, I don't follow him.

2635
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:11,720
I'm doing my part.

2636
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:13,680
I followed you. There we go.

2637
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:18,980
Ben Hugg 264-22354.

2638
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:22,420
Yeah, buddy, you already got you already got nine K.

2639
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:23,520
Dude, you're good.

2640
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,520
He was over 10 K for a while.

2641
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,020
And then I guess, you know,

2642
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:29,320
bot accounts being deleted or whatever.

2643
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:33,780
Well, yeah, he's only at like nine nine nine point eight now.

2644
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:34,980
And he hates it.

2645
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:36,520
Well, well, he's so close.

2646
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,180
Well, Ben Hughes, just fucking.

2647
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:40,580
How about you just update your fucking content

2648
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:43,680
as you're posting the same joke over and over again?

2649
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:45,980
You're so epic and cool, dude.

2650
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:48,680
This guy, he's barely getting like 50.

2651
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:51,880
He's getting like under 50 likes on all this guy is epic and cool.

2652
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:54,720
And yes, I love that he posted the same joke over and over again.

2653
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:55,980
And it's not a joke.

2654
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:56,880
It's not a joke.

2655
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:59,320
It's a sincere appreciation of yours.

2656
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:01,780
Six wives, if he's so epic.

2657
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:04,180
Why does he have 10 K?

2658
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:04,880
Yeah, it's true.

2659
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,880
As I thought, I don't know.

2660
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,180
I don't know why Ben Hughes says,

2661
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:10,680
I'll keep focusing on the Simpsons females E.R.

2662
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:12,480
and all the prehistoric animals.

2663
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:14,480
So he's staying the course.

2664
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:17,180
He's not changing up his content to fit the the album.

2665
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:21,180
Fucking Raven follows him.

2666
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:22,980
Damn, Revin, we're going to follow me back.

2667
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:24,280
I saw Raven.

2668
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:27,780
Yeah, Raven did some ninja fan art.

2669
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:28,580
Right.

2670
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:29,980
We're going to follow me back.

2671
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:31,780
I literally agree with everything you say.

2672
02:03:31,780 --> 02:03:32,780
I love your comics.

2673
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:34,280
Was it something I said?

2674
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:36,780
Was it something I said?

2675
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:38,480
Was it something I said?

2676
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,880
Big Twitter artist.

2677
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,080
She was offended.

2678
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:43,680
They they she's she's a big they.

2679
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:45,080
Yeah, they they go by day them.

2680
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:47,580
They are they were offended.

2681
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:49,780
But because they're big and they're bigger than you.

2682
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:50,780
It's going to change.

2683
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:51,980
You can't go saying that.

2684
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:55,780
It's going to change once Mimi already drops extra souls.

2685
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:57,380
Raven's going to be like, oh, written by cheese.

2686
02:03:57,380 --> 02:03:58,580
Manfredo will give.

2687
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:59,580
Oh, give follow.

2688
02:03:59,580 --> 02:04:01,780
Oh, executive produced by Ben St.

2689
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:03,880
Does it mean wait?

2690
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:06,380
Wait, they follow you already, don't they?

2691
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:07,380
I think they did.

2692
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:09,580
And then they like purge their their follows.

2693
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:10,980
And I don't think they follow me anymore.

2694
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:12,180
Oh, oh, no.

2695
02:04:12,180 --> 02:04:12,780
Yeah.

2696
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:14,380
That was like a while ago.

2697
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:15,580
Well, look at bummer.

2698
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:17,180
Let's see who follows Ben.

2699
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:19,580
Well, Juniper follows you.

2700
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:21,380
Juniper does follow me.

2701
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:23,880
I'm not exactly sure why, but I appreciate it.

2702
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,380
Wait, which which Juniper?

2703
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:27,680
The one that invented the worm.

2704
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:28,980
Yeah, the goblin mode.

2705
02:04:28,980 --> 02:04:29,980
Yeah.

2706
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:31,080
What?

2707
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:35,080
Do you DM Juniper and be like, yo, this cheesy Manfredo guy, pretty base.

2708
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:39,980
The person who literally invented, well, popularized the term goblin mode.

2709
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:44,380
Juniper is like the final boss of Twitter.

2710
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:47,880
I was like the ultimate poster.

2711
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:52,980
The only Juniper I know is the Moffy Tuber, who has a cool Eldritch Moff character.

2712
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:57,080
If you don't know Juniper, then I'm sorry, but you just don't have it in your NGMI.

2713
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:00,180
The majority of the people, the majority of the people that follow you.

2714
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:01,380
Juniper is one of those weird names.

2715
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:02,480
It's probably a tree.

2716
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:04,880
I think it is.

2717
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,280
Oh, I just got reminded looking at your follower account.

2718
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:13,480
A Stereo's Coconut is going to have me on on his live stream in March.

2719
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:16,380
I was on a Stereo's live stream.

2720
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:18,280
I saw Stereo's Coconut.

2721
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:19,480
You did a good job.

2722
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:22,780
I educated him on the history of that guy with the glasses.

2723
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:24,580
A Stereo's.

2724
02:05:24,580 --> 02:05:29,680
Like, so back in, I think back in November, I gave him a Stereo's and I tell him,

2725
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:32,980
hey, a Stereo's, do you know about the Blueie fandom?

2726
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:35,980
Like the adult Blueie fandom that's growing.

2727
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:38,380
And he's all like, no, so good.

2728
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:39,980
I said, no, tell me.

2729
02:05:39,980 --> 02:05:40,580
You tell me.

2730
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:42,180
He's like, no, tell me more.

2731
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:46,880
Well, I basically explained to I gave like a brief summary of what the Blueie adult

2732
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,280
fandom is like, because I like Blueie.

2733
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:57,180
Yeah, but but my partner is a massive, massive Blueie head.

2734
02:05:57,380 --> 02:06:01,880
Actually, they were like on the ground floor when the when the fandom first started

2735
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:02,780
like two years ago.

2736
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:03,780
Jesus.

2737
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:05,880
Yeah, two years ago.

2738
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:06,680
It started.

2739
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:11,680
So I've been witnessing firsthand like the Blueie phenomenon like right here

2740
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:12,880
in my bedroom.

2741
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:15,080
That's sickening.

2742
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:16,280
That's sickening.

2743
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:16,980
I hate it.

2744
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:20,680
No, no, look, look, look, it's fine.

2745
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:22,180
It's not fine.

2746
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:22,780
It's Ben.

2747
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:24,180
Ben can't imagine Ben.

2748
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:29,980
Can imagine imagine being into a show for little kids like imagine.

2749
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:32,380
Imagine like I'm sorry, an adult.

2750
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:36,280
I'm sorry, a fandom, a group of people that come together around shared

2751
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:38,980
appreciation for a cartoon for children.

2752
02:06:38,980 --> 02:06:41,380
What is society?

2753
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:42,580
What is happening to society?

2754
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:45,580
You know, back in my day, this wouldn't have happened back in my day.

2755
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:49,580
You know what we would do if we found out that someone was into a little kid show?

2756
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:50,280
Mm hmm.

2757
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:51,280
Oh, yeah, we draft them.

2758
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:52,480
We would send them to Nam.

2759
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:56,680
We tie him, tie him, tie him to the back of a car and we just and we just go to

2760
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,080
town, just hit the gas.

2761
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:00,280
Australians, a loving family.

2762
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:03,080
I could never support such a thing as Ben.

2763
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:07,180
So I sent that to a stereo's back in November.

2764
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:10,680
The stereo's did not reply into two months later.

2765
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:14,280
Oh, and out of out of nowhere, he replies and says, hello.

2766
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:16,080
Yeah, I'm going to read for all this now.

2767
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:17,580
Oh, wow, this sounds great.

2768
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:19,080
You want to come on my live stream?

2769
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:20,180
Let's talk about it.

2770
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:21,980
And I'm like, yeah, sure.

2771
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:22,380
I'm down.

2772
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:25,180
And then, um, yeah, so we set a date.

2773
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:26,280
It's going to be like in March.

2774
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:29,780
Um, he added me about when the date is going to be.

2775
02:07:30,580 --> 02:07:35,080
Um, I know everyone's going to forget the date because this is like in fucking March.

2776
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:41,380
Most most PCP fans forget everything they heard once they're done with an episode.

2777
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:42,180
Mm hmm.

2778
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:43,080
Yeah, real dummies.

2779
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:46,180
Those guys, real, real, real little funny fellas.

2780
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:46,480
Okay.

2781
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:53,480
March 26, March 26, like at seven p.m.

2782
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:54,880
East coast time, I think.

2783
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:55,680
All right.

2784
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:56,680
Well, reminding.

2785
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:58,780
Yeah, I won't remember.

2786
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:01,680
He says live stream with the clown fucking guy.

2787
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:04,680
That's me in case the clown fucking guy.

2788
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:06,680
Yeah, that's about right.

2789
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:13,780
After after McPuglatchy, um, I'm going to double down on that that like monster.

2790
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:14,980
You're going to be double that.

2791
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:16,280
Yeah, double down to clown.

2792
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:17,580
Double down to clown.

2793
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:21,780
I actually have, I actually had a genius idea for another clown porn comic.

2794
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:23,780
And oh my God.

2795
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:25,980
Now, is that going to be clown milk too?

2796
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:28,780
I still have to, there's still a couple of things in the background.

2797
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:29,880
I have to fix up.

2798
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:31,680
There's a couple of lives.

2799
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:35,580
I, there's a couple of friendships and lives that have to rebuild in the background.

2800
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:41,880
You have to ruin to get to get that back to get that ship running again.

2801
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:46,580
I had an idea for a clown porn that would have just been a solo comic.

2802
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:50,680
Um, then I could make a joke about being like, I only make two types of clown

2803
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:54,280
found comics like serious comics and porn.

2804
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:57,180
That's the two genres of clowns for me.

2805
02:08:58,080 --> 02:09:00,280
Um, that's going to be out.

2806
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:05,380
I don't fucking know when, but I am going to double down on the monster manual.

2807
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:06,280
Did I tell you about that?

2808
02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:11,780
But the, the monster, the gimmick was like, oh, this is a monster.

2809
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:14,680
The monster manual for a video game that doesn't exist.

2810
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:18,380
Like, oh, yeah, you might have mentioned that before.

2811
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:18,780
Yeah.

2812
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:22,380
Like, like we were going to, we're going to be like, yo, we, uh, we built a machine

2813
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:26,380
that pulled out this monster manual for what would have been a Super Nintendo

2814
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:28,580
game at the game.

2815
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:31,880
The game doesn't exist in our reality, but we have the monster manual.

2816
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:35,880
And I've been kind of like thinking about it like slowly, like, oh, maybe I

2817
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:39,680
should, I, I'm going to try to do some like, uh, Super Nintendo research to see

2818
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:43,680
like, what are the limits of the system to see how accurate we could get?

2819
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:47,080
Like our like monster manual would be to an actual video game.

2820
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:47,580
Right.

2821
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:48,980
Yeah.

2822
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:49,380
Yeah.

2823
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:49,780
Yeah.

2824
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:50,380
Interesting.

2825
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:52,880
I think, I think people will, will dig, will dig that.

2826
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:54,180
It seems like enough.

2827
02:09:54,180 --> 02:09:55,480
And I'm going to do with a, okay.

2828
02:09:56,280 --> 02:10:01,980
I was, I was, I was talking, talking to my friend, uh, Dwoob yesterday about

2829
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:06,480
this artist called, um, Alex Dejan or Deegan.

2830
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:07,380
Do you know who that is?

2831
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:09,480
You ever, you ever heard of Alex Dejan?

2832
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:12,580
Alex Dejan, D E G E N.

2833
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:20,680
Um, he, he made a comic called, uh, soft X-ray mind hunters and he

2834
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:25,280
sometimes works with, uh, the catamites, which is who is the guy who made

2835
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:30,080
space funeral and he makes lots of other weird, uh, uh, indie games.

2836
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:32,280
Um, but he, okay.

2837
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:37,780
Soft X-ray mind hunters is like a wordless, like sci-fi, like fantasy thing

2838
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:40,780
about these guys, like going through all these like weird, like dream

2839
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:44,380
universes, like fine, they have to, they have to hunt down these brains

2840
02:10:44,380 --> 02:10:45,780
and like destroy them basically.

2841
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,880
Oh, this looks cool.

2842
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:48,080
It's really cool.

2843
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:49,080
But he all, okay.

2844
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:52,580
He, he does, uh, he's done a bunch of things that are, what you just said

2845
02:10:52,580 --> 02:10:53,280
reminds me of them.

2846
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:57,480
They'll, he has another book called, uh, I think it's called the Martian War

2847
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:02,880
library and the Martian War library is, it's not really a comic.

2848
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:09,880
It's a book of, they're drawings of like magazine covers or like comic book

2849
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:11,180
covers and there's no comic.

2850
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:15,580
There's just the covers, but it's just a series of covers of what is presumably

2851
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:19,580
an in-universe comic and there sort of is a story that's told like through the

2852
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:23,480
progression of the covers of these comics that don't exist about this character

2853
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:25,180
card Martian called Martian War.

2854
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:26,080
Yeah.

2855
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:27,780
And, um, that's cool.

2856
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:31,480
Doob showed me another, uh, older book of his that I'd never seen before

2857
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:34,480
yesterday and it was, um, it was a similar thing.

2858
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:39,280
It was just illustrations of these like, it was like a team of like, uh, child

2859
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:44,580
sleuth geniuses doing like solving crimes and like finding mummies and stuff.

2860
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:50,080
And it was like, just like sort of a, not really like a story, just like a

2861
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:56,280
series of images depicting these characters in this, in scenes.

2862
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:58,180
That's, that's really cool.

2863
02:11:58,380 --> 02:11:59,680
Yeah, he's good.

2864
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:00,680
He's soft.

2865
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:04,280
I think I've probably talked about soft x-ray mind hunters at least once

2866
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:07,580
before, but it's a really good comic and it's, and it's big.

2867
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:12,080
It's a big book and it's quite long and wordless and the illustrations are really

2868
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:12,480
nice.

2869
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:19,180
Yeah, that's, um, I, I've been, um, I've been like, I just, I haven't bought it.

2870
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:23,480
I only maybe bought two new comics like last year because I've been so

2871
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:29,680
focused on working and also I, I got into a very expensive hobby, which is

2872
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:35,280
um, action figures, but buying a lot of those, like a little, like a little

2873
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:36,380
fucking man child.

2874
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:40,880
But, um, it is very, I've been, um, yeah.

2875
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:41,880
Man, chill, chill.

2876
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:47,580
It is very man-shilderness, but like the, the, the, the star fire, the fire star

2877
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:52,280
figure that I have just like activates a sexual urge inside of me so I can't,

2878
02:12:52,580 --> 02:12:55,580
can't help myself when I look at it, right?

2879
02:12:56,380 --> 02:12:57,580
Yeah, this looks really cool.

2880
02:12:57,780 --> 02:12:58,580
I like this a lot.

2881
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:04,780
I'm reminded about like, I, I kind of have like a, um, for the monster manual

2882
02:13:04,780 --> 02:13:10,480
we're doing, I'm actually working on it with, uh, my buddy, uh, Kizuchu, who's

2883
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:12,780
in your, oh, Kizuchu, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2884
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:13,580
Yeah.

2885
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:14,780
He's a, he's a cool dude.

2886
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,580
Um, I love, I love him to death.

2887
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:19,280
Um, and his, his art style is like this.

2888
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:21,580
This is like, this is like the first piece he made this year.

2889
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:22,480
It's really good.

2890
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:23,880
Let me see.

2891
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:25,680
That's good.

2892
02:13:25,680 --> 02:13:26,280
Oh yeah.

2893
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:28,180
He's a, he's a really good artist.

2894
02:13:28,180 --> 02:13:29,480
He, he, it's me and him.

2895
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,080
I like the woman.

2896
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:31,580
We're, we're kind of doing this thing.

2897
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:33,280
I like the woman.

2898
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:35,580
It looks cool.

2899
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:39,380
And, and our, and our private, we have like a private server for the monster

2900
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:40,480
manual or just me and him.

2901
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:45,080
And what we do is we just kind of throw designs into like a chat and then it's

2902
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:45,880
like, Oh, what do you think of this?

2903
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:46,480
Oh, what do you think of this?

2904
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:50,780
And then we just kind of go back and forth or like it was just any idea I have.

2905
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:51,480
I just throw it in there.

2906
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:54,480
Like, I just come up with a name like, Oh, what about a gloopity gloop?

2907
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:56,180
And then he's like, all right.

2908
02:13:56,180 --> 02:13:59,980
And then he just draws a design based on that name or he gives me a name and I

2909
02:13:59,980 --> 02:14:01,380
draw it and we go back and forth.

2910
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:04,480
Um, the only problem is, and like, look, don't get me wrong.

2911
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:05,280
I love Kazoo.

2912
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:06,380
I've had him.

2913
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:09,380
He's like my co-host on like five different podcasts.

2914
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:10,980
I didn't know that.

2915
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:16,880
Cause, cause you, cause you is just, oh, cause you takes like, like decades to draw

2916
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:17,680
one picture.

2917
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:19,580
Oh, that's a bummer.

2918
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:20,980
That is his one flaw.

2919
02:14:20,980 --> 02:14:23,780
If he could fix this flaw, he would, he could become God.

2920
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,580
He could become a big Twitter artist.

2921
02:14:26,180 --> 02:14:32,380
Um, if he, if he fixed this one, one flaw, um, but it's, it's okay.

2922
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:34,380
Cause I'm going to, I'm going to whip him into shape.

2923
02:14:34,580 --> 02:14:36,480
Sometimes I have that same problem.

2924
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:39,980
And actually it's my number one problem.

2925
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:43,280
The thing is that you guys don't have like deadlines.

2926
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:46,180
You don't have, I do.

2927
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:47,680
Yeah.

2928
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:51,680
You don't, you don't have like time limits where like, oh, if I don't do this by

2929
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:56,680
now, I might become homeless or, uh, no, I have, I have, I have a deadline of if

2930
02:14:56,680 --> 02:14:58,980
I don't do this, I'll have wasted my life.

2931
02:14:59,680 --> 02:15:02,780
Uh, but the time, the timeline is pretty generous on that one.

2932
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:06,480
Um, oh, Ben, have you seen your life in weeks?

2933
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:07,480
No.

2934
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:10,780
Oh, get ready for a dread.

2935
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:11,480
Jesus.

2936
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:17,380
Did you know that you spend 100% of your life being stupid?

2937
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:18,380
Is that what it is?

2938
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:24,080
Do you know that, you know that every second of every hour you're inhaling air that

2939
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:26,180
is touching another man's cock?

2940
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:30,180
Oh, did you know that?

2941
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:32,580
Did you, I, I didn't.

2942
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:38,380
Did you know that your body is comprised of molecules that once were farted by somebody?

2943
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:41,280
Somebody farted you.

2944
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,280
Ew, probably.

2945
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:44,280
That's gross.

2946
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:45,980
Yeah.

2947
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:47,280
Oh, no.

2948
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,580
Oh, God.

2949
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:51,580
What's the life in weeks?

2950
02:15:51,580 --> 02:15:52,980
Oh, I've seen something like this before.

2951
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:53,980
Each one of these is a week.

2952
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:54,480
What is this?

2953
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:56,880
That's how many weeks you'll live, probably.

2954
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:02,780
Uh, that's, that's, that's my result with my birthday put in.

2955
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:03,780
I don't, I don't.

2956
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:07,280
It's my birthday next week, which is why it's right about to complete a row.

2957
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:09,280
At least a little bit there is like five years.

2958
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:12,780
Each line is a year.

2959
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:16,680
Well, here's mine.

2960
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:25,580
Are you, is the, is the non red space is that, um, like how much time you got left?

2961
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:29,080
That's like, that's like expected life expectancy.

2962
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:31,380
It's fucking over.

2963
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:32,380
I'm good.

2964
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:37,080
I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna crank out like villain verse chapter 500 by then.

2965
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:37,680
Good.

2966
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:44,480
So like age zero to like 15, basically you're not real.

2967
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:46,380
Yeah, I could get to like villain verse chapter.

2968
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:47,780
You can change it to months too.

2969
02:16:47,780 --> 02:16:49,880
If you click on weeks, you can select months.

2970
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:51,680
I don't know about you guys.

2971
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:54,880
Uh, this doesn't, this doesn't apply to me.

2972
02:16:55,380 --> 02:17:00,280
It's gonna, cheesy man, Fredo library is going to be pretty big by then.

2973
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,480
Damn big library.

2974
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:05,680
I just got to, you just got to put out every, every single one of these boxes.

2975
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:13,080
Put out a new chapter and, uh, damn, that's like, it's not that many.

2976
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:14,380
Oh no, it's not that many.

2977
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:16,680
It's not that many boxes.

2978
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:18,480
There's a lot of boxes.

2979
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:20,780
Not try counting them with your hand.

2980
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:22,380
Not that many boxes.

2981
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:25,680
You try counting each of these boxes with your hand.

2982
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:27,080
You'll run out of fingers.

2983
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:29,880
Oh my God.

2984
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:34,480
You know, you know what I, what I like to do is seven days with multiple

2985
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:38,280
millions of seconds, not millions boxes anymore.

2986
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:39,080
I've had enough.

2987
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:40,480
Frankly, I've had enough.

2988
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:41,680
You know what, you know what I like to do?

2989
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:43,980
You know what I like to do when I complete a project?

2990
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:47,080
I like to, I haven't actually done this before.

2991
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:51,280
This is the first time I'm doing this and this is going to give me my dread is I

2992
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:55,880
will highlight how much time I spent mucking around on the last project.

2993
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:59,480
Um, so, so this is, this is my life in months.

2994
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:03,180
The yellow squares is how much I spent working on the animation that I just finished.

2995
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:08,280
Oh, such a big chunk of my life on one loop.

2996
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:09,780
Oh my, oh my God.

2997
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:15,080
I don't, oh, I can, I'm thinking about it.

2998
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:17,480
I'm thinking about.

2999
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:22,280
Imagine these as like, like, um, like time, like a bus health bars.

3000
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:27,480
Like, yeah, like, uh, like all the zelda hearts.

3001
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:28,480
Hey, you got a lot of them.

3002
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:30,180
Got a lot to go.

3003
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:34,980
I'm looking at like time that I spent working on like slime and punishment.

3004
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:37,280
That's like way too many of these boxes.

3005
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:40,080
There's all the years I wasted with my bitch of a wife.

3006
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:42,680
Exactly.

3007
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:44,880
All the fucking years I wasted on that bitch.

3008
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:48,880
More like every single one of these red boxes a year that I wasted on my bitch

3009
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:51,280
of a life in my opinion.

3010
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:53,680
I gave that whore the best years of my life.

3011
02:18:55,780 --> 02:19:00,080
Well, it's been, it's been more than a decade since my little pony

3012
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:00,680
came out.

3013
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,180
Yeah, like a, oh my God.

3014
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:10,980
Yeah, like, like a quarter of these boxes are post MLP.

3015
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:13,280
Scary.

3016
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,680
Well, no, a third, more like a third.

3017
02:19:15,780 --> 02:19:16,180
Yeah.

3018
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:19,380
Although I didn't get into it until it was several years old.

3019
02:19:19,380 --> 02:19:20,380
So I don't know.

3020
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:24,580
Well, um, fuck it.

3021
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:27,380
Oh, that's the podcast everyone buy.

3022
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:29,380
No, I don't know.

3023
02:19:29,380 --> 02:19:30,980
I'm making it worse.

3024
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:32,980
I'm making it worse for myself to moralize.

3025
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:36,080
I'm not letting you know how I'm just working at Pennsylvania.

3026
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,280
Just make stuff.

3027
02:19:37,780 --> 02:19:38,980
Just make stuff guys.

3028
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:40,280
No, shut up.

3029
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:41,280
No, I won't.

3030
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,180
No, I won't make.

3031
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:42,980
I'm making.

3032
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:43,780
Oh, I don't know.

3033
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:44,880
I can't make things.

3034
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:46,480
So hard.

3035
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:50,380
I can make things and I want to say at least like one thing in this whole

3036
02:19:50,380 --> 02:19:53,780
podcast because like every topic has been like, oh, I don't care about that.

3037
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:55,380
I'm sure.

3038
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:55,780
I'm sure.

3039
02:19:55,780 --> 02:19:56,280
I'm sure.

3040
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:58,380
I'm sure our audience feels the same way.

3041
02:19:58,380 --> 02:19:58,980
Every topic.

3042
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:00,180
Oh, I don't care about that.

3043
02:20:01,580 --> 02:20:02,780
Now I know how they feel.

3044
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:03,380
Yeah.

3045
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:11,280
But I have been productive on the Clarissa stuff and I'm sticking to my

3046
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:11,780
pace.

3047
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:14,680
I'm getting a I did a calculation.

3048
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:18,180
I did nine pages finished.

3049
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:19,980
They were already aligned.

3050
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:20,880
I was doing the shading.

3051
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:22,780
So this week last week.

3052
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:22,980
Yeah.

3053
02:20:22,980 --> 02:20:26,780
Nine pages and I have 10 left for this chapter.

3054
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:31,180
So maybe the end of February beginning of March chapter four of Clarissa

3055
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:36,080
gun smoke will be done and then the perfect comic party issue one will be

3056
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:40,080
soon after assuming that there's other stuff to put in there.

3057
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:43,280
And I did a calculation.

3058
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:52,580
I did a calculation based off just like my my current like slow ish pace of

3059
02:20:52,580 --> 02:20:54,780
like doing line art and then doing shading.

3060
02:20:55,780 --> 02:21:02,180
It will take me roughly for a 20 page chapter of a thing about three weeks

3061
02:21:03,180 --> 02:21:06,180
from doing all that stuff.

3062
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:12,780
And then that's assuming that I keep the pace I was currently at and that I

3063
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:15,380
don't have any major setbacks or like bad days.

3064
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:20,180
So like probably like four weeks is a good estimate for how long it will

3065
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:21,580
take to get a chapter done.

3066
02:21:22,480 --> 02:21:27,080
So I'm on and I have 10 chapters of Clarissa overall.

3067
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:28,480
I'm on chapter four.

3068
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:32,180
So in six months it'll be done.

3069
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:39,380
That's my that's the whole thing like all 200 pages 208 pages.

3070
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:39,680
Yeah.

3071
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:40,180
It's a lot.

3072
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:40,880
That's cool.

3073
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:41,580
That is a lot.

3074
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:46,680
That's I'm very bad at I'm very bad at condensing my story into small normal

3075
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:47,780
amounts of stuff.

3076
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:49,180
But it's going to be good.

3077
02:21:49,180 --> 02:21:50,080
It's going to be very good.

3078
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:51,180
I'm rooting for you.

3079
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:52,080
Yeah.

3080
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:53,580
Thanks.

3081
02:21:54,180 --> 02:21:54,380
Yeah.

3082
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:56,780
You need to pump that Schmidt out.

3083
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:00,180
I got I feel I feel more.

3084
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:07,180
I don't know capable of of just being just to just do the work.

3085
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:11,480
Just got to keep you got to keep the pace that you know you can you can

3086
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:16,280
match so that you don't like freak out when you're doing fine.

3087
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,280
Yeah.

3088
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:20,280
Because like if you if you get some work done you're like oh shit I could

3089
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:22,480
have done like seven times that much work.

3090
02:22:22,480 --> 02:22:25,780
And in reality you could not have done seven times as much work.

3091
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:27,080
Don't worry about it.

3092
02:22:27,080 --> 02:22:27,780
You're doing fine.

3093
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:28,880
Just keep just keep going.

3094
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:30,080
And it's like it's it's good.

3095
02:22:30,480 --> 02:22:30,780
Right.

3096
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:35,880
If you're if you're making progress then it's like OK just keep keep doing

3097
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:36,680
what you're doing.

3098
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:38,380
You're doing it right.

3099
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:39,680
Did I.

3100
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:40,380
Okay.

3101
02:22:40,480 --> 02:22:42,880
Apparently I can't remember what I talked about last week.

3102
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:47,680
Did I say last week that I had sent my files of slime and punishment

3103
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:49,680
to the printer that that would happen.

3104
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:50,680
Yeah you did.

3105
02:22:51,380 --> 02:22:51,980
Yeah.

3106
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:54,280
Okay well now I won't mention thank you.

3107
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:54,880
Thank you.

3108
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:55,880
I won't mention it again.

3109
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:56,380
All right.

3110
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:57,580
No problem.

3111
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:03,280
Give if I could if I could just if I could just ask for one request.

3112
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:10,380
I need you to to make the carrier the characters look wackier to be wackier.

3113
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:13,080
They're not wacky wackier.

3114
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:14,380
They look a more goofier.

3115
02:23:14,380 --> 02:23:15,680
Make them I think you should.

3116
02:23:15,980 --> 02:23:16,480
Yeah.

3117
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:19,580
I think maybe you should just start over and make them wackier.

3118
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:22,980
I mean look I don't disagree.

3119
02:23:22,980 --> 02:23:24,980
I think I struggle.

3120
02:23:25,180 --> 02:23:28,780
I struggle a bit with like oh it's got to be good.

3121
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:32,580
So I have to be an anatomically correct which means I can't do this pose.

3122
02:23:32,580 --> 02:23:36,680
That's too wacky and then some of the sketches some of the drawings are like

3123
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:42,580
end up kind of lame like kind of stuff you like look look everyone everyone

3124
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:46,880
who I'm so surprised when I when I find out about a one piece fan and then I

3125
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:50,880
look at their work and I'm like are you not taking the lessons from one piece

3126
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:56,180
where it's like just characters are just wacky or like or even like something

3127
02:23:56,180 --> 02:24:00,580
like in Iraqi's logic with like characters just having weird poses

3128
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:06,280
because like being weird is just more memorable than being like neutral or what

3129
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:06,580
not.

3130
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:10,780
You're just I mean I don't think I'm going necessarily for a one piece look.

3131
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:15,880
I don't you should I definitely want to should have and yeah I agree.

3132
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:20,180
Wackier characters but like singles for Ben I don't know I like I like subtle

3133
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:25,680
stuff like like peanuts like Charles M. Schultz like the way he does like

3134
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:30,680
extremely subtle expressions Charlie Brown being like depressed in a very

3135
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:35,580
specific way and it's like yeah like there's only a tiny little flicks of

3136
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:39,980
ink that make you feel like that particular way and when you look at it

3137
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:44,380
okay but where is the I like subtlety where's the where's the Charlie Brown

3138
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:47,480
gift shop and Tokyo Universal Studios.

3139
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:49,480
Oh wait that's not there.

3140
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:50,880
Oh there's a one piece gift shop.

3141
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:52,580
No you can't answer that.

3142
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:54,880
Can you you fake fan.

3143
02:24:55,380 --> 02:24:57,480
Look they put that goes for you too.

3144
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:58,980
You got to make your character the wackier.

3145
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:03,480
Um yeah.

3146
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:05,980
Okay yeah it's not wacky enough.

3147
02:25:05,980 --> 02:25:10,680
I'm I'm not as wacky as people expect.

3148
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:13,980
Phantom had some wacky expressions like in Simon punishment.

3149
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:15,780
He had some for some wacky panels.

3150
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:19,780
Sometimes you just have to like draw characters with just one foot in the

3151
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:22,580
air and every time you see them they just have one foot in the air for no

3152
02:25:22,580 --> 02:25:25,380
reason I've never explained why but it's just memorable.

3153
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:27,180
Is that a Jojo thing.

3154
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:29,980
It's just like the thing just a thing people do.

3155
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:33,180
What one foot in the air.

3156
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:36,080
He's got he's got he's got to be goofy goofy.

3157
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,880
Oh what I'm imagining right now is saying to you with his foot like

3158
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:43,880
fully upwards 180 degrees looking at smoking a cigarette or cool.

3159
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:47,080
I want everyone a lollipop you mean I want everyone to look in the mirror

3160
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:50,680
and say say to themselves I got to get goofier.

3161
02:25:50,780 --> 02:25:51,880
I just got to get silly.

3162
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:55,080
Look no no no I see what you're doing now you're trying to clown us.

3163
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:57,680
You're trying to make us turn you just to put on the makeup.

3164
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:58,780
That's not true.

3165
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:00,180
That's not true.

3166
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:04,580
But I see why I see what's speaking of which it wouldn't hurt.

3167
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:07,480
Cheesy just wants us to put on clown makeup.

3168
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:08,980
So does he can fucks us.

3169
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:12,680
What's no look I see you.

3170
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:13,980
I see your game.

3171
02:26:14,380 --> 02:26:17,380
Look look give me speaking of which you have you know it wouldn't it wouldn't

3172
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:20,680
hurt to put on some more color maybe some more makeup and your big red

3173
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:22,080
nose foundation.

3174
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:24,680
Some red some red nose selfies wouldn't hurt.

3175
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:29,480
Tease the hair dot tease that hair out into a big fro diet some wacky colors

3176
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:33,880
and Ben Ben I hear that I hear if you really want your teeth to glow.

3177
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:36,880
Astrogen is pretty good with that.

3178
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:43,680
I heard like taking astrogen is pretty helps you glow it more and really big

3179
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:48,780
shoes really really really big shoes and filled with estrogen.

3180
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:52,680
You know I hear you know you know you know like a lot of people think breast

3181
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:56,280
implants are expensive but not really and I hear they're pretty affordable

3182
02:26:56,280 --> 02:26:59,880
and the area you live in you know just saying just saying and they're not

3183
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:01,180
just for women anymore.

3184
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:02,580
They're there for everyone.

3185
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:06,980
It's for everybody especially especially guys who take HRT.

3186
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:10,380
Yeah true true yeah.

3187
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:17,180
I hear you know I know it's a little it's a little hyperbolic but yeah my some

3188
02:27:17,180 --> 02:27:21,980
of my character designs are like stiffer and like more reserved than they

3189
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:22,680
should be.

3190
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:26,780
Yeah I still like Clarissa I like how her hat is like stupid hat but it's like

3191
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:28,480
it's just a symbol of a cowboy hat.

3192
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:33,080
Not and she's she's but she's like really cool though.

3193
02:27:33,180 --> 02:27:37,180
That's that's you know that's drawing comics though right isn't it just

3194
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:42,280
like the more of it you draw you just like how push push the characters push

3195
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:47,880
him more and more to be like you know wacky your poses exaggerated poses

3196
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:52,280
you exaggerate them more and when it's a process you work push it you always

3197
02:27:52,280 --> 02:28:01,480
push in it push it funny doofy you know right and then I have I have a

3198
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:04,580
thing I have one another thing that I wanted to mention this episode which

3199
02:28:04,580 --> 02:28:10,480
is I just wanted to mention that the radcon for dojin is done the dojin

3200
02:28:10,580 --> 02:28:17,080
the dojin is done the OVA is not done Nate is supposedly done almost he's

3201
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:21,980
he's about seven or eight times now he said it's going to be done soon I

3202
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,280
promise it's going to be done soon I'm definitely going to get it done this

3203
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:29,080
month and then he's just a totally ignored it every single time but maybe

3204
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:34,680
this time he means it for real and yeah the dojin is done and I have the

3205
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:39,880
copy I have the PDF of it and one of these days when the OVA is done I'll

3206
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:43,780
release it and it looks really great and everybody did a really great job

3207
02:28:44,580 --> 02:28:48,280
and I especially was impressed with Drinking Moth who did a lot of pages and

3208
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:53,180
a lot of big like full-page spreads and they were really good and really quick

3209
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:58,780
Drinking Moth like fucking got all these pages done and like got them done in

3210
02:28:58,780 --> 02:29:05,180
like a day like they were so good was so impressed yeah shoutouts to Drinking

3211
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:10,080
Moth in particular I still need to commission Drinking Moth everyone

3212
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:14,980
should commission Drinking Moth I really I can't recommend her enough honestly

3213
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:19,780
I wanted to do the the the picture for the League of Nate fuckers voicemail

3214
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:25,980

about the the the the the finitude the the the smallness of the world and the

3227

correct all right all right is there oblivion do you read one piece I my

3250
02:33:14,680 --> 02:33:19,120
experience of one piece one of my friends his name was Christopher Hall I'm

3251
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:26,040
calling him out he's autistic more often than me which is on a ball he tried to

3252
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:29,720
get me into one piece he showed me the first episode I don't remember if it was

3253
02:33:29,740 --> 02:33:34,740
dubbed in English or not and I didn't like it and based on that I will condemn

3254
02:33:34,740 --> 02:33:38,540
everything you know what the show is bad don't watch the show except I know

3255
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:42,860
that's what that's what everyone's always said yes I mean it's no I disagree I

3256
02:33:42,860 --> 02:33:49,180
think the show is cool I watched every episode up to like episode 300 I did I

3257
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:53,060
did too but I was like a child I was like 14 when I watched the show yeah and

3258
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:59,760
children know children are the future I used to be one and then I got over it

3259
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:07,120
I'm never gonna watch the show I'm gonna stick to the manga sorry I'm sorry you

3260
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:10,520
can read you can read the manga in half the time it takes to watch the show it's

3261
02:34:10,520 --> 02:34:17,960
art isn't about how quickly you get to the end yes it is I just yes the baby's

3262
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:24,740
shoes never worn all the best art ever done sooner equals better take I take I'm

3263
02:34:24,740 --> 02:34:27,940
gonna stick to the source material the better a work of art is the faster it

3264
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:31,780
lets you just be done with it and get back to counting your fucking pennies

3265
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:37,380
and investing in in your in diversifying your portfolio and in finding a high

3266
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:42,260
interest savings account to put your your money in okay that's what it's about

3267
02:34:42,260 --> 02:34:47,800
the manga is good I would prefer the manga it's just that the anime has a

3268
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:53,480
really good soundtrack and sound design and like I can't imagine knowing one

3269
02:34:53,480 --> 02:34:59,480
piece I can't imagine really knowing and one piece without knowing the sounds and

3270
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:03,480
the voices and the music of the specific moments where it's like super

3271
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:09,840
emotional it's like yeah it's all in my head damn Gino Gino 7 should do a video

3272
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:14,740
on the sound design of the one-piece anime one piece how it looks a little

3273
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:22,980
goofy so that's I know right isn't it great they have multiple sounds in one

3274
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:28,220
piece where's my cool emo edgy boy protagonist huh that's law you're a law

so many girls in there I would definitely read it over watch it I'm not

3295
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:36,940
watching a show that long it's too much I've already watching Detective Conan and

3296
02:37:36,940 --> 02:37:43,740
that's taking years that's that's now that I'm sorry how can you how can you

3297
02:37:43,740 --> 02:37:48,420
judge how you sit on your high horse and judge reading one piece when you're

3298
02:37:48,420 --> 02:37:54,740
literally watching Conan literally watching Conan I would say I would argue

3299
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:59,160
you know why I'm watching somewhere there's actually a good reason

3300
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:04,920
we're gonna leave it unless you can read oh my god she's amazing it's boss

3301
02:38:04,920 --> 02:38:09,320
it's his boss and a sonia you gotta she's on ironically really pretty and I'm not

3302
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:15,680
saying that as a meme however if there's a one-piece waifu she's it for me I I do

3303
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:20,400
appreciate that at a certain point Oda seemed to commit to making wackier

3304
02:38:20,700 --> 02:38:25,740
women he did not do it for a long time but then at some point he was like okay

3305
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:32,580
I'll do it always but there is actually a very good reason to read sorry to watch

3306
02:38:32,580 --> 02:38:35,700
Detective Conan over read it and that's because the English translation is

3307
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:42,460
utter dog shit when Funimation localized Detective Conan they changed it to

3308
02:38:42,460 --> 02:38:47,140
case closed that's yes I don't know why Detective Conan is already an English

3309
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:51,120
title for the show I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest I'm when I hear detective

3310
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:56,200
just the name Conan all I can give is Conan the barbarian it does not conjure

3311
02:38:56,200 --> 02:39:03,280
images like a genius child the offer Sherlock Holmes that's what I'm right

3312
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:06,920
Conan O'Brien that's just not where that's just not what I think I don't know

3313
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:11,560
that's maybe that's just not well ignoring that only did they change the

3314
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:18,380
title they also changed Shinji's name to Jimmy Jimmy Kudo they changed his

3315
02:39:18,380 --> 02:39:24,140
names to like English names yeah they they made now it's in America it's not

3316
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:28,220
Japan it's America which doesn't make any sense they did that to a phoenix right

3317
02:39:28,220 --> 02:39:33,180
and I love that game so like what's the problem the problem is that it doesn't

3318
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:36,180
make any fucking sense because the fact that they're in Japan is extremely

3319
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:42,720
important to like a lot of the stuff that happens the American police do get

3320
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:46,800
involved and that's like a whole plot point and that makes no sense they just

3321
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:51,320
fucked a bunch of shit up and all the official like English translations use

3322
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:57,040
that for some reason and it's really dumb and I don't like it and the show

3323
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:01,160
does that and also the show adds a whole bunch of extra like stories that are

3324
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:07,660
also really good so I don't I'm sorry all that you just said those were like

3325
02:40:07,660 --> 02:40:13,460
complaints against the English dub right yes but you like the end the stuff

3326
02:40:13,460 --> 02:40:17,500
from the English dub was also put into the English translation of the manga as

3327
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:23,540
well I see they did that to the manga too and I am just like why why would they

3328
02:40:23,540 --> 02:40:29,460
do that I I don't I don't know that's just what they it's real it's really

3329
02:40:29,480 --> 02:40:36,080
funny how for like a while there like they couldn't just have an anime be in

3330
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:41,800
Japan they had to make it like about America they had to change it yeah which

3331
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:46,400
is weird because I'm going up in the area they said in America they couldn't

3332
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:49,720
have them eating rice they had to pretend they were donuts or fruit

3333
02:40:49,720 --> 02:40:55,120
sandwiches or whatever and it's just like why I think it would have been okay I

3334
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:58,240
think you could have just said yeah these guys are Japanese and they're

3335
02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:04,860
eating rice it's normal what if my child asks me about what is bacon and they

3336
02:41:04,860 --> 02:41:10,740
they they learn about rice what is that weird oriental food you that's me an

3337
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:19,340
American parent mm-hmm you're right and I was being being Japanese is woke well

3338
02:41:19,500 --> 02:41:29,800
I think yeah I I think it's woke being Japanese the Japanese gender I have to I

3339
02:41:29,800 --> 02:41:34,120
have to use the bathrooms you got can I you guys might what I could I could I

3340
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:40,480
interest you in letting me use the bathroom no I'm gonna I'm gonna go back

3341
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:48,440
my pants a little does he know that I diarrhea dumped in his toilet and now

3342
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:53,140
it's blocked I diarrhea dumped in his ear when he was asleep and you didn't

3343
02:41:53,140 --> 02:42:01,220
even notice I diarrhea it out my butt which is where it comes from I should

3344
02:42:01,220 --> 02:42:04,260
also mention that the reason I'm watching Detective Conan is because it's

3345
02:42:04,260 --> 02:42:10,340
Kai's favorite series of all time and he's sharing it with me that's the other

3346
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:15,700
reason I probably wouldn't watch it if I was if it weren't yeah like genuinely

3347
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:23,760
when people say oh I can't get into X media it's so long I'm like shut up what

3348
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:27,200
the fuck are you gonna do with that time oh you're complaining you got more of a

3349
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:32,520
good thing oh you people don't actually go for bite-sized entertainment they

3350
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:36,400
just like are intimidated by something that they can get invested in I don't

3351
02:42:36,400 --> 02:42:42,960
know why I just don't get it for me it's because there are so so so many shows

3352
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:47,420
that I do want to see in my lifetime and I have a finite amount of time on earth

3353
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:51,580
and I don't have the the did you borrow spirit of being able to watch fucking

3354
02:42:51,580 --> 02:42:58,740
everything I don't have that luxury so shows that are shorter I can watch more

3355
02:42:58,740 --> 02:43:07,900
of them and get more unique experiences out of that it's just I don't relate I

3356
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:12,220
don't relate to feeling like I need to see everything or even that many things

3357
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:17,040
I personally lists of movies and TV shows I've heard are great it's like oh I

3358
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:20,680
should probably watch Scarface at some point like I've heard that reference so

3359
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:25,480
much maybe like I should watch the film yeah but like I'd rather not every day

3360
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:33,840
I say that I would I would prefer if someone could make a list of okay like

3361
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:37,760
here like here of a list of detected Conan episodes that are actually like

3362
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:43,140
relevant to like the main story and like here are like from the ones that aren't

3363
02:43:43,140 --> 02:43:47,460
relative related to the main story or introducing characters who will become

3364
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:52,620
important later which you know like like the only grabbing like the top 10% of

3365
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:56,220
the best mysteries to include so that way instead of having to watch a thousand

3366
02:43:56,220 --> 02:44:01,300
episodes only have to watch like 200 or something or maybe two or 300 like I

3367
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:05,620
would probably prefer that experience because then because there are point

3368
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:08,440
there are like some episodes that are just like okay that mystery was kind of

3369
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:13,300
boring and predictable and but then there'll be like episodes like anime

3370
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:16,080
original episodes that have some of like the best mysteries in the entire show

3371
02:44:16,080 --> 02:44:19,440
that are like super engaging and clever and I'm like holy shit how did they come

3372
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:23,920
up with that murder and that like alibi and that like method and all this shit

3373
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:28,120
and it's like really fucking crazy like cool stuff that they come up with

3374
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:34,520
sometimes and you know what's our anime original episodes do a lot of good

3375
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:38,540
stuff with that sometimes so I wouldn't want to just do the ones from the

3376
02:44:38,540 --> 02:44:45,620
demand you know what's a really good show I got into and me and me and my

3377
02:44:45,620 --> 02:44:52,500
buddies in my private server we uh we started watching a Colombo and it's a

3378
02:44:52,500 --> 02:44:59,700
really it's a really good a show is that detective man yeah and you know like

3379
02:44:59,700 --> 02:45:04,600
the general premise of it um no but I've seen his face I think I know what he

3380
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:08,000
looks it's it's really it's really interesting cuz cuz the type of

3381
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:12,280
mystery is they do the so you the the most common kind of mystery is the who

3382
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:16,680
done it right like you know that's like the default usually right but Colombo

3383
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:22,680
instead is the it's a type of genre called how you catch him is what it's

3384
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:27,680
called and what it means is that at the start of every episode of Colombo we see

3385
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:31,740
that we know who the killer is and we see them commit the crime and every

3386
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:34,980
little thing they do to make sure they don't get caught like they always have

3387
02:45:34,980 --> 02:45:39,540
like every little like thing like like figured out like they always like think

3388
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:43,100
twice they like get rid of evidence and they're like oh I did it I committed the

3389
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:48,260
perfect murder that's always like the the first first third of every episode of

3390
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:52,900
Colombo is the murderer we see them we know their name and everything and

3391
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:56,300
they're committing the crime and they're getting away with it like I did it and

3392
02:45:56,300 --> 02:46:00,720
then and then but then the premise of the episode is like what is Colombo

3393
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:05,800
the detective gonna figure out to solve the mystery and it's like so fucking

3394
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:10,560
it's like so fucking interesting you know it's an ironically like a shonen

3395
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:15,320
battle it's like because like both both sides are trying to like the killer is

3396
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:20,460
trying to like like kind of like get the better of Colombo like oh Colombo

3397
02:46:20,460 --> 02:46:24,120
Colombo isn't gonna figure out this bit cuz I free I like I cleaned it up or

3398
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:27,040
like in the spot I came up with the perfect liar I have an awesome alibi and

3399
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:31,520
Colombo and Colombo's whole gist is that he kind of seems like kind of like

3400
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:36,180
he's like kind of messy looking he's like really short and he and he always

3401
02:46:36,180 --> 02:46:40,020
seems to be asking like questions that are kind of stupid right or he starts

3402
02:46:40,020 --> 02:46:45,060
talking about his wife which is like his catchphrase and um but eventually

3403
02:46:45,060 --> 02:46:49,240
Colombo figures out like a small detail that connects everything else and in the

3404
02:46:49,240 --> 02:46:52,240
end he kind of like reveals the bombshell like oh well this is how you

3405
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:57,480
did it and then and then the then the killer like what what Nani and then the

3406
02:46:57,480 --> 02:47:02,560
episode ends and it's and it's really fun it's so fucking awesome he also the

3407
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:07,400
majority of the killers are like are rich people are like they're the ones who

3408
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:10,600
are usually killing people and it's it almost becomes kind of like this like

3409
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:17,320
class thing where like Colombo is like I don't know I kind of hero Colombo he's

3410
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:20,360
working class hero even though he's a cop he's a working class hero and he

3411
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:23,200
always kind of like gets the better of these like rich fucks who think they're

3412
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:27,120
so smart and he's all like I don't know but my wife told me you're the killer

3413
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:31,000
and that's basically every episode really the secret clue that put it all

3414
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:37,000
together my wife had a dream she saw it in a vision I and and every episode is

3415
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:40,720
like a movie it's like I like I think the original the first episode was

3416
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:45,120
actually a TV movie but like people liked it so much they ordered a pilot

3417
02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:49,080
which was the second episode and every episode took an hour long but it's

3418
02:47:49,080 --> 02:47:56,160
really good love it big Colombo I can I can definitely say there's a lot of

3419
02:47:56,160 --> 02:48:00,480
like Detective Conan like it's not every it's not like every episode so who

3420
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:03,520
done it that's like half of them but there's a lot of episodes that are like

3421
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:08,400
we know who did it or like we we can very like one person is very obviously

3422
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:12,800
suspicious but like it seems impossible like they were somewhere else they were

3423
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:16,160
like sometimes so like they were on a plane like flying somewhere else at the

3424
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:20,960
time of the murder how the fuck did they like pull it off like they change for

3425
02:48:20,960 --> 02:48:25,840
time of death did they or it's like in like locked room you know and like they

3426
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:28,760
were somewhere else like and how did they pull that off how to if they

3427
02:48:28,760 --> 02:48:30,880
committed the murder they would have had to have locked the room but we can't

3428
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:34,960
prove how they would have done it so we have to figure out the method and it's

3429
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:38,960
really fucking good sometimes like some of the shit and like they teach you real

3430
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:44,720
skills that you can use to murder people IRL I remember I saw a couple

3431
02:48:44,720 --> 02:48:51,240
episodes of case closed and I literally like never realized that Jimmy is like

3432
02:48:51,240 --> 02:48:55,720
an adult that's been transmogrified I thought he was just a kid and like it

3433
02:48:55,720 --> 02:49:01,680
like never came up that he is like magic child that's the whole that's the whole

3434
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:05,000
like running plot is that he's trying to figure out who are the people who

3435
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:08,600
behind making him into a child I know but it just never it just never came up

3436
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:15,720
I still don't know I genuinely believe that that will never ever be solved like

3437
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:21,280
that it's I don't know it's it's sort of like the most annoying compelling thing

3438
02:49:21,280 --> 02:49:28,400
to get you to read on cuz I'd like I like I like mysteries but you know you can

3439
02:49:28,400 --> 02:49:31,640
get tired of like and he's just solving the mystery again like there's only so

3440
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:37,120
many types of mystery you can do and you know it could get boring but there's

3441
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:43,120
that that hook when is he gonna find out who turned him into a baby when is he

3442
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:48,720
gonna get the information never never will he get it but always really want

3443
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:54,720
to see I can confirm that's not true we found out a lot of stuff about the

3444
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:59,600
organization and who made the drug organization 13 yeah organization

3445
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:05,520
because it made a black organization because they're their outfits were

3446
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:12,440
designed by Nomura you see yes yes yeah all comes together and my wife had a

3447
02:50:12,440 --> 02:50:15,440
dream about it do you know that guy you know that like there's like an American

3448
02:50:15,440 --> 02:50:19,200
congressman who like literally posts on Twitter about how like his wife had a

3449
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:24,640
frickin like vision from God and her dreams or whatever there's a real this

3450
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:27,320
is a real good I think it might be clay Higgins I think it might be

3451
02:50:27,360 --> 02:50:32,320
representative clay Higgins like his wife had a fucking vision and is a

3452
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:37,960
prophet of the Lord and that's why I don't know that's why I deserve to be

3453
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:42,680
reelected that's why we have to raise taxes on that farm supplements or

prophetic like God dreams that like foretell the future and stuff God it's

3465
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:54,040
awesome you know you know what flight of a Concord's first recently for the

3466
02:51:54,040 --> 02:51:57,720
first time there's that episode with the guy at the fruit stand who's super

3467
02:51:57,720 --> 02:52:04,360
racist against New Zealanders he's played by Aziz I'm sorry yeah yeah it sounds

3468
02:52:04,360 --> 02:52:12,400
like a name he would have based on his visual appearance I'm racist I can I

3469
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:17,480
could say that cuz he's a fellow brown brother like me yeah he was in like he

3470
02:52:17,480 --> 02:52:24,960
was in like parks and rec yeah yeah he got like canceled for a millisecond but

3471
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:29,560
it was only because apparently I forget the details but people kept saying that

3472
02:52:29,560 --> 02:52:35,960
like oh it was just because like this woman had sex with him and I don't like

3473
02:52:35,960 --> 02:52:45,360
that very much that was upsetting cancelable behavior in 2023 yeah not

3474
02:52:45,360 --> 02:52:49,360
anymore not anymore I'm sorry that's that's fucked up we can't allow this

3475
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:53,280
it's over it's I'm sorry you took it too far we have to roll we have to start

3476
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:58,560
rolling back we have to go back because you had sex with one of them

3477
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:04,040
this is a plan rolling back rolling back women's rights rolling JK rolling

3478
02:53:04,040 --> 02:53:11,000
rolling back rolling rolling rock rolling rock on the rolling rocker yeah rolling

3479
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:22,640
rock on the rolling rocker could not fucking believe it I made a tweet like a

3480
02:53:22,640 --> 02:53:28,040
couple weeks ago where I said that a best case scenario Universal Studios just

3481
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:33,080
buys the rights of Harry Potter off JK Rowan but not now in retrospect I don't

3482
02:53:33,080 --> 02:53:36,360
really think that's gonna happen because like it probably only happened if it

3483
02:53:36,360 --> 02:53:41,840
gets to the point where like the JK Rowan herself has like decreased the

3484
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:47,760
profits of the franchise and I think to a certain extent she has I don't think

3485
02:53:47,760 --> 02:53:52,160
it's like enough enough you know it might not know yeah we haven't gotten to

3486
02:53:52,160 --> 02:53:57,200
that point yet where it's like only it's only been increasing because as the

3487
02:53:57,200 --> 02:54:01,440
people who grew up with the films start getting incomes they start being

3488
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:06,080
becoming you know man children about it and they're like oh I love Harry Potter

3489
02:54:06,080 --> 02:54:10,800
I remember that and now they're all buying like Harry Potter stuff as an

3490
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:17,840
adult it's yes with the whole Hogwarts legacy thing it's like moments like

3491
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:22,200
this that make me realize that like you spend too much time on Twitter you start

3492
02:54:22,200 --> 02:54:25,480
thinking like this is something everybody knows but it's not really true

3493
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:30,640
because I'm on Instagram where I mostly follow like close people who live in my

3494
02:54:30,680 --> 02:54:35,000
city they're playing the Hogwarts game and like they don't know nothing about the

3495
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:41,000
JK Rowan like shit or yeah I would like post most people don't care to the

3496
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,960
average person and I and I and honestly I sympathize I do it's like to the

3497
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:51,120
average person it's like that's a political debate and I don't even want

3498
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:55,600
to look at it I have not I'm not gonna take any position at anything that's

3499
02:54:55,640 --> 02:55:01,680
politics and this is a video game and I and I and I do not want to don't

3500
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:04,120
acknowledge that those have anything to do with each other I'm just here to play

3501
02:55:04,120 --> 02:55:09,760
a video game I kind of get it I don't I don't like it but I understand this is

3502
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:14,360
that it's like I don't want to engage with the takes about this I just want to

3503
02:55:14,360 --> 02:55:20,080
consume product this is why yeah in a couple of months I'm going to drop my

3504
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:28,360
video called I prove every story is political with just one chart and I

3505
02:55:28,360 --> 02:55:33,840
have a chart that like proves everything is political interesting what does it

3506
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:39,920
chart like politics over yeah it's a it's a it's a Prager you a graph that's

3507
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:44,400
like the axes are unlabeled it's just like politics versus time and the arrow

3508
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:50,280
just goes out politics so they acknowledge that politics is relative

3509
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:56,520
that's relativism which is Marxism which is if society agreed that killing

3510
02:55:56,520 --> 02:56:00,760
babies was good then it would be good because that's relativism and leftist

3511
02:56:00,760 --> 02:56:06,200
want to kill babies I agree that's that's for I didn't agree with anything

3512
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:13,200
until you said kill babies yes I love killing babies also I believe politics is

3513
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:18,520
relative a woman driving in a car in a video game isn't political unless you

3514
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:25,320
live in Saudi Arabia hmm okay I'll I'll tell you I'll tell you this I kind of

3515
02:56:25,320 --> 02:56:31,600
like I like go down to like the core of what what politics is and what and like

3516
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:35,200
forget ideology like forget left or right don't that's not even what I'm

3517
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:40,960
talking about politics is ultimately just like how society functions that's all

3518
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:47,640
what politics is right hmm and this chart like that I have I'm gonna post it

3519
02:56:47,640 --> 02:56:54,320
here like kind of like you could like you could like fit stories into this

3520
02:56:54,320 --> 02:57:00,280
chart like and not just in the squares but in between squares hmm right has

3521
02:57:00,280 --> 02:57:04,400
just been updated since the last time you showed me no it has not I've been too

3522
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:08,240
busy I don't think I've seen this before okay but I'll explain what I mean so

3523
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:14,080
like like the top says blatant so that's what I first of all you spelled

3524
02:57:14,080 --> 02:57:20,080
preserve wrong okay who cares I'm gonna roast you for that alright whatever

3525
02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:27,920
who cares I yeah English is the colonizers language I don't care anyway

3526
02:57:27,920 --> 02:57:32,480
at the top we have blatant so that's when like a story is like obviously

3527
02:57:32,480 --> 02:57:36,520
political so either it's like the main character is like the president or

3528
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:41,640
something or the main character works in like some sort of political body then

3529
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:46,600
oh yeah obviously it's political cuz someone is like you know working in the

3530
02:57:46,600 --> 02:57:51,080
system itself story about politics right and then at the bottom is like subtle

3531
02:57:51,080 --> 02:57:56,080
so it's like when like no one in the story works with anything political at

3532
02:57:56,080 --> 02:58:01,160
all you know they're just like people or they're like abstractions of people or

3533
02:58:01,160 --> 02:58:08,880
whatever you know and left and right we have state power and then non-state

3534
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:13,080
power and you know there we have like preserve like preserving state power and

3535
02:58:13,080 --> 02:58:19,000
on the right we have changing you know with like non-state power this is like

3536
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:27,080
politics is downstream from from culture or vice versa sort of yeah so so so at

3537
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:30,560
the so for and the biggest way to figure out what could fit in this chart is

3538
02:58:30,560 --> 02:58:37,840
like pick a story and like think about does society change by the end of the

3539
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:45,560
story if the if society does not change then it's like it's in the preserved

3540
02:58:45,560 --> 02:58:49,600
section so like by the stuff like it by the start of the story if the government

3541
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:52,920
or everything that functions around it is the same it's on the it's on the left

3542
02:58:52,920 --> 02:58:57,760
side I'm thinking about I'm thinking about Harry Potter right and then and then

3543
02:58:57,760 --> 02:59:03,720
on the on the on the right side right like if society well it's no no forget

3544
02:59:03,720 --> 02:59:06,920
forget for you know it's not there's no ideologies here like forget left or

3545
02:59:06,920 --> 02:59:11,360
right politics yeah there's no there's no ideology so like for example what it you

3546
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:15,080
know what would be all the way at the at the top at the top left side where it's

3547
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:21,600
like blatant a blatant preserving and and like state power would be a movie like

3548
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:25,880
Independence Day right because all the characters all the major characters

3549
02:59:25,880 --> 02:59:31,880
work in the governmental body and the and the bad guys don't necessarily have

3550
02:59:31,880 --> 02:59:35,840
an ideology they're just aliens they're just a force who wants to change our

3551
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:40,560
world right and we want to preserve our we want to preserve America so at the

3552
02:59:40,560 --> 02:59:43,280
start of the movie America exists and at the end of the movie America still

3553
02:59:43,280 --> 02:59:49,160
exist nothing change right we have preserved society that's like yeah right

3554
02:59:49,160 --> 02:59:54,160
and at the at the top right corner where it's like and that's good yeah sure

3555
02:59:54,440 --> 02:59:58,560
depends on you and well and at the top way at the top right corner where it's

3556
02:59:58,560 --> 03:00:03,840
like blatant and like changing society and like it would be kind of like non

3557
03:00:03,840 --> 03:00:07,240
state power we would have something like one piece where there's like people

3558
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:11,560
actively changing society like society's gonna change once we get to the one

3559
03:00:11,560 --> 03:00:18,200
piece right probably probably but also state power will probably change I feel

3560
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:23,560
like I feel like the like an artwork can be put in many of these different

3561
03:00:23,960 --> 03:00:27,600
zones see that's that's the beautiful thing though that's a beautiful thing

3562
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:30,360
about this because like every every one of these stories I mentioned could be

3563
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:34,720
debated on so like nothing is permanently like like stuck in one place

3564
03:00:34,720 --> 03:00:40,720
well I yeah I don't think it's like one place or another I just think it some

3565
03:00:40,720 --> 03:00:46,320
things can be multiple places like the main characters are trying to change

3566
03:00:46,320 --> 03:00:50,440
society and then they like like overall like yeah exactly like where to put my

3567
03:00:50,480 --> 03:00:56,920
little pony well okay does equestria people change you is where I is where I

3568
03:00:56,920 --> 03:01:01,320
put my little pony okay you're also changing the community and preserving

3569
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:05,640
Ponyville from attacks Twilight became a princess that's a that's an increase in

3570
03:01:05,640 --> 03:01:11,400
state power yeah it's like individual equestria equestria exists at the start

3571
03:01:11,400 --> 03:01:15,280
right there's still a monarchy at the start of the series and there's still a

3572
03:01:15,320 --> 03:01:20,680
monarchy at the end of the series right yes I would so my little pony is more

3573
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:24,280
episodic so it'll be closer to the center which is the status quo zone and

3574
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:29,120
that's mostly that's mostly reserved for like episodic like superhero media or

3575
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:33,280
like sitcoms they're all in the status quo zone nothing ever like it's always

3576
03:01:33,280 --> 03:01:37,680
just everything's kind of the same nothing changes right like that's where

3577
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:44,320
the majority of like just super so by this charts logic is that non political

3578
03:01:44,360 --> 03:01:49,840
when nothing just nothing changes well I think the idea is that it's still

3579
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:56,600
political status quo it's all political if a story if a story takes place in a

3580
03:01:56,600 --> 03:02:04,200
society it is political by the fault right yeah and like and the care and the

3581
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:08,120
characters just kind of like because like the characters doing nothing about the

3582
03:02:08,120 --> 03:02:13,960
politics it's still like a commentary on politics itself right you know sure sure

3583
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:20,440
right so like yeah unconsciously perhaps but yeah yeah when it's like subtle

3584
03:02:20,440 --> 03:02:24,040
when they're like because I mean you might say it's kind of more blatant in my

3585
03:02:24,040 --> 03:02:27,960
little pointy because she's training to become a princess which is a person in a

3586
03:02:27,960 --> 03:02:33,880
position of power right hmm well she doesn't even train to be well she kind

3587
03:02:33,880 --> 03:02:39,440
of trains to be a princess or ultimate friendship lessons ultimately she

3588
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:44,240
becomes a princess and she kind of like escapes the like well if he's a

3589
03:02:44,240 --> 03:02:48,920
princess it's some sort of monarchy right sort of like it's honestly more

3590
03:02:48,920 --> 03:02:54,760
like a divine appointment than it is like a hereditary monarchy okay familiar

3591
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:59,240
you are like real monarchs you you can like well as long as like the divine

3592
03:02:59,240 --> 03:03:03,880
monarchy has some sort of like kind of state power you know like the princess

3593
03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:10,520
implies there's a state power or something right you know mm-hmm there's

3594
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:16,520
parades there's cantaloupe there's lots of this guards castles I think I'm I

3595
03:03:16,520 --> 03:03:20,800
think like if I were to kind of like be more kind of like try to like keep things

3596
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:27,800
simple I think the top left would be kind of like people preserving society I

3597
03:03:27,800 --> 03:03:31,960
mean it says right there like top right like it's people like kind of changing

3598
03:03:31,960 --> 03:03:38,000
society and the bottom is more like society is changing you right or like

3599
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:42,880
yeah like you know society changes your society keeps you the same you know and

3600
03:03:42,880 --> 03:03:46,480
that's what those are more reserved for more like kind of psychological stories

3601
03:03:46,480 --> 03:03:52,280
or stuff that's like a character you know society society also gazes into you

3602
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:57,000
yeah like like at the bottom like probably at the bottom I would put

3603
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:01,400
something like taxi driver where the character of Travis Bickel like ultimately

3604
03:04:01,400 --> 03:04:06,800
stays the same because society has kept them the same you know because he does

3605
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:10,240
this giant action where he fucking goes into a brothel and starts shooting up

3606
03:04:10,240 --> 03:04:14,520
people and he basically committed a massacre and but the thing is the fact

3607
03:04:14,520 --> 03:04:18,360
that he since he killed what society deems the right people who deserve to

3608
03:04:18,360 --> 03:04:24,080
die he's considered a hero so he's like his his terrible actions are justified

3609
03:04:24,080 --> 03:04:28,520
so he stays in this he stays in this state and you know and it's kind of like

3610
03:04:28,520 --> 03:04:32,240
all like all of this is very obvious if you've seen taxi driver because the final

3611
03:04:32,240 --> 03:04:37,640
scene it's looking if we have it is that everyone here seen taxi driver I have

3612
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:41,800
not seen taxi driver oh it's a 10 out of 10 it's a it's I mean I've heard I've

3613
03:04:41,800 --> 03:04:46,600
heard people talk about it it is the best in taxi driver and I will watch it so

3614
03:04:46,600 --> 03:04:51,040
it's the best crazy white boy movie ever of all time like don't know they're

3615
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:54,920
crazy crazy like like that movie is the reason why I love crazy white boys is

3616
03:04:54,960 --> 03:05:00,080
that movie and I'm we fucking turn it in a fight Travis Bickle or Patrick

3617
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:05,640
Bateman probably Patrick Bateman to be honest because he's because he's in

3618
03:05:05,640 --> 03:05:08,440
better shape because he does a thousand crunches every morning he's it he has

3619
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:14,680
more experience but no one will believe him Travis Bickle is like sloppy you

3620
03:05:14,680 --> 03:05:18,560
know and you know also like also American Psycho could probably go like

3621
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:23,040
here at the bottom where his name is Patrick Bateman okay unless unless his

3622
03:05:23,080 --> 03:05:27,600
actual name is a what's the other guy Patrick Bateman wait wait don't they say

3623
03:05:27,600 --> 03:05:31,160
in the movie wait Patrick you're the American Psycho they call me American

3624
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:36,760
Psycho in the movie I remember Jared Lito calls him like Patrick you're the

3625
03:05:36,760 --> 03:05:41,580
American Psycho he says that I don't think that's true there's a part in the

3626
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:44,880
movie where he's mostly Patrick Bateman but sometimes there's another name for

3627
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:48,320
another guy that sometimes it's like he killed that guy but then other times like

3628
03:05:48,320 --> 03:05:52,400
he's like people call him that name like he might actually be that guy that he

3629
03:05:52,440 --> 03:05:56,800
thinks he killed like so like at the like at the start of American Psycho

3630
03:05:56,800 --> 03:06:00,760
like Patrick doesn't change like he just kind of just stays the same ultimately

3631
03:06:00,760 --> 03:06:04,640
because the society that he's around himself has kept them the same so he

3632
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:11,720
would be like at the bottom left you know is that political is that really a

3633
03:06:11,720 --> 03:06:15,720
measure what it's saying it's the fact that he's being kept the same says

3634
03:06:15,720 --> 03:06:24,680
something about like society right just it's all I'm saying I'm gonna I'm gonna

3635
03:06:24,680 --> 03:06:29,240
eventually like really when I do the video every one of these squares is

3636
03:06:29,240 --> 03:06:32,720
gonna have a movie or like a story there so people are gonna have like a better

3637
03:06:32,720 --> 03:06:38,880
like idea what I'm talking about okay well I'll watch it do you like it do

3638
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:43,360
you think it's interesting do you think I'm onto something I am not sure you have

3639
03:06:43,640 --> 03:06:47,680
to convince me you don't have to give me more examples and maybe lay out a full

3640
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:53,080

03:12:15,160 --> 03:12:20,680
to voicemails I feel like we're getting to that point before that had did you

3695
03:12:20,680 --> 03:12:34,080
read the one-piece chapter no you fool no no no well what do you want to do do

3696
03:12:34,080 --> 03:12:38,400
you want to do first I want to skip it I don't want to skip it I don't want to do

3697
03:12:38,400 --> 03:12:42,880
I mean I don't know we got guess we can't be rude rude to read I don't know I

3698
03:12:42,880 --> 03:12:46,720
don't know what a one no no I mean like not with them I mean like that's why like

3699
03:12:46,720 --> 03:12:52,240
after the voicemails like the show ends then we talk about one piece well I

3700
03:12:52,240 --> 03:12:57,160
guess we could do that yeah yeah you could continue after voicemails I could

3701
03:12:57,160 --> 03:13:01,120
say bye and you could keep the episode going for five hour mark I mean I hate I

3702
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:05,920
hate to kick hate to kick a blivvian fall off if you don't kick me off Kai's

3703
03:13:05,920 --> 03:13:08,360
gonna kick me off you'll be like you're being on the podcast too long I want to

3704
03:13:08,360 --> 03:13:15,320
be loud in the living room that's fair that's reasonable okay I mean we could

3705
03:13:15,320 --> 03:13:20,360
do that yeah sure all right voice voicemails now and then one piece after

3706
03:13:20,360 --> 03:13:26,720
I guess sure all right so the first voicemail is it's a link to a YouTube

3707
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:34,560
video and it's just called moon stuff and it's this just video of a guy on the

3708
03:13:34,560 --> 03:13:40,800
moon oh this is me I saw you can you can disregard the audio and just send a link

3709
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:46,800
since I'm already here I explain it the comics the comments are turned off cuz

3710
03:13:46,800 --> 03:13:54,080
everyone's like oh it's fake yeah so so this was a few episodes ago then you

3711
03:13:54,080 --> 03:13:59,920
were talking about you know wait did we did we ever go back to the moon and the

3712
03:13:59,920 --> 03:14:05,520
answer is yes we did and we took a better cameras wait I mean I did I say

3713
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:09,040
that cuz like I know we went to the moon several times I know we didn't just go

3714
03:14:09,040 --> 03:14:13,800
the one time oh did you mean like after the first like burst of missions was

3715
03:14:13,800 --> 03:14:19,520
there like another one yeah like um we want to I know we went a bunch of times

3716
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:24,640
but like we kind of just haven't been doing it in a while cuz like there's

3717
03:14:24,640 --> 03:14:28,800
not really anything to like get on the moon there's not a whole lot humans can

3718
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:34,000
do but I'm so freaky with a completely black sky I love it I love it you bring

3719
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:38,000
that up cuz I remember I was talking to a co-worker and I told the co-worker

3720
03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:43,280
that like like yeah I'm like anti conspiracy theory like I really do the

3721
03:14:43,280 --> 03:14:47,760
majority conspiracy theories are like incredibly fucking bullshit and stupid

3722
03:14:47,760 --> 03:14:51,520
and he's all like oh so you actually believe we we went on the moon and I'm

3723
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:55,200
like yeah of course we went on the fucking moon and he's all like oh yeah how can

3724
03:14:55,200 --> 03:14:57,920
we never went back and I'm like there's no fucking resources why would the

3725
03:14:57,920 --> 03:15:02,560
fuck would we go back there's nothing to okay when you send a robot to the moon

3726
03:15:02,560 --> 03:15:06,000
you can fold it up into a cramped space it doesn't need a life support system it

3727
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,560
doesn't need room to move around and stretch its muscles and breathe it

3728
03:15:08,560 --> 03:15:13,600
doesn't need food it doesn't need water you don't have to like basically like

3729
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:17,360
for human habitation especially you know usually they send a couple people

3730
03:15:17,360 --> 03:15:22,240
at a time because it's you know better that way you're gonna have to like

3731
03:15:23,120 --> 03:15:27,360
does the size of the craft have to be like five or six times bigger and five or six

3732
03:15:27,360 --> 03:15:32,160
times heavier which means for rocket needs to have like five or six times more fuel

3733
03:15:32,160 --> 03:15:36,320
because the fuel to payload ratio isn't something you can just sidestep

3734
03:15:36,320 --> 03:15:40,960
like a bigger payload means more fuel but then the fuel also adds more weight so

3735
03:15:40,960 --> 03:15:44,560
you need even more fuel and it just becomes ridiculous for Saturn 5 rocket was

3736
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:48,480
fucking gigantic we don't usually use rockets that big because they cost billions of

3737
03:15:48,480 --> 03:15:52,960
dollars per launch so basically I told my co-worker all of that that Oblivion just

3738
03:15:52,960 --> 03:15:57,520
said I told that to my co-worker and he was fucking stunned and he fell on the ground

3739
03:15:57,520 --> 03:16:04,720
and then everyone clapped also also Ben you mentioned parabolic arcs I want you to watch

3740
03:16:04,720 --> 03:16:08,960
this footage of the lunar rover whenever you see dust kicked up behind it notice how

3741
03:16:08,960 --> 03:16:14,320
there's no it doesn't swirl around like it would an air like the dust particle is just

3742
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:18,160
like fall out follow a parabolic arc and like fall straight to the ground

3743
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:21,360
let me uh let me they don't linger in the the way air does

3744
03:16:22,320 --> 03:16:25,360
it's like halfway through driving towards the camera

3745
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:31,680
they kind of just yeah it kind of just kicks up in these like little waveforms behind the tire

3746
03:16:32,320 --> 03:16:37,120
and then just falls straight up and then down and up and then down yeah yeah they don't linger

3747
03:16:37,120 --> 03:16:41,680
because they don't there's no air for them to hang in there's no air and they also accelerate

3748
03:16:41,680 --> 03:16:45,920
towards the ground too if you're I mean the camera's moving quite a bit but like if you're able to

3749
03:16:45,920 --> 03:16:50,160
catch so often when you see at the ground it actually speeds up quite a bit before hitting

3750
03:16:50,160 --> 03:16:54,160
the ground because it just accelerates the whole time yeah which wouldn't happen in air

3751
03:16:54,160 --> 03:16:58,320
dust particles are tiny they basically have air resistance basically completely

3752
03:16:58,320 --> 03:17:03,840
overwhelm some you can't do that without filming in a vacuum and because of the low gravity you

3753
03:17:03,840 --> 03:17:11,680
would also have to film it basically have a high speed camera spilled it spilled it film it at like

3754
03:17:11,680 --> 03:17:17,120
90 frames per second which we didn't have 90 frame per second cameras that could record for like

3755
03:17:17,680 --> 03:17:24,080
10 20 minutes or hours at a time back then that that technology in exhaust high speed cameras

3756
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:29,840
could only record for about 90 seconds which would be we'll start for like for for 30 seconds

3757
03:17:29,840 --> 03:17:34,240
which would be 90 seconds after you slowed it down but if that's the case then the dust makes

3758
03:17:34,240 --> 03:17:39,680
even less sense because that would be the dust moving in slow motion which dust the dust would

3759
03:17:39,680 --> 03:17:43,440
have had to be moving three times faster than that which it definitely wouldn't do if there was air

3760
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:50,720
so it's impossible to fake it's that's just not possible oh i see what you're saying yeah this

3761
03:17:50,720 --> 03:17:55,200
effect is just you wouldn't you wouldn't never wouldn't you just wouldn't act like that yeah i

3762
03:17:55,200 --> 03:17:58,720
saw a youtube comment i guess i turned off the comments off since then someone was saying yeah

3763
03:17:58,720 --> 03:18:03,200
this is clearly stop motion and i'm like first of all what fucking stop motion animator people

3764
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:07,120
just say words people just fucking say words oh my god they're saying they claim that the

3765
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:11,920
astronauts don't move and they're like oh the astronauts have stopped motion i'm like first

3766
03:18:11,920 --> 03:18:16,400
of all stop motion the 70s was janky as fuck with the animators back then just weren't as good as

3767
03:18:16,400 --> 03:18:21,360
the people we have now and that's not a technology thing that's an artist thing who did they hire

3768
03:18:21,360 --> 03:18:26,960
secondly these shots go on for like minutes at a time no stop motion person can do a shot that

3769
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:32,160
long without making a mistake and having to start over also dust how do you do stop motion dust

3770
03:18:32,160 --> 03:18:36,880
are you fucking stupid yeah you've ever seen any fucking movie ever they never do stop motion

3771
03:18:36,960 --> 03:18:43,360
dust because it's so fucking yeah stop motion movies have only been able to have that since CGI

3772
03:18:43,360 --> 03:18:48,400
could do CGI dust over top of a stop motion movie that's like what like it does it would be interesting

3773
03:18:48,400 --> 03:18:53,760
to see like like a doctor uh no uh what's what's the guy who does the visual doctor disillusion

3774
03:18:53,760 --> 03:18:58,560
captain captain disillusion captain disillusion video about how like yeah how you couldn't fake

3775
03:18:58,560 --> 03:19:03,280
the moon landing footage there was um you know i think he's addressed that people want him to do

3776
03:19:03,280 --> 03:19:08,080
that but like he just i think he's like he's like misbusters or did it better than i ever could

3777
03:19:08,080 --> 03:19:13,040
and i think no he could do an even better job there's busters barely tap the surface there's

3778
03:19:13,040 --> 03:19:20,000
also a lot of things aside from like actual moon footage that proves the landing was real

3779
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:23,680
and everything and i think the biggest thing i always go back to is the fact that if the moon

3780
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:28,960
landing was fake the russians would have exposed us like right then and there because they had way

3781
03:19:28,960 --> 03:19:33,840
more shit up there and they would have they would have known right unless your logic is like oh the

3782
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:38,240
russians are in on it too and it's like um in the middle of the fucking cold war we they weren't on

3783
03:19:38,240 --> 03:19:44,080
the same fucking side motherfucker uh yeah so they colluded to make the cold war just a just a little

3784
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:48,000
prank that they pulled on every single other person and then you would have to believe in a bigger

3785
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:51,600
body and then it goes into the people that like oh well you know who's secretly controlling the

3786
03:19:51,600 --> 03:19:57,520
strings and it's like bro it's it's a one world government but also fuck the middle east um they're

3787
03:19:57,600 --> 03:20:02,480
terrible and we have to kill them it's a one world government but they want globalization but we're

3788
03:20:02,480 --> 03:20:07,040
but we're already at globalization and like it's so fucking oh god i'm so fucking tired i was

3789
03:20:07,040 --> 03:20:12,000
listening to um it's yeah i was listening to the it's literally more it's more believable to just

3790
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:16,720
be like no maybe we it would actually be simpler to believe that we just went to the moon we just

3791
03:20:16,720 --> 03:20:22,080
we just launched a rocket to the moon like it's not that far it's the grand scheme i was um i was

3792
03:20:22,080 --> 03:20:27,360
fucking listening to the cold cuts podcast with uh yellow swag and beatle moses and like

3793
03:20:27,360 --> 03:20:33,200
just the way that like i like beatle moses but i really just hate how casual he is about like

3794
03:20:33,200 --> 03:20:37,520
just believing in conspiracy theories and he's all like yeah you know i i do think the movement

3795
03:20:37,520 --> 03:20:42,000
he was fake it's just it just be so easy to fake like oh my god are you serious you fucking dude

3796
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:46,720
like i i swear i thought you were supposed to be the smart member of this podcast yeah if you

3797
03:20:46,720 --> 03:20:53,920
know nothing about cameras or physics or anything that's that sucks oh my god i was this this just

3798
03:20:53,920 --> 03:20:59,440
this justifies every bad thing i've ever said about beatle moses uh he's a he's a cool guy he's

3799
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:04,080
still like kind of the better half of that podcast not gonna lie oh god that doesn't

3800
03:21:04,720 --> 03:21:11,200
spill me with the confidence i mean if they're on a podcast they're already too far gone right

3801
03:21:11,200 --> 03:21:16,320
right it's too late right ellies ellies are cut out the following that i'm about to say because

3802
03:21:16,320 --> 03:21:22,720
it's kind of like some personal shit a few moments later okay all right should we go back to voicemails

3803
03:21:22,720 --> 03:21:28,400
now yeah we go back to voicemails no i have a mini topic it's really short trust me it was all right

3804
03:21:28,400 --> 03:21:35,120
okay um i was just i just i fell down the i didn't really fall down the rabbit hole i i got it i

3805
03:21:35,120 --> 03:21:43,280
saw the fucking elevator i fell into an elevator no a mini Scientology rabbit hole again i fell

3806
03:21:43,280 --> 03:21:48,000
down to a deep a few years ago learning about all the fucked up shit that Scientology does and how

3807
03:21:48,640 --> 03:21:54,480
insane and like batshit crazy the organization is and how they like attack people do you know

3808
03:21:54,480 --> 03:22:01,200
any Scientologists i actually i met one uh when i was at animation school one of my friends

3809
03:22:01,200 --> 03:22:04,160
one of my best friends at the school turned out to be a Scientologist and he was talking about

3810
03:22:04,160 --> 03:22:09,200
the South Park episode and he actually broke down into tears talking about it oh no he got bullied

3811
03:22:09,200 --> 03:22:12,880
he got bullied so much because of it and how he doesn't understand why the stuff from the

3812
03:22:12,880 --> 03:22:17,840
that they said in South Park isn't even true that was my first exposure to it i but um that

3813
03:22:19,280 --> 03:22:23,360
and then he tried to show me like some Scientology videos and it was like the very like you know

3814
03:22:23,360 --> 03:22:27,360
that corporate music where it's like all like uplifting and spiritual and it's like come join

3815
03:22:27,360 --> 03:22:33,680
our institution i watch the tanda cruel video about corporate music yes that was a good one yes

3816
03:22:34,400 --> 03:22:40,880
boba way yeah they were boba weighing in there boba way yeah yeah yeah yeah but then um i don't

3817
03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:45,520
know later i i ran out falling into that document falling into i ended up watching that documentary

3818
03:22:45,520 --> 03:22:51,200
series about Scientology and how like um all the shit about the aliens that South Park mentioned

3819
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:55,680
is true there's recordings of L Ron Hubbard talking about it um well that's well that's the stuff

3820
03:22:55,680 --> 03:23:01,600
that like they don't tell you until you get like deeper right until you reach ot free which most

3821
03:23:01,600 --> 03:23:06,320
an average person would have to spend around 300 thousand dollars in donations to reach that level

3822
03:23:06,320 --> 03:23:10,480
fuck hell oh you think you think they're alive you think they're alive when they put like this is

3823
03:23:10,480 --> 03:23:16,400
what they actually believe and then they weren't lying every person who's ever like left Scientology

3824
03:23:16,400 --> 03:23:22,480
has like horrible like yeah like they teach you about ot free that's like standard um but uh

3825
03:23:23,440 --> 03:23:28,320
so i without getting too much into it i just i just noticed this is this is the leader of

3826
03:23:28,320 --> 03:23:36,480
Scientology david miscavige he has he has those glassy like those empty like glassy eyes that a

3827
03:23:36,480 --> 03:23:42,560
lot of like crazy like demonic like religious people is this guy ai generated no that's just

3828
03:23:42,560 --> 03:23:50,400
how he looks you know kind of copeland has it has those eyes oh my god uh the heavens gate guy also

3829
03:23:50,400 --> 03:23:56,800
has those glassy eyes okay i just noticed it these people are demons this guy looks like a comedian

3830
03:23:56,800 --> 03:24:01,600
you ever um you ever seen this guy is like leslie nielsen and uh which which guy is the comedian

3831
03:24:01,600 --> 03:24:07,280
the third guy the third yeah ben you ever seen this guy's like rodney dangerfield leslie nielsen

3832
03:24:07,280 --> 03:24:12,880
and uh who's the guy who was steve martin he's like those three people in one guy i mean i thought

3833
03:24:12,880 --> 03:24:18,000
it was pretty funny when he had all those people commit ritual suicide by drinking kool-aid pretty

3834
03:24:18,640 --> 03:24:22,560
no that wasn't him that was that was jones that wasn't heavens gate that was jones town it was

3835
03:24:22,560 --> 03:24:26,640
jones town what heavens gate was similar though it also yeah they had similar similar but you

3836
03:24:26,640 --> 03:24:32,480
ever seen the the video with that with that image come from no it's pretty it's pretty wacky um you

3837
03:24:32,480 --> 03:24:37,600
might get some inspiration heavens gate you initiation um you know what's funny is i should have painted

3838
03:24:37,600 --> 03:24:42,720
his teeth with y9 you know what's funny is that um the site where these guys committed their mass

3839
03:24:42,720 --> 03:24:49,040
suicide is like like i think i'm like an hour and a half away from there um it's pretty close by it

3840
03:24:49,040 --> 03:24:54,880
was like a it was like a like a big house in like a in the neighborhood and after they committed

3841
03:24:54,880 --> 03:24:59,920
like the act like all the neighbors like got together and bought the house and then fucking

3842
03:24:59,920 --> 03:25:05,280
demolished it because they didn't want like a couple of weirdos to come and check out the place

3843
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:11,120
you know because of like tourist reasons or whatnot right so it's not it's technique that's

3844
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:17,760
there but it's not because they built i think they built a new house over it um good for them yeah

3845
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:24,240
it's uh it's wacky oh also um when they when they committed the mass suicide they were wearing a

3846
03:25:24,240 --> 03:25:29,840
specific like nike shoe and after like that mass suicide they stopped making that shoe and that

3847
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:35,840
shoe goes for like it costs so much on fucking ebay now because they don't it's because they don't

3848
03:25:35,840 --> 03:25:41,040
sell it and you know it's infamous now yeah and suddenly consumption under capitalism was african

3849
03:25:41,040 --> 03:25:46,880
once again it just took one very funny if that was like their best shoe and they're like oh we can't

3850
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:55,200
make it anymore we gotta make the worst shoes now damn it why people ruin everything uh uh

3851
03:25:57,840 --> 03:26:02,480
our uh shit i'm sorry i lost my train of thought what's happening what are we talking about

3852
03:26:03,360 --> 03:26:08,320
uh Scientology um oh yeah Scientology Scientology

3853
03:26:10,560 --> 03:26:19,200
demons i love demons um i love demons i am a demon i love evil i love material harm

3854
03:26:19,200 --> 03:26:29,280
i love to cause it um so uh speak voicemail yes okay the next voicemail was uh where are we

3855
03:26:29,520 --> 03:26:35,120
we got an image here we got some image posts okay we then took us that long to get through

3856
03:26:35,120 --> 03:26:45,600
one voicemail it was like an hour uh okay so this is oh my god what is the beast out of the earth

3857
03:26:45,600 --> 03:26:49,520
and then i saw the second beast coming out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb but it spoke

3858
03:26:49,520 --> 03:26:56,960
like a dragon it excites the authority the first beast on its behalf something Aurora

3859
03:26:57,920 --> 03:27:06,000
oh so like mage is the devil not the devil the the beast of the earth uh earth beast

3860
03:27:06,960 --> 03:27:14,000
guys who horns like a lamb spoke like a dragon fire to come down from heaven okay like the

3861
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:18,400
aurora bria it deceived the inhabitants of the earth just like just like mage does every day

3862
03:27:19,200 --> 03:27:25,840
um if i can if i can six six six the number of the bitch gives hey no that's my favorite number

3863
03:27:27,760 --> 03:27:32,400
the beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast so that the image

3864
03:27:32,400 --> 03:27:40,640
could speak oh like a vtuber yes oh my god it's all holy shit yo is this is this true guys guys is

3865
03:27:40,640 --> 03:27:46,640
this true is this true i would say i can't i can't believe mage is narrow caesar slash

3866
03:27:46,640 --> 03:27:54,160
narrow on caesar six one six i could i i have i had a feeling i had a feeling

3867
03:27:54,960 --> 03:28:02,720
guys saying not that i'm shocked but not that shocked i got a feeling that mage might be the

3868
03:28:02,720 --> 03:28:08,000
devil the devil that mage might be the devil let the person who has insight calculate the

3869
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:15,360
number of the beast for it is a number of a man that number six six six it but just dawning on me

3870
03:28:15,360 --> 03:28:22,480
how goofy that is yeah like like the number of the beast it's the calculation yes because you

3871
03:28:22,480 --> 03:28:28,880
calculate it okay so in roman this is a common thing in rome is that like you know how roman

3872
03:28:28,880 --> 03:28:33,520
numerals they're made out of letters right if you add the letters in someone's name together you can

3873
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:41,360
get like a number um and so you know you can calculate someone's number and narrow uh like the

3874
03:28:42,080 --> 03:28:47,600
what his number was six six six um or six one six depending on if you spelled it narrow or

3875
03:28:47,600 --> 03:28:54,880
near on there are two spellings and um narrow killed a bunch of christians and they also it's

3876
03:28:54,880 --> 03:29:00,560
not just for number they also specified that the beast is just rome they say there's like seven

3877
03:29:00,560 --> 03:29:06,080
heads which are seven hills and but the tail is a river and there are this many crowns on the head

3878
03:29:06,080 --> 03:29:10,320
this many crowns came before this many crowns will be and this specific crown which if you

3879
03:29:10,320 --> 03:29:14,960
looked at how many scissors they had had up into that point that also matches up with nero

3880
03:29:14,960 --> 03:29:18,880
and all the stuff it says he's going to do is stuff that narrow did it's very much just

3881
03:29:18,880 --> 03:29:23,600
it's a guy in history i think i think it's a i think it's a hebrou thing there's this thing

3882
03:29:23,600 --> 03:29:29,760
called gematria which is just like yeah yeah it's it's he he does it as well yeah maybe maybe the

3883
03:29:29,760 --> 03:29:34,160
romans also did it uh yeah it's roman the romans had like had their version of it but like there

3884
03:29:34,160 --> 03:29:39,440
was a similar thing in hebrou as well too yeah but the number six six six and six one six comes

3923
03:34:25,360 --> 03:34:31,520
haha i wasn't really a virgin it was all an act i was nearly pretending to be a virgin

3924
03:34:32,080 --> 03:34:38,320
full show wow please don't write in newspaper that i'm a virgin i've had sex i pleased multiples

3925
03:34:38,320 --> 03:34:44,000
of times i was fooled but i was listening to the draw costs again and there was this one episode

3926
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:51,600
where it was like locally sad and distraught about her art style and she was talking about how

3927
03:34:51,600 --> 03:34:58,080
she felt she was shit because she didn't have like the technique and i just felt really sad about

3928
03:34:58,080 --> 03:35:04,240
that because i really like your art style i'm really like the way you use color and shape design

3929
03:35:04,240 --> 03:35:10,640
i think it's really expressive and it's something i really miss in my art so i thought i'd call in

3930
03:35:10,640 --> 03:35:16,400
and just let you know in case you might still feel that way because i think it would be really

3931
03:35:16,400 --> 03:35:22,640
sad if you felt like that about your art style because of some weird notion of what constitutes

3932
03:35:22,640 --> 03:35:31,040
technically able good art it's funny i am uh consistently down on myself that's true um

3933
03:35:31,680 --> 03:35:38,160
it's not that it's not good um i know i've gotten better over time i think my art style right now

3934
03:35:38,160 --> 03:35:46,960
is pretty good uh obviously well it's not obvious but i i do i do want to improve in various ways

3935
03:35:48,080 --> 03:35:54,640
but like uh i don't shit on myself quite as much yeah you feel you feel i'm i'm getting better at

3936
03:35:54,640 --> 03:36:01,280
your yeah i'm good like like like later later later chapters of cleric gun smoke i read like

3937
03:36:01,760 --> 03:36:08,000

3938
03:36:08,000 --> 03:36:13,440
layout and the the expressions i'm like oh my god i'm actually emotionally moved by my own comic

3939
03:36:13,440 --> 03:36:18,480

solo queue shit that nobody asked for all right and it was thanks for keeping me abreast of the

4002
03:43:55,520 --> 03:44:06,560
heads up uh next one is called uh pcp appreciation from this is from prince isolation three two one

4003
03:44:06,560 --> 03:44:16,000
go hello everybody with this new content renaissance of sorts that the pcp has recently

4004
03:44:16,000 --> 03:44:22,800
been seeming to go through with uh both people starting to stream again uh the possibility of

4005
03:44:22,800 --> 03:44:30,400
the perfect comic party and uh things overall looking looking a little bit more uh content wet

4006
03:44:30,400 --> 03:44:39,120
as opposed to content dry i thought that maybe it would be fun to sometimes you know call in

4007
03:44:39,120 --> 03:44:46,800
with a little voicemail that's just appreciating uh the the content uh that that that we're all

4008
03:44:46,800 --> 03:44:55,200
enjoying from the pcp and from ben and gave and from all the uh nasty little creature uh guests

4009
03:44:55,200 --> 03:45:04,080
and site people um true on the podcast so um without further ado i want to inaugurate the

4010
03:45:05,040 --> 03:45:14,080
ben and gave appreciation hour or the procrastinators appreciation hour uh and you know i don't even

4011
03:45:14,080 --> 03:45:18,640
want to be the only one to do this if you have something you appreciate about ben and gave call

4012
03:45:18,640 --> 03:45:25,520
into the podcast and talk about it yeah do it i agree it's really cringe and annoying maybe but

4013
03:45:25,520 --> 03:45:35,520
also i don't know i like it i agree you should tell me what you like about me yes it would be nice

4014
03:45:35,520 --> 03:45:45,280
tell me nice things keep me going in this dark world we live in i'm feeling particularly content

4015
03:45:45,280 --> 03:45:55,840
wet as they say um i'm feeling my my fire emblem streams have been fun i want to do more often

4016
03:45:55,840 --> 03:46:02,320
oh yeah because i somebody in the last stream did the tallied up it was crunchy crunchy spoon

4017
03:46:02,320 --> 03:46:08,560
tallied up um the the average time to beat all fire emblem games and it was like 600 something

4018
03:46:08,560 --> 03:46:15,120
hours and if i played like five hours uh during one stream like per week it would take like multiple

4019
03:46:15,120 --> 03:46:21,920
years to play them all i think some some some big number that was like uh you know i could probably

4020
03:46:21,920 --> 03:46:28,480
do more than one stream a week i don't know when though uh but at the moment Clarissa is taking

4021
03:46:28,480 --> 03:46:36,160
priority yeah for the foreseeable future so i don't know i but like i'm i'm i'm enjoying being more

4022
03:46:36,960 --> 03:46:45,040
doing of stuff it's very good to be doing stuff um yeah i'm feeling i mean i'm not like

4023
03:46:45,040 --> 03:46:50,080
i haven't been drawing but i have been getting stuff done lately for what feels like the first

4024
03:46:50,080 --> 03:46:58,560
time in a while and that's exciting um so yeah it's pretty wet yeah moist yeah when it rains at

4025
03:46:58,560 --> 03:47:06,160
course yeah and i'm and i'm drenched i'm soaking wet uh right now okay next one is called pcp

4028
03:47:22,400 --> 03:47:36,480

4029
03:47:36,480 --> 03:47:42,800
gibbism was that me i didn't sound like me i don't think it was you i think it was but it sounded

4030
03:47:42,800 --> 03:47:49,200
like a gibbism well i remember saying back when i got back from a break but that doesn't sound

4031
03:47:49,200 --> 03:47:57,120
like me no listen to it i i'm not sure i feel like i feel like i feel like it's an impersonation

4032
03:47:57,120 --> 03:48:03,120
of you oh this is just meant to appreciate like what you say when you get back to a stream

4033
03:48:04,080 --> 03:48:11,200
oh but hey i guess i did say well the next one is ben coming back to a stream uh so maybe these

4034
03:48:11,200 --> 03:48:18,960
are partner content okay oh no it's 30 seconds yeah i don't know three two one go

4035
03:48:22,160 --> 03:48:27,120
all right let's start again with the stream okay uh let's get started

4036
03:48:28,240 --> 03:48:34,560
oh is there is there even a reason to go on

4037
03:48:34,720 --> 03:48:40,800
oh oh is there even a reason to go on can i do can i do it can i do this

4038
03:48:42,160 --> 03:48:49,040
oh god i don't know i don't know okay let's just oh let's just start okay

4039
03:48:51,280 --> 03:48:59,600
i mean first of all true second second of all i mean that's a bit is exacerbated by the fact

4040
03:48:59,600 --> 03:49:05,120
that i was streaming battle network uh blivvy and you were there okay something something nice

4041
03:49:05,120 --> 03:49:08,560
i was there right i was there for a little bit yeah you were there maybe you weren't there

4042
03:49:09,200 --> 03:49:15,040
did i already ask were you there when gamers tavern gave me those maps did i say that already

4043
03:49:16,000 --> 03:49:22,000
uh i think you tried asking a question like 40 minutes ago when she was talking maybe that's

4044
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:28,000
what the question was well yeah okay so so so battle network is really annoying because there's

4045
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:33,040
so many random battles and it's really hard to navigate the maps and you get lost really easily

4046
03:49:33,040 --> 03:49:37,760
and i don't know where i'm going and it's honestly it's kind of a nightmare but during this during

4047
03:49:37,760 --> 03:49:43,760
the last stream on friday gamers tavern uh messaged me a link to a zip file that had all

4048
03:49:43,760 --> 03:49:48,640
the in-game maps in it so now i can just look at the maps and know where to go and it's genuinely

4049
03:49:48,640 --> 03:49:53,920
i feel like this is going to cut my play time in half and it makes me like so much less annoyed

4050
03:49:54,800 --> 03:50:02,560
by it like it's it's a really great uh help so you know i probably was whinging a lot you

4051
03:50:02,560 --> 03:50:06,960
have cheated the game and yourself you have learned nothing you have gained nothing yes

4052
03:50:06,960 --> 03:50:14,080
and i'm so happy and i i probably was whinging a lot because the game um was really being a

4053
03:50:14,080 --> 03:50:19,120
book with its pages stuck together for a while there uh i was only in the stream for like 20

4054
03:50:19,120 --> 03:50:24,000

4099
03:55:43,600 --> 03:55:50,800
the i don't know because there was the the voice girl from last week was a pcp 500 that was not me

4100
03:55:51,600 --> 03:55:55,360
alizar seemed to think it was me he was like hey do you have that one i'm like no i didn't do that

4101
03:55:55,360 --> 03:56:02,720
one i did the other nate ones my nate was better but i also had probably had better training data

4102
03:56:02,720 --> 03:56:10,160
for it because i i still have every and i only have this for nate every like wave cleaned up

4103
03:56:10,160 --> 03:56:16,480
like pristine like fully background noise do you have that from when you were the pcp editor is

4104
03:56:16,480 --> 03:56:22,960
that why yes i see i also have all the voicemails from back then because it's always fun to like

4105
03:56:22,960 --> 03:56:28,640
take an old voicemail and fuck with it and then you won't recognize my voice this is why it's not me

4106
03:56:29,440 --> 03:56:36,400
we've given over our voices to oblivion fault to train ai's on and create create content out of

4107
03:56:36,400 --> 03:56:44,480
and just remix i only do it with public figures and nate people people people that i know personally

4108
03:56:44,480 --> 03:56:50,080
i won't do it with unless they explicitly ask me to and enthusiastically consent to uh being

4109
03:56:50,080 --> 03:56:59,200
turned into a fucking meme um i mean uh i am cool with it as long as it's funny is if it's funny

4134
03:59:50,640 --> 03:59:59,840
word the one piece chapter so are we on chapter 10 75 is that the one mm-hmm okay okay so we got

4135
03:59:59,840 --> 04:00:09,680
labo phase death game labo yeah and there is a vega vega punk on the cover gora say granted an

4136
04:00:09,680 --> 04:00:16,800
audience with the five elders due to scientific genius so he won the scientist competition

4137
04:00:16,800 --> 04:00:26,240
with the bubble tanks i guess and then mm-hmm you got to speak to them gotcha makes sense to me

4138
04:00:28,080 --> 04:00:32,960
oh i see when the screen dies it becomes the flag of a finland or whatever

4139
04:00:33,280 --> 04:00:41,760
that's um that's a joke that's a joke i just made about this panel right here

4140
04:00:42,400 --> 04:00:51,120
oh it's scotland i don't yeah i'm sure finland is a right angle top left uh no is scotland the

4141
04:00:51,120 --> 04:00:57,280
blue the blue and white yeah diagonal okay yeah some andrew's cross or something yes yeah the

4142
04:00:57,280 --> 04:01:02,960
saint andrew's cross is the is the diagonal one right they can't leave because the lasers will

4143
04:01:02,960 --> 04:01:11,360
shoot them right that's still happening uh yes the lasers will shoot them because the control thingy

4144
04:01:11,360 --> 04:01:22,800
is offline okay organoid artificial human you guys can create organs i thought vega punk got

4145
04:01:22,800 --> 04:01:33,120
chopped into pieces what okay well what are you confused about well i don't know are they

4146
04:01:33,760 --> 04:01:38,720
she's they're are they are they are they looking at like the seraphim are these like seraphim being

4147
04:01:38,720 --> 04:01:44,720
made in these tanks here like they look like these weird blobs i think they're not seraphim they're

4148
04:01:44,720 --> 04:01:50,400
just sort of like scientific um they're in the laboratory so there's like oh there's all these

4149
04:01:50,400 --> 04:01:57,680
different things not just the seraphim and they're looking at like the the ability to create or the

4150
04:01:57,680 --> 04:02:04,720
organs for like surgery transplants and choppers like wow medical science is amazing you can that's

4151
04:02:04,720 --> 04:02:10,720
so cool my my translation said it's an organoid an organoid had an asterisk and a translator

4152
04:02:10,720 --> 04:02:17,120
note that said artificial human so i'm yeah i don't know it sounded like she was saying they're

4153
04:02:17,120 --> 04:02:23,200
just growing a human in there uh but i'm i mean chopper says they can you can grow new organs

4154
04:02:23,200 --> 04:02:28,800
that's i get the sense that this part is like kuznami earlier it was like oh you can create

4155
04:02:28,800 --> 04:02:36,480
diamonds um they're like learning the value of science i guess yeah learning learning all about

4156
04:02:36,480 --> 04:02:42,960
the important lesson that science is the future and the future is cool the camera feeds keep going

4157
04:02:42,960 --> 04:02:50,240
scottish one after they just keep going scottish yeah so they've they've split up okay they've split

4158
04:02:50,240 --> 04:03:00,000
up into to look for dr vega punk for stella and we know that he's with bonnie in the kuma room

4159
04:03:00,880 --> 04:03:08,320
ha ha kuma kuma mm-hmm a bubble gun these strong bubbles can reflect anything ah just like just

4160
04:03:08,320 --> 04:03:14,000
like kuma's just like the pacifist's bubble shield hmm just like bubble-based technology

4161
04:03:14,000 --> 04:03:23,440
just like gomo gomo fulsen yes yes the most powerful technique it's an attack that bounces

4162
04:03:23,440 --> 04:03:34,240
things back hmm i didn't realize that the the vega punk the the eating and sleeping and pooping

4163
04:03:34,240 --> 04:03:40,640
vega punk is like a giant i didn't realize she was yeah i i don't think you ever saw her from like

4164
04:03:40,640 --> 04:03:46,720
next to someone else yeah lying down with like smaller robots i assumed there was very tiny

4165
04:03:46,720 --> 04:03:54,800
robots all around her but no she's just really big yeah it's still so fucking weird that they all

4166
04:03:54,800 --> 04:04:02,720
feel the satisfied the satisfaction of taking a shit after she does do they do they all feel this

4167
04:04:03,360 --> 04:04:07,200
i think so i think that was like the introduction to us like she i'm hooked and they were like

4168
04:04:07,200 --> 04:04:12,720
ah finally she is like she like feels the satisfaction for all of them like she

4169
04:04:14,000 --> 04:04:18,320
is the one that handles all the eating and the pooping and the sleeping and she's just like

4170
04:04:18,320 --> 04:04:27,520
oh i love it oh i forget i don't remember if they comment that like oh yep i feel that other

4171
04:04:27,520 --> 04:04:35,840
self is taking a shit and i'm a big fan i guess that would be weird it's pretty it is weird uh

4172
04:04:36,640 --> 04:04:41,600
okay the Pythagoras is head because his little feet yeah his little

4173
04:04:44,000 --> 04:04:47,920
guys little feet oh no okay it's the star eye

4174
04:04:49,360 --> 04:04:57,200
okay stop york don't get any closer i don't know she has been turned to two stones she is

4175
04:04:57,200 --> 04:05:04,000
dead why can she shoot a laser is it just because she's got pacifista laser technology

4176
04:05:04,560 --> 04:05:16,640
pretty sure that's that's why yeah oh beam beam is it like based on kizaru fruit is that

4177
04:05:16,640 --> 04:05:21,600
i don't know i don't i just imagine that i mean it looks like it in the anime it looks exactly like

4178
04:05:21,600 --> 04:05:27,040
like kizaru is uh what is it what is it the pika pika fruit i can't remember the name but yeah

4179
04:05:27,040 --> 04:05:34,240
sounds all right um i think it's pika pika i don't think they ever say the the pacifista

4180
04:05:34,240 --> 04:05:39,200
just have lasers and then frankie learns how to make a laser so i think it's just a science thing

4181
04:05:40,240 --> 04:05:47,360
frankie finds vega punks like um old lab in the two-year timeskip and he learns a bunch of vega

4182
04:05:47,360 --> 04:05:52,000
punk stuff and one of the things he learns is how to make a laser beam just like the pacifistas did

4183
04:05:54,000 --> 04:05:59,200
and then he comes back and he do and he does a little beam and everyone's like oh cool frankie

4184
04:05:59,200 --> 04:06:06,800
you're so much better i suppose lasers are just a thing you can make in in science yeah i made a

4185
04:06:06,800 --> 04:06:17,040
laser beam one time out of a fluorescent tube but i did it no didn't not true actually this

4186
04:06:17,520 --> 04:06:22,800
okay the proportions on this kuma are like really stupid look how stupid he looks uh this one right

4187
04:06:22,800 --> 04:06:28,080
here yeah he looks really dumb i mean he's a child he's just a kid he's just a boy oh it's

4188
04:06:28,080 --> 04:06:38,320
wait a minute yeah but they're all children right hold on a second no no okay i thought that this one

4189
04:06:39,680 --> 04:06:43,840
this one i thought was an adult like this he was made first and i thought it was just like the ones

4190
04:06:43,840 --> 04:06:51,280
that just woke up are the kids because didn't we see kuma didn't we see child kuma in in the memory

4191
04:06:51,280 --> 04:07:01,120
bubble and he didn't look like this uh no but we don't know like we don't know exactly how their

4192
04:07:01,120 --> 04:07:09,040
model i mean i picked up that they're like oh the seraphim are children and therefore his bigger hit

4193
04:07:09,040 --> 04:07:15,360
means that he's like younger than his adult self yeah he doesn't he doesn't have quite the

4194
04:07:15,360 --> 04:07:21,120
jawline yet and he's sort of softer looking yeah i guess yeah maybe this is just like him as like a

4195
04:07:21,120 --> 04:07:28,160
teenager or like an adolescent whereas the one we saw in the memory was like little boy little boy

4196
04:07:28,160 --> 04:07:34,160
but he looked he looked like a completely different little boy he did i guess it's the hat and the

4197
04:07:34,240 --> 04:07:40,320
eyes being like white that changes it a lot it's the jaw it's the yeah him wearing the hat

4198
04:07:41,040 --> 04:07:49,520
and the and the chin he has some chin here he had no chin in the memory okay okay i gotta read

4199
04:07:51,520 --> 04:07:58,960
so so who ordered the pacifistas to do this the seraphim the seraphim

4200
04:07:59,680 --> 04:08:01,680
i

4201
04:08:03,520 --> 04:08:09,360
i think the the only reason oh the it's oh it says here the one that who gave this command was

4202
04:08:09,360 --> 04:08:15,520
vega punk if my orders are being obeyed then i mean okay it must be by the original vega punk

4203
04:08:15,600 --> 04:08:21,760
which is like hmm it's a little little sus uh

4204
04:08:25,360 --> 04:08:27,920
because it wasn't because sentomaru outranks

4205
04:08:30,080 --> 04:08:36,000
the cp-zeros but it wasn't him and the only one that outranks sentomaru

4206
04:08:36,800 --> 04:08:42,400
is vega punk so if you're not listening to cp-zeros and then the gurus say above vega punk

4207
04:08:42,480 --> 04:08:48,640
then vega punk must have told them to do this right is that right yeah that's that's the only

4208
04:08:48,640 --> 04:08:56,400
explanation and the at least based on what he's saying here is that the vega punk prime the stella

4209
04:08:57,360 --> 04:09:06,240
said um kill everyone or at least they seem to be i see we don't know whether they're

4210
04:09:06,240 --> 04:09:11,280
fighting the straw hats necessarily because the straw hats are with different groups of people

4211
04:09:11,760 --> 04:09:21,120
with a different vega punk and also the cp-zero but i i don't know like what the hell could this

4212
04:09:21,120 --> 04:09:32,080
order be for i mean we've seen stella is just like a baby with bonnie and he seemed like he didn't

4213
04:09:33,120 --> 04:09:38,080
when would he have had time to give this order to the seraphim to commit

4214
04:09:38,960 --> 04:09:50,560
it war it's it's odd um because early on in the chapter there was like oh there's a mysterious

4215
04:09:50,560 --> 04:09:55,120
person there and we learned that it's the the seraphim walking around destroying cameras

4216
04:09:55,760 --> 04:10:03,920
so they don't want anyone to know and there have been like tiny hints that like the seraphim are not

4217
04:10:04,000 --> 04:10:12,480
like quite like the pacifista in that they're not totally robotic yeah they're like they have a bit

4218
04:10:12,480 --> 04:10:18,560
of humanity in them zoro felt something when he was fighting me hawk yeah earlier yeah and so it's

4219
04:10:18,560 --> 04:10:26,000
like are they acting of their own volition at this point what would they want maybe i don't know

4220
04:10:28,080 --> 04:10:33,280
i don't know either could could the seraphim have been a failed experiment and it's like

4221
04:10:33,360 --> 04:10:38,000
shit's going wrong and they're just like you know what we don't want to be uh friends

4222
04:10:39,920 --> 04:10:47,280
actually i mean this kuma was obeying the cp-zero but maybe he was maybe he was just pretending the

4223
04:10:47,280 --> 04:10:56,000
whole time yeah maybe they're just maybe they're just going going rogue hey oh oh but but but number

4224
04:10:56,000 --> 04:11:02,080
one i forgot this part he says yeah between the communications blackout the barrier sealing us in

4225
04:11:03,040 --> 04:11:08,160
and the seraphim rebelling seems to look it seems like it's an elaborate plan somebody's trying to

4226
04:11:08,160 --> 04:11:15,760
kill us all so that could be vega punk who's who said be like who said that uh the number one

4227
04:11:15,760 --> 04:11:22,160
face oh shaka yeah shaka yeah i see him right at the end like he he says like yeah because we don't

4228
04:11:22,160 --> 04:11:30,400
know who how the communications were blacked out we thought it was somebody else but like who else

4229
04:11:30,400 --> 04:11:37,680
is there like stella has been revealed to be now i although she's with vega punk maybe she still

4230
04:11:37,680 --> 04:11:47,440
isn't a now i and it's like a double ruse you mean you mean stussy stussy sorry yeah so many

4231
04:11:48,080 --> 04:11:51,360
in this chapter in this in this arc two

4232
04:11:58,240 --> 04:12:05,280
yeah yeah i mean i guess we're i guess we didn't recap the chapter we didn't recap last chapter

4233
04:12:05,280 --> 04:12:10,640
listen the last episode if you want to hear last chapter well i guess well no i mean like

4234
04:12:11,200 --> 04:12:16,640
you read it but we didn't really talk about every page no but yeah things are destroying the cameras

4235
04:12:17,760 --> 04:12:24,160
um shaka's like what's going on everybody's split up nami and brook are with the little guy

4236
04:12:25,920 --> 04:12:31,680
and they're finding like diamonds that are artificially generated and she's getting money eyes

4237
04:12:32,400 --> 04:12:38,880
belly eyes um chopper and robin are with the big big one

4238
04:12:41,120 --> 04:12:45,840
and they're and they're they're doing the classic like arc everyone split up and search for clues

4239
04:12:46,560 --> 04:12:50,640
sort of so that you can be in a different situation right different place so you can have a different

4240
04:12:50,640 --> 04:12:55,840
bath time time to pair up our characters in different combinations and see what kind of

4241
04:12:55,840 --> 04:13:05,440
chemistry they have together yeah classic and then classic bit so like everyone's splitting up

4242
04:13:06,400 --> 04:13:15,360
uh sanji says uh he'll be a dog for for us to see yep same that's that's same that's pretty funny

4243
04:13:16,240 --> 04:13:22,880
uh all right this this graph uh i'm a little bit unclear on what's being communicated here in this

4244
04:13:23,840 --> 04:13:29,680
uh oh and then food lady gets destroyed food lady gets completely obliterated she's turned

4245
04:13:29,680 --> 04:13:36,960
turned to stone kicked by uh amazon and then boahankov that's right this this like tower here

4246
04:13:36,960 --> 04:13:45,440
okay so this is like so they're in tower a and it looks like tower b and tower c have been like

4247
04:13:45,440 --> 04:13:52,560
blown up and and like has the the top of tower a has been like cut off i kind of don't remember

4248
04:13:52,560 --> 04:14:02,560
when that happened uh well it was just before the seraphim had been calmed down um if you remember

4249
04:14:02,560 --> 04:14:06,960
they got up there and then they started blowing shit up okay yeah because they were still with

4250
04:14:06,960 --> 04:14:16,400
cp0 um and then one of the vega punks i think it was the little guy he flew at them and he was like

4251
04:14:16,400 --> 04:14:21,600
wait stop and he just got the commander in time and then they all stopped but by that point

4252
04:14:22,160 --> 04:14:29,040
mihawk uh had sliced oh mihawk oh yeah hey and the other two had blown stuff up okay so it's like

4253
04:14:29,040 --> 04:14:36,480
doesn't mihawk uh doesn't mihawk have like a legendary blade so like is i wonder if is this

4254
04:14:36,480 --> 04:14:41,520
uh like child mihawk like he's got a similar looking sword i wonder if it's just like a replica

4255
04:14:41,520 --> 04:14:47,280
and like it's not as good i i would imagine it's not as good or just like it's made of

4256
04:14:47,920 --> 04:14:54,560
you know it's it's comparable maybe yeah i mean this guy's got like world government money could

4257
04:14:54,560 --> 04:14:58,320
probably afford maybe they commission maybe they could duplicate maybe they could duplicate the

4258
04:14:58,320 --> 04:15:04,400
powers of like a cursed blade with uh with with science somehow like a hacky and flute infused

4259
04:15:04,400 --> 04:15:09,760
blade i mean they can make frickin anything else they want they copy these like legendary people

4260
04:15:09,760 --> 04:15:14,000
and their fruit powers like they it seems like yeah they can just fucking do anything

4261
04:15:15,360 --> 04:15:22,720
making a magic sword seems like a a trifle compared to all this so yeah wouldn't be too surprised

4262
04:15:23,840 --> 04:15:28,400
yeah so the main thing of the whole chapter is people are split up and then the seraphim are

4263
04:15:28,400 --> 04:15:40,000
evil we got uh bow handcock with usopp and frankie and then uh mihawk and kuma seraphim

4264
04:15:40,960 --> 04:15:47,600
are charging up trying to kill the cp zero guys and so they're fighting or they're about to fight

4265
04:15:47,600 --> 04:15:55,120
luffy and zoro uh we don't know where the gym bay one is yeah he is not pictured

4266
04:15:55,440 --> 04:15:58,400
yeah i think there's only those four

4267
04:16:00,400 --> 04:16:07,040
uh so are they they're they're all in like separate towers right or are they just on

4268
04:16:07,040 --> 04:16:16,400
different they have towers c floor three tower b floor two tower a floor two tower a floor two

4269
04:16:17,360 --> 04:16:22,640
all right they started in tower a floor three building c third floor

4270
04:16:25,600 --> 04:16:31,520
all right we're yeah that's setting up this for stuff yeah this is starting to get a little

4271
04:16:31,520 --> 04:16:37,040
bit like wano like okay the floating city is up here and then there's like a tunnel down here and

4272
04:16:37,040 --> 04:16:42,240
like the the magma is like going down through the thing and it's going to hit the weapon store

4273
04:16:42,320 --> 04:16:49,520
which is down below everything even when oda does these little maps with labels for all

4274
04:16:49,520 --> 04:16:55,600
these different sections and then says you know when you cut to a different uh situation with

4275
04:16:55,600 --> 04:17:00,400
different characters and there's a little box saying oh this is the left side of the great

4276
04:17:00,400 --> 04:17:07,440
hall or something um i'm like i cannot understand what that is i can't hold it in my mind all at

4277
04:17:07,440 --> 04:17:12,800
the same time it's it's it's better on the anime because like they have like little animations for

4278
04:17:12,800 --> 04:17:18,560
little floating heads that move here and there in fact i did that in bell shape i remember

4279
04:17:19,680 --> 04:17:26,400
doing a little bell shape one of those because i liked it i see yeah i can get that image

4280
04:17:27,040 --> 04:17:33,440
all right well i mean i i think i've um i think i've pretty much got to handle on what happens

4281
04:17:33,440 --> 04:17:40,480
this chapter oh he's not oh yeah yeah yeah yeah this one this map it's like dare they all are

4282
04:17:40,480 --> 04:17:47,920
i remember there was uh yes so coherent a lot going on oh yeah oh right bell jake was good

4283
04:17:47,920 --> 04:17:57,040
action i i forgot bell jake was kind of cool actually hmm now i remember bell jake when's bell jake

4284
04:17:57,040 --> 04:18:06,160
too you know once i finish Clarissa i think bell jake two is the next like thing people want to see

4285
04:18:08,000 --> 04:18:15,040
so i'll probably work on it then i think um i think this week i should probably

4286
04:18:16,000 --> 04:18:21,760
having finished a bunch of other stuff i think my work this week is probably gonna be uh the

4287
04:18:21,760 --> 04:18:28,720
the pcp website and um yeah i should probably get started on on bscapades and pick that up i

4288
04:18:28,720 --> 04:18:34,960
should actually like get to it i guess i haven't really even touched it it's all been just it's

4289
04:18:34,960 --> 04:18:47,040
all been talk so far um i have to do something about that uh yeah too hard so hard but i'm

4290
04:18:47,840 --> 04:18:53,760
how fast do you think you can make what however many panels you're thinking of

4291
04:18:55,200 --> 04:19:00,880
i i i don't really know how many i'm thinking like drawing it is like is kind of secondary

4292
04:19:00,880 --> 04:19:06,880
to us thinking up what is gonna happen wait say what for for bscapades like drawing it isn't that

4293
04:19:07,520 --> 04:19:12,000
strenuous it's more like trying to keep everything in your head like where the story's going and

4294
04:19:12,000 --> 04:19:16,960
writing the most the most daunting part is that i have to go back and i have to reread it to remember

4295
04:19:16,960 --> 04:19:22,320
like where i was and like what was going on and and recall like what i was gonna have happen next

4296
04:19:22,320 --> 04:19:30,720
i've kind of forgotten and lost the the plot so i just have to do that and and until then i

4297
04:19:30,720 --> 04:19:39,600
don't even remember like what the plan was i have to figure it out uh and so i yeah i don't even know

4298
04:19:39,600 --> 04:19:43,280
i don't even know how how long the like next chunk is gonna be

4299
04:19:45,200 --> 04:19:49,280
ah but i fortunately it's on my website so i can just go and read it all there

4300
04:19:49,280 --> 04:19:55,040
and i'm sure i'll take it pick it right back up yeah actually drawing the pages is not that hard

4301
04:19:55,040 --> 04:20:02,160
especially if i kind of issue the like gifs thing because like i mean i was doing the gif

4302
04:20:02,160 --> 04:20:09,520
animated like that's not really that necessary for like a pdf version that wouldn't carry

4303
04:20:09,600 --> 04:20:14,000
over so yeah it's not it's not that important if there's something i really want to animate like

4304
04:20:14,000 --> 04:20:22,400
i can do an animated panel it should be like check out the animated version here dummy dummy idiot

4305
04:20:22,400 --> 04:20:26,960
stupid why are you reading this on a static format nerd check it out on the worldwide web

4306
04:20:27,840 --> 04:20:34,960
whoa whoa what all right to to cap off one piece because we finished talking about it um

4307
04:20:35,600 --> 04:20:42,640
and then the cp0 are gonna team up looks like the straw hats in order to fight the seraphim

4308
04:20:42,640 --> 04:20:50,480
we're just gonna be up a little bit of a hijink i think uh they don't like to look oh man how

4309
04:20:50,480 --> 04:20:58,080
quickly how quickly the turntables enemies become allies it's my favorite trope to lovers yeah um

4310
04:20:58,240 --> 04:21:05,920
it's funny because it's like luci was always such a you know back in the day that was like

4311
04:21:05,920 --> 04:21:13,200
well captain smoker he's the bad guy but then you beat you beat him or like you're more powerful

4312
04:21:13,200 --> 04:21:18,720
and he run away and he's like ah those dang straw hats but he sort of respects them and it's like

4313
04:21:18,720 --> 04:21:24,240
yeah you know what this smoker guy is not so bad but then there's luci and he's like this guy is a

4314
04:21:24,320 --> 04:21:29,040
murderer killing she has a real fucking sicko yeah there's no way this guy could have a vegeta

4315
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:35,200
moment but here we are where he's forced to be friendly i mean he's still a i mean i guess he's

4316
04:21:35,200 --> 04:21:39,680
still a bad guy but you know he's definitely still a bad guy we need all the help we can get against

4317
04:21:39,680 --> 04:21:49,760
these he's he's not as bloodthirsty as he used to be he is he's just sort of like i mean i haven't

4318
04:21:49,760 --> 04:21:56,480
seen anything to suggest that he's like nicer or no he's not nicer but like it's it's just the

4319
04:21:57,040 --> 04:22:02,960
it's just a vibe like forced forced camaraderie he's wearing white now he's wearing white now

4320
04:22:02,960 --> 04:22:12,240
he's a good guy but what about what about all that white guilt yeah true yeah never mind

4321
04:22:13,200 --> 04:22:21,040
that's much much much better much better way to interpret it well i don't know i think that's

4322
04:22:21,040 --> 04:22:27,040
it that's all i have to say about it the one thing i have to mention about okay the this chapter

4323
04:22:27,840 --> 04:22:35,120
two panels that look exactly the same it's when i think it's lila uh is screaming

4324
04:22:36,560 --> 04:22:41,760
yeah she's like she's like what a seraphim why are you here you scroll down a bit and she's like

4325
04:22:41,760 --> 04:22:46,400
quit joking around we don't stand a chance it's exactly the same oh my god angle yeah they do

4326
04:22:48,800 --> 04:22:54,480
she's just maybe it's just like yelling and i i know why it's that way it's because her eyes

4327
04:22:55,120 --> 04:22:59,520
are covered on that one side of her face so you have to show her from that angle when

4328
04:22:59,520 --> 04:23:06,160
you show her saying anything and she's also still scared and shocked so she's screaming and it's the

4329
04:23:06,160 --> 04:23:10,400
same face and it's the same angle it's just like i guess she's screaming louder in the second one

4330
04:23:10,400 --> 04:23:15,200
it's just like a little bit louder you've got to do something to differentiate it it's funny

4331
04:23:15,200 --> 04:23:23,600
yeah it's very it's very similar true you make a guess lilith is cool lilith looks awesome her hair

4332
04:23:23,600 --> 04:23:31,600
rules her jacket is yeah they're so cool all of this all of the so fucking cool like lilith especially

4333
04:23:31,600 --> 04:23:39,280
and generally the outfits in this arc are amazing yeah i love them they're all just funny and cool

4334
04:23:39,360 --> 04:23:46,640
but also a little bit like unique and uh fresh yeah it feels a little bit like wasteful sometimes

4335
04:23:46,640 --> 04:23:53,120
when it's like man all this cool shit and it's like you never really get a chance to like take it in

4336
04:23:54,640 --> 04:23:59,600
you know oh to just make so much good shit all the time so many secondary tertiary characters

4337
04:23:59,600 --> 04:24:04,880
that just got funny cool designs that are really cool and you see them for one chapter or two

4338
04:24:04,880 --> 04:24:09,520
chapters and then they're just never again seen well well but then there's like hundreds upon

4339
04:24:09,520 --> 04:24:14,240
hundreds of characters that are just really good the more it goes on the more you keep seeing these

4340
04:24:14,240 --> 04:24:18,960
old characters that were seen like one time and it's like oh they're back like oh what are let's

4341
04:24:18,960 --> 04:24:25,120
check in on what they're up to like oh they're like you know at uh marriage or oh they were at the

4342
04:24:25,120 --> 04:24:29,840
reverie or oh they're like working inside the world government or they're in the marines trying to do

4343
04:24:29,840 --> 04:24:35,600
something or they're on a secret mission or whatever they'll be like a throwaway character

4344
04:24:35,600 --> 04:24:40,320
like that and then put so many of them end up like brought back and recycled in some weird new

4345
04:24:41,360 --> 04:24:49,040
context and it's cool when you you know like uh you see a guy that you had he's like oh i totally

4346
04:24:49,040 --> 04:24:57,120
forgot that that was a character but he's back yeah uh it's great i love it

4347
04:25:00,880 --> 04:25:06,160
i guess there's not like a lot going on in this chapter there's no there's not like a lot of

4348
04:25:06,160 --> 04:25:12,240
revelations there's a question though who the fuck just fucking is vega punk bad now is vega

4349
04:25:12,240 --> 04:25:19,440
punk betray us i'm trying to think if there's a likelihood that he is bad because it's like he's

4350
04:25:19,440 --> 04:25:23,680
working with the world government but he knows the world government wants to kill him and he's

4351
04:25:23,680 --> 04:25:28,080
siding with the store has to get him out of there why would he kill him i feel like there's some

4352
04:25:28,080 --> 04:25:34,800
other mysterious third party that is actually here narratively i think if vega punk were evil

4353
04:25:34,800 --> 04:25:39,040
they would not have the characters questioning like wait a minute is vega punk the one who's

4354
04:25:39,040 --> 04:25:47,840
doing this like yeah yeah probably not because we're wondering about it i think it's it's a

4355
04:25:47,840 --> 04:25:55,200
potential misdirect to have the mysterious person going around destroying the cameras be the seraphim

4356
04:25:55,760 --> 04:26:01,200
because it's sort of implied that there is actually a another third party like unknown

4357
04:26:01,200 --> 04:26:06,960
person here doing these things but they're not the seraphim maybe they can talk to the seraphim

4358
04:26:06,960 --> 04:26:12,080
maybe it's a fucking maybe the goro say teleported in because he's just like super strong

4359
04:26:13,840 --> 04:26:18,960
and he's just in there so you do you think there is a third party or do you think it's

4360
04:26:18,960 --> 04:26:23,920
just one of the seraphim like maybe it's the jinbei seraphim who is not around maybe he's the one

4361
04:26:23,920 --> 04:26:30,160
doing it and the seraphim have gone rogue well either the seraphim have gone rogue for some

4362
04:26:30,160 --> 04:26:36,080
reason or another they decided to have their own thoughts and feelings and they've chosen this path

4363
04:26:36,080 --> 04:26:42,080
or foolishly yeah or they are being controlled by either vega punk who is uh for some reason

4364
04:26:42,080 --> 04:26:50,480
telling them to do this or a goro say which is impossible i think um or you know what it could

4365
04:26:50,480 --> 04:26:55,920
be i feel like this would be kind of unsatisfying because it's just sort of like building up a

4366
04:26:55,920 --> 04:27:02,080
mystery for no payoff like maybe it's a mistake in the programming and vega punk's like oh shit

4367
04:27:02,160 --> 04:27:08,720
oh jeez uh i didn't mean for that to happen let me quick this button uh now that now they've

4368
04:27:08,720 --> 04:27:15,840
calmed down again it's like i already did that he just was careless i was like oh i forgot to

4369
04:27:15,840 --> 04:27:24,160
carry the one like whoops like it could be funny but like yeah hmm yeah man

4370
04:27:24,160 --> 04:27:28,800
yeah i think i think it's a bit of a letdown if that's the reason

4371
04:27:30,800 --> 04:27:37,440
i kind of i'm kind of going with the seraphim are going rogue and they're just kind of decided

4372
04:27:38,480 --> 04:27:43,760
to do their own thing and they're they're they're they're they're making a break for it they're

4373
04:27:43,760 --> 04:27:53,200
hatching a plan that seems like what is has been suggested by all the oh there's some humanity in

4374
04:27:53,200 --> 04:28:02,720
you yada yada yeah that's what i'm going for yeah that's the chapter uh all right are we done

4375
04:28:03,440 --> 04:28:08,960
