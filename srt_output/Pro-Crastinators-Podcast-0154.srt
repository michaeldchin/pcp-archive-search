00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of the Productivity Podcast.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,640
And we procrastinate so you don't have to. I'm a procrastinator and now you can too.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,160
Was that from a comment? Or did you just come up with that right now?

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,240
That was on a comment that I stole. Shout out to PacifistBetaFish who sent that comment last episode.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,400
I'm the best guy ever with the most original jokes ever. Munchy's here.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,640
I'm livid about the comments last episode that they were all about politics and not like

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,040
they were like a handful about the other topics. I can't blame them too much for that.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,720
I can. Politics are like a mind virus. I like people appreciated me.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,200
People appreciated me in the comments last episode.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,520
I have things to say. There's a reason I'm here and that episode is the reason.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,960
Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait to obliterate you with an orbital fucking strike.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,520
We'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes. Ben and Tom, we just heard them.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,080
Gibbs here, HippoCrit. Hello. There you go. And of course, Jesse.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,920
Guys, I've got two great topics that we've never talked about on the show before. The first is

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,520
Kingdom Hearts and the second one is going to be debating the merits of capitalism versus

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,480
communism. Oh, I can't wait. What about Pokemon? I think that's a fresh one.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah. We can do three topics this time. Three new topics that are totally fresh.

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
Actually, we can only do one topic per episode. Sorry. I guess you didn't hear.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,360
We've got rules now. We made them. Topic today is telephones. What do you think about phones?

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm against them. The end. Thanks for watching, everybody.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm saying, guys, new topic today, cups. I just don't really know if they're moral,

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,640
you know, they just sort of seem like their life is like as valid as a normal person.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
And I feel like I could just take it. You know, cups are all right, but I prefer,

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,080
I prefer mobs and tankards. Oh, sorry. And, and, you know, the little, the solo cups,

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,360
those are bigger than I thought. The first time I saw a solo cup, I was like, that's big.

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,680
I'm used to like tiny little, tiny little plastic cups and with like one sip and you're done.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,160
You got to refill it something. Yes. European portions. The last time I saw a solo cup,

28
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,320
I thought that that is Luke Skywalker's sister. I thought, what are you talking about?

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,760
I don't get it. I don't get it at all. I thought you were just going to say you

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,600
killed him because he was on his own. No, no, like it's Han Solo, guys, like Star Wars,

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,200
your favorite. Han Solo is not Luke's sister. What are you talking about?

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,160
No, no, he was copying, he was copying Princess Leia who he has sex with. Listen,

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,760
it's not rocket science. I didn't go to Harvard. I went to the fucking dump chair outside your house

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,960
to find this fucking joke. That's right. I'm turning it on you.

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,440
Hey, why don't we make this viewer appreciation day and talk about the, the PCP dating simulator

36
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,600
that just came out that I have not had a chance to play. I also have not had a chance to play it.

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,880
I was too busy. God damn it. Yeah. You guys were too busy bitching about gay politics shit.

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,080
Yeah, I know. It didn't stop after the episode. Hey, I had a busy week. No, no, I got, I got to say,

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,960
I was, because I was talking, I was talking to Hippo yesterday. The message, I'm like,

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,800
wait, stop everyone. More important, it's my birthday. Oh, that is important. It's my birthday.

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,760
Thomas mid-sentence, who cares? We'll get to that later, we'll see how it goes.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,560
That's why I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to say, yeah, I wanted to say it in the middle of the break.

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah, I did it. I fucking got so much, I got so much out of head.

44
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,680
Happy birthday, because Maige really cares about her friend Ben and wanted me to know.

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:55,280
Whoa, amazing. Dude, I, dude, that was the ideal time. I got, I got, I got, I got so much out of that

46
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
announcement. It was crowbarring. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is it. Maige, take a lesson. Maige,

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,360
take a lesson. All right. That's all I got to say. All right, how you fucking do it?

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,400
I've never given you, if you don't start talking right fucking now. There's like a

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,440
giant chasm between the two sides of this podcast now, before and after this interjection, but

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,640
all I was going to say, all I was going to fucking say was that I was listening to last week's PCP,

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,560
because that's what I do. I listen to the ones I'm not on, because I want to know, I want to,

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,480
I want to know what the lore is about. I want to be on point. So the next time I do show up,

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,040
I'm not out of the loop. You know, I don't, I got to be on the Zemp, the them snakes cannon

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,840
and everything. That's why I'm almost always on them, because I can't bear the thought of listening

55
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,160
to one. So let me tell you, let me fucking tell you, I was having a great time. It was one of my

56
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,400
favorite episodes in a long time. It was all this like interesting talk about creativity.

57
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,080
And I was fucking hype. I was like, this is like a return to form. This is great.

58
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,160
And then, and then at the very end, my, I immediately go totally flaccid because it

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:08,880
turns into the same old political bullshit. Oh my God. Good solid discussion. And then it turned

60
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,000
into gay shit again. Well, people in the comments hadn't been fucking wrong. I wouldn't have had to

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,800
correct them. But you know what, literally, it just is our, like, like, okay, Tom, I'm completely

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,560
with you. I resonate with you. But look at the comments. No one gave a shit about the art goals.

63
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,520
No one cares about that. If the show is to entertain and to make the most down people

64
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,840
like interested, everyone like cared about the that the politics more than the art goals and

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,960
wanted to comment on that. It could just be the politics or like a hot button issue and people

66
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,800
are like more likely to like comment about them. But like, like what there is there's

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,400
productivity cast. There were some dude like saying that like, I don't know, like, like,

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,920
there was just a handful of comments, maybe majority of them were just about interrupting

69
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,680
mage and politics. So I don't know. Maybe we should focus on the things that people are more

70
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,760
interested in, in a way, like interrupting me, like, making mage feel bad. That's what got the

71
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,320
most comments. So we should, we should double down. We should lean in. I did see those with

72
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,520
the top comments. They were, they were. This is I guess this really is a viewer appreciation slash

73
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,320
response episode thus far. Oh, I see a f y sama on the top 37 minutes ago just says, would you guys

74
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,360
stop with the politics? That's so some of the politics commentary is to just say to shut up

75
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,120
about it. I do agree that politics is wrong and no one should ever speak of them. But then again,

76
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Ben also raised a, Ben also raised a good point. He said the commenters were wrong.

77
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,440
So I have to side with Ben on this point. We can't have commenters going around being wrong.

78
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,840
What am I just gonna let them be wrong? Forget about it. Yeah, okay.

79
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,400
About that PCP dating symbol. I played it. I played got all the endings. There's well, I mean,

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,920
there's like, there's not really endings. You just do certain different branches. You go to speak

81
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:14,160
to like Digi, Munchie, or me, or Mage. Not everyone is in the thing yet. But I really,

82
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,280
really, really like all of the little references in the dialogue and the backgrounds. I love them

83
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,040
in the background. And you know, I've got like a like a weird like, like hip thrust, like sexy

84
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,680
pose going on. That's, that's funny. I'm laughing about it. You're like a main character. You're

85
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,800
like the childhood friend or something. I am a childhood friend character. I heard that I'm not

86
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,560
in the demo. Is that true? Yeah. But I mean, your influence is pervades. It's a progressive story.

87
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,480
They just haven't gotten everything yet. Well, I mean, hope, I mean, okay, by the time this episode

88
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,560
is out, I will have played it. But as of right now, I have not to my shame to my shame. We should

89
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,440
play on the nice man. That's part of the variety. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Munchie. We recorded. Okay,

90
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,440
but this won't be a spoiler by the time this is out. We recorded me playing trying to kill the

91
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,760
rowdy rat. Dude. And then since I failed to do so, immediately, we should do it. I should,

92
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,440
I should do it on the on the stream. I should do it live. Everyone got blue gets blue balled

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,360
in the in the video, but then they can see it live. That's a good idea. Yeah. Oh, I was so

94
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:27,440
tantalizingly close. Okay. All right. Was that surprise? What was that the surprise you're

95
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,000
going to tell me before the show? Oh, no. Okay, the surprises that I have a new energy drink

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,080
to best you. Really? Okay. Well, first of all, okay. Okay. The score so far, I have bang and I

97
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,720
have rain on my side. I have monster ultra. I have gridlock and now you have gridlock. Okay.

98
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,240
And now I have spike. Spike. Spike hardcore energy. I can tell just by looking at it that it's

99
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
shit because it's one of those cans that is like just one color. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,240
Yeah, this has no graphic design. This is the opposite. Have you had it yet? I'm opening my very

101
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,440
first can of spike blue razz right now. Okay. I was on my way home from birthday breakfast with

102
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,040
the parents and I was like, Hey, hey, dad, pull into the 7-Eleven because I was looking for bang.

103
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:27,200
I got to grab the wheel and steer it right in through the windows and I did not they did not

104
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,440
have bang. However, they did have a carnival candy rain. So they did. Oh, they had rain.

105
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,800
That's the most that is the most rowdy energy drink I've ever heard. Yeah. Yeah. It is. But I,

106
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,480
you know, I wanted to try it and it was really good. I really liked it. Oh, you liked it. I did.

107
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,040
Yeah. They also had a they had a ultra paradise monster, which I have not tried yet, but I've

108
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,440
got a can of it here. But anyway, let's let's get this let's get spike. Let's get spike. I'm

109
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,120
going to hear that pop. Oh, that there it is. That was highly carbonated. Oh,

110
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,720
flavor flavor. It's good. It's a very it's high. It's a high intensity blue raspberry kind of flavor.

111
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,640
Blue raspberry. Okay. Life. Let's taste. There's a flavor in Japan specifically called blue Hawaii

112
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,720
with just aware of this with just a hint with just a hint of just a hint of nasty

113
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,600
acrid like chemical water treatment plant underneath it. Yeah, that's that's how you

114
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,000
got the bargain basements. But I but I like but I actually like it. No, it's very it's it tastes

115
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,920
like blue raspberry. There's a seven eleven right down. It's no bullshit from where I am. I kind

116
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,600
of feel like I need to go on a quest. I need to start. I need to start getting caught up on the

117
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,360
energy drink wars. I mean, I don't drink energy drinks in my humble opinion, but I mean, you're

118
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,800
not wrong. What's wrong with them? You know, they're for the week. That's my main point. Are they

119
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,880
is coffee for the week? Do you feel that way about coffee? Yes, it is. And I drink it anyway. Wait,

120
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,800
wait, wait, pause for a second. Does do energy drinks actually give you energy? Because I've

121
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,600
caffeine in general, all it does is make me feel sick. I've never it's never made me feel energetic.

122
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
It energizes my heart and my heart beats really fast. And then I feel like I'm going to die.

123
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,160
But I've never been like maybe it's not for everybody. I don't know. I'm with you, dude.

124
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,840
Okay, it doesn't make me feel it has no adverse effect. But honestly, like it doesn't really

125
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,040
affect me. But yeah, that I'm hopped up so often that I don't feel it. I can't imagine. I mean,

126
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,800
you're already weren't functioning at an 11. I think I might have died. I think I might have

127
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,040
developed a tolerance to caffeine. Honestly, I don't feel like it wakes me up that well. Well,

128
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,040
that's like that's that's the RPG like stat positives and stat negatives of sugar in general.

129
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,320
Is that like it's, you know, short term energy, but in the long term, you're

130
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,800
fat, sad all the time. You can't move. Plus somebody like munchy as Tom was saying, when

131
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,040
you're blood is at a certain concentration of caffeine just naturally, when you introduce an

132
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,240
outside element that to a normal person raises their energy level, but to munchy it lowers it on

133
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,600
average, you know, wait, but have the opposite effect. Was any of that true? Does your body

134
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,480
create? I mean, he's saying that your veins are already pumping full of caffeine and specifically

135
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:16,320
bang energy drinks. There's something like mythical and exotic about hearing stories of like

136
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,360
American garbage core processed food. That's what it feels like because it's like, you know,

137
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,920
if you're in small town America and you just go down to the to the local whatever it is fast

138
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,040
food chain, 7 11 Walmart, I don't know what they have, all those things. And you get like some

139
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:42,080
like, like toxic brew or like, like, like dangerous will kill you product with bright packaging.

140
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,520
Yeah. And it's just, it just feels like another world. It feels like like Neo Los Angeles City,

141
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,720
aka Neo Milwaukee is America to me, because we have a lot of like regulations over here that

142
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,640
things like that just can't get on the shelves. And so it's cool just to hear like,

143
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,640
like bang stuff. It's a little bit of capitalism run wild.

144
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,160
You walk into the 7 11 and everything on the shelves has a skull and crossbones on the

145
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,040
body. Yeah, I mean, I don't it's literally like, you know, how like, like, like poisonous frogs

146
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,560
and like insects will have a bright packet of bright coloring on them. Yeah, it's like that.

147
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,920
Every single thing I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know if you heard,

148
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,160
but bang energy drink has been shown to to reverse retardation.

149
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,520
It has to be super cringy and fucking Britbong. Yeah.

150
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,880
Wait, it's that would that would just be called Tardation.

151
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,000
I mean, in America, we consume so much food that induces retardation that we have to

152
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,560
count it. We have no choice but to counterbalance it. I'm going to copyright my own energy drink,

153
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,200
Brandon. It's going to be called Tardation. Oh, no way. We can't call it what in Tardation.

154
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,280
That should be the full. And it's going to be and it's going to be like an off brand Yosemite

155
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,680
Sam on the label. It's like a legally distinct Yosemite Sam. Yeah, it's like a sasperilla.

156
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,600
It's like brood and barrels. Yeah, he's just he's just going to be called Simity Sam.

157
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,040
Everybody working on the PCP dating sim. Take notes. Fuck energy. This being the cafeteria

158
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,760
in the deal. Fuck it. The official drink of New Los Angeles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,200
Yeah. It's just it's just it's just it's just as fuck with a skull and crossbones.

160
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,000
It's like a skull and crossbones with their dollar signs in the skeleton's eyes.

161
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,080
But there's also like the nuclear like nuclear radioactivity. There's like like the chemical.

162
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,040
There's like the chemical warning, you know, like the four diamonds. Yeah.

163
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,000
It's super creative. There's ultra creatine two, 3D. Hold on. I'm going to post the chemical

164
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,280
warning diamond thing. Okay, good. I want to see that. It's it's like four quat. It's like it

165
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,520
literally looks like the the the the Steven Universe diamonds, diamonds, the diamond hierarchy,

166
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,000
whatever it's called. And it's like it's like four quadrants. And each one has like a number

167
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,280
or a letter in it that determines like in what in which specific ways is this environment hazardous

168
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,320
to you. Perhaps this is room for an epic New Los Angeles City Steven Universe crossover event

169
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,240
where the diamonds are the ones supplying this particular beverage, you know, involved in the

170
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,840
production. I've been looking for I've been looking for an excuse. I've been looking for an excuse.

171
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,560
Here we go. I'm posting it in gross disgusting audio. Okay, good, good, good. Yeah, here we go.

172
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,240
Oh, yeah, okay. Asbestos materials classification diamond. There you go. Damn, this is sick.

173
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,800
My hands on that. I died. Dude, dude, dude. No, no, no. It's that diamond. But in in in each of

174
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,920
the quadrants, it says N. L. A. C. Oh, that's good. That is pretty good. Yeah. Also, you could

175
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,320
just in the middle of each of them just have a middle finger just pointing to you will just or

176
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,440
or just like or just more dollar signs. God, yeah, that feels so good to be an energy drink warrior

177
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,360
where you can walk into your arsenal, aka your fridge and just pick from any of your many arm

178
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,800
armaments. It's like, okay, like a monster is like the basically everyone gets a monster to start out

179
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,280
with. It's like the skill floor. It's it's it's like the you know, everyone has that's the freedom

180
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,320
dividend. Exactly. Exactly. Everyone gets like a month's supply of monster energy at the beginning

181
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,400
of this war chest. It's like when it's like when Neo and Trinity are going to save Morpheus and Neo is

182
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,320
just like give me energy drinks. Lots of energy drinks. Have you ever seen that famous overlord

183
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,720
gift where there's like the skeleton man just casting like spell after spell like buffing

184
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,960
spells like greater dexterity. Yeah, and magic prow. And like it's a million those just like

185
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,720
chugs like a monster, you know, zero energy chugs of bang chugs, you know, rain, etc. etc.

186
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,680
just so many fucking just glowing brighter and brighter with like more like more and more particle

187
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,080
effects just like collect until you're just like a blob. You just like a light a luminous

188
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,280
like slightly shifting and has different hues. They're just rating out like you just you look

189
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,520
like a like like from a distance like from like miles away, you look through a telescope and you

190
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,920
see like a black hole with like a like an accretion disk like orbiting around you and you're like

191
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,400
spewing out like heated superheated particles from your axes. Mixing all these energy drinks

192
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,400
is like is like when Guy opens up the eight gates, the eight chakra gates. Yeah, that's the one.

193
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,800
Your fucking aura keeps changing colors because you're like seeping out. Tell me who just finished

194
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,040
Naruto at the end of the day. And then you're just fucked afterwards. Yeah, and then you fucking

195
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,440
die at the end. You fucking die at the end. Pretty much everyone agrees that that Guy moment was

196
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,200
like the highlight of like late game Naruto. Do you agree? Yeah, it was the fucking greatest

197
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,680
shit because like and when when Madara says you are the greatest Taijutsu user of all time. God,

198
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,720
that felt good. Everyone was hype as shit. By the way, by the way, Tom, I'm just curious.

199
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,280
While Naruto came up, I'll never talk about Naruto ever again, but I'm curious. My favorite moment

200
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,800
of of late game Naruto, it was truly the peak. It was it was a return to form. It was an escalation.

201
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,800
It was a it was a a fucking resurrection of a great old meme. It was that moment where Naruto

202
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,400
attempted to use sexy nojutsu on Kaguya. Did you love that? It was the best moment of like

203
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,680
arguably the whole series. Yes, it was so funny. Thank you. I watched a lot of Naruto in my late

204
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:22,640
teen years, but I never never made it that far into Shippuden. I got to I got to a filler arc and

205
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,800
something about that's why I watch I watched Naruto Kai. Everyone, if you want to get through

206
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,320
this, you got to watch Naruto Kai. It's a fan. I didn't know they made all the filler. They cut out

207
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,920
a ton of like the flashbacks that are pointless. Yeah. And it cuts it down to just

208
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,120
72. Yeah, it's it's all it's all. It's not even that bad. Each each episode is like 90 minutes

209
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,480
because it's like oh each each episode is a volume of the manga in anime. Damn. That's so that that

210
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,960
sounds really good. I might actually watch some of that. It's worth doing. It's worth doing. Is

211
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,680
that an official release or is this a fan thing? This is a fan thing. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so that's

212
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,160
like Dragon Ball Z Kai was a thing. Wait, wait, wait, Jesse, wait, rewind the tapes. Rewind the

213
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:19,520
tapes. Jesse, what did you just say? I said, I said, don't don't don't do it. Oh my Naruto. Shit.

214
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:33,120
That's what I thought. It feels weird having everyone jack off and suck off and just titillate

215
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,840
over a specific show that you've never seen before in your entire life. I feel like I

216
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,680
have not watched any of the same thing any of you have ever or played in the same thing. I don't

217
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:51,520
know. Sly Cooper could be a rat for all I care. No idea. No idea who a fucking Spyro is. Who's a

218
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,080
Spyro to me? It's a Spy Pyro. It's a Spy disguised as a Spyro. You don't know Spyro? That can't

219
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,760
be right. Do you really not know Spyro? I know. I know who Spyro is. I've never played a single

220
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,640
game of his. Oh my god. Okay. Okay. Okay. Complete understanding of Spyro. Spyro is a dragon and

221
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,440
there's a bear and he has money. Here's the here's the problem. Here's the problem. To Munchy,

222
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:17,200
the original PlayStation is a retro console. That's not even true though. Fucking kill this guy.

223
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Well, okay. Well, okay. It's sort of true. Like for like, I think like my like my like eighth

224
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,880
birthday or something. I don't even remember. But I told my mom like, Hey, I want a PlayStation

225
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,720
because I saw my brother's PlayStation too. And she was like, I'm on it. And it was really nice

226
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,760
of her but she got me an original PlayStation. Listen, you fucking jackoff. Get the fuck on my

227
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,800
level and play fucking tennis for two on your fucking oscilloscope. You coward. I'm gonna play

228
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,640
fucking Sony All Stars battle racing. I've never played that before. You can't play that on an

229
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,400
oscilloscope. You can't play Smash Bros on an oscilloscope. Fuck you. Hey, if you try hard enough.

230
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,920
I just speaking of video games, I just want to share with you. I posted something in the

231
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,080
gross discussing audio links chat. So now that I say Kingdom Hearts 2, what final makes best

232
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,160
game ever? So right, it's still still true. But get this, someone just released a release a mod.

233
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,320
There's a link in the description or whatever, you'll see it. It's it's a it's basically a full

234
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,840
remake of Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix by a fan where you instead of playing a Sora, you play as

235
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,520
Vanitas, which is like evil Sora from birth by sleep, essentially. And he's got all new moves.

236
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,560
He's got like an all new setup. And it's like a totally new thing that a bunch of fans just made

237
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,560
because they love the game so much. And I'm probably going to stream it at some point.

238
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,240
And I was just, this is the greatest game ever, but it was tragically locked on a console. But

239
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,760
now that like emulators have like enabled people to, you know, fuck things up and make it free

240
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,120
and loosey goosey, you can make something like this. And it's just really, really sick. Really

241
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,160
sick. Actually, it's interesting you mentioned that because like I just found out recently that

242
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,960
there was a there's a mod for the PC release of Devil May Cry 3 that adds style switching. So

243
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,480
you can play, oh really, which is fucking sick. So I kind of want to try that roster of PlayStation

244
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,400
All Stars. Look at the roster of this. I've literally not played a single game that any of

245
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,720
these cages besides right besides right. The PlayStation All Stars lineup is like the worst

246
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,680
in history. No one likes any of these characters. I wouldn't know. I wouldn't even know. I wouldn't

247
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,680
even know. It has like two or three of games that like Ratchet and Clank, Jack and Dexter and

248
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,720
Sly and then maybe one other one. I mean, didn't they add Dante to this game, but it was Dante from

249
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,200
like DMC Devil May Cry? Oh, they might have. I'm pretty sure that's real. It is. I'm looking at it

250
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:40,320
right now. Oh yeah, there he is. I see Dante, D-O-N-T, Dante. Oh, I like, okay, I like Jack,

251
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,440
Jack and Dexter. Cool. Like, but like they're like main guys are like Sackboy, Sly Cooper,

252
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,960
I don't know, Toro, you know what the fuck is that?

253
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,800
We'll never stop being hilarious.

254
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah, Cole and Evil Cole. I mean, I guess there's a lot of links in Smash.

255
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,560
I'm just like, this is a shit lineup we all know that.

256
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,800
It's so lame. Like, it just feels so lame and forced and gay and shit.

257
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,320
It's because they, that princess.

258
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,640
Yeah, what? Like, I've always felt like PlayStation had its peak in PS2. I mean,

259
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,920
a lot of people would agree with that. And with the PS3, because it was like pushing

260
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,680
graphical capabilities as what everything was at the time, that was like the thing of the day.

261
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,560
Oh my god. They went to make like, look at how realistically we can render this human being,

262
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,840
and then everything they made was with human beings. And so they have no characters that are

263
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,760
different from each other. Nathan Drake's just got a gun. He's just a guy with a gun.

264
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,880
He's just a guy with a gun. You don't want to play a fighting game with a guy with a gun.

265
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,240
That's stupid. People would be like, what about Snake? I mean,

266
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,920
Well, Snake's not even in here. And Snake would be right in here.

267
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,480
Okay, so Riden isn't here. Riden's sick.

268
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,200
I gotta say, okay, so I have, I started to feel a little weird for a second there.

269
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,360
I looked it up. Turns out a spike hardcore energy. Okay, it, okay. So first warning sign.

270
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,800
Warning sign. On the back, it does not have nutrition facts. It has supplement facts.

271
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,720
Turns out it has like three times the caffeine of a monster. Oh, okay.

272
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,760
Okay, so I'm gonna slow down on that. Good idea. Chug it, chug it, chug it, chug it.

273
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,880
It's spike hardcore energy supplements. It's totally, all right, all right.

274
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,680
You know, I forget what it is, but it's primarily marketed to bodybuilders.

275
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,000
Michelle's mom is both like an alcoholic, seemingly, and like a weird energy drink,

276
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,800
like freak. So she will just drink, if I remember correctly. So she's a four loco gal.

277
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,720
Absolutely. Absolutely. And it's truly a fascinating creature in that human being.

278
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,760
Imagine stuffing your body full of a depressant and then full of a stimulant over and over and over

279
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,440
and over again. That's the only way to live. You gotta force balance. Force balance.

280
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,840
Yes. If you can't find it. Perfectly balances all things should be used to destroy your body.

281
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,400
Insert that meme. Dave Chappelle, modern problems require modern solutions.

282
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,200
That's relatively appropriate. By the way, shout out to Kat, the sexy gravity rush girl who's a DLC

283
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,280
character in PlayStation All Stars. Honestly, seeing that one character, it makes me want to go

284
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,680
look up gameplay because Kat is cool. Anyway, that's it. That's all I have to say about that.

285
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,960
Video games are sort of weird in a way where it's like everyone can more or less watch the same

286
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,480
movie, you know, they can just go to the movies, which everyone is like it's almost like a public

287
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,320
venue that anyone can go to. But video games, they're like super fucking locked behind like a

288
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,040
pretty big upfront commitment where it's like there's no way I really could have played some of

289
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,640
these games unless I was going to not play the other games I play because you know, you can't

290
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,880
really have that many multiple systems or at least I couldn't, you know.

291
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Well, Munchy, it sounds like you, like so many of our brethren in the journalism field,

292
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,800
demand to be able to get through games without putting any time commitment in,

293
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,800
without putting any effort to learn the mechanics. I know you're not saying that, I'm just making fun

294
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,200
of that. Okay, there's been a thing recently with Sekiro being too hard for baby journalists.

295
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,680
Literally don't even know what Sekiro is. I have an opinion about that. Yeah, I don't like it.

296
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,040
I think a game, I think a game should be fucking hard if it wants to be fucking hard. And

297
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,280
well, yeah, I mean, most of us would be in agreement. Are we, are we, are we on agreement?

298
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,560
Yeah, I think we would all agree. I did, I did read a couple of the articles about that that I

299
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,440
saw. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't say I wouldn't be against Sekiro having an easy mode,

300
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,320
but I'm not going to cry like it's not fair because people can't experience all the content

301
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,800
if they don't give it one. That's stupid. That's what they're doing, basically.

302
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't know. There's like an article about, about like the accessibility written by a person who

303
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,640
has like a lot of physical ailments that cause their muscles to spaz out and seize up and it

304
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,080
hurts a lot. And it's like the, you know, the Sekiro is the big, the hot big game and it's,

305
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,560
he tries his best and he feels like, you know, it's possible, but it's really hurts and it sucks.

306
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:23,440
But he, he wasn't like advocating for making an easy mode. He was just explaining that accessibility

307
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:31,680
does not mean like, like literally making a baby version of the game as a mode. It's like things

308
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,840
I, I can't remember off the top of my head, but it was just very like,

309
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,400
What does he want is my, is my, I mean, I mean, what I'm, I thought people were being like,

310
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,160
this game should have an easy mode. Like that was the thing I came away with was that

311
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,880
you know, the people who write these articles, because I've read the article and it was like,

312
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,800
you know what, I can see your point and it was a good point. I can't remember exactly, but you

313
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,760
know, he wasn't an idiot and he was like giving, you know, I would agree with him on a lot of what

314
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,880
he said. And then everybody who saw that, you know, saw that thing tweeted in the, in the tweet

315
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,320
replies were replying to some nebulous idea of what the article was about and instead of actually

316
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,400
reading it, and it just really made me annoyed because of course, of course, nobody would

317
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,400
actually read the articles to understand what was being said. Nobody does that. And then I

318
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,000
realized that everything sucks. Yeah, so we have here, so we have here is, everything does suck.

319
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,360
So we have here is a spiral of fake news where someone, where someone makes like a moderate

320
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,600
take, someone, people misinterpret it and spread it around as like, this person thinks this

321
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,960
ridiculous thing and then it just becomes accepted in the zeitgeist that people are saying this

322
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,440
ridiculous thing. Fuck them. Like what are they stupid? Let's be slightly more charitable because

323
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,880
I think that that could definitely be the root of it. But like as the conversation swirls into a

324
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,040
more and more like toxic storm, I do think that like, at any one moment, like in that storm that

325
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,040
starts at that beginning of that conversation that may or may not be justified, within that storm,

326
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,920
there are like battles that are, you know, relatively reasonable. Like, I mean, I saw

327
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,640
a tweet from somebody before that was basically saying like, like, what is it that like, you're

328
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,160
really risking by like, basically they were, they were, this person was like, defending the idea that

329
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,840
like, why are you being so elitist about like, accomplishment in games? Like, what are you even

330
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,440
like, risking by, you know, having this high level of like failure that you might not get over. And

331
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,400
so they were kind of like attacking the idea of like accomplishment in video games versus loss.

332
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,360
And so, I mean, I think that's a reasonable argument to have. And obviously, I'd come down on

333
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,120
the, I'm into, I am the gatekeeper, call me the gatekeeper, I want to keep the gate and keep the

334
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,920
hacks out who can't hack it. I don't think that like, they're being an easy mode would like,

335
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,680
cheapen the hard mode, or something. I mean, it depends on how it's implemented, I'd say. And

336
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,200
I think it kind of, I would say it certainly can. Well, I don't think it necessarily would,

337
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
because like, I've been thinking about this a lot, because like, I, I've been trying to play

338
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,800
Sekiro, and I can't really get into it. Big surprise, I can't really get into any of the

339
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,760
Soulsborne games or any of, any of, any of FromSoft's work for the most part. And I'm trying

340
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,400
to like parse why, like why I'm just like, not a fan of these games. And I mean, and then this

341
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,560
discussion came up, and I was thinking about it, I'm like, yeah, I would enjoy Sekiro more if it

342
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,120
was easier. I think the hard, the difficulty, because like, my whole thing with games is that I

343
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,280
just don't want to spend the time getting that good, because I'd rather spend that time doing

344
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,040
other things and games. But there's the difference right there. Right. But like, here's the thing,

345
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,760
even with that perspective, I don't think it should have an easy mode, even if that excludes me from

346
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:56,160
having fun with it, because I respect the interest of the artist and what they're trying to create,

347
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,960
right. And like FromSoft clearly wants to make a title that is like, ball bustingly hard, like

348
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,080
that's the idea. And to change that. If you don't want the game to be hard, I mean, I can see your

349
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,240
perspective, because I kind of share it sometimes, because it's just us being old. Like when you're

350
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,920
kids, you have time to play a hard game, and you have time to master it. And when you're old,

351
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,440
you don't have time to give a shit so much. But like, if you're, if you work at like a

352
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,800
games journalism website, and your only job is to play games, that excuse goes out the fucking

353
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,360
window. I mean, I think there's a lot of overlap with like, well, I'm not even trying to like,

354
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,200
bait political stuff. But I just mean, I think there's a lot of like, literal advocacy that

355
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,800
come that they people perceive their job to be when you are a games journalist, they think like,

356
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,400
I need to make games for everyone. And you know, I don't know if that does, I don't know if that,

357
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,240
I mean, because if you're a games journalist, you got to play a lot of games. Like, yeah,

358
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,920
you think they'd be the best at games. I mean, you would think so. But yeah, but like, they can't

359
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,680
spend the week, they can't spend a whole week mastering their fucking counter attacks and

360
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,200
second row. They got to fucking play the next, they got to play the next fucking marble match,

361
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,480
fucking match three fucking, as far as I know, the greatest games journalist in the world,

362
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,360
in my humble opinion, is super bunny hop, because he does exactly that he has committed himself

363
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,320
on a deep level. It's like, you got those like roaming like war journalists who like go to like,

364
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,800
you know, the fucking conflict zone between like Palestine and Israel, and like talking to both

365
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,400
sides and like, could be killed in a moment's notice if they do something bad. But that like

366
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,440
super bunny hop is the equivalent of that with video games by 100% in Metal Gear Solid 5.

367
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,240
That is very cool that he did that. But that's not really equivalent, because that would be

368
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,520
like a war journalist reporting on, you know, news from like eight months ago, that there's no war

369
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,240
anymore. Like bunny hop takes his time, right? It's not like Metal Gear Solid 5 disappeared.

370
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,040
We got to put an endless war, Nate Bestman. No, I would never say that.

371
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,320
Journalists that like have to, you know, be timely with the thing, because the games out and people

372
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,960
want to know, is it good? Is it good? Somebody is going to fill that niche. Somebody is gonna have

373
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,320
to. And I'm not saying that the journalist has to be really good at the game, but I've read articles

374
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,960
by things like on IGN, where people are like going apeshit, there's the same thing as before,

375
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,120
they're going apeshit that, you know, they assume that the IGN guy doesn't play the game enough and

376
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,480
he's stupid. And he says, I don't play, didn't play this game for that long. And here's the problems

377
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,680
I found with it. But also, he understood, like, in the articles, they would, they would say that

378
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,880
they hadn't played the game for as long as they could have. Yeah, yeah. They put that in their

379
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,640
score and in their review. As long as they're transparent about it, like, what's the problem?

380
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,000
They're like, yeah, I played 10 hours of this game. Here's my impressions after 10 hours of it. You

381
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,240
know, I mean, what's what's the complaint about this? There's no problem with that inherently. I

382
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,600
would say just like the issue as it arrives is not with them, but it's that like, when people are

383
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,000
looking for information on a game, and maybe if you're someone who has put in like 80 hours,

384
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,520
100% of the game or whatever, and then you you you were just annoyed to see like, this is the review

385
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,080
of an incomplete, you know, playthrough of the game, like literally didn't even beat it, let alone

386
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,480
100% it. And yet this is the information people are taking away, which is why people like Super

387
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,720
Bunnyhop, those are the people you want to listen to. Not depending on who you are.

388
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,520
I would argue that Super Bunnyhop is made for people who have completed the game.

389
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,880
Yes, it depends. More so than for people who haven't even thought about buying the game,

390
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,160
because people who think about buying the game, they want information really quickly.

391
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,760
Yeah. You know, is it good? They just want to gauge like vague interest because they're

392
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,760
probably going to get it. They want to know whether it's like got a game breaking bug or

393
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,680
whether it sucks completely. Yeah. And if there's a review that says, yeah, it's pretty good, then

394
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,320
like, okay, good. I'll buy it. Yeah, it's the entire concept of reviews needing to have integrity

395
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,240
and needing to be helpful should just be done away with and thrown on the garbage because that's

396
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,120
bullshit. You don't watch a review to help you. You know what game you want. You know what you are

397
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,560
interested in playing. You watch your review because you want to hear a guy just talking

398
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,320
about a game and just sharing his thoughts. That's all should be this guy's talking about

399
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,240
games. It should be okay to be wrong. It should be okay to just fucking talk out of your ass.

400
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,600
You don't need to play the fucking game. I don't care. I also don't really understand. Like,

401
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,120
I also don't have the perspective of like, I go to a review to like get like be informed about

402
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:23,200
what kind of a product to make a decision about buying. I don't yeah, I don't do that. But my

403
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,920
understanding is that people do it. And you know, I just have to take people's word on this one.

404
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,280
Like, like these reviewers should be rising up and saying, no, we're not at fault for making

405
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,600
stupid reviews. You're at fault for being so stupid. You need reviews to tell you what fucking

406
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,320
game you want. You're at fault for basing your buying decisions on our stupid reviews. Yeah,

407
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,120
here's a real question. Here's a real question. What are the actual consequences of any of this?

408
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,920
Like, are people being led astray really? Is that even happening? Or is the issue that people like

409
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,920
me, elitist assholes, just see journalists with an opinion we don't like or like a not completely

410
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,760
informed one because they haven't like 100% of the game or whatever. Is that really the

411
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,480
consequence? Are the stakes are the stakes just you being annoyed or someone being annoyed by the

412
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,840
review itself? That's probably it. Yeah, probably. And so yeah, I mean, we should just do what Gib says

413
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,720
and either like, actually read the whole thing and have like the full context of okay, you know,

414
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,960
he says the only play 10 hours, whatever, or like, just don't get mad by it. The problem I think is

415
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,720
headlines. The problem when I see a headline that says, Sekiro needs to respect its players by

416
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,280
adding an easy mode. That was a literal headline. It just makes me mad. I think that article was

417
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,120
actually exactly what it looked like. Okay, well, that's another article afterwards that I read,

418
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:50,160
which was well, that's objection because the implication obviously is that Sekiro does not

419
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,120
respect its players, because it did not add an easy mode. And I mean, respect can mean a lot

420
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,960
of different things. And so that's where you have to get into the nuance of, well, what do you mean

421
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,400
by respect? I mean, obviously it means like cater to probably it's less capable fans. I don't

422
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,440
understand this idea that people have that any game is actually hard at all. Like they're not.

423
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,600
Well, they do dude. So I'm with you on that. And I've got two examples to show. One is a video of

424
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,840
a quadriplegic beating one of the harder bosses in Sekiro a quadriplegic. And in this case,

425
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,920
what that means is he just has very limited usage of his limbs. He can actually move his hands a bit,

426
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,400
but he is a technical quadriplegic with barely any function in his hands. And he shows he still

427
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,840
beats this boss in Sekiro. Like no game is hard compared to like the constant moral quandary

428
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,280
and crushing existential pain of life. So like if you think that any game is hard, you obviously

429
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,720
have no life and you haven't lived, you're a fucking stupid poopy baby. That's like, because

430
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,480
fucking people are all you hear about Dark Souls is like, Oh, Dark Souls is a hard game. Or, you

431
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,360
know, every year there's a new game that comes out. That's the hard game like Cuphead that all

432
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,680
anyone the only talking point about it is how hard it is. Like none of these games are hard. You're

433
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,160
all full of shit. Like, well, Jesse, you know what it is? You know what it is? The reason they say

434
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,520
this, when I hear they say like, I want an easy mode for this game, what I hear is this exactly

435
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,120
what here is, I do not want to have to devote the time required to complete these challenges.

436
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,080
Like, is Dark Souls even hard? I don't get it. What is hard about Dark Souls? It's like,

437
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,080
you fucking roll and you're invincible the whole time you're rolling. That's it. You have to learn

438
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,280
the system, dude. It's literally bullying to force them to have to learn the mechanics of the game

439
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:46,640
to get through it. It's such a disservice to these games in a way. We're like Cuphead or

440
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,680
Dark Souls. They're beautiful games in their own right. Oh, yeah. It's like, there's so much there

441
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,360
to talk about with Cuphead with Dark Souls, like just ranging from like themes to just like Cuphead,

442
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,120
like you could have an entire discussion about the art style or just the way it was made and the

443
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,200
interesting story there. But just for some reason, this one aspect of the game, which I don't even

444
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,840
know if it was intentional in Dark Souls case, maybe it was. But it's not the main point of the

445
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:20,400
game. So why is it the main talking point? I mean, I guess because it's the stopper that

446
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,880
keeps people from experiencing more of it. That was less the game. Ultimately, people want

447
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,720
everyone, somebody who likes Dark Souls wants as many people as possible to play it and enjoy it

448
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,480
because they like it so much. And so when there's this idea going around that Dark Souls is too hard,

449
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,320
in their brain, I think, you know, they probably wouldn't realize. But I think it's this, they get

450
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:51,360
angry about that because it implies that more people will not even give it a chance and not even try

451
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,560
and not even go through the pain to feel the euphoria that they felt when they finally beat

452
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,760
the hard boss. And they want, they want to share the enjoyment of the game. It comes out in this

453
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,000
vitriolic sort of back and forth with, you know, game journalists and, and get gooders and all this

454
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,720
stupid internet internet fighting. And it's like, you just want to you just like video games. There's

455
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,960
a lot. I mean, there's a lot. It's hard. Let me let me let me be good if you could calm down, everyone.

456
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,760
Let me quote this guy. He says, there's a lot of talk about quote respecting the player when it

457
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,720
comes to not including an easy mode, an idea that all players can and should play the game in this

458
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,600
particular punishing way. Yet I think the lack of an easy mode showcases the exact opposite.

459
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,080
It shows an almost stunning lack of respect for players with the idea that they cannot be trusted

460
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,240
with their own gameplay experience, that even those who want a challenging game would somehow

461
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,320
be lured by the siren song of lower difficulties and destroy their own experience because they're

462
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,440
too impatient or immature to know what they actually want. But I mean, that has happened to me. It has

463
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,400
affected me when playing games. I mean, yeah, my argument. Yeah, I remember now that I read this

464
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:04,720
one and my had my my fundamental disagreement was that I don't think gamers can be respected.

465
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,800
I think I think that there's an ED mode. It's an ED mode. They will go for it because they go to

466
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,920
video games to escape. If there's a difficult section and they had a bad day and they're playing

467
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,320
a hard game and there's a way that they can just make it easier, of course, they're going to take

468
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:26,320
it. This is this is dark souls race. Remember the Dark Souls race that we did? Yeah. So like the

469
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,880
the Dark Souls race was great. Obviously, everybody go watch it on the procrastiners channel that

470
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,320
you're viewing right now. And like I won and that was really great. But but the thing about that was

471
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,720
like what I wanted to do with that and with the Pokemon race that we did afterward,

472
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,640
I would it was you guys were there, you know, I was like, guys, we need to set the rules because

473
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,680
once the rules are set, I will exploit every ability I can find within the rule set so that I

474
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,200
have not broken the rules, but I can use every possible tool and gimmick and glitch that is

475
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,960
allowed under the rule set to win. So it's so important to set the rules so that you know what

476
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,280
you like are and are allowed to do. And I like I just think this is a pretty good way to do that if

477
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,000
that's what the developer wants to do, which from soft has said they do, which is just say this is

478
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
the baseline of everybody. These are the rules. You can't obviously like cheat the game unless you

479
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,520
use like a cheat engine or something. So was it level here? Was it? Did Matthew Matosis do a video

480
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,760
about fucking? What's the game where you're a guy in a pot and you go in the mountain getting over

481
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,760
it? Yeah, did Matthew Matosis do a video about that one? I don't think so. No, I did a video about

482
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:48,240
that one. True. Am I thinking of Joseph Anderson or probably probably. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't

483
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,760
know, like, if it was Joseph Anderson than him, but if it was someone else, whatever, whoever I'm

484
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,640
thinking of said like, there's, you know, there's something kind of beautiful about the idea that

485
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,120
this mountain is a totally, there's no easy mode for this and there couldn't be. Because like the

486
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,240
mountain change the game, the mountain is what it is. It is a series of set obstacles that you

487
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,200
either can or cannot overcome. And everyone who climbs this mountain climbs the exact same mountain.

488
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,120
That's exactly what it is in this case. That's exactly what Sekiro is. It's a mountain. And I

489
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,440
think that's fine. And I think that's cool. And no, I don't think it's fucking disrespectful

490
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,360
to be like, this is the exact experience I designed. And, you know, I don't think I'm going to want to

491
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,760
let people change it and play it in a different way. I think that's, that's the thing. And forgive

492
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,360
me, I haven't been talking this whole time because some asshole is like mowing his lawn or some

493
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,040
shit. It's fucking loud. I want to get picked up on the microphone. But yeah, I mean, it's interesting,

494
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,000
Nate, that you said that like you've been tempted to go to lower difficulties because like,

495
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,840
I paradoxically want games to be easy because I don't want to like spend a ton of time with

496
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:02,000
them. I just want to like escape from my life and have fun and feel cool. But every time I can't

497
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,760
go to easy mode on any game because it infuriates me. It makes me feel like a pathetic bitch because

498
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,520
I rarely like there's some games that like if you fail enough, the game will offer to like lower

499
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,560
the difficulty or whatever. And it feels like a slap in the face. I mean, it does, but I have done

500
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,960
it on occasion when like the game is just, I'm against the wall. To me, when it does that, it's

501
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,400
just it like quadruples down my efforts. I'm like, I will, I will never take you up on this offer.

502
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,160
You disgusting mongoloid of a developer who put this line of code in here. How dare you insult me?

503
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:42,000
I personally, I personally, I can't even go ahead. Oh, well, a perfect example of that is like

504
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
whenever I'm in playing in Minecraft and I've got survival on because that's default and there's

505
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,960
monsters around. I'm doing stuff. And then, uh-oh, there's like, I'm trapped. There's things all

506
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,880
around me. Paul's turned it to peaceful. All the mobs go away and I could just continue building

507
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:04,400
what I was building. Yeah. I do that all the time. I was playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate World of

508
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,880
Light and I had it on hard just because I thought I usually play games on hard. I like when things

509
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,240
are difficult, but I think it's almost a sign of like when a game isn't good, then you want it to

510
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,680
be easy just to get it over with in a way. It feels to me when you just want things to be easy. It's

511
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,880
just because you just want to have it be done as fast as possible, which is not how I usually want

512
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,040
to play a game. So like with Super Smash Bros, it was like, I played it on hard for a while and I

513
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,840
thought, well, this game sucks and I'm not really having that much fun and I don't really care about

514
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,680
continuing. So I always turn it to easy and try and crank through it. And even still, if you

515
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,920
effort was on easy, I was like, oh, this is just too much. I don't fucking care anymore. It's a lot.

516
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,720
Yeah. I haven't beaten it either. I personally can't stand when a game even gives me a choice in

517
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,000
difficulty. There should be one option and that should be how the game is meant to be played.

518
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,160
Because when I see like easy, medium, and hard, you know, it's like, well, what the fuck is the

519
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,360
real game? What is the actual game? Is it normal? So I usually just pick normal. But that's if there's

520
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,000
like three. Sometimes games get crazy and they have like six different difficulty modes. And

521
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,960
there's no middle option because there's like an even number. So you don't know like what the real

522
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,320
game even is. And I don't want to have to think about that shit. I don't want to sweat the petty

523
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,960
things. Just give me the game how it's meant to be fucking played. One fucking difficulty mode.

524
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,400
Don't give me a choice. Don't make me fucking think about it. I hate you. All game developers die.

525
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,840
That is ideal, which is why I like Securo and Dark Souls so much.

526
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,400
Yeah. And it's like another thing that annoys me about multiple difficulty modes at the beginning

527
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,480
is that I have a choice to make. And it's like if I choose easy, then the game might not be

528
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,480
challenging or interesting enough. So I usually don't choose easy. But if I choose normal,

529
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:50,960
and I'm like locked into it, or like hard, and I'm locked into it. I feel like I if I get stuck

530
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,720
at any point, I'm like, ah, I should have picked easy. Yeah, I got to restart the game because I

531
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,680
I'm not having an easy time. But there's a possibility that I could be having an easy time

532
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,320
if I had done the other thing. There's a handful of games that I've ever been like, I would prefer

533
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:12,480
to play this on easy. Have you guys seen that extra credits video on the true genius of Dark Souls

534
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:23,280
two? I don't wait. Yes. And I think I remember. So fucking dumb. Yeah, terrible. Okay, basically.

535
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:31,520
Okay, well, the idea of the video is that Dark Souls two lets you basically sort of soft set

536
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:38,640
your own difficulty. But like the key argument for it basically boils down to magic is way

537
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,360
overpowered in the game. So if you're having a hard time, just use magic and then the game

538
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:49,520
will be easier for you. And I disagree with that in the grounds of Have you seen the adventures

539
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:55,680
of Baba Duke spook? His life is suffering. He is a pure mage. He only does magic and his life is

540
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:02,000
constant agony. That's true. Well, a lot of that's of his own making. I don't know. They're fucking

541
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,120
wrong. That video is terrible. It's like, Hey, embarrassing. And this whole discussion of like

542
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:12,080
difficulty of Dark Souls, like everything makes sense so far. But but the thing is there's there's

543
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,160
games that are just fundamentally designed differently. And I think one of those like is

544
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,800
Devil May Cry. Because personally, I've never done this. Yeah, like I intend to with Devil May Cry

545
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,520
and maybe I'll go back. I've beaten all the games and basically a scrub. But like I understand that

546
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,200
the idea of those games is you basically get through them once. And then you go back and you do it on

547
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,880
like hard mode, and then Dante must die mode. And you try to like get, you know, triple s rank on

548
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,760
like every individual level or whatever. And so it's about like perfecting your gameplay and,

549
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,800
you know, upping your score. So that's kind of like a totally different approach to like how

550
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,880
difficulty should be handled, because that's a game designed to be played many times over and

551
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,680
over by the most committed. I really like rank systems, ranking systems, because is this is

552
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:03,680
exact same thing? Like, it's difficult to do an s rank, but you don't need to do an s rank to get

553
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:09,120
to the next part of the game. So you can beat the game with a low rank score, and you can see

554
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,040
everything there is to see. But if, you know, the challenge is always there. And, you know,

555
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,520
in Dark Souls, if you kill the thing, that's it. There is no how well you did it, how many

556
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,360
times you dodged or, or like how many estus you didn't need to drink. It's like, you just do it,

557
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,320
and it doesn't matter whether you're, you were terrible during the fight and got lucky, or that

558
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,880
you killed it in like five seconds. And you can do like self-imposed challenges, but those are just

559
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,920
those are an outside thing that you, but like having having the rank system as like a tantalizing

560
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,520
Ooh, I want the shiny one. I want the shiny one. It makes you, you know, it gives you,

561
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,800
you know, the whole game, you can play the whole game and beat the whole game. But if you want to,

562
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,000
and if you feel inclined to, you can, you can train yourself to get better at it so that you

563
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,880
can beat the highest scores. And often I don't do that, but I just like the fact that that is,

564
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,560
that is a thing rather than just, rather than just cutting my gameplay experience short and

565
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,840
making me rage quit. I think that's why I end up liking Devil May Cry more is because like,

566
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:16,160
it feels like to me that like actually like being good at Devil May Cry is, you know, S ranking

567
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,640
everything. You know, and so like you have this like kind of like skill floor difficulty where

568
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,080
it's like getting through the game, but like the real way like you've actually quote unquote beaten

569
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:31,120
the game shirt for in all intents and purposes by S ranking everything. Like that's, that's kind of

570
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,960
like, you know, what you should optimally do. Like that's where you kind of the games clearly kind

571
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,480
of like designed to influence you to try and do that. Whereas with something like, like Dark Souls,

572
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,520
the different, the difficulty is like, to S rank it is to just beat it, you know, just fuck your

573
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,120
way. So like, so like that's why it's harder is that like it the S the skill floor of Dark Souls

574
00:50:53,120 --> 00:51:00,080
is S ranking everything. So it's fair to I get complaining about a skill floor being too high

575
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,160
such that it's too much for a lot of people to get over. But then it just comes back to like,

576
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,560
I mean, another another thing I was entitled like why are you entitled to an experience?

577
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,720
People feel entitled. People really feel like here's another video in the girls discussing

578
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,000
audio links. This is a video made it's on the Street Fighter channel on YouTube made like three

579
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,120
years ago, whatever. And it's of the number one ranked Chun Li player in the world. And I think

580
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:28,000
Street Fighter five or maybe Street Fighter four, whatever. And like, he's got a like a terrible

581
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,720
debilitating disability. His legs don't work. He like crawls around and his arms have limited

582
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,280
functionality. And if you skip through this, like the way he plays is like he has his face on the

583
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,000
game pad and puts his hands like claw like behind it. So this guy had to come up with a whole new

584
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,640
way to play the game. He can't use an arcade stick. And still he became the number one ranked

585
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,480
Chun Li and placed like fifth in a professional tournament. So this guy just like he adapted

586
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,880
and overcame. I don't know if we should base our expectations for people on like clear. It is.

587
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,120
Yeah, it is. This is a man who he's living out his fantasies of having legs by playing as Chun Li

588
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,480
and her beautiful, ultimate legs, big, meaty legs. Yeah, the most leg of all. I'm just saying

589
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,560
this is like the ideal of what I would want people to aim.

590
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,640
You know, of what this guy has done seems. I just think the world will be better if people

591
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,400
approach challenges in this way. The problem, the real problem in all this, of course, once again,

592
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,720
comes down to zoomers. It's all young people's fault that we have these issues. I'm not sure.

593
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,120
And I'm going to tell you why. And this is okay. I mean, the guy who wrote this article is not a

594
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,520
zoomer. Well, it's going to sound slightly influenced. I believe the guy who wrote this

595
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,480
article, even if he's not technically a zoomer, he is a zoomer at heart. He is a young person at

596
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:55,040
his core because there's an epidemic of people who are not classically educated in video games.

597
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,160
Because what my point of view with saying that Dark Souls isn't hard, like is Dark Souls hard

598
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:06,880
compared to Ghouls and Ghosts? I don't think so. Is Sekiro hard compared to the original

599
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,440
Ninja Gaiden? No, not even close. These people have played, they haven't played these games.

600
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,640
They don't know what a real hard game is like. They don't know Shinobi 3. They don't know the

601
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,560
fucking Lion King. That's why I went into a rant about the Lion King in my last video. Because

602
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,440
the Lion King was the first video game I ever played. The first video game I ever beat. I was

603
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,160
like, fucking five years old. So I never thought of it as a hard game my whole life. And then

604
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,920
when I grew up and I, you know, you look on the internet, it seems like every other week

605
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,720
to this day on Reddit, there's a big thread like, anyone remember the Lion King is the hardest game

606
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:42,240
ever made? No one on earth could ever get past the second level. And it's like, what is wrong

607
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,280
with you people? I don't believe you. I don't believe these people have played it. I think they're

608
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:54,560
just copying the notion that it's the hardest game ever. In my humble opinion, the world and the

609
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:01,120
people in it have all softened. Because there's just less need to try harder things. People used

610
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,840
to be a lot tougher, you know, back in the day when we were all Nephilim, you know.

611
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:14,880
But before the flood. No game made nowadays is as hard as Splatterhouse 2. It's never gonna happen.

612
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,200
They'll never make a game again as hard as Splatterhouse 2. The final boss of Splatterhouse 2

613
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:25,040
will reduce you to a quivering, weeping mess. Anyone out there, you try it. You try to beat

614
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,040
the last boss of Splatterhouse 2. You'll cry and you'll scream. You'll break your controller in

615
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,480
half with your hands. You'll get Hulk strength just for that one moment. I tried to play Contra 4

616
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,840
on my DS when it came out. And I was like, this is so, there was no chance. No chance. I will

617
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:45,440
ever beat this game without cheating. And so I just gave up. So yeah. I don't know. And I feel

618
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,800
like I have some ability to say this stuff. Because like right now, I'm at the end of Hollow Knight

619
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,480
facing down like some of the like the final challenges to get like the uber super secret

620
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,360
ending. It is so, it asks so much of you. And by that, I mean, it asks about as much as like

621
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,320
level one of Contra 1 asked, you know, to get like the ultimate, probably a bit more than that.

622
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:11,760
But like still, it's such a hurdle to get the final shit in Hollow Knight. And I have not earned

623
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,520
it. And I don't want to be just given a participation trophy. I want to work up to it over the next,

624
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,720
I don't know, months or years, and then earn it. And like satisfaction will be, will be there.

625
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,840
But if Hollow Knight had an easy mode, I mean, that wouldn't be like,

626
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,400
I mean, would you take that away from, I mean, I mean, you would have to opt into being given it.

627
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,640
You would have to be like, okay, I'm doing it. I'm macing that Faustian bargain. I'm hitting,

628
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:45,440
I'm hitting the button. I have decided on that. Easy mode. Does easy mode in this in this mean

629
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,880
like the main game is has an easy mode, but then all the extra challenges don't have easy modes,

630
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,200
or would they also? Yeah, it depends on how it's done. Because a game like Kingdom Hearts 2, for

631
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,520
example, it has a it has easy modes, basically, that just make basically the whole game easier

632
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,640
and then hard modes that make a lot harder, etc. But like the way that it punishes you is that the

633
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:13,520
like, the criteria to unlock like secret ending content is it scales up like exponentially based

634
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,480
on how easy you've made the game. So like, I think if you plan beginner, you straight up can't

635
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,200
unlock the secret ending. I think I might be off about that. If you're playing on like normal,

636
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,640
you have to like 100% Jiminy's journal. If you're playing on like hard, you have to like, you know,

637
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,320
like do some secret like collect all the answer reports or something. And then if you're playing

638
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,840
on like critical mode, all you got to do is like beat the final boss. And then you get it.

639
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,960
Oh, this reminds me back back in the day when I played on Sega Genesis, Golden Axe.

640
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:47,360
Yeah, Sega Genesis, my first console, I had I had Golden Axe. I love that game. And me and me,

641
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,440
I would play it on on easy mode mostly just because I liked how you gave you more life and

642
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,040
stuff. Because like when you play, when you play Golden Axe on easy, like doubles your life bar,

643
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,240
gives you more, more lives and shit like that. And so you play the game. And I beat it. And I

644
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,160
beat it on easy mode. I'm like, Oh, this is a fun game. I like I like this game. It's cool. I played

645
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,920
a bunch of times like that. And then I remember the first time I played it on normal mode. And

646
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,640
as a little kid, I couldn't do it. But like a year into having the game, I played it on normal.

647
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,400
And I got to the end of the game. And I realized, Oh, this wasn't the end of the game. This is the

648
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,880
end of baby mode. There's like a whole other game after this that I never knew about. It blew

649
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:28,400
my mind to shit. It was fucking cool. Yeah, that's that's the shit. And like, I didn't, I watched,

650
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:34,320
I look at Sekiro, I haven't played it yet. So full disclosure, I haven't played it, but I watched

651
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,000
people playing it. And it just looks to me like a modern 10 shoe, basically, stealth and the grappling.

652
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,920
And it's like, I haven't played it yet. But I promise you that the original 10 shoe was harder

653
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:55,120
than Sekiro. That's no doubt. And it's just, there's different kinds of difficulty. I mean,

654
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,200
like when you talk about difficulty in games, it sort of becomes like either games are easier,

655
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,040
they're difficult, but there's so many different kinds. Like I have, I have, I have an easier

656
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,240
time with certain kinds of difficulty now than I used to and a harder time. Like, like the kind

657
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,880
of difficulty that like wears on my patience, I can't do anymore. Like when I was a kid, I had

658
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,160
all the patience in the world for it. But like, the difficulty that's just like, it's just there

659
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,400
and it's hard and you're doing it and you got to do it better. That's easy for me. Like anyone can

660
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,200
just do it and do it better each time. But like, you were talking about Hollow Knight, I played

661
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,840
Hollow Knight for a little while, I didn't beat it. Hollow Knight was kind of hard for me, just

662
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,280
because like, it all looked the same and I didn't know where to go and I had no patience for it.

663
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,080
I had no patience to explore this, this world because I got lost like Teminis and I'm like,

664
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:48,160
this game sucks, I hate it. Yeah, that'll happen. Yeah. I mean like, and it's not, I don't know if

665
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,480
it's a flaw of the game, like it sounds, maybe it is. The game starts with a particularly kind of

666
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,640
steep getting into a curve at the first like 20 minutes to an hour. I don't know if it like,

667
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,360
becomes more varied later on, but the first part of it, like every background looked the same and

668
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:06,560
I'm like, what, all these rooms are the same. I have no idea. Like at least with like Super Metroid,

669
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,760
every area has different music and different backgrounds. Some of the areas are more interesting

670
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:17,600
than others, for sure. Yeah, for sure, for sure. But I agree with Hollow Knight. I felt the same

671
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,600
way when I first played it too, which is captured on-stream during me and Mafia 1, so people can

672
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:28,560
go see it. Boy, I really gotta get back, I really gotta beat Hollow Knight. It's on my list of

673
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:34,960
shit I gotta get around to. We can all agree that, you know, games are hard, but nothing. No game is

674
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,880
more difficult than Team Fortress 2, because you're fighting in a multiplayer game. You're hunting

675
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:49,760
the most dangerous game of all, man. Yeah, because in multiplayer games, the skill ceiling will never

676
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,960
stop from getting higher. It will just keep going as players play the game for millions of hours and

677
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,360
they become super duper squads that completely destroy you. Until every single one of them is

678
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:05,040
basically Mario like glitch jumping up the like backwards, glitching up the infinite staircase.

679
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,600
Your skill set in a multiplayer game is social engineering that is legitimately one of the

680
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:18,080
skills you need to develop in order to be a proficient video game player in the multiplayer

681
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,360
scenario. Like when I hit 100 Charisma, what I realized, I could just go up and yell at the

682
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,360
competitors on the other side of the room to intimidate them into just giving up and leaving.

683
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:32,000
That's what I knew. I'd unlocked maximum gameplay skill. When you're not playing as part of a

684
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,240
professional group or even just playing with your friends exclusively, when you are matchmaking

685
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,600
online with maybe just one of your friends or even just alone, you will have people on your team in

686
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:47,840
any video game that you play, multiplayer, you know, shooter or whatever, that are shit. And you

687
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:54,240
have to figure out how to make them effective if you want to win. You can make your people,

688
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,720
it will often be said that, you know, you're just kind of fucked, you know, oh, my team was

689
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,560
sucked so bad. It's so bad. But literally, you just got to carry or you got to be able to tell them

690
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,480
what to do in ways that they understand. You got to be able to make them better. That's part of

691
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:17,120
how you have to play the game or to accomplish. It's literally a skill. It's like I've had like

692
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:24,080
the most like angry, angry gamer moments of all time where I like gnashed my teeth.

693
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,840
I've been witness to them. It was weird. It's very weird that you weren't really,

694
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,080
HIPAA's not very an angry guy. But for some reasons, TF2 just unlocks something that's

695
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:40,480
primal. It just makes me go fucking primal. Because I know it's not just, oh, like video

696
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,920
game a little difficult. It's that a person beat me and they're probably happy about it.

697
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,880
They're looking at my corpse and they're like, hey. That's the moment where you switch from full

698
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,480
retro to full gamer and just the explosion that follows is, you know. Yeah. And it's,

699
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,640
especially when like someone duels me, like I've played TF2 with Munchie before and he's

700
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:10,640
dueled me and I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Probably the worst experience of my life.

701
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:17,200
God damn it. God damn it. Fine, fine, fine. Probably the worst experience of my life was

702
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:22,240
playing brawl with you, Munchie. For the same reason, because I could tell you were having fun

703
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:27,200
and I wasn't, and that was unacceptable. Yeah. I was having fun for the first, okay. I was having

704
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,680
fun for the first couple of minutes because I didn't know how the way it would turn out. And

705
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,200
also the last couple of minutes because you were actually fighting me and it was fun at the end

706
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,000
because it was a real game at the end. Yeah. This is that like deleted video, right? That never

707
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:47,120
No, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, not the slime fest was saved. Unfortunately. Yeah. And all it's

708
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:56,320
fucking misery. Okay. Um, uh, I was going to say something. TF2? TF2? Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's not.

709
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:00,560
Because she's got ink. Just wondering about that. Yes. Also, inkling is awesome. Yeah.

710
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,640
That's true. These aren't captured any device, but I'm going to specifically call out Ethan

711
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:11,200
because I've dueled Ethan many times before late at night. And the way he gets when he's losing a

712
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:20,400
duel is simply indescribable. The most bitter that he could possibly get. Like that I've seen

713
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:27,520
a human become where it's like, like when you know that he sees you when he goes completely dead

714
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,480
silent, I would describe him as corpse silent to the point where he could not make a motion

715
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,440
even if you wanted to. I'll do that. And the amount of like expression that leaves his body

716
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,360
when he dies after after a heated encounter can only be described as like the creation of a sun

717
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:51,840
in a way where it's like on a cosmic scale, sounds leave his body. And when things are over,

718
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:58,080
when the rounds over and I win the duel by like a couple points, like you can like I physically

719
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,680
like saw like his soul leaving. I look up to the sky and I saw it leaving his body reaching towards

720
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:13,040
heaven. And let me just if you're not familiar. Wait, I always forget. Munchy, have you read Jojo?

721
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,800
I never remember the answer to this question. Yeah. Of course I have. Yeah. Okay. You know those

722
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,400
moments where like a character dies and you see like their ghosts like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

723
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,520
like that's even spirit like floating away from his deceased gamer corpse. Did I fight

724
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,960
Ethan? Munchy, did I fight? Is Ethan one of the guys that we hung out with that one time?

725
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:37,200
Yes, he is. That time when I that time when I killed everyone. Yeah, that was crazy. That was

726
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:43,680
ridiculous. Yes. Wait, when did that happen? That was three before before everyone got before

727
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,280
you were like like you weren't there. Yeah, every at the law point. Everyone was laughing like oh,

728
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,000
look at the old look at the elder millennial with his princess P. And she doesn't know how to play

729
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,920
smash. And I fucking went in there with my fucking peach and my fucking you know, with my hip,

730
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,200
this isn't my fucking floating in the air and my fucking kick where you can see your panties if

731
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,160
you had pause it and ate the black hole. Wait, which version? Speaking of that, Jesse, the most

732
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,400
memorable moment of that was when you were about to get a kill and like I think when the tournament

733
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,080
before you did you did that up smash and then you just pause and saw our skirt. And that was the

734
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,480
last thing that happened before the other person died. That's what I want them to see before I

735
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,080
killed them. The last brawl. Is this brawl? No, no, melee, melee. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. I also want to

736
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:35,280
say you fucking zoomers. I was born in melee. I was molded by like never that was the first time

737
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,600
that I had ever seen like all those people that I had talked to like the like like for years.

738
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:47,920
And I was so tired from radcon three that I was sleeping in the cab. I got out. They all greeted

739
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,000
me. They were all so happy to see me. And I was like, yeah, yeah. Hey, is there like a bed?

740
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,480
Radcon three was was was an intense experience. So understandable.

741
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:05,120
Isn't that you know, it's an interesting conundrum. Yeah, seriously, radcon four. I was I realized

742
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:10,640
recently it's been like a year since radcon three. Yeah, I was wondering why my chakras were so low.

743
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:15,840
And then I agree. Of course, I haven't been recharged at radcon in so long. My Christ consciousness

744
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:21,600
has been fading. Radcons are honestly a really great thing just to do every once in a while.

745
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:26,640
They make you just feel good and alive. Yeah, you're with people who you like and we're competent.

746
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:33,120
Sometimes I have a flash and I realized that like there's for the vast majority of people,

747
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:39,600
they hang out with their friends daily. Yeah, we never do that. And I don't I don't understand

748
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:46,800
how that's even a thing like like it's a yearly event for me. It's bizarre. It really does. It

749
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,960
takes me back to those high school days when you actually could see your friends every weekend and

750
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:57,680
like hang out and eat pizza and stuff and have like sort of a pizza party, you know. If you had

751
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:05,440
a microphone back in those days, some manner of podcast. Oh my god. Where if only I could find

752
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,720
that feeling again if only I could find those glory days again. What? But I can't I can't seem to see

753
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:17,600
it. I can't find it. I'm having a I'm having a flash. Where is it? Where is it? It's on the tip of my

754
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,960
tongue. I can't I can't remember. Can't go back to that place. We sealed those memories away long ago.

755
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:32,080
Where's the podcast? Hey, we've got voice signals about that. I mean, I feel like we just been

756
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:36,400
we got endless stuff to talk about today. We've only been gone for an hour. That's true. I'm just

757
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:42,000
saying we've got we've got stuff about that. But yeah, we can keep going. I mean, I can I can shift

758
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,480
gears a little and talk about Homestuck a little bit a little bit of Homestuck. I got the the the

759
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:55,120
was a book for act five act one, which is a big heavy tone. And I've been reading it and it's

760
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,120
great. It's with where all the trolls are introduced. Do you have all the books?

761
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:08,400
No, I specifically have been, you know, because I really only want the troll ones act five and

762
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:14,960
act five act two. And I already have all guys I didn't realize they were they had continued

763
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,960
making the books. But I guess yeah, well, once once Hussie got bought out by a media conglomerate

764
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:28,400
or whatever, whatever happened. Yes. Well, he's underneath it now. So like Homestuck.com is

765
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,880
you know, I mean, that's like how it's not like Bioware got bought up by Activision. And now

766
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,240
they're slowly dying. Oh, no, he there's nothing like wrong with like the Homestuck books, they just

767
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:43,680
got to kind of shitty covers. But that's how they're gonna make like the final flash into a book,

768
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:49,680
you know. Well, the same way they've been making flashes into a book form the whole time is just

769
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:54,560
take screen grabs and then underneath Hussie gives his author notes. So he says God, if only this

770
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,920
was online, you'd be really good time right now in some format, it was possible to create like

771
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:05,040
moving images. But alas, we're trapped on this stone cold. Yeah, I just want to brag I just want

772
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:10,960
to brag that I have I have the entire the entirety of problem sleuth in book form. Oh, dude, same.

773
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:17,680
It's high five. It's great. High fucking hoof, brother. Yeah. But yeah, specifically about this

774
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:24,960
book, though, the the the author commentary, which is under every page of these books. I have

775
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,840
book three already, the old book three, and I was reading those and those sort of interesting,

776
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:36,000
sometimes silly, sometimes sort of a pointless but you know, it's Andrew Hussie's writing and I

777
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,240
love Andrew Hussie's writing. So it's generally good. But with with the trolls, he kind of went

778
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:51,040
like super deep analytical like arm retrieval tier sort of explanations of all of these troll

779
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,560
characters and their place in the story and the way he was thinking when he was writing them.

780
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,120
And it was really insightful, especially when he got to risk and explained why

781
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:05,280
risk is canonically and like in an outside universe, his wife in every facet in every

782
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:11,680
single possible way. And he had so many notes. He had so many notes about it that like the notes

783
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,160
went from one page to the other and he had the arrows going literally just made his waifu like

784
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:22,320
the most important character. No, it's not as dumb as that. Maybe it is. But like it was just

785
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:30,160
that the role she had in the story is like one little snippet of notes that I can try and remember

786
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:36,800
was that as she is like the bitch character, she's like the trolliest of trolls. She causes the

787
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:44,800
controversy and she like attacks and like tries to fuck up everyone's shit constantly. And she is

788
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:50,960
like sort of like a like a tier two surrogate author character, because the way he was talking

789
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,400
about it was as an author, you create your creations and then you give them problems to overcome.

790
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,800
And the more problems you give them and the harsher, you know, punishment you deal them,

791
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,840
you know, the more dramatic it becomes. And so Vriska being his favorite and like in universe

792
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:13,520
love interest, because his character is a character in the comic, like he loves Vriska,

793
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,680
is like part of the fact that she is kind of doing what he would otherwise be doing as an

794
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:28,480
author, you know, that is like putting problems in the way of the create the OCs he's made.

795
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,040
Is this like what he was thinking when he wrote her? Or is this him reflecting in the hindsight

796
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,880
and being like, you know, I could probably formulate an argument for this combination.

797
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,680
The way it comes across in the way he's writing, I mean, sometimes he does like say,

798
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:49,520
yeah, the reason I probably did this was because I was lazy, but I'd like to think it was some other

799
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:56,640
reason like he's quite about it. No, no, no, but he is being accurate, like some things he feels

800
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,880
are lazy. But it's usually just visual things. But things with like the trolls, he thought of

801
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,200
all the trolls before he started, he just didn't know what they look like. Or like, you know,

802
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:11,040
he came up with the zodiac signs, and the 12 of them, and then he came up with little things,

803
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:15,840
like he probably had a notepad with like, this is various things that can all these characters

804
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,800
can mean. And then he wrote them down. And then as he as he was going through, like,

805
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:29,040
Act five, Act one was like made really quickly, using all new assets and all new alien technology

806
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,680
and world building that he was kind of making up as he went. And it was, it's just, it's just

807
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:40,240
really brilliant to see. And I totally believe that the notes that he leaves behind, leaves under

808
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:46,480
the pages explaining his thought process, because it doesn't seem completely impossible. It just

809
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,520
seems like he had an idea, he went with it, and then he made it continue to work in the future.

810
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:55,120
And the ones, the trolls that weren't important became nothing.

811
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,120
Act one, I would be especially interested in reading his notes about.

812
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:06,320
They're all online. You can read them as the arm retrieval guy. It may sound weird that I'm

813
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:14,240
very, very quick to come to Hussie's defense here. Because Hussie is no idiot. He's not stupid.

814
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:22,160
Act six is not the work of someone who is just simply stupid. The thing is that he doesn't care

815
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:27,760
anymore. I have no doubt about Hussie's right ability. As he's shown, he like in the early

816
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:33,520
acts of homes like he is literally like probably my favorite writer ever. He just, I resonate with

817
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:39,200
his work more or so about than any other person in the world or earth that I've had. So it's not,

818
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:46,320
I don't think that Hussie just became stupid or that it's hard for me to believe that he had all

819
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:51,200
of these things planned out when he was originally writing the trolls. That's not unrealist to me

820
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,040
whatsoever. So I have no reason to doubt him that he can articulate the way that he felt before.

821
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,160
Well, some things are straight up retconned as they go along. So not every single thing was planned

822
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:04,320
from the beginning. Well, sure. But these major things that tie into the entirety of a character

823
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,440
who's probably playing. You know, I bet if we really dug into that, I could point out some

824
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,800
ways that it's not as brilliant as everybody seems to think it is. I mean, I don't know what

825
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:20,240
specifics we're talking about. If you understand the things that Hussie writes and the reasoning

826
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:27,600
he's giving for why he writes them that way, you come to understand that no, it's more likely that

827
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,560
he came up with the things and then he just got lazy later and didn't give a shit about making

828
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,520
the art very good. Like that's far more likely based on what I know about him and his writing.

829
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:43,280
Exactly. I think about the things that I know about him. What are the elements of this? There

830
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:50,480
is a pseudo self insert character. Very Hussie happens all the time. Aside from his literal

831
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:56,240
self insert, he describes very often in many old form springs about how many of the characters are

832
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:01,760
aspects of himself in very clear ways. Like he refers to Dave and Dirk as author inserts in

833
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:09,120
many ways. What are the other elements of this? You know, Riska being like a force, like just a

834
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:15,440
force for chaos and a force to drive the storm. Yeah, for the authorial wrath. Yeah, that is also

835
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:21,520
very Hussie and just his general attitude and way he's described things in his general humor style

836
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:27,760
is often just inflict pain upon others. And it's literally just something that he likes to do.

837
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,720
I don't think that's that's that's weird. I was I was saying I was saying on the I was saying on

838
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:38,640
the video before that just makes me so mad. It makes me so mad that people in this day and age

839
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,920
in 2019 year of our lord will roll their eyes at Homestuck and not and think of it as anything

840
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:50,320
other than just a brilliant work of genius. Hey man, I love Homestuck. Yeah, despite all its flaws,

841
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,960
like people that haven't read Homestuck, they just go like yeah. Yeah, Homestuck. Yeah, that's

842
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,680
dumb thing. Isn't it impossible to read more? Isn't it like impossible to read now though,

843
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:06,000
because the flash is down or whatever? No, no, it was the website. The website has changed and

844
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,520
the some of the flashes have been replaced with well all of the flashes exist, but you just have

845
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,840
to click on a little I was in which is the site from flash version to like non flash version. I

846
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,440
was in a comic book store and I saw like all of Homestuck in book form. And I was thinking like

847
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:27,760
how the hell does that work? I thought it was like a game or something. I would not want to read

848
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:34,640
it in book form. Not first, at least. No, not first. Yeah. It's definitely like a supplemental

849
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:41,200
item. And I like having it as an object. I like reading the author. It's like buying the soundtrack

850
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:48,000
to a sheet like or something. It has to lose so much. I flipped through it to try and like

851
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,400
understand like how you put this thing in a book. And it's like, yeah, all the things that

852
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:58,640
used to be like one sequential page of a like a website are now like all put together as panels

853
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,040
in a page. And it's like you are John Egbert and you're fucking over here and you're doing this

854
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,640
and it's like all on one page. And I'm like, how the fuck do you read this? Where do these words

855
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:12,080
go? Well, it's it was very confusing. It's not great. It's not great. I have I have book one and

856
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:21,360
two. And I regard them fondly. And I love to read the commentary. But it is. It's not fun to read.

857
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:27,840
I don't like it. Like it's not a great home stuck not so great. Just not good.

858
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:34,960
I've got the problem sleuth books. You know, I like them. I like reading them. But like the

859
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:43,440
animated segments lose like most of their impact much. Yeah, like they lose basically it's not

860
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:49,520
even an adaptation. It's just a straight copy paste like without any like you adapt a manga to an

861
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,560
anime like you do an a real adaptation you redraw you reformulate. But this is just you know,

862
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:01,600
basically like a flash zip file with the PNG is copied over to well, I mean, there's a little bit

863
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:07,920
like like the sepulchretude parts. There's like, you know, like the the it sort of flows out like

864
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,360
it like kind of covers the page and parts and like, I mean, there is some adaptation going on

865
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:21,840
there. But yeah, I mean, oh, by the way, the troll romance section was notes were really funny.

866
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,560
And I would recommend you at least try and find the notes. He was like making fun of

867
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,720
those wasn't he wasn't that like his main goal with that? Yeah, yeah. Well,

868
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,920
he was basically explaining how it's not actually as ridiculous as it looks. And it's

869
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,960
basically just human. It's just human romance. But with certain aspects of human romance given

870
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,320
silly names, and he made it look like ridiculous. And so people were freaking out and he was like,

871
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:51,200
that's the sort of thing he likes doing. Yeah, I mean, it's great. Definitely. I mean, there's

872
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:57,600
there's nothing like he brings when he brings the trauma romance back, he's like, oh, you don't

873
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,400
think I'm going to do it. And he has like all the text from all those pages, but like in tiny,

874
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:08,000
tiny, tiny typeface filling an entire page. And then like on the other page opposite is just him

875
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:14,640
doing that the laughing like haha. Got him. And it's like, wow. And then in the author notes

876
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,200
underneath both of those pages, he also put the exact same text. Oh, you know, it'd be really

877
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:23,520
funny if I put all of this troll romance stuff in the author notes as well. Oh, you don't think

878
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,920
I'll do it. And then he does like it's so hard to read funny. I can't believe Hussie never dabbed

879
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:35,280
a single time in the entire course of Homestuck. You might be able to find some some some dab like

880
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,640
positions there. I think I think just wasn't it wasn't a big did I mention okay, I think I might

881
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,640
have talked about this. Stop me if I've told this before. But I really like these videos by John

882
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:50,560
Boyce called like pretty good. And just he does like things about sports that are interesting.

883
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:58,720
And he and his he and one of his cohorts at SB nation discovered discovered the very first dab,

884
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:06,080
like the pro the proto dab. Was it Michael Jackson or something? No, it was just done by some player

885
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:13,760
on the on the the Troy State basketball college basketball team in the Troy State versus DeVry

886
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:19,040
University basketball game that holds the record for most baskets scored in a basketball game ever

887
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:23,920
in any in any league. But but how can you actually know that's really the first one though? I always

888
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:30,160
thought well it's the first one anyone's ever seen. The dab was like taken in inspiration at

889
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:34,640
least from Usain Bolt when he does the thing with pointing with two hands in the same direction.

890
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:41,600
You know that what I think I know what you're talking about. Yeah, who knows the same sort of

891
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:46,880
thing. I mean, okay, the guy in this the guy in this like record breaking basketball game,

892
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,360
he doesn't do like a full and he does sort of like a double mover like first he brings his arms to

893
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:58,240
the side and then he sort of bends over and like kind of moves them up in a in a it's sort of it's

894
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:04,000
like a proto dab. Yeah, okay, okay, it's not quite a dab as we understand it today. But it is, you

895
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,240
know, it has all the underpinning evolution. It has all the ideological underpinnings of a dab.

896
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:17,360
Uh, yes, okay. I think that's neat. Word. So what about the fastest dab of all time? Oh,

897
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:23,040
I can do that. Have you seen that video of the dude do moving at light speed? Have you guys seen

898
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:32,080
the video electrocuted myself to dab? No, there I was shown a fantastic YouTube channel highly

899
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:43,120
recommended. Michael Reeves, he is a like a baby, the smallest genius ever made, but he is perhaps

900
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:50,800
the funny it like the smartest person on earth. Okay, I'm sure it's really smart exclusively

901
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:58,240
exclusively for evil. I'm sure he's a technical creative genius. But he does things like programming

902
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:04,080
a robot to shoot him when he gets shot in fortnight or or electrocuting his muscles to force

903
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,640
him to dab. I'm gonna link it down right now. Okay, that's great. But please also review this

904
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:15,280
quickest dab ever caught on film. I love quickest dab. It's like it's like watching a frog catch a

905
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:21,760
fly with its tongue. It's so fast. It's so just you can't comprehend it in real time. Yeah, no,

906
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:27,040
the I can't catch it. I don't think the camera even caught the whole motion in like in he did it

907
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:32,000
like with between frames he hit the dab and then it's like there's just like the suggestion of the

908
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:39,920
motion indeed you understand but you understand what happens god damn impressive impressive. It's

909
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:45,120
like pornography you can't quantify it but you know there's something going on when you see you know

910
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:51,920
a dab when you see it. You can't you can't define a dab. Yeah, electrocuting my muscles to force me

911
01:22:51,920 --> 01:23:00,400
to dab. He's screaming in pain. Did it work? Yeah. Oh, it worked. It worked perfectly. Damn,

912
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:08,960
but what was what was the trigger for the electrocution? These medical grade like electrodes

913
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,200
that he had strapped on to his entire body like like on his shoulders on his back that would

914
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:19,360
hide in the high frequency electricity signals to certain parts but parts of his body to cause

915
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,360
the spasm uncontrollable. Okay, I'm with you on that but the only issue with that is how do we

916
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:29,360
know that this is even true because we can't like prove he did it on an unsuspecting person who

917
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,280
didn't know what's happening but you could say he was lying but he does like I don't know I believe

918
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:38,800
him he does he does multiple like truth checks to like really okay yeah okay I'll have to check it

919
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:45,440
out more thoroughly um a robot shooting when I get shot in fortnight he um he like he like

920
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:50,320
does like a like a close-up of his muscles while they're spasming and like in a way that like I

921
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:55,360
don't think that you would be able to like fake if even if you wanted to and I see he's using the uh

922
01:23:55,360 --> 01:24:02,560
the strand's cutaneous uh electrical nerves oh wait I thought it was a meme it the acronym is

923
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:07,680
shit but it just doesn't matter wait never mind wait you mean you meant like the the the place

924
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:13,280
where he put the electrodes makes the specific muscles that forces him to literally do the

925
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:18,720
dab yeah I thought it was like yeah whoa I thought it was like um if you don't dab you get electrocuted

926
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:25,200
or something no that's pretty that's that's way more sciencey and impressive yeah I like this

927
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:30,400
channel this channel confuses me there's there's a weird uh uh anomaly you scroll through his videos

928
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:36,640
there's like trigger me Elmo electrocuting my muscles to force me to dab I built the stupidest

929
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:41,520
gun in the world but if you scroll all the way down amongst all this stuff there's just like

930
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:49,760
two C sharp tutorials yeah I don't understand are they like tongue-in-cheek or no that's so odd

931
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:55,600
I'm trying to scroll through to see him like electrocuting his dab muscles I just want to see

932
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,080
it work it's towards the end yeah yeah it's there it's there

933
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,720
I mean he's the guy seems to be we got to watch this video like thoroughly to to analyze the

934
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:14,160
yeah yeah you know up front okay but anyway people enough on that uh uh uh I mean anybody else got

935
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,000
anything they want to talk about because I'm just letting you know we have like a bunch of voicemails

936
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,560
so we could spend a while on that a bunch we have like like 17 I'm not anything that isn't

937
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,280
home stuck because I have nothing to contribute fair enough Tom you got to read it you got to read

938
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:37,360
it dude it's the only way I had to get through Naruto Kai yeah Naruto Kai that should be your thing

939
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:42,880
Tom didn't you want to like didn't you want to like school me about like politics on the last episode

940
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,800
no I would but the point of me bringing it up was just that I thought it was gay that it ruined

941
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:52,320
the awesome art vibe I was having oh okay fair enough and then you told me I don't think I had that

942
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,920
I mean I remember Tom saying I think you tweeted the other day at the tweet I very much sympathized

943
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,240
with that was like something about like have lots of political things but the only thing I hate more

944
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:04,480
than political ideas I disagree with is tweeting about politics I know the thing about the tweet

945
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:08,720
the actual tweet was I have tons of strong political opinions but my strongest political

946
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:16,000
opinion is I hate talking about political right right okay um gay well fair enough fair enough

947
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,600
okay but regardless we got like a million fucking things we might as well get a million I'm not

948
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:29,040
something like there are 17 of these okay summer summer but um but uh okay the good news is uh we've

949
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:35,760
got uh some pizza party podcast updates here uh oh so let's just check in uh let me see this one is

950

okay this one's called where's the podcast okay let's let's see what this one has to say

951
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:47,520
eternal question I'm watching Michael Reeves just scream and pain as he's muscles forcibly

952
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,360
dab for him that's great great well while you're in agony listen to this uh as well

953
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:02,080
everyone was too busy asking where's the podcast that nobody bothered to ask

954
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:13,200
how's the podcast and I just think that's pretty sad I already know that it has to be

955
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:19,120
the most glorious podcast it has to be the thing that will finally fill that void in me

956
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:24,640
that I'm just I'm just every day all day I'm just scarfing content I'm just opening up my

957
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:29,520
brain hole and scooping as much content into it as I possibly can just to fill something to fill

958
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,160
that hole to fill some need in me that I can't even identify and I know that the pizza party

959
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:40,880
podcast would be it if only I could find it out there in the vast nothingness that is our modern

960
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:47,040
reality speaking of filling holes okay stick with me for a second uh has anyone ever read

961
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:53,200
that uh I forget his name ito I eat oh okay he knows exactly where I'm going uh there's this

962
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,760
there's this one the cracks in the rock or something I forget what it's called but it's

963
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,320
about a girl who I forget what happens she gets like grease on her and it creates a bunch of like

964
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:07,440
holes in her skin and it just happens more and more uh like her whole body gets covered in

965
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:14,000
these disgusting holes and she finds kind of joy in inserting things into them it gives her pleasure

966
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,600
so I'm just so just the the money shot is at the very end the final page is like her mom walks

967
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,920
out on her alone in a room that's her whole body is not only covered with holes but has

968
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:29,120
all been filled by objects that she's pleasuring herself with all these holes all over her body

969
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:35,920
as she says to her mom mom I need more I can't fill all the holes and that's now that's that's

970
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:43,760
how's the podcast by the way ever since you mentioned it uh I have been vigorously editing

971
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:51,280
this image and I have this to show for you I've created it is hussy dabbing that's uh you know

972
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,400
not a bent elbow there but it's better than nothing it's the best we could do it's the best

973
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:01,360
we could do again another prototype dab sort of thing is it done is it it's over yes we're done

974
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:05,600
describing gross things did you wait did you post a picture it's in the gross disgusting audio

981
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:34,960
to death in my glory the pizza party president himself wanted audience with me and we did business saucy

982
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:42,960
cheesy business and i got it so that the sign outside looks just like any peter piper pizza by the way

995
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:07,760
can maximize your enjoyment by just doing one simple thing and that is leaving a message oh my god if

01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,920
you leave a message you'll be listening to the whole episode standing on your fucking on your

pleasure of his or anyone else's life and you can too at at at speakpipe.com slash something

1004
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:02,000

01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,960
to the click to type it so you might as well um okay so now that's out of the way leave messages to

enhance your own enjoyment people um here is although i'm sure for most it's vast disappointment

1007

1008

one glorious that one glorious win that one that one hit yeah they'll have you coming back for more

1010
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:29,840
that's what you need the difference between the lottery and the pcp voicemail though is that this

1011
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:35,520
is a test of skill so you can improve your odds by getting better much like the discussion that

1012
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:42,240
opened the show it's all about skill the difference between uh gambling and sending a voicemail to the

1013
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:50,800
pcp is that with the pcp even if you win you still lose with gambling you actually do win

1014
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:56,000
there's the chance however remote okay next voicemail is from a free thinker but spelled with

1015
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:02,080
like numerals instead of the vowels like fr three three you know thinker one three etc yeah let's see

1060
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:36,320
has a voicemail for us let's listen up you probably turned this off once you know who i am

1061
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:41,120
i used to go by the name binary dude and was hailed by jesse as the worst commenter of all time

1062
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:46,160
oh yes looking back i can simply see why it was everything that i said was my fault and i know

1063
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:51,440
like probably jesse gets to do a lot but from that moment from like three days since that moment i

1064
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:57,760
end on i just became really unsatisfied with how i was speaking the internet in general i did not know

1065
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,480
it was completely because of my autistic fucking retardedness because i just didn't think about it

1066
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:09,040
and just how that can look like like actually affect someone's day just a thought of ruining

1067
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,480
someone's day because of some bullshit i said online is something that stayed with me and

1068
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:17,440
actually altered my behavior on how i deal with this stuff online so even though i had no redemption

1069
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:23,360
arc and of course i didn't act like a fucking jackass um at least i got that awareness and for

1070
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:29,280
whatever for whatever that's worth i am completely sorry to jesse he's actually a guy i uh tried to

1071
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:36,000
watch every video nowadays whenever they come up um so i probably there's nothing i can say that like

1072
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:44,080
okay okay we got it disconnect is is too sad i thought i thought i thought it's over it's over

1073
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:48,320
i thought there was a joke coming i thought there was gonna be a subversion of my expectations

1074
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:54,240
that was worse than a bad comment all right that's fair i you're fucked up even harder this time

1075
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:59,600
yeah i thought i thought i'd show him because just here's a guy who's who's who's who's who's

1076
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:05,280
trying to redeem himself and i would just think it isn't that nice to see someone you know i do

1077
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:10,080
remember the guy i don't remember what his comment was about i remember like an argument i think

1078
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:16,080
like a long argument i remember writing paragraphs and paragraphs and like i remember like months

1079
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:22,560
after that maybe a year after that he like he found like my defunct endless jest facebook page and like

1080
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:29,280
messaged me like a private message to me like this even more massive like apology oh and that was

1081
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:34,240
years ago that was years ago so this guy has been like stewing in this for years well you know what

1082
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:39,120
maybe this will be his catharsis the fact that he was able to to be on here maybe he can rest in

1083
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:46,080
peace at long last hopefully i mean i i don't even know what i don't remember what was bad about it

1084
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:50,320
i'm sure your comment was horrible but i don't care you know this is the funny thing i i'm sure

1085
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:56,880
that i've since seen many worse commenters in fact i i can guarantee it so don't please don't

1086
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,680
beat yourself up about it anymore well yeah than you already have i think there's a lesson to be

1087
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:06,240
learned here that that's something like well well it's possible he may have been a total pants on

1088
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:12,000
head retarded commenter at one point like you don't need external validation necessarily like if

1089
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,440
you've changed your ways or whatever and you're like you know what i'm not gonna do this anymore

1090
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:20,160

1091
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:24,480
you know maybe sometimes they might uh but certainly as like as if you're like a shitty

1092
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:29,040
commenter odds are even if you were like a jerk or you made a bad impression on somebody odds are

1093
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:33,920
they don't like specifically remember you or anything so if you just improve your overall

1094
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,520
behavior going forward then you'll probably you know that that's really the best good you

1095
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:42,080
can do for the world i'd say probably oh i don't want to shout out specific bad commenters right

1096
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,280

1135
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:58,160
floor challenge he looks like sniper joe but he just has like a bernie 2020 hat on him that's him

1136
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:06,000
okay go hey guys it's me zoomer joe again this time i'm calling in from my vr headset actually i'm

1137
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,600
doing a new challenge a new zoomer challenge that all the kids are doing it's called calling to the

1138
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:16,960
procrastinator's show while in vr but the vr room that you're in is actually a room with your

1139
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:22,720
mother staring intently at you looking disappointed that's what i'm doing i'm calling you right now

1140
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:29,200
i'm speaking these words while staring into the disapproving soulless eyes of my very own mother

1141
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:38,800
well i gotta go now zoom i like the zoom i like the action he did it he he beat the challenge

1142
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:46,080
what was the challenge wow call into the channel oh i like how it's not a challenge for anyone else

1143
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:50,000
it's just a challenge for him and he's already completed it by the time he calls well you just

1144
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,440
gotta get your mom to fucking to fucking you know understand what you're doing so she'll look at

1145
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,840
you disappointedly oh and then and then the challenge begins incidentally zoomer joe after

1146
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,080
listening to last episode he left a separate message and said do not play the one i just played

1147
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:08,400
he said play the other one the thing is though this one was funnier than the other one so i just

1148
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:12,880
didn't want to you made the executive decision indeed i did and it paid off in spades yep all

1149
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:19,120
all right i think so cool okay moving on uh we've got another call from correct correct okay go

1150
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:27,120
okay spell differently hey you fucking nuts i'm curious given someone who disagrees with you

1151
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:34,720
do you tend to believe more frequently that they have been misled by a set of incorrect information

1152
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:42,000
or do you tend to believe that they just value different things to you i that's a real question

1153
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:49,360
i assume i will assume that they are misinformed first and only only only after like only after

1154
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:54,960
like serious probing of the subject we like disappointedly conclude that their their core

1155
01:47:54,960 --> 01:48:01,040
values are just fucked because they're different from mine right uh you know i've uh i've noticed

1156
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:07,920
that i've i think for a long time i've been possibly a way too charitable arguer and that

1157
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,400
like i'm it seems like when i argue i'm looking for ways generally with someone i would like

1158
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:18,160
respect and don't think it's like a total idiot i'll i'll look for ways to like you know make them

1159
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:22,560
seem like to really straw a steel man their argument i guess like i guess that's what i'm

1160
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,800
just describing a really steel man arguments and i want to touch on like wait what what is a steel

1161
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:30,640
man well it's it's the opposite of a straw man or what you're well sort of an opposite it's what

1162
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:35,360
what you're trying to do is give the strongest best possible interpretation of your like quote

1163
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,400
unquote opponents did you make this up no no it's it's making the rounds i i didn't make it up um

1164
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,080
it's it's pretty good though it's uh i mean i pretty much believe in it i think it's like the

1165
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:49,040
best way to get to like good faith arguments though to to abide by it so i guess just answer

1166
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:53,840
his question i think i think that i generally go to like my default now is that people have

1167
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,600
different values that's that's seems to be where i start whether that's smart or not i don't know

1168
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:04,800
i i i start arguing text because if i am to take this in the way it's probably obviously

1169
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:09,440
meant and like the stuff we've been talking about recently about politics and stuff like that yeah

1170
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:17,920
i think most likely my my first reaction is why do you think that like like what like why are you

1171
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:24,000
thinking that and that could be your misled but i don't know if i know i don't know if i make a

1172
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,760
judgment on whether what people do i just kind of want to find out why and then i'll make my

1173
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,560
decision based upon it but if i had to like guess like it like what do i think the people at large

1174
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:40,320
like are they irrational or are they rational i would say i think like they are like just they

1175
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:45,520
had different values than me in general i i think that it they might not just be like

1176
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:50,080
led astray yeah i don't know that's a particularly healthy way i think i've come to a conclusion

1177
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:57,280
about this that might seem radical to some yeah i i have come to find that opinions in general

1178
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:04,080
having opinions is just wrong and it's bad and i so i i don't have any i strive to have evolved

1179
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:09,840
beyond the need for any opinion so that i can just fucking float and just like be like water you know

1180
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:13,360
that's kind of what the monks do right they try to just dissociate from reality because like you

1181
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:19,520
know because humans are not rational humans are highly irrational highly stupid morally

1182
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:25,280
bankrupt evil sacks of shit every single one of them and like every opinion that you see

1183
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,840
if you talk to these people even a good opinion that you think is good even an opinion that you

1184
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,920
might agree with if you talk to these people and if you scratch the surface you will find

1185
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:41,040
the insanity behind everyone's reasoning everyone has their own fucked up just their

1186
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:47,680
brains are just shit everyone's brain is just shit and piss and cum and it's just that's all

1187
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:52,000
there is even even even something that you think sounds smart if you really scratch the surface

1188
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,600
and talk to the person long enough you'll realize they only think that because of something fucking

1189
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,920
wrong with their brain everyone is fucked no opinions allowed i don't like them just everyone

1190
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,840
just be like water man just fill the glass you're in okay fuck it there there's go with it i mean

1191
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,760
it kind of makes sense i mean when you get like to like a large enough scale like if you're like a

1192
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:20,000
president or like a a dictator whatever like you don't treat like your subjects even if you're like

1193
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,080
the smartest rule it doesn't really make sense to like treat your rule like your subject like they're

1194
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:29,840
all like perfect philosophers who you know are able to like totally like you appeal to like

1195
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,640
their interests like if you got like a farming population you're like okay let's like lower

1196
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:40,320
taxes on like seeds and i don't know if you there's somebody else you don't like let's raise taxes on

1197
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:45,200
something else it's like boom i just boosted my popularity and you can even may argue that like

1198
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:50,080
that was like a good thing because there's like more farmers in the country than there are i don't

1199
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:56,640
know like lawyers or something and so was this an objective good uh i don't know maybe uh may i feel

1200
01:51:56,640 --> 01:52:00,880
like i just got whiplash right now how is this really what was just saying what just being said

1201
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:06,080
well i'm just like i'm i'm trying to make a comparison of like the the how there's no like

1202
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:11,280
there's no inherent like correctness in any kind of like political idea that a lot of it is just

1203
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:15,600
coming down to like a person's personal values like that you could call you can call that just

1204
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:21,920
like their own personal madness just like that's not that's not the that's not the question well i

1205
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:26,560
know i'm just responding to jesse's point though and i'm aware i'm you know wondering a little bit

1206
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:31,680
i don't think it's totally irrelevant like all these people commenting on on my videos like oh

1207
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:36,880
your opinion is bad you have the wrong opinion and it's like you don't get it it's not my opinion

1208
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:42,400
it's all made up i made it up because it's funny fuck you i can't be right or wrong i don't fucking

1209
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:47,360
give a shit what you think i'm wrong about resident evil too because i said i hate it i lied

1210
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:52,560
it's great you fucking morons you clods you dumbasses you're just playing right into my hands

1211
01:52:53,520 --> 01:53:02,000
um i don't know correct i have no fucking opinion i can't be wrong i have no opinion so i'm always

1212
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:08,880
right that's the perfect flawless position unassailable from any side uh well moving on

1213
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:15,280
let's move on to comments our sin by our next commenter comments our sin uh go

1214
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:21,920
in regard to the point that ben made last podcast about not wanting to have comments associated

1215
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:26,320
with your work because inherently when there's comments under like a youtube video you associated

1216
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:33,360
with it when i was reading through hunter hunter on the most unsavory of online sites i found this

1217
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:38,960
one motherfucking commenter who at the end of every chapter would just post the most

1218
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:44,720
uninsightful vapid trying to be funny he had a fucking he had the fucking um guts icon

1219
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:50,480
the guts face where he's like smiling really big and it just made me hate him even more

1220
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:55,120
to know that he ride berserk as well but it was just like he developed a cult of personality

1221
01:53:55,120 --> 01:54:00,960
in this comment section people would comment and say just hate him just attack him and he

1222
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,800
would just keep doing it and he got stronger from it and all i can think of is just like why

1223
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:10,800
is this part of my hunter hunter experience why is it tied to this now but also why am i so interested

1224
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:17,040
fair question you got sucked into the cult man we got a deep platform guts guy

1225
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:21,600
he's like uh he can't he can't keep getting away with it who's that one famous commenter

1226
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:26,160
kevin why or something is that him you know i'm talking about uh you talking about retro

gamer kevin no no there's this guy who comments on like every does the y stand for yellow i don't

1228
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:37,520
know god damn all right let's move on i guess um wait who is kevin why there there is like a famous

1229
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:42,720
youtube commenter with like he's got several hundred thousand subs but no videos and his thing

1230
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:48,320
is that he just comments on like every video uh it just goes around and like is a notable

1231
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:53,120
commenter on youtube are are they good comments i don't think they're that good i'm not really

1232
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:57,680
sure i haven't studied them how did this happen they can't possibly be that good how could this

1233
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:03,200
how could this have happened yeah this is a mistake we need to detach his platform i don't know i don't

1234
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:09,200
know i i mean he's he's not benefiting from it because he doesn't make videos it's just no what

1235
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:14,400
if he had his own patreon like just to support his comment does he have a silver play button

1236
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:19,680
sorry oh maybe he should get the silver play button as like a creator on youtube right maybe

1237
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:25,040
you have to have one video the only one who never made a video to get the silver play button

1238
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:32,640
he might he gets like a silver like a comment submit button instead oh yeah yeah it just says submit

1239
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:40,480
he's a hero um anyway well that's fascinating yeah he's a fascinating guy and this this this

1240
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:45,840
comment this this voicemail uh was interesting as well and it's just yeah like i don't know like

1241
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:50,400
with somebody like me who reads one piece weekly and stuff i go to like 4chan on a and like talk

1242
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:56,000
about it in a group but that's like me seeking that out specifically like on on manga stream or

1243
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,400
gymonies box or whatever like there's no comment section like directly under it so i i'm totally

1244
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:06,480
free of that and it's great and i'm super happy that that's the case uh so yeah i don't know i it's

1245
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:11,360
i definitely will impact like the delivery of the content if there's like you know

1246
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:16,560
visible comments around it or on it or whatever so uh yeah you know it's always felt really weird

1247
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:22,800
to me um and i also keep looking at them even though i hey i don't like them at all is uh

1248
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:28,480
comments under like hentai and porn yeah we talked about that and and comments on porn are so weird

1249
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:33,600
like i remember like uh that on the site site frequent there was always this one guy who would

1250
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:37,600
have something funny to say on every page of every dojin and hentai i was like

1251
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:44,880
like what what are you doing and then like he it can be cool but then he's sort of it's the same

1252
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,560
sort of thing the cult of personality people started to recognize this guy and then people

1253
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:54,240
started to imitate this guy and and like there was a whole there was a whole like subculture on

1254
01:56:54,240 --> 01:57:00,560
this porn site people were jacking off and then laughing or like hating got any examples of like

1255
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:07,280
what he might say in general uh i mean it was never like unfunny it was just sort of like

1256
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:11,760
i'm trying to jack off this is a porn time sure what does he get out of it what does he get out

1257
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:16,240
of posting a little bit of community a little community in this particular you know forum or

1258
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:21,040
whatever well but there was no form like back and forth it was just like he was throwing his thing

1259
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:24,640
out in there and then people would keep seeing it well i mean it's i think that the what you get

1260
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:28,880
out is just yeah it's exactly that it's like you like you're here obviously people do come here

1261
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,200
to some degree if you comment they might see your thoughts and it might you know feel kind of nice

1262
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:38,960
if people like or see your comments especially if as this guy has it becomes kind of a thing that you

1263
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,200
do so i'm not saying it's a lot but i'm saying there's there's something of value same with you

1264
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:48,480
too i want to like go off i'm like how this is so weird how people spend their time and build

1265
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:53,120
community but i spent like three years talking about my little pony so i have no i've no ground

1266
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:58,080
not too different from that equally sexual i'd say

1267
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:06,560
okay let's move on hey season nine just premiered like yesterday uh no it did is this the last season

1268
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:14,640
yeah oh god oh no what are we gonna do guys what are we gonna do our revenue stream is gonna dry out

1269
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:19,600
yeah this is our cash cow i watched the latest episodes of my own did i ever talk about this

1270
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:24,400
no i don't think so no i watched a handful of them you mentioned it once or twice how they how they

1271
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:33,520
hold up i um how do they hold up yeah uh on how the age paralleled okay so i watched this

1272
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:40,800
probably the worst possible way that i could go about doing it and that's um i watched season eight

1273
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:49,440
and sevens uh start and end in reverse order okay so i watched four two parts in reverse order

1274
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:54,320
so i watched the end of season eight the beginning of season eight the end of season seven and the

1275
01:58:54,320 --> 01:59:03,760
beginning of season seven and uh it was sort of like being on drugs in a way that like you can't

1276
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:10,720
really trust what your body is perceiving sure uh the first thing being thrown back into the arena

1277
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:18,320
after uh you know being away from from hashtag enter the arena hashtag right before exactly uh

1278
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:27,280
was okay the end of season eight was unbelievable how much change from really what i just dude i've

1279
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:33,440
seen the like collections of new characters and i'm like who are these people what is this okay

1280
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:38,000
it's uh it's pretty insane it's bizarre there's like a weird like red not not knowing what happened

1281
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,480
between net then isn't like tirak back as like a good guy or something now i think i saw that

1282
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:48,320
he was back in a new episode he was in the most latest uh latest episode all right the last thing

1283
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:53,200
i remember happy to my little pony is twilight and the main sick go to like a parody of new

1284
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:57,760
york and rarity is there and she makes dresses and she works herself too hard yeah i remember that

1285
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:03,760
now twilight is the headmaster of a school what there's a literal weird white nationalist pony

1286
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:10,720
who wants to wipe out the other sub races dude yes this school is meant to be for ponies only

1287
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:17,200
these beasts are not fit these not fab to the equestria school unified school district guidelines

1288
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:21,920
is is there a pony is there a pony trump is this pony um it might as well be this guy it might as

1289
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:27,360
well be this guy imagine if imagine if like ponyville got a new mayor like they elected a new and he's

1290
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:32,800
like orange and he has like a big like swooshy blonde mane and he's all like wrinkly and stuff he's

1291
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:38,800
like a mean boy gotta build a wall like is is is is the headmaster they wouldn't do it too they would

1292
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:45,200
fucking do you know honestly he got elected because he was colluding with the dragons they don't forget

1293
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:50,720
my little pony came down hard against communism so i don't think they're like that uh i don't know

1294
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:57,040
anti trump e i mean maybe i'm just talking to everyone knows communism's bad but uh that's that's

1295
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:01,280
like uh like a big jump to take all right all right you know what you know what that's a huge

1296
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:06,720
jump that i sound dumb okay fair point i i i i will give them credit i think they're a little bit

1297
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:14,640
most of the world agrees communism isn't great but i gotta get into the world i think we know

1298
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:19,440
what's going on okay anyway much but i'm sorry okay so so twilight is the headmaster of a school

1299
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:25,360
and the main six are like teachers at this giant college is erected in ponyville is what is your

1300
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:30,160
high on is fluttershy a teacher too yeah i think it makes sense that doesn't make sense she wouldn't

1301
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:35,600
be a team why do they make what fluttershy in fact has won teacher of the month for like two years in

1302
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:40,400
a row because she fucks her students because she won't say no that's why she has low self-esteem

1303
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:45,440
she makes up for it like all sexy young women do by becoming ethos uh and this is the closest you

1304
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:51,040
can get um wait i don't nate i don't see your logic here that fluttershy wouldn't be fit to be a teacher

1305
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:58,080
isn't she i don't know she doesn't seem like she's like she's the element of kindness she's

1306
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:03,120
she's the she's the perfect teacher okay isn't she like what about pinkie pinkie she would like

1307
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:06,560
to be a teacher pinkie can't be a teacher can she like not talk to people doesn't have a whole

1308
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:11,440
point you gotta get in front of like a bunch of like lecture to people fluttershy is so far beyond

1309
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:16,560
that she's grown she has grown i guess she has grown she made she made so many baby steps that

1310
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:21,280
they added up to one adult she made so many babies too many i'm trying to say fuck that

1311
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:30,800
fucking horse what what fluttershy in her i like fluttershy but uh it was 1 000 baby steps for a

1312
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:38,800
pony one giant baby one giant baby for mankind all right okay so fair enough they're all teachers

1313
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:45,120
okay they're all teachers twilight has like a weird like surely temple pony who is uncomfortable

1314
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:50,800
and is like for like assistant in some weird bizarre way you see you open the door a crack and

1315
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:56,560
you let in a star set sunshine glimmer or whatever and then the floodgates burst open all these

1316
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:03,920
fucking weirdos there's a bunch of eclectic cafe-esque misfits and fucking morons there's like

1317
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:09,680
there's yaks there's griffins there's dragons there's changelings all the races are intermittently

1318
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:17,440
and the and the donald trump pony hates it that's hates it uh okay oh my god cozy cozy glows evil

1319
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:24,800
cozy cozy is evil she uh wants power and she tries to summon t-rex uh and she traps twilight

1320
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:31,200
in the co in hell and she traps them well the the the beast myth fits eclectic cafe members

1321
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:37,680
have to uh try and like at least you know make it the people known that she is an evil imposter

1322
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:43,840
and a dictator she imprisons she turns the masses against starlight glimmer who is a good personnel

1323
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:49,520
she uses like kindness to manipulate people into liking her literally now gore toxic femininity

1324
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:54,320
nice nice yeah yeah yeah i'm definitely not reading too much in this is definitely a pro jump

1325
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:59,840
anti uh sjw episode hey i'm just saying uh looking at i'm on the villains i'm on the

1326
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:06,640
villains wiki uh and i'm on cozy glows page and and and right above her image is a big red banner

1327
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:12,640
labeling her in the category of evil doer so don't get confused hey i see is your kid mark a

1328
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:17,600
unlike all the other villains on this on this week she is an evil doer rook in chess is that what

1329
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:24,320
that is no no it looks like it looks like it might be it's kind of a spirit by her wing

1330
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:31,760
type of villain tyrannical brat i mean that's a classification i just want to say that i i actually

1331
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,640
like uh that idea for a story and i like her design and i think she's a cool character and i like her

1332
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:41,600
ponies are good guys let's review the show let's like as in as in like watch oh maybe we should

1333
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:45,440
maybe we should that was tame that was tame because that's just like like a massive departure

1334
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:50,960
from the job then you go back to season seven yeah and it's fucking insane okay okay so twilight

1335
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:56,880
sparkle likes star swirled the beard so she like plays god and brings stars swirled the beard no

1336
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:04,320
back to life are you kidding me other mythical friends to just these historic people from the

1337
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:09,600
olden days twilight brings them back to life what i guess typically she unseals them that's

1338
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:14,640
literally fucking what's his face that's literally like what twilight did in remember what's that

1339
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:19,440
fucking apple she ate too many apples and she had a psychedelic trip and there was an episode

1340
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:23,760
for each of the other ponies too you know what i'm talking about max dot mauve dot mauve yeah

1341
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,520
that's the one dot mauve whatever it's fucking twilight dot mauve magic dot mauve whatever

1342
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:32,640
that's exactly what literally happened uh what the fuck they're all they're all labeled evil

1343
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:38,080
doer every single one is labeled evil doer why have it um they're all they're all because if they

1344
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:43,200
don't do evil they're good but this is the evil person wiki right like by default well that it

1345
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:48,400
probably be like evil doer and redeemed doer i guess they're being thorough okay anyway so they're

1346
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:53,920
bringing them back to life but but because they bring them back to life the pony of shadows the

1347
02:05:53,920 --> 02:06:00,080
villain the pony of shadows he is a pony who just is black and somewhat wispy that's his fucking name

1348
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:05,360
is the pony of shadows no stop that's the guy he was the one that they said was in the castle in

1349
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:09,920
that one where they're running around the castle castle mania oh that was real that finally means

1350
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:14,960
materialized or something was real that was confirmed as a joke but i guess they turned it

1351
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:19,760
into a oh isn't that great when you turn jokes into like actual plot points great i love that and

1352
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:23,680
and yeah it's good it's actually better no it's not it was like it's like what it's like

1353
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:30,080
these like to do with the party god and it sucked in adventure time no i mean you guys are bullshit

it's a good show it was finally acknowledged it sounds like the way the analysis was the

1363
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:19,840
comic section of my i don't know if i was making like a value judgment on it i just think it's crazy

1364
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:24,080
that so much has changed and there's so many weird different storylines i never would have expected

1365
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:30,720
and that it was so i was caught off guard it is crazy yeah okay that's what is that's what i still

1366
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:36,400
love about it is that like the show is so different from what it was when it started and like for

1367
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:41,600
for like a cartoon that is for like things technically for stupid technically for stupid

1368
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:47,520
baby toddlers uh but like for it to have like so much ongoing depth and narrative and continuity

1369
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:52,000
and like it's a totally different show now it's a good show hey hey i'm with everyone i mean i

1370
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,000
mean i believe you on all that i'm just curious what's the cmc up to what's what's their arc right

1371
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:01,680
now are they doing anything they had like they started their own camp to like help other ponies

1372
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:07,680
get their cutie marks sure sure which i which i which i did think was stupid and it is actually a bad

1373
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:14,560
show okay right that i said uh yeah that's what they did okay all right fair enough that seems

1374
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:20,560
i feel like like a like a concentration camp yeah that's what kind of camp it was concentrate

1375
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:24,400
really hard on the concentrate all these fucking blank flanks they're just want to eliminate them

1376
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:29,040
from the populace uh they they grab their trowels and their bricks and their mortars and they're

1377
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:32,880
building dude imagine all the ponies they're like they're they're all blank flanks they bring them in

1378
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:37,600
but when they enter the camp they all get like the you know like the badges that the concentration

1379
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:44,000
kit like the star the star for the jews like the pink heart whatever uh oh yeah we got it we got it

1380
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,600
we got it we got to get rid of all these blank all these blank flanks are just coming over the

1381
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:54,640
border and taking our jobs and taking the lack of jobs because they have no talents exactly yeah

1382
02:08:54,640 --> 02:09:01,280
yeah we can't uh i guess it comes back to the nurture versus nature uh facet of of the synopsis

1383
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:07,920
for season nine the first the two-parter and it's pretty insane okay all right let's let's check it

1384
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:15,040
out people we'll have an educated opinion one of these days i feel like the i may be the reason

1385
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:20,400
the reason that um my little pony can get so crazy is is literally because

1386
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:26,960
of it being like a show kind of for babies that is not supposed to be really serious

1387
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:32,400
because they can it for like from a writing perspective you've got all these silly ponies

1388
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:38,880
and they do all these ridiculous things and um anything you want you can you can just throw in

1389
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:45,680
there but because generally from the beginning since lauren faust is it faust or forced i can't

1390
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:53,760
remember faust um haven't said in so long uh lauren faust's like has a vision and she got like

1391
02:09:54,400 --> 02:10:00,320
certain writers who she she felt like you know that could could make it like an actually good

1392
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:07,840
show that sort of has been carried on uh through all the seasons where it's like they can have fun

1393
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:13,280
but you know they don't need to they don't need to be too serious but because they don't need to

1394
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:18,480
be they can you know they can choose to be serious when they want to and that's why things get so

1395
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:23,680
crazy but the quality of the show doesn't get stupid because it's not like it's not like a game

1396
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:29,200
of thrones where people are like it has to be really good in a very specific way and if it goes

1397
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:35,200
silly or like has a bad episode or something people people wouldn't go apeshit if my little pony

1398
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:39,760
has a bad episode here or there they're just sort of you know what i mean like it's like under the

1399
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:43,360
radar and that's why it can do all these crazy things and it's fine it's like even to this day

1400
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:47,440
like in the hasbro offices when they're all making the show you know even though lauren faust

1401
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:51,360
hasn't been there in all these different years there's there's there's probably like a big

1402
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:56,000
like words written on the wall like big words that everyone can see that's like a quote from

1403
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:02,160
lauren faust that says don't forget don't be shit and so everyone knows when they're making the show

1404
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:08,880
they know not to make it shit and if every show had a guiding principle like that then every show

1405
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:14,320
would be great god the whole uh i've only ever had the wisdom to say don't be shit the whole

1406
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:18,800
contents of the show bible just contains one sentence a full blank page and then the one

1407
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:23,600
sentence don't forget don't be shit it's real you need to know collect the link in the description

1408
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:28,560
to see some nightmare fuel uh there you go please do uh okay but let's move on to our

1409
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:33,840
couple of last voicemails we got here people um we've got another one here oh i forgot to

1410
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:40,240
record in the show for a second there i understand what wait what possibly could have been the last

1411
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:46,400
voicemail what yeah possibly why did we start talking about it was okay the last one was comments

1412
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:53,040
our sin uh and and forget it just yeah yeah it's a mystery wait i'm curious because i i have

1413
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:58,640
forgotten you have to listen to the episode no wait a minute a fate worse than death is listening

1414
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:06,400
to my own podcast agreed um okay but here's uh here's one from art director 69 uh okay go

1415
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:12,160
hey guys i have a question um so like i was at home and listening to the podcast and then my friend

1416
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:16,320
was fucking his girlfriend too loudly so i came out here to record this uh so i'm a zoomer right

1417
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:21,040
like i'm on like i'm a zoomer uh i'm 19 and for a couple days like look at me i'm a zoomer uh

1418
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:24,720
what point in time does someone become a zoomer or not like i have a game team for people who are

1419
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:31,040
like old fucks or like 20 somethings but i'm a zoomer because i'm 19 right right right that's it

1420
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:38,880
20 fucking 24 no 25 just the cutoff if you're if you're currently 25 or over you're not a zoomer

1421
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:43,840
damn that's a pretty harsh uh cutoff i think that's i think it's a little high i think 25 barely not a

1422
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:51,200
zoomer then i think 20 so i think this guy's got it right i don't know i i think 20 20 year old

1423
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:56,720
are insufferable have you ever seen a 20 year old i don't want to zoomers i don't care to look upon them

1424
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:03,440
i feel like 25 is about right okay i i i think that's too old i know the real answer i know the

1425
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:09,760
real answer if you if you remember what you were doing on september 11th you are a millennial i

1426
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:15,600
don't you're a zoomer okay that's fine yeah that works so i mean september 11th is the is the

1427
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:20,560
is the cutoff point for all human history it's where it's before and after you would have had to

1428
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:26,880
have been like maybe five or so on like september 11 so how old would you be now uh that was well

1429
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:35,120

1443
02:14:54,560 --> 02:15:00,320
fucking uh support for it people want to contribute but the thing is like zero of the people

1444
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:04,640
who have expressed interest in showing like you know it's contributing to the project

1445
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:10,240
our programmers and that's fucking mental because we need we need those guys we need

1446
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:14,880
code boys we need people like me who are on the front lines and like developing shit because

1447
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:19,760
rempy isn't going to cut it we uh we were looking to expand operations i'm not gonna say too much

1448
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:24,880
about it but we're looking to expand operations with this injection of new talent and we can't

1449
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:32,000
do that if we're working with like shit fucking software and no programmers yeah i could also

1450
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:38,080
use rempy programmers if uh we don't get enough code boys just so like you know like make it easier

1451
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:45,360
on everyone involved but we need more fucking programmers and welcome to you viewer uh fuck

1452
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:50,720
this podcast fuck the people on there all means to an end we need more programmers to program the

1453
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:57,680
shit and that's it uh that that's all okay bye oh wait didgy uh i saw the video you did with may

1455
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:10,640
playthrough um all right so viewer you know i mean i guess they're looking for programming talent

1456
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:16,640
on the pcp dating sim is their twitter people i would probably the best way to get in touch would

1457
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:21,200
be to message them on twi on the twitter probably i imagine so it's the only way i know how to contact

1458
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:27,760
them so yeah um have they tried asking like the the many programmers involved in endless war

1459
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:32,880
probably not because that's a that that's a large enough we need we need them maybe we need all their

1460
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:40,320
energy uh but also probably maybe i don't i mean oh please just shut the hell up bro i

1469
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:20,800
things done by escalating my volume okay anyway let's move on to the next call

1470
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:25,400
thank you Joe thank you whole team on the dating sim next one is from Gator

1471
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:35,400
inflator this message goes out to Tom Oliver in regards to the vertical slice

1472
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:41,440
that he just released for a zoomie game quite enjoy it but suggestion the sword

1473
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:45,960
the hitbox for the sword is way too fucking dinky it's you have to get in

1474
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:50,120
way too close and it just doesn't go play strider and you'll see what I mean

1475
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:55,200
that that man can fucking swing a sword out like 30 feet and it's just like you

1476
02:17:55,200 --> 02:18:00,880
got it's just the right amount of room I'm not saying exactly I get that she's

1477
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:05,480
small but her sword doesn't need to fucking me like a little fish a little

1478
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:15,240
floppy little fish give me incentive to use it over just spamming shirkins all

1479
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:19,280
the time maybe put a limit on them or maybe make them a little slower or because

1480
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:23,320
just I hang back I just use that instead it just feels so much better

1481
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:29,600
lastly knockback it's a fucking it's it's it's too ninja-guidant for my taste

1482
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:37,600
you fly back and just out but you don't have the invincibility frames Tom tighten

1483
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:41,400
it up a little and it could be great the little raccoon which you could go far but

1484
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:50,040
as it is thank you okay way this guy sounds like he wants an easy mode I

1485
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:57,480
don't know if I can do that I suppose I think you I think you gotta tighten up

1486
02:18:57,480 --> 02:19:02,560
the graphics on level three oh fuck you're right yeah yeah that's some solid

1487
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:07,600
feedback it sounds like you went to school for that dude like damn I'll uh you

1488
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:12,320
know I await my check in the right I mean I'll say I mean I thought this was

1489
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:16,080
relatively insightful and decent feedback I remember when I was playing

1490
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:20,640
specifically I I suppose while the game still in development it's fair to

1491
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:24,600
make you know critiques or whatever I agree that it feels like you do have to

1492
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:28,000
get very close to enemies in order to hit them and considering like the

1493
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,240
relatively large size of a zoomie I mean again maybe this is literally what

1494
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:37,000
you're going for but I basically of like it feels like you're you got to get

1495
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,000
real close to do a hit and it could theoretically be more satisfying to have

1496
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,760
like a slightly larger hitbox which yeah I'm aware would require changing like

1497
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:48,320
you know a bunch of stuff including the animation itself but I don't know just

1498
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:53,000
saying that seems like reasonable suggestions would actually be

1499
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,480
relatively simple to fix yeah okay you just gotta edit a couple frames and

1500
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:01,640
then change the actual hitbox size do you use physical hitboxes for the damage

1501
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:06,360
calculations yeah okay cool cool oh I'm curious because I don't know well you

1502
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:09,720
know okay what I what I mean is a fitbox as opposed to like I mean some people

1503
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:13,760
use like ray tracing or stuff and that's a that's another method of calculating

1504
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:17,920
damage hits and whatnot but like I was curious if like because there's there's

1505
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:21,320
images that get posted like game dev threads on V and stuff of like the

1506
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:24,880
different games with like the different styles of hitboxes do you have one

1507
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:28,520
hitbox do you have stacked hitboxes to like because if they're rectangles you

1508
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:32,500
got to stack them to emulate like a circle shape or Smash Bros actually uses

1509
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:38,400
circles themselves so I'm curious what would you use for the vertical slice

1510
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:42,840
they're all just a single square and they approximate the size pretty pretty

1511
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:49,560
well I mean the the sword swings in the game that you use the area is can be

1512
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:54,080
covered with a square pretty effectively I didn't see a need to stack squares yeah

1513
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:59,720
that's um I figured like if it extended a little bit beyond the animation itself

1514
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:02,880
like I'd rather have people like wow I can't believe that hit they're like oh

1515
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:06,480
that's bullshit that sort of hit yeah kind of like overcompensate instead of

1516
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:12,360
undercompensated probably good yeah but yeah I mean the the shuriken thing is

1517
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:16,560
probably the thing that I want to address like that's something that is

1518
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:20,560
planned to to be changed yeah right now the reason not to use them is they do

1519
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:24,560
like so little damage compared to the sword but you can just kind of sit back

1520
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:29,400
and just spam them if you want to it just kind of gets boring but you know I

1521
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:33,320
mean that's a that could potentially be like a criticism of the game that's like

1522
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:37,160
even though like the game might feel boring to play that way to more cautious

1523
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:40,200
players like especially on like the first playthrough if you're just trying to

1524
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:43,440
get through the game like if the game incentivizes you to do a most boring

1525
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:47,480
option because it's super safe then you might want to funnel into that there

1526
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:52,200
actually is a bunch of logic right now turned off that controls inventory like

1527
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:55,040
one of the conditions for throwing the shurikens you should have ammo I just

1528
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:58,680
didn't get around to adding in the ammo yeah at some point there are supposed to

1529
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:03,520
be kind of like in a shinobi for the Genesis like I mean the Sekiro is the

1530
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:07,040
same way kind of Sekiro like the shurikens are kind of OP in some

1531
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:11,360
situations but you only have like 17 at a time so right when when did this

1532
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:15,960
vertical slice release like yesterday oh shit well why don't we put that in the

1533
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:23,240
fucking show notes god damn it wait yeah yeah yeah where can they find it it's on

1534
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:29,520
itch itch.io so it's Tom Oliver itch.io slash Izumi and it's the pinned tweet on

1535
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:34,000
my Twitter so there you go there you go all right I'm gonna I'm gonna check that

1536
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:39,040
out fucking neat. It does have controller support now which everyone was very

1537
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:42,360
adamant on adding so if you plug in your Xbox controller if you can play with a

1538
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:47,920
controller not a keyboard if you're that so inclined. Controller babies. Ben's of a

1539
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:54,680
higher grade. We need to respect players by adding controller support wrong okay

1540
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:00,080
oh god damn it I posted a keyboard mouse and keyboard please. I've posted the

1541
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:03,760
fucking audio link in the wrong okay whatever I just posted the link to the

1542
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:08,040
thing in the show notes so people have it okay but anyway moving on next voice

1543
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:12,280
mail we're wrong I think we got like three or four left Izumi and the vertical

1544
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:20,120
slice that's really funny oh okay solid snake one solid snake is calling in oh

1545
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:25,040
my god it's exciting let's let's get to it go.

1546
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:32,840
Colonel I've managed to sneak in to PCPHQ which was tough as it doesn't exist

1547
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:42,080
and likely never will but regardless I'm in and wait what's that on the floor is

1548
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:51,640
that my god it's the body of Andrew Yang oh no he's been force-fed heavy cream

1549
02:23:51,960 --> 02:24:00,300
oh man how could you he's covered in snake bites I was my god I was I was

1550
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:08,360
middle gear solid them twin snakes

1551
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:16,760
oh no I forgot to tell you about the fucking poison gas room sorry I know

1552
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:20,520
that's kind of important but I forgot you're now just dying a poisonous gas

1553
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:26,640
right now that my experience he was he was like he was dying of poison and he

1554
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:29,360
asked me he asked me to suck the poison out of his wounds but I thought that

1555
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:32,520
sounded a little gay so I just said no here drink this heavy cream instead

1556
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:40,280
it's good for what else you know the electrical floor room yeah sorry the

1557
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:44,400
room where people just shoot you automatically just entering I forgot I've

1558
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:48,040
got a guillotine if we decapitate you it'll be really easy to drain the poison

1559
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:51,480
out of you and then we can reattach the head afterward this is the only way to

1560
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:57,200
go there you go that's that's there you go yeah solid okay moving on thanks

1561
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:02,040
solid snake appreciate that okay here we go this is a this is a bit of a spooky

1562
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:08,040
one the biological clock on Nate's branding I saw this in the evening I

1563
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:12,440
was curious about what this let's let's hear what they have to say Ben is

1564
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:18,160
losing all his hair and Nate is Ben's brother yeah you know lead related but

1565
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:25,520
unlike Ben Nate's hair is a part of his brand it's on his avatar so Nate what

1566
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:31,640
are you gonna do if and when you lose your hair gonna wear a wig maybe implants

1567
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:36,440
or some shit you know your shit's in danger you're you're you have a

1568
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:41,240
biological clock on your avatar I'm what's your contingency plan here man all

1569
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:50,600
right I well hey regardless no wait hold on hold on listen I listen guys listen I

1570
02:25:50,600 --> 02:26:00,080
am you know what I'm fucking argue I'm not argue this I my I just have a huge

1571
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:04,560
forehead I just always have a huge forehead is it's the same what is a huge

1572
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:09,720
but the absence of hair to cover it listen yeah my hair my hair is seated

1573
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:13,560
when I was a baby my hairline my hairline just went way back up there and

1574
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:16,920
gave me a giant forehead and you know it's fine and I'm gonna have this you know

1575
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:20,880
and my hair my hair my forehead will be just as giant the day I fucking die

1576
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:28,000
your claim then at 80 at 89 years old of a fucking of a fucking eyeball popping

1577
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,880
out because I sneeze too relevant to me but but if you if your claim is simply

1578
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:36,560
that your hairline has not receded anytime recently then fair enough I'm

1579
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:40,080
sure you know people could probably I don't know the data could be compiled

1580
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:46,360
you know I I have I okay now I could be crazy I could be imagining it but I look

1581
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:50,000
at pictures of myself in like high school and I've got like a fucking giant

1582
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,560
forehead and like the same like it's it's like kind of yeah I've got the sort of

1583
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:58,760
it's not a widow's peak but like I know what you mean like it goes kind of like

1584
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:03,000
up on the sides like it sort of sticks out front yeah but it's I mean it's

1585
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:08,480
pretty much the same so I'm okay I'm going I'm going I'm going great really

1586
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:12,800
fast like at a rapidly accelerating pace but you know that's fine that's

1587
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:16,880
different it's all the heavy cream you know I thought about this a little bit

1588
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:21,920
because I mean my hair is tied to my brand a lot more than Nate's is to his

1589
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:26,440
I'm known as the long hair even if I just got a short haircut that would be

1590
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:32,600
like what's going on but you know like I'm I'm a man I'm probably gonna lose

1591
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:37,640
my hair and I think that the solution is to just rebrand and just be an old

1592
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:42,160
person because if red letter media has taught me anything is that it doesn't

1593
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:45,560
matter what you look like as long as you're funny and I am funny so I'll be

1594
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:49,840
you know you know I that is totally fair but you know what there there's a

1595
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:53,240
reality to be addressed of just just for example if you've got a really hot

1596
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:58,040
chick and she's like a host on a show or whatever if she begins to become not

1597
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:02,880
hot even if the other hosts are like straight-up ugly that will be very

1598
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:06,960
noticeable to the audience let's say she starts to get fat or just stops wearing

1599
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:10,920
makeup or anything like that people notice similarly I think I have kind of

1600
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:15,760
look earned or not I think I have something of a reputation of like of like

1601
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:20,960
the hot one and again I'm not saying that I deserve that I think that frankly

1602
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:26,120
workout it's it works you're the you're like the fit yes deservedly or not I'm

1603
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:30,520
working on it guys I swear I really am right now but don't look at me in real

1604
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:35,760
life but so yeah I mean like in the PCB demo like I'm huge and muscly and stuff

1605
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:40,120
which okay I do work out whatever I'm not gonna get to that the point is on like

1606
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:45,280
if I I'm somewhat associated with like looking relatively handsome and I think

1607
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:50,440
that like if my hair does start to go away I that will impact it so I thought

1608
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:54,400
about that one thing to do is to rebrand I don't really want to do that I

1609
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:58,600
could like I if I had no other option I could definitely do that and I've

1610
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:02,120
actually been thinking about this about how my avatar is tied to hair and some

1611
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:04,480
people have been roasting me on it whether it's appropriate or not how is

1612
02:29:04,480 --> 02:29:08,080
your avatar what do you mean how is your habits are tied well it just has hair

1613
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:12,720
it's all like if I went bald it would be weird to keep using an avatar that just

1614
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:19,240
had hair don't you think I I mean isn't it isn't it kind of lame to use the same

1615
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:22,760
avatar forever and ever and ever anyway I mean probably you'd want to switch it

1616
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:26,880
up eventually yeah you'd be like a wrestler going through I mean I mean

1617
02:29:26,880 --> 02:29:30,360
that's fair I'm mad because my hair is falling out fuck the world here's a

1618
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:33,560
video game you know that's true and as a YouTube you know you'll you know you know

1619
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:38,080
I'm this is a business opportunity for me because when you go bald that means

1620
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:40,800
you'll have to get me to draw you a new avid so that's fair that's just money in

1621
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:44,720
my pocket but you know what the thing is and maybe I made it do that but I've

1622
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:48,560
thought about this there have been stories I haven't verified this of how

1623
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:53,840
Elon Musk like seemed to be going bald when he was younger but right now he

1624
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:57,840
has a beautiful full head of hair I think the technology has advanced you

1625
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:02,280
got implants I mean implants or whatever it is I'm telling you right now I don't

1626
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:07,920
mind about everyone talks about baldness like they've never fucking even heard

1627
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:12,240
that implants exist like they exist they've existed people start to go bald

1628
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:16,160
and then they just get their fucking hair back it's not even complicated you go

1629
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:20,360
you pay like a thousand two thousand whatever dollars or whatever I mean I

1630
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:23,960
just put your hair back in I think it's pretty fucking expensive I'm probably

1631
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:28,360
expensive but I mean it exists it's weird that people act surprised like if

1632
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:31,320
you're gonna save up to buy a new car you know that's one that you do you'd save

1633
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:34,560
up you know buy hair implants if it's important I mean women do it with like

1634
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:38,480
you know breast implants I just as an example you know similar sort of thing

1635
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:43,320
and I think it's relatively similar to that and so I'll tell you people I I've

1636
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:46,880
considered it and I don't think like obviously I'm whatever I'm doing fine

1637
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:51,440
right now but like it's just there's such a weird thing of like it's it's like

1638
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:56,800
shameful to do it you know like it's like embarrassing like unfortunate but I

1639
02:30:56,800 --> 02:31:01,080
don't know well women where we that has to be destroyed we have to fuck that I

1640
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:07,920
think we should have an option when you're going bald it's it's like you're

1641
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:12,000
game overing on life and then the implants is like do you want to go to

1642
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:24,240
easy mode if I go bald before I'm 40 I'm starting a fucking go fund me for

1643
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:29,520
hair implants fuck I will not have you guys I don't have you guys seen you guys

1644
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:34,080
seen community you know Jeff from community main guy yeah Joel Mikhail

1645
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:39,560
the handsome one he's a you ever you ever seen him before his hair implants

images right now they are yeah right you oh my Jesus like and he's like us he's

like a leading man now he's like one of the he is like known for being handsome

1653
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:23,080
now you got a post I'm posting it in the links for right now look at this here's

1654
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:29,480
one yeah or like how about this one over here there's another one and like his

1655
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:32,800
hair's still back that's that's actually that's less dramatic than I that's less

1656
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:36,640
dramatic than I remember look at this next I mean I don't know he's he's still

1657
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:43,480
got a giant fucking for you know this guy this guy went from tool to cool in one

1658
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:48,400
simple step and the step was being rich so I mean that's fair you know what so

1659
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:51,800
I'm just gonna tell people right now I'm gonna I'm gonna make it man I'm gonna do

1660
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:56,520
whatever it takes and frankly I got aspirations to do things and be more

1661
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:00,600
widely known and if hair is gonna get in the way I will get implants in a

1662
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:04,560
fucking heartbeat if I know all packed right now we're all fucking

1663
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:10,000
sign it never go bald okay the only reason I won't sign that right now is

1664
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:14,000
cuz when I if I if I reach this moment I might want to go the Joe Rogan like

1665
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,880
ripped bald guy route and like see how that goes that's the only thing that I

1666
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:25,040
think I kind of like that's nothing wrong no I love two minds on the subject

1667
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:29,080
like cuz like I always like I always thought George Carlin looked cool when

1668
02:33:29,080 --> 02:33:32,440
he was like sort of balding and like like Jerome Flynn the guy who plays

1669
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:36,680
brawn on Game of Thrones yeah yeah he looks cool he so like I always thought

1670
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:40,680
that like if I'm in my 40s and it starts to go I'll just be cool like whatever

1671
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:46,280
exactly but like if I'm if I feel like it's happening too soon fuck that I'm

1672
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:50,320
getting it fixed yeah yeah I feel yeah I feel so we could at least make the pack

1673
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:57,000
of the no shame the no shame well here's the thing the moment I like go like

1674
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,360
start to be like embarrassing bold I will shave my head and then I will grow

1675
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:05,280
my beard oh yeah yeah good plan I know I can do that that's true okay if I

1676
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:10,480
decided to to make that demonic packed take that fousty bargain and switched

1677
02:34:10,480 --> 02:34:15,400
and switch on easy mode because the hair loss was just too too much to handle I

1678
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:20,400
might be tempted to over correct and bring it down like bring my hair line

1679
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:24,520
down like further than it ever was to begin with like like all the way down

1680
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:29,840
shows up looking like the old-timey wolf man like hoping no one notices

1681
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:34,080
anything's different like hey guys well we'll think about we'll think about this

1682
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:39,520
remember okay remember Harry Potter right any anyone anyone else remember

1683
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:43,440
Harry I don't know which time like remember when Hermione got her like

1684
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:47,200
teeth knocked out or something and then no no she got shrunk she got them shrunk

1685
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,280
she got her teeth cursed and her teeth became right and she went to like

1686
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:54,800
Madame Hootcher whatever the nurse's name was and she had them shrink her

1687
02:34:54,800 --> 02:34:58,360
teeth and she just let me sort of like make them a little make make them a

1688
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:01,840
little smaller than they started where I'm gonna go I'm gonna be like hey bring

1689
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:06,200
my hair line down here and then just keep just keep going and then it'll just

1690
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:09,640
come all the way down to my it'll just blend right into my way you know what

1691
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:14,920
though Ben this is why the reasons like this are exactly why I want to have money

1692
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:19,480
like a bunch of money so I can make these kind of fixes in my life if and

1693
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:23,520
when necessary that's freedom baby sure freedom yeah that's what money's for

1694
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:27,400
yeah to fix the things that go wrong yeah that's what I think sure I think yeah

1695
02:35:27,400 --> 02:35:32,200
totally now I agree okay so I guess let's move on are we done got another

1696
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:37,800
I don't have to think about this for at least you got ten years for sure unless

1697
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:41,560
something happens some people are unlucky but that I don't know man okay

1703
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:14,600

1704
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:18,080

1713
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:03,800

1714
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:06,680
that was that was definitely Robin I think we're setting up for a big change

1715
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:13,480
in the paradigm and I don't know I'm I'm ready for a narrative it's not like

1716
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:18,640
the riddler has Batman and Batman has to answer nine riddles and then he's

1717
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:23,160
released every single time he's released again and then assuming he is just

1718
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:28,320
captured again releasing the PCP he's releasing the members of the PCP

1719
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:33,200
