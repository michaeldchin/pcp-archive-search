1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm sorry darling, I'm listening to the PCP right now, it's so addicting.

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,000
Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,640
Uh, soon, in like a couple days, hey, it's the PCP. We're here to, you know, say some

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,000
things about the various events. Uh, I'm Hippocrit, and with us we have Digibro.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yo, yo, I'm a GameCube, trying to spread holiday cheer through some holiday fear.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Not gonna question how that works. And we have Nate with us.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Um, yeah. Best Nate ever.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's, uh, it's just one of those ones, you know, just one of those fucking ones.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And least, we have Tom.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have nothing to say because I'm so small and insignificant, except play my fucking game

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
that I made with my own blood, sweat, and tears, follow development, it's great.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Uh, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a GameCube launch title for sure, confirmed, check it out.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Dude, let's, let's talk about that just a little bit because, uh, recently I noticed

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that four of the PCP, myself, Davoo, Tom, and, uh, well, Ben and Munchy together have

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
like technically made video games this year, uh, and I made a Twitter poll and it was cool.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was just like, yeah, Game of the Year, but for us, we're all game devs now.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We do cool stuff.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So who won the poll?

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think it was Endless War.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Endless War did win the poll.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I gotta admit, I voted, I voted for Autonomous.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Autonomous was really nice.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Autonomous was fucking sick and was a game I would actually love to play.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Whereas Endless War is mean and they bully me and it's hard, so I, so I gotta say,

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I haven't, I haven't found time to play Autonomous yet, but I did watch a little bit

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
of Ben's stream of it and I couldn't keep watching it because when I read the text,

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I could hear Davoo's voice saying every single line in my head

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and the way Ben was reading it was not satisfactory enough of a representation of that for me.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I was like, I can't listen to Ben read this.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I have to go read this myself.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Fair enough.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Davoo needs to do a let's read of his own game.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't even need it.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can literally hear him saying it.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like every line is something he would say in a way he would say it.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So it's, it's somebody who lived with them for a while.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's like trippy to play this fucking game.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So I guess go play it if you want to like have the experience of Davoo's voice in your mind.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Great.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a great, it's a super fun game and it's just, it's so chill and like relaxing kind of

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
because there's not a lot that goes on it.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's just like walking around an environment and examining things,

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
but like it's such, it's such a very common interaction in games given center stage

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and it's like really refreshing and it's got good sense of humor

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and the art style is nice and clean and it's great.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I love it.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And it's a common interaction in games given center stage.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is that like the descriptor?

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's just what he said and I thought it was really nice.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Shit.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So Davoo's, Davoo's off doing bug fixes, which has been keeping him busy for a while now,

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but God damn it.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I like, this is funny.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Like I want Davoo to, to take a pause from doing things that actually matter,

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
making a real game, to come on this worthless meme podcast,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to talk with me so I can get a piece of the glory that he's produced

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
by telling him how much I fucking loved that game

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and so I can hear his sick developer commentary.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That game was awesome.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We gotta suck his dick hard.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't say, I don't think it's going to be easy to get a hold of such a busy game designer.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
A pro.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He, he was, he did, I, he's editing my video and I didn't hear from him for about 13 days

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
into the month.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is what happens.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is what happens.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, I'm working on the video, by the way.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We're all procrastinators right now, but Davoo has finally hit level 16 and has evolved

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
into a professional.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There it is.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He doesn't have time for this anymore.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was going to say that.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is that when we become next to the professionals?

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's when the podcast ends.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
When we're finally doing real shit, we'll be the professionals.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then we get to make up our own definition of what a professional is.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's, yeah.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's true.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Shit.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Speaking of something about game developer reminded me, you guys hear about fucking today,

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the super best friends deleted.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's gone.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They are ending their show.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They made a video saying, yeah, this is the finale of super best friends and the three

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
people.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Because they're not friends anymore.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
At least one of them.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
At least.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The woolly guy and Matt Pat and Pat Matt said, you know what?

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm done.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And they were all like in different rooms.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So yeah.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I never really watched them, but they've been around for a long time.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They're an institution, man.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm kind of surprised they were still around.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Because I feel like you can't keep, most two guys doing a let's play kind of shows, you

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
know, eventually someone gets fucking tired of it or moves on.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They were doing it for a long fucking time.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Nine years.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Apparently the channel was around.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
God damn.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It was that long.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's, I mean, I was, this is not, like, I'm not trying to be snot or anything.

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was never like a fan or dedicatedly watched their content.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But just like going to V today and seeing all the threads about people being sad.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And like then the Janney, lol, Janney cleaning up my threads.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Clean it up, Janney, you get paid nothing.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sorry, my inner Janney rage just came out for a second there.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And like just people being sad about it ending and then like mods deleting the threads and

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
then people making new threads saying janitors are literally cleaning up the most relevant

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
games news today, which is the end of the super best friends podcast and let's play

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
show.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And I don't know, it's just interesting.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's a good point from those guys.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And I got to say, and this is 100% out of my own personal bitterness and resentment.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That they can't talk about me on a because they talk about extremely anti-e celebrity.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Like even more than V even more than more than anything.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Like I get talked about way more on V or on.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I get talked about most on V because of the fact that they can't talk about me on a because

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
it will get deleted immediately.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Like even if a thread, the longest threads that have ever existed about me about on a

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
are ones that became about me.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And usually the highest risk for that is in the three by three threads because my three

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
by threes get posted as a meme in there.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Literally every thread.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know who does it, but someone is very dedicated.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So like I see that, but like nowadays it doesn't.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Barney fag is still put.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Are you familiar with the legend of Barney fag?

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
To this day.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Just whenever in any way there is actually he's actually tapered off a little bit, but

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
for years, for years and years and years, every single time that someone would post

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
an image like a like you'd post like ponies.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He would say kill yourself Barney fag and post a little screen, a little screencap that

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
what it shows the airing dates of like my little pony airs that immediately afterward

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
like is Barney on like the Disney Channel or something or I might be flipped.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But like the point was like this is you.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Like this is who you are.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Fan of MLP.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But the thing was this got to such an incredible degree, such an incredible heights where any

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
like you'd see like human like a sunset glimmer, whatever the fuck her name was.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And like, okay, sure, she's kind of pony-esque.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So he would reply to that and be like, ah, kill yourself Barney fag.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, that one's a little bit easier.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Even though it's not literally a pony, then it would be like obscure fan art that kind

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
like his interpretations of characters.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He would still be there.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Kill yourself Barney Barney fag every single time he would know.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And then it would be it got to such a level where the absolutely like tiny little cropped

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
portions of vaguely my little pony relevant content still immediately Barney fag would

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
be there knowing exactly what it was and would be able to pinpoint how this was MLP related.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So really, he's clearly like the biggest MLP fag that there ever was, but he just he

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
chooses to use his powers to, you know, punish those.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Isn't it more likely that every my little pony fan on that website has the copypasta

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and do it on site.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, no, don't ruin the mythos for me, man.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was getting infested in this narrative and you've ruined it for me with it cold.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, I choose to believe he's one.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Even though it would be impressive if people could tell that quickly, you know, like it

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
tells you how many bronies are still around on these fucking sites.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's true.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And the sad thing is that like these days, you'll see a thread where like someone will

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
post, you know, one of these like crops and people know and they're like, wait for it,

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
wait for it.

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But but Barney fag never shows up and everyone's like, where's Barney fag?

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We've been waiting like this thread's gone to like 500.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That means it has to be one person.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If it was a bunch of people, somebody would have hopped on the bandwagon, but it had to

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
be one guy, one star hero.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Maybe people only do it if they can get it first.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Like if they don't get it in time for somebody else to respond, they're just like, well, it's

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
not.

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There's no credit.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's like in the Dark Knight Rises where Batman is like retired and everyone just waiting

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
for him to come back, but he hasn't yet.

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We're all waiting for Barney to make his triumphant return.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We need we need Catwoman to come in and steal his shit and kick him off his cane and get

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
back into shape.

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's going to happen.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Exactly like that.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And there's also the hero, Final Fantasy XV Koon, who is the biggest child like defense

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
force for any criticism of Final Fantasy XV.

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's such a degree where he's like a mythological creature where any defense of Final Fantasy

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
XV will be attributed to a post by Final Fantasy XV Koon.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know.

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's there's a lot of great characters.

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
God, great lore.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I should make videos about these honestly.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
These are fascinating.

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, the only problem with that is that they would shit on you for being a trip fag, basically.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You'd have to do it on a channel that had no identifiers at all.

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, I don't mean I'd like go fucking post like that.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You know that guy Wang, you know, that guy Wang who's been rising up in YouTube recently,

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
like posts.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, he makes videos about like internet lore, basically.

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And it's like, I don't know.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I kind of similar to what fit MC does, I guess, where he like only fits focus is more narrow,

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
but like every YouTuber, like hundreds of thousands of thousands of YouTubers.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This guy specifically, his show is called Tales from the Internet.

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Tales gets trolled.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You know what?

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Let's move on.

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's move on.

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They get the idea.

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Digi, I've been rewatching Digi Bros. Let's Plays.

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh my God.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I've been rewatching from the beginning.

220
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Sonic Adventure 2 is legitimately really, really good, especially at the end of the hero play through.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I remember having always thought that they got better as they went,

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
but they do become more podcasty as they go.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They get like the Sonic Adventure 2 starts off pretty funny and it gets funnier around the middle

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and it sort of mellows out, but then it gets really funny by the end.

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's a good Let's Play and it just reminds me of that time when, you know,

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Game Grumps Dan was new and they were doing Wind Waker and it's like, whoa, nice.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is Game Grumps-esque content that I can return to,

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
that I haven't rewatched a million times already.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I mean, that's kind of the reason.

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's really funny.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm like ass out on Let's Plays lately.

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I used to watch so much of them and I realized how important they are to me

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
because I can just eat and have something to watch that is, you know,

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
just barely not mind-numbing enough to keep my attention for 40 minutes or so.

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So like, right now, Vic and Hope have finally returned to start making Let's Plays again

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and they're like slightly too boring because Victor plays fucking Breath of the Wild

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and it's really not fun to watch.

238
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I heard you talking about that, but sometimes they come in hot with their hot takes.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Sometimes they come in hot with some hot takes on the PCV, which is fine.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Did you hear all of those? Did you hear their hot take and my response?

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The first thing I heard about it was your response to it,

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
but it sounds like Vic was getting pretty peeved at us for a while.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It was pretty funny. I listened to it.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You were deeply accused of like, why are you making Dozlocks and not doing We Agua?

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You got roasted pretty hard.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What? I made my fucking Smash meme videos. Those were big. Come on.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I thought that those were a better idea than me and Maff of a person.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But you know what? I'll give them the credit.

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I do need to be doing We Agua, so I'm totally with them on that.

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Fair criticism. Fair criticism.

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Anyway, I'm going to fight you one-on-one, Vic. I'm coming to your house.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I felt like a dearth of Let's Plays and it's funny because there was a time

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
where there were so many of them that they were competing for your attention

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and it was like, when I first started mine, a lot of the people who initially were watching it,

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
as we kicked up the production cycle, there were a lot of people who were like,

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I already watched Game Grumps. I don't have time for this on top of that, you know?

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And then I think as a lot of people lost interest in Game Grumps,

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
like me, they turned to like, Monkey's Gaming Expedition.

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Back when that was super at peace.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And then like, that stopped being entertaining.

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So it's like, well, where do I go from here?

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then now there's like, there's nobody really doing those Let's Plays anymore

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
because nobody got big doing it.

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Like, no matter how good your Let's Plays are, nobody is going to be the next Game Grumps

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
because just frankly, there's just not enough time in any viewer's day

267
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to watch like 100 Let's Players.

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And I used to know a lot of people who would say like,

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
oh, I've got like 200 subs, but most of it's Let's Plays I don't watch, you know?

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Like, as in some people they are subscribed to.

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So yeah, like, I think that Let's Plays have just quietly been dying

272
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
because of the fact that nobody's...

273
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Market saturation?

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, market saturation, which was already going on.

275
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And we all knew that.

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But like, I think everybody hoped that if they just did it long enough

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
at a certain level of quality, more people would pay attention.

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And it's like, usually they hit a certain number of your fans

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
who will watch you play a video game and they stop there.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You know, nobody knew comes in.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's like, how many people who watch Digibro After Dark

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
are going to watch me play...

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You know, are going to watch me commentate over Pokemon Colosseum

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
while Mei plays it.

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Exactly 2.2 thousand.

286
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That is the view count on every video, you know?

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So it's like, because nobody's blown up through it,

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
it's just like, well, I like doing it,

289
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
but it takes time out of my day.

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And eventually everyone becomes way slower at it.

291
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And then I'm sitting here eating my food and being like, wait a minute,

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I needed those Let's Plays.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I needed there to be like 40 minutes out of every day

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
that I could spend watching really mindless content

295
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and I don't want to watch another Needledrop review.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Because I don't give a shit about most of these ads.

297
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Everybody also, there's like, streaming can get you big

298
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and it's also a lot easier.

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And donations are like instant advice,

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
so it's like more monetarily good.

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So everybody kind of just realized that that's better as like a creator.

302
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But it's not the same sort of thing.

303
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You can actually put on an episode of Part of a Stream.

304
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's true. You can watch the back stuff.

305
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I mean, you don't want to sit there for like three hours and be like,

306
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
okay, well, I'll pause it and come back tomorrow.

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't know.

308
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I mean, on the creative side, a Let's Play is difficult

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
because you have to constantly find things to talk about

310
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
or else you get boring.

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And like, Back When Me and Victor did Digi Bros.

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
for the longest time, it was like, we just had an endless wellspring

313
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
of anything we could possibly think of to talk about.

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
At some point, we started running low, so we started asking the audience for questions.

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So then we're doing like Q&A and we're giving extremely long answers to questions

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
just to fill up as much time as possible.

317
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, you run out of questions and then it's like,

318
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
well, I guess we got to like do things now and have experiences

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to have new things to talk about.

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And when it came to that point, it's like, we can't do this show twice daily anymore.

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It became like, well, we're going to make it, you know,

322
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
we have to record less often so that we have more to say.

323
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And now like when me and May do our Let's Plays,

324
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
it's basically just like when we have a topic,

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
when we're like, oh man, I have something I want to talk about on a Let's Play,

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
then we sit down and record a Let's Play as opposed to, you know,

327
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
being forced to come up with new ideas every day,

328
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
which I think if that was all you did with your career would be one thing.

329
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But like, I think that as soon as you try to do something else at the same time,

330
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
like obviously the quality of the Let's Play is going to diminish.

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's like, you're not going to have time to sit around

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and think of the best possible topics to talk about on your Let's Play show

333
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
if you're doing a main show, you know, on top of your Let's Play.

334
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm sure that's true.

335
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Consistency is the death of me and I'm dead.

336
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh, Victor put out my apology to the PCP episode.

337
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Did he really?

338
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, God.

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I have to apologize, Victor.

340
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's fine.

341
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll have to listen to that.

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That'll be funny though.

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I mean, if you haven't heard his episode, Nate, you...

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I have not.

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because you might...

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Is he actually mean?

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Is he actually bullies me?

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He's pretty fucking harsh.

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Like, on every...

350
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Victor, why?

351
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No, but it's...

352
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He's harsh, but like, it's always about Victor,

353
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
the way that he's like, you can hear how much he's smiling at all times.

354
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So he doesn't really...

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

356
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
He doesn't really like have like a vileness to it,

357
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
but it's like, he gets real.

358
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He lays all the cards on the table.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You know what?

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He literally says like, I'm calling you out, guys.

361
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

362
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You guys don't do anything.

363
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I bet there's a lot of truth in what he says.

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I bet there's a lot of truth.

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There's a lot of truth in it,

366
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
but he also just like misinterprets a lot of things

367
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
about like what everyone is up to, you know?

368
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Man, I make no defense for myself.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I mean, if people think that I'm wasting my time

370
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and focusing on bullshit, I want to know that

371
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
so I can fucking, you know, get back to shit.

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, yeah.

373
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I mean, there's one thing to like agree with, you know,

374
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the way you come across is your fault at some point.

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There's also like, you know when you're doing something

376
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and if people don't, you know, believe that you are

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and you tell them or like, you know,

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
you don't have to keep like a 24 hour,

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
like I'm doing exactly this.

380
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm working exactly this much guys to keep them informed.

381
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Like people are going to think things

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
that are kind of incorrect.

383
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah.

384
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll tell you though, because I, Victor responded

385
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
in a comment to my response video

386
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and he said of Nate's trajectory that he was like,

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
he said, I do watch everything.

388
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He was like, I watch everything everyone in the PCP does.

389
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I watch all of Tom's dev logs even,

390
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
which I was like, Jesus Christ,

391
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
you must have more time than I fucking realized.

392
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm so sorry.

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But like, he said that he thinks

394
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that Viagra is more like the type of content

395
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that like endears people to a creator,

396
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
whereas to smash videos are going to be bringing in

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
a crowd who doesn't really know about you on a personal level.

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But like, I don't think that's totally true.

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't think your videos are that impersonal though.

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like the smash videos are such a distinctive editing style

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
that like, if you see that thumbnail

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and it looks like the thumbnail you saw last time,

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
you know what you're going to get.

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And actually people have started to emulate.

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There's been several like copycat videos

406
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
that people have made clearly.

407
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, whatever, Tom, what were you saying?

408
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think what Victor's trying to say,

409
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and I totally agree with, is that like

410
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Viagra is like about Nate and Nate's on camera.

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Like you build that personal relationship with the person

412
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and that's going to get you to subscribe more than like,

413
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I like smash, here's a smash video.

414
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The smash videos are going to get views.

415
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The Viagra's are going to get subscribers.

416
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I mean, with every smash video,

417
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
because they're like music videos inherently,

418
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I make no money from them.

419
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You know, except for what like patrons give me and stuff obviously.

420
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So like, okay, so they get a lot of views.

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Does that translate to success, to like earnings and like a stable,

422
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
you know, like are they paying for themselves,

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
especially considering how long they take to make.

424
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Doesn't really seem like they are.

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So I basically just did it because I fucking wanted to

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and I did and they're great and I'll probably do more.

427
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But I mean, yeah, these are all relevant questions to think about.

428
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So I get it. It seems reasonable to me.

429
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I just feel like with Viagra,

430
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
it's so dependent on the independent,

431
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the individual subject matter to carry,

432
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
whether this video is going to get views or not.

433
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's like Viagra is not going to get over 100,000 views ever

434
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
if it's not talking about something that could get that amount, you know?

435
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's definitely true.

436
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Unless you were a much bigger YouTuber.

437
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But you know, on the other hand, it's also, it's good for me

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
to have Viagra to force me to keep making stuff.

439
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So I, you know, like an object in motion stays in motion.

440
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Just to have that momentum, I think is a very good thing,

441
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
which is why I wanted that.

442
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And I'm sorry everybody to keep you waiting for the next one.

443
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It is in the editing bay, should be out soon.

444
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But you know, it's, it's one of my other favorite things to watch

445
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
while I eat a fucking sandwich.

446
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Hooray! By the time you're hearing this, it should be out.

447
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Thanks.

448
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hooray for you people.

449
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll be sure to send you an angry tweet if it's not the case.

450
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Sounds good.

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

452
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Speaking of growing a channel,

453
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Monkey's channel's all got destroyed.

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No, they're gone.

455
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Let's talk about that shit.

456
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Jesus Christ.

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So, so in case people aren't aware, which you probably are,

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
our boy, Monkey Jones, had his two main channels deleted

459
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
for a whole bunch of copyright strike reasons.

460
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And then when he tried to set up his backup jokes.

461
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, I think they were community guidelines strikes,

462
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
but I can't, maybe I'm wrong.

463
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I think you're right.

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah.

465
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
They was like content they don't want, that kind of stuff.

466
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah.

467
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Hate speech, I think it was.

468
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Like Elliot Roger is like now a dirty word.

469
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You can't say it.

470
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Basically, yeah.

471
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then when he tried to make his gaming expedition channel

472
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
that hosted all his precious, precious Nuzlocs

473
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
into his main channel,

474
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
like the whole channel just got taken down.

475
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't know exactly how, like what the strikes were on that.

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah, he seems to have been blacklisted.

477
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Apparently he was removed from Hornhub as well.

478
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He was removed from, are you serious?

479
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What the fuck?

480
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He was removed from Hornhub.

481
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I heard that.

482
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Are you really?

483
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What?

484
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
How is that even possible?

485
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's a fucking, that's a, wow.

486
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I am shocked if that's true.

487
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I got to go check this channel right now.

488
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I mean, all right.

489
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Maybe that's because one of his patron tears, I think,

490
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
was like, if he gets this much per month,

491
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
he'll put all of his Elliot Roger videos on Hornhub.

492
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah.

493
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's like a funny joke.

494
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Maybe that potentially,

495
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Hornhub was like, this isn't porn,

496
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and they got rid of him for that reason.

497
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But I just can't, I can't imagine Hornhub

498
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
being like in league with, you know,

499
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
people who blacklist things.

500
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He said on Twitter,

501
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Hornhub deleted two of my Elliot Roger videos last night.

502
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So, yeah, I guess they just deleted it

503
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
for being the Elliot Roger videos.

504
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Probably, yeah.

505
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I mean, where in this wide world

506
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
can you go to watch a dark comedy video?

507
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I just want to put it out there, people.

508
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We've had our differences.

509
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I 100% stand with Monkey on this issue.

510
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There is no debate that this is fucked up.

511
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
No, I don't know if I do,

512
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
because I think this is the least surprising event

513
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
in YouTube history.

514
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Monkey's channel's already been deleted

515
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
like three times before.

516
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Like, obviously, the type of content he's making,

517
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I mean, it is in breach of YouTube's guidelines.

518
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Like, it's not as though this is like...

519
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's questionable.

520
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
How so?

521
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Make your case.

522
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm curious to hear it.

523
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Well, first of all, he's shown,

524
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I mean, the videos that got him taken down

525
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the first couple of times

526
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
was because he showed, like,

527
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
explicit sexual content from Boku No Pico.

528
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, right, right, yeah.

529
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
This time, he's got videos that are, like,

530
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
essentially encouraging suicide,

531
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and like, well, hang on, hang on.

532
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I don't know if that's true.

533
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You know, I heard YouTube say in one of their tweets,

534
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
the team YouTube, whatever,

535
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
they said that, like, they don't allow content

536
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that glorifies or encourages violence.

537
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And, like, okay, I've always thought that

538
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I understand the case that making, like,

539
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
basically comedy parody videos about Elliot Rogers,

540
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I understand the case that that is glorifying it

541
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
in the sense that it's, like, spreading notoriety,

542
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
kind of, it's making it into a thing.

543
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Maybe this is just me being an idiot,

544
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
but, like, wouldn't the entirety of YouTube gaming

545
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
be glorifying violence in that case?

546
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Like, if you're just playing Call of Duty,

547
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and it's just, like, fucking murder simulator

548
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
all day, every day.

549
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Sure, you can make that argument.

550
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's just, YouTube's terms are always so fucking vague,

551
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and it's just, it's totally arbitrary

552
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
when they decide to pull in what they don't.

553
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Okay, well, Digi, you're right.

554
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I agree with you, Digi.

555
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
There's definitely a case to be made

556
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
that this violates content policy.

557
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
My response to that is only,

558
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't believe that that is a good policy.

559
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I agree with that, but, like, that is...

560
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's just that we've been on YouTube this whole time

561
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
under the assumption we were working under this policy.

562
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Like, I don't...

563
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
There's a lot of shit that I don't put into my videos

564
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
because I'm afraid of getting kicked off of YouTube,

565
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
you know?

566
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Like, I don't throw in jokes and stuff that I think of

567
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
that I would like to be in there,

568
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
but I think, oh, this will get me kicked off of YouTube

569
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
or this will get this video blocked,

570
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
because I've had my channel taken down several times,

571
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
including for community guidelines reasons, you know?

572
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I lost my Ask Princess Malestia video back in 2014.

573
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That was more innocent than anything monkey's ever done, you know?

574
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

575
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So, like, to me, it's just like, I'm...

576
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Like, I...

577
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah, it sucks that he lost his channel,

578
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
but, like, this is the least surprising event in history,

579
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and he's made, like, he's, like,

580
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
tripled his Patreon earnings as a result of this.

581
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Right, yeah.

582
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So all he has to do is switch this shit on Google Drive

583
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and he'll be fucking fine.

584
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Well, that's the plan as far as I know.

585
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Or if not Drive the fucking bitchude.

586
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That they were...

587
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He was making his own website.

588
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Like, that's gonna be the new place.

589
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well, guys, I mean, we all know this is a terrible punishment.

590
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Like, the question of discovery alone,

591
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
like, monkey was growing quite rapidly on YouTube,

592
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and to cut off his future like this,

593
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I mean, that's the real punishment.

594
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah.

595
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Even if in the short term, he's gained...

596
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, I mean, it definitely sucks.

597
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's one of those things.

598
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
The short term is gonna be fine,

599
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
because Patreon explodes, but, like...

600
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
For now.

601
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
For now.

602
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, it's...

603
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I mean, Monkey seems like somebody that the new clean Patreon would not want, right?

604
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Guys, let's also be real about something for a second here, though,

605
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
because on the one hand, yes, it's a huge loss to lose your YouTube channel,

606
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
because the YouTube is easy growth,

607
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
which is why we all use it.

608
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's a platform that when you know how to turn the wheels on it,

609
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
you can grow pretty easily.

610
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
However, we are also living in an internet age

611
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
where it's even more interconnected.

612
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Most people are in communities.

613
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
They're in discords.

614
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
They're on Reddit.

615
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They're all over the place.

616
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And, like, Monkey's heavily connected with the Dick Show.

617
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The Dick Show is the ones who are putting up his website.

618
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Like, Dick and his girlfriend, I guess,

619
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
are helping him to get his website launched.

620
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Dick is a guy who...

621
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
His YouTube presence is basically non-existent.

622
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He is just famous for having a podcast that has its own website.

623
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He got all his fans back through Twitter, you know,

624
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and now he's like the biggest Patreon,

625
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
one of the biggest Patreons out there.

626
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Monkey's Patreon just triplicated.

627
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
He is gonna have his own website.

628
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Anybody who's willing to go over there to watch him, you know.

629
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And the only reason that this wouldn't work out for him

630
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
is if his content couldn't stand up to that medium,

631
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
if people were not willing to go seek it out.

632
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I didn't really, like, bring this up just because, like,

633
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
he will be all right.

634
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's more like the idea of it is very unsettling

635
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
because, you know, the line is constantly shifting

636
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
a little bit towards, you know, banning things.

637
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
More censorship and shit, yeah.

638
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Banning channels, like, in a blink of an eye,

639
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
like, whereas before you would have gotten a strike.

640
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm way more worried about how Sargon lost his Patreon

641
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
than I am about serving.

642
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Like, Monkey losing his channel?

643
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Not a surprise because it's been, again,

644
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
it's been taken out from community guidelines before.

645
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Like, I'm not shocked to hear, I'm not like,

646
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
oh, wow, censorship's gone even worse

647
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
when I hear that Monkey gets deleted.

648
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
When I hear that Sargon got removed from Patreon

649
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
for saying nigger on someone else's podcast,

650
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm like, uh-oh, I've done that before.

651
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You did that just now.

652
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Granted, he did it in a way that they deemed to be,

653
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
like, racially insensitive.

654
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But I mean, even a lot of people have argued

655
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
that in the context it might not have been.

656
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It was definitely dumb the way he fucking phrased it

657
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
one way or another.

658
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, okay, just so that you aren't misinterpreted,

659
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
did you here?

660
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So it isn't thought that you are unsympathetic here.

661
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You can separate the two issues.

662
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
On the one hand, there have been objective setbacks

663
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
in the real world.

664
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Will Monkey be able to make up and, you know,

665
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
survive and grow from here?

666
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Hopefully, probably, I don't know.

667
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I gotta hope so.

668
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But on the other hand, there's just the fact

669
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
that no one wants him to have had

670
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
to have dealt with this shit.

671
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Even if just for the fact that things are getting closer

672
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and closer to the fact where I'm gonna face

673
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
some fucking issues like this.

674
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I just want that line to stay way away from me.

675
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just protect every fucking buddy

676
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
who's even, like, a bit closer to being an edgy boy.

677
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So on the one hand, will Monkey survive?

678
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Hopefully.

679
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Hopefully.

680
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But maybe not.

681
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Maybe not.

682
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But on the other hand, just a separate issue.

683
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I don't like that this was done.

684
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I know it's within their terms of service,

685
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
but I don't like the terms of service.

686
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I guess what I mean to say, the reason I keep saying

687
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that I'm not surprised is that I've already been

688
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
under the mindset that this is what YouTube does

689
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
this whole time.

690
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
This is what they do.

691
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
They just kill people.

692
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
This isn't surprising.

693
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's just disappointing.

694
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And it's like, I've spent this whole time hoping

695
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
we can find a way to get off YouTube.

696
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And the way I've seen it is that the only way

697
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
it's going to happen is when they finally ban

698
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
enough high-profile people that those people

699
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
can't rely on YouTube anymore.

700
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Because the only reason any of us are here

701
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
is that we rely on the platform.

702
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
No one likes the platform, but we need it.

703
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's the easiest way to make money

704
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and it's the easiest way to have growth.

705
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But any of us could survive without the platform

706
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
as long as we worked really hard

707
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and played our cards right.

708
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And just created something that exists on its own

709
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
that doesn't rely on YouTube.

710
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I mean, I would hope so.

711
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But honestly, the biggest feature YouTube has

712
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is the discovery and the way that that's where everybody is.

713
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And without that, I mean, I don't know

714
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
that we could recover an audience if we lost it.

715
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I think we could.

716
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I don't know how.

717
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't think it's as hard as people think.

718
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think that, I mean, first of all,

719
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
a lot of people have heard of us already.

720
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So it's like, it's not difficult to introduce

721
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
the idea of yourself back into the world

722
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
as long as you are a part of a lot of communities

723
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and you are somebody who gets the word out

724
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
about what happened and where you can be found now.

725
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But, dude, that's the thing, though.

726
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Like, fucking, like, Monkeys had his Twitter deleted

727
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
a bunch and like, sure, okay,

728
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Twitter has the right to delete accounts they don't want.

729
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay, I get it.

730
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And he's made like a bunch of Twitters

731
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and he's got one that's technically alive right now.

732
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I guess I won't say it,

733
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
just so they can't fucking track it down.

734
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But, like, they're really squeezed in that guy.

735
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
They're really trying to, like, erase him.

736
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And I know these are technically independent things,

737
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
but you can just see the machinery at work

738
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
just saying this person makes content

739
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
that's unacceptable for the new world

740
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
that we're trying to make here.

741
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I know that, because the thing is that, like,

742
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
the reason I say it's, I think it's always been this way.

743
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It's like, this is exactly what happened to Dick Masterson.

744
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Like, he was kicked off of, like,

745
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
dozens of hosting sites for men are better than women.

746
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
He was constantly sent angry letters.

747
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
He was, like, demonized on the internet.

748
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He was banned from YouTube, like, early into YouTube,

749
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
not just his channel ban.

750
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
He himself, as a human being,

751
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
was blacklisted from posting to YouTube.

752
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And it's just kind of like a,

753
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
it's just been long enough that I guess

754
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
they don't care enough to find out

755
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
he has a channel on there now for his show.

756
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But, like, that's why when they did

757
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
the biggest problem in the Universal Live show,

758
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
he went under his real name,

759
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
because Dick Masterson was technically banned

760
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and Maddox gave a shit about that, for some reason.

761
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But, yeah, like, so, you know,

762
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
it can happen even with a more innocent satire,

763
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
even a more obvious satire than what Mumki is doing

764
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
on a scale that even exceeds

765
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
not only was he blacklisted from YouTube,

766
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
but also from, like, tons of, of, you know,

767
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
what's the fucking servers and shit.

768
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So, like, you know, I know this can happen to people

769
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and it always has been happening to people

770
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and the way you get around it

771
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
is by not relying on those platforms.

772
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's like, if you are, if you are good enough,

773
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
you should be good enough to survive

774
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
without needing the platform to promote you.

775
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You know, it shouldn't be that you are entirely

776
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
relying on that for people to care about you,

777
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
because that means that whatever you're doing

778
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
is not good enough.

779
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And, like, I think Mumki'll be fine in this regard,

780
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
because, like, when you look at people who are,

781
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
who are really, who would really be in danger from that,

782
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
it's the people whose patreons don't succeed.

783
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Like, someone like Dame Drops, the YouTube food reviewer,

784
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
who had, like, he put out, like, four videos a week.

785
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
He got decent views.

786
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
He had the, oh, my damn song made about him

787
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and that blew him up initially.

788
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And, like, even though he got pretty good views,

789
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
when he tried to open a Patreon, it made nothing.

790
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Because, like, his content was just kind of vapid.

791
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Like, it wasn't, it didn't, it was just, like,

792
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
hey, I want to watch a guy review fast food for three minutes

793
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
a couple times a week, because why not?

794
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Nobody was, like, invested, you know?

795
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And it's, like, it's a lot different for someone like Mumki Jones,

796
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
who has this overarching narrative,

797
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
who has all this drama and baggage,

798
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
who communicates with his fans a lot, you know?

799
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Like, I'm sure that Twitter or no Twitter,

800
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
he's got a Discord somewhere that's probably got

801
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
a few hundred people in it, you know?

802
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like, even if I lost my, if I lost all my social media platforms,

803
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I at least have my Discord,

804
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
which has, like, 400 people in it, you know?

805
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So, like...

806
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Until Discord decides that you're too toxic for there

807
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and Twitter decides you're too toxic.

808
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I guess we can cross that bridge when we come to it.

809
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah.

810
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yeah.

811
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's easy to learn fear of, like,

812
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
oh, oh, I can't say words anymore.

813
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Because it's not entirely true,

814
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
but it is becoming truer in certain places.

815
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
We're gonna get back to a podcast to me,

816
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and Digi did, like, fucking two years ago

817
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
about RSS and email,

818
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
about how, like, at least those things were, like,

819
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
hardcore in your control, and they couldn't take it away from you.

820
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Guys, I've found an even better way.

821
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Um, because just last month...

822
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Is it Web 3.0?

823
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
No, even better than that.

824
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Just last month, and now again this month,

825
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
the highest tier of my Patreon is a $40 care package,

826
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
where I mail people a USB stick full of exclusive content.

827
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I like that. I like that.

828
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So what I've been doing is I've been doing, like,

829
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
just full commentaries over movies,

830
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and, like, just, like, having background music playing

831
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
in my vlogs, and just, like,

832
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
because they can't copyright strike me.

833
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's on fucking USB stick.

834
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Hang on.

835
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I have a question about that.

836
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I thought about this myself a little bit.

837
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Is it not theoretically possible that, like,

838
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
so the whole, it's not like that YouTube just, like,

839
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
came up with copyright shit out of nowhere.

840
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That's fucking copyright claims, stuff out of nowhere.

841
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's specifically that they're trying to avoid copyright infringement,

842
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
which is a legal thing.

843
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
If you're actually selling content, you know,

844
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
in this way via Patreon, that uses copyrighted material,

845
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
you are still in violation of that.

846
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You're technically illegal to do what you're doing.

847
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I mean, the extent they would have to go to,

848
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
to even find out what content I have on these flash drives

849
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
that I'm sending to people, because there's only 10.

850
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So, like, you'd have to get ahold of one.

851
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
All right.

852
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You know, find somebody who will tell you what's on there.

853
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Check it.

854
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And then even then, I could make a fair use argument

855
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
for a lot of it, because it is common.

856
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah, it's a fair use.

857
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Because, like, the reason that YouTube content ideas

858
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
is so terrible is because the robot doesn't know

859
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
how to understand fair use, and it doesn't care,

860
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
and YouTube doesn't care to make it understand.

861
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So, that's always the problem.

862
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's hard.

863
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You just can't use it in any way, even if it's fair.

864
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yeah.

865
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay.

866
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Well, you know what, there's something to that.

867
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Like, fucking Red Letter Media sells their, you know,

868
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
their, like, director's commentary shit over movies.

869
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I think it's just a separate audio track or something,

870
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
but there's got to be something similar with that.

871
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
All I'm saying is consider that that's between 10 flash drives

872
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
at $40 a pop, and they sold out immediately.

873
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's $400 for whatever.

874
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's not bad.

875
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You know, and not including the overhead,

876
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
because the overhead's like $100 in itself,

877
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
just a fucking, you know, well, not $100.

878
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But, you know, there's a lot of buying flash drives

879
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and mailing shit, depending on how many people are foreign.

880
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And I charge people extra for that,

881
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
because after the last time, because it was like $10,

882
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
if you're out of the country in any way.

883
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Sure, sure.

884
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But, yeah, the, like, the, not with saying the overhead,

885
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
that's a lot of money to make off of a piece of content

886
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
that only 10 people are watching, you know?

887
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That's true.

888
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So, like, you really have to think creatively about,

889
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
like, where does your money come from,

890
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
what is your content worth, and who is it for, you know?

891
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
There might only be 10 people who would pay this amount of money

892
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
to get these things from me,

893
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
but, like, as long as those 10 people exist,

894
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and as long as I can give them something

895
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
that is worth 40 bucks to them, you know,

896
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
which, for a lot of them, just the fact that they're receiving

897
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
a physical thing that has my name on it,

898
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and, like, a little personalized piece of art is, like,

899
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
you know, worth something in itself.

900
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So, yeah, I just think that this is the kind of way

901
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
that we can rethink the way we can release content

902
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and monetize it.

903
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I could not be more with you on the sentiment that, like,

904
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
we shouldn't rely on these platforms long-term,

905
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
and we should, it's our responsibility

906
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
to make sure that we can fucking survive,

907
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
you know, the storms to come, and the fireballs

908
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
that they're gonna throw at us.

909
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I've been saying for a while that, like,

910
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
all these platforms should be a place for you

911
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to advertise your content on top of just making it

912
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and, like, drive it down a funnel

913
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
to, like, something you have more control over.

914
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Diversify people.

915
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Go to APSadventures.site to read Baaljeep

916
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and other things.

917
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Do it now before YouTube deletes us.

918
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And, again, reminder that, for all of Mumki's

919
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I've Lost Everything, like he said on Twitter,

920
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
again, tripled his Patreon,

921
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
has run successful Kickstarter,

922
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
has sold a book at, like, for hundreds of dollars,

923
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
you know, like, he has a ton of avenues he can explore.

924
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I am not even...

925
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I think he probably will have benefited more from this

926
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
than he loses out.

927
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The amount that his Patreon spiked,

928
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
like, if he doesn't lose all those people quickly,

929
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
if he capitalizes on it by, let's say,

930
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
making a really epic, like, a real documentary

931
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
that uses all kinds of footage he couldn't show on YouTube,

932
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
maybe, you know, something a little edgier

933
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
than what he even could get away with before.

934
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'm sure he could keep those people.

935
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, I mean, it's a time-tested term

936
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
that the best way to grow your YouTube channel

937
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
is to get unfairly deleted.

938
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It's happened so many times to people,

939
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
though that's always been in the case

940
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
where they get it back eventually,

941
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
which could theoretically still happen

942
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
for what it's worth.

943
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You have to milk it and be a crybaby for it to work.

944
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Because I've had my channel taken away three times,

945
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and it did nothing for me, because I didn't...

946
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You need to make a campaign.

947
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You need to make a thing happen where lots of people hear about it.

948
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I mean, victimhood is the current social currency.

949
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It is, like, or not.

950
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You need to lift those sunglasses up and see the tears,

951
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
throwing the tears rolling down.

952
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
See the sharring guns I have beneath these shades.

953
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, in any case, I feel deep sympathy,

954
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
and I hope things work out.

955
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little jealous.

956
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Just when you get your channel deleted,

957
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
you just get so much love from the world.

958
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I know I sound like an asshole,

959
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
but you really get a lot of attention and love.

960
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
People act like someone in your family died.

961
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It erases many of your sins.

962
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
They don't matter anymore.

963
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm just saying, this is why victimhood

964
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
is an extremely valuable thing.

965
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That said, I totally...

966
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The left got something right,

967
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and it's being a victim.

968
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's very funny.

969
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I laugh all the way to the bank.

970
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
By the way, so I have a...

971
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So this isn't a story of deplatforming, per se,

972
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
but it's of deplatforming to come for me.

973
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
There was an event that happened over the last week,

974
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
or it might have been a little bit earlier,

975
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
and I might have forgot to mention last PCB,

976
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
but this actually is sort of a cataclysmic shift in my life,

977
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
in my professional life, specifically.

978
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Oh, no.

979
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And I'll share it with you now, ladies and gentlemen.

980
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Okay, brace yourself for this.

981
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So I'm at work.

982
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm sitting at my desk,

983
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and I'm just doing some shit.

984
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's like...

985
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There was a luncheon that happened

986
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
that everybody at the company went to,

987
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
down the street, to a restaurant, or to go eat.

988
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I just didn't want to go, because I'm like,

989
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
fuck it, I've got work to do.

990
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And you made steamed hams.

991
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I made steamed hams, yeah.

992
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So I didn't go.

993
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I was in my office at my desk,

994
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and then I'm just working, just doing my thing,

995
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and then all of a sudden,

996
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
somebody stops by my door, somebody looks in and says,

997
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
hey, Nate.

998
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Hey, just so you know,

999
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
the president says that everybody can go home,

1000
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
because it's like a party day.

1001
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Just yay, everybody can take the rest of the day off.

1002
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And I'm like, shit, dude, that's awesome.

1003
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'ma do that.

1004
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And then he turns to leave.

1005
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And as he turns to leave, he pauses.

1006
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He pauses this young man.

1007
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
He's like an intern at the company.

1008
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
He turns around,

1009
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and he just says

1010
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
five words that

1011
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
will haunt me for the rest of my days.

1012
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And it's just, forget this one,

1013
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
um, and then here they are.

1014
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Are you best guy ever?

1015
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh, no.

1016
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yes, yes.

1017
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I've never spoken to this person before.

1018
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Just independently,

1019
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
at work, one of the interns,

1020
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
these damn college kids,

1021
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
recognized me and knows who I am,

1022
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
and is without a doubt,

1023
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
spreading the word throughout the company.

1024
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And now that this is really

1025
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
a crossing into a new era,

1026
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
now that this is happening,

1027
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I have no idea how long

1028
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I can keep things under wraps

1029
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and, uh, and, you know, on the down low.

1030
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I told him like, yeah, that's me, man.

1031
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Do you, you know, you listen to the PCPs

1032
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
like, no, I'm just, I watch your main channel

1033
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
sometimes. It's, it's pretty funny.

1034
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'm like, yeah, thanks.

1035
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, I like to keep that shit on the down low

1036
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
here at work a little bit, you know.

1037
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So he was like, yeah, I heard you on calls

1038
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
and I recognized your voice and I was like, that can't be.

1039
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But anyway,

1040
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
this is, I'm sure that this is, uh,

1041
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
this is getting around more

1042
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and people will be aware of my various activities

1043
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
online. And I, it started

1044
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
a doomsday clock as far as I'm concerned.

1045
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Uh, to one day

1046
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
something will be unearthed

1047
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
that's not so good that the people

1048
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
aren't too fond of at work.

1049
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Uh, all they have to do is scroll back to

1050
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Lolly the Greatest Love of All

1051
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
of my main channel and that might be,

1052
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that might be it right there, ladies and gentlemen.

1053
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
What if you get fired because you don't upload

1054
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
frequently?

1055
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Guys, I gotta,

1056
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I gotta interrupt because

1057
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
apparently Victor's apology video

1058
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
is like really, really

1059
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
sad and at one point

1060
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
there's a screen cap someone took where he put

1061
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
text on screen that says, at this point

1062
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I just break down crying like a bitch

1063
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
for like six minutes. I care

1064
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
about the PCP a lot and they have been a big

1065
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
positive part of my life for many years

1066
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and I feel closer to and care about

1067
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
them more than any of my IRL friends.

1068
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Well.

1069
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm so, I'm so confused.

1070
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Victor, it's okay. It wasn't that serious, dude.

1071
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's all right. It's all right.

1072
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Hashtag save Victor.

1073
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Go send him love. Go to vicanhope.com

1074
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I absolve you, Victor, of all

1075
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
sense. We'll have to listen to this apology later.

1076
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I will definitely go listen to it later.

1077
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Uh, anyway.

1078
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
What if Victor's playing all of us and he's like taking

1079
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
our advice, he's already heard from his podcast

1080
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
somehow already and went back into the past

1081
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and it's like, I'm going to play the victim card. I'm going to get all the money.

1082
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Oh, yeah. That's it. That's definitely it.

1083
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So, so on this subject

1084
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I just, this is more than ever.

1085
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The time the clock is accelerating

1086
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
at rapid speed to depart from this land.

1087
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Dude, that is the most terrifying thing

1088
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
that could possibly happen

1089
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
on planet Earth. It was quite terrifying.

1090
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Uh, like, because there are

1091
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
people at the company that like once

1092
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
or twice I have discussed this stuff with

1093
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
which I deeply regret and should not have done

1094
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
but, uh, it's never like spread around.

1095
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But this is a guy I've never spoken to before

1096
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
just independently. The only

1097
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
like good thing to come from that

1098
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
is like he doesn't watch the PCP

1099
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
so he's watching PG-13 content

1100
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and not your NC-17

1101
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
off the rails

1102
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
talking with your psychotic friends.

1103
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Like, thank God because

1104
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that's not in the limelight yet

1105
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and you're still okay.

1106
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
But who knows.

1107
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Who knows where it's going to go from here.

1108
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's like, uh, sort of Damocles

1109
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
is now in place.

1110
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Like the rope is getting thinner

1111
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and thinner by the day. It's splintering more.

1112
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It's going to drop. But, um,

1113
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I hate to tease everybody like this again

1114
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
but like I'm just going to say again

1115
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
looking over my finances, looking over

1116
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
my future, the day draws

1117
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
close when I'm at a place where I can

1118
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
when I can do it, when I can make

1119
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
this change. So, just saying.

1120
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Just saying.

1121
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Anyway, that was a big thing for me.

1122
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh, I've got another funny story.

1123
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
No.

1124
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
This is a small one. This is a small one.

1125
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Basically, so yes,

1126
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
two days ago, my internet just died

1127
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
and I didn't know what was going to happen

1128
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and I thought I was going to have to kill myself because I don't have internet.

1129
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But I was a big boy

1130
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
called Cincinnati Bell

1131
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Cincinnati's best internet provider

1132
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and I just, I

1133
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
talked to them like a big boy that Ham

1134
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
having this issue. Can you guys help me?

1135
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And they said, not only can we help you

1136
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
we're going to replace your router for free

1137
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
but because

1138
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah, that's right. Because

1139
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
you are a two year loyal member

1140
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
who as far as I know has literally never missed a payment

1141
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
or even been late. We're going to

1142
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
upgrade you from

1143
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
50 megabytes per second

1144
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
to 500 megabytes per second

1145
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and it's going to be cheaper.

1146
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's going to be cheaper than what I was paying

1147
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
before.

1148
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
What the fuck?

1149
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Is it

1150
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
literally because in this

1151
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
age of millennial babies that you

1152
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
are the only big boy you could ever

1153
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
call in?

1154
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Probably. Probably.

1155
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
This is the highest endorsement of capitalism I've ever heard

1156
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
in my life. Exactly.

1157
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Like, honestly dude, I was

1158
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
shocked to my core. But you know what, let me damper

1159
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
this a little bit. I looked into it

1160
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and while we thought it was going to be less

1161
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
it actually is $2

1162
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
more out of like 64.

1163
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Now, I don't know if maybe there's like some shenanigans

1164
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
that's going to be on the bill that's going to be less

1165
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
but it looks like it was $2 more.

1166
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean, from 50 to 500, that's a pretty huge

1167
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
10 times the speed.

1168
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
10 times the speed.

1169
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm going to be

1170
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm going to be

1171
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
the greatest, I don't know, overwatch player

1172
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I'm going to be playing

1173
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Smash Online and having so many

1174
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
gigabits per second. You can stream

1175
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Pokemon video games

1176
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
in 4K. Yeah, exactly.

1177
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Get the pixels blown up to

1178
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
big pixels.

1179
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You know, this is why capitalism

1180
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
is the way the truth in the life, guys.

1181
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
You know what's different from me to everybody else

1182
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
that complains about this shit? They just

1183
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
fuck up. They just fuck up

1184
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and they don't pay their fucking bills and they got

1185
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
deadbeat ass jobs. They don't work hard

1186
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
to improve at and become a fucking

1187
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
manager and they don't go to school

1188
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and they don't tactically take out

1189
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
debt in the interest of one day

1190
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
paying it off in a timely

1191
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
fashion and they also don't have really great parents

1192
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
who will just help you and like absolve you of debt.

1193
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You're doing good for a while.

1194
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
The point is

1195
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
if what you pay into the system

1196
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
you will be paid back most of the time

1197
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
so fuck you

1198
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
every socialist piece of shit out on the planet

1199
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I'm going to knock your block off.

1200
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Nate comes to all the Bernie Bros.

1201
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
At once. I'm going to fight every

1202
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Bernie Bro on the planet because you know

1203
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
they're at home, you know, fucking

1204
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
jerking their dunk ding dong to

1205
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I don't know. I just imagined it's like

1206
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Smash 64 fighting

1207
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
polygon team except it's fighting Bernie Bros

1208
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and just one Nate and smash them all

1209
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
one after another.

1210
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That's exactly it.

1211
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Anyway, it was great

1212
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and what a wonderful time that was.

1213
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Although, you know, I checked my download speed

1214
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I don't think it's either ticked over yet. It's still like

1215
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
54 megabytes per second or something.

1216
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't know if I'm getting mean. Disgusting.

1217
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I don't know if I need to like, if I need to wait.

1218
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
If it was all a lie just to get you to stay with their service

1219
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
then that's the capitalism I know. It's possible

1220
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
it's possible. And by the way, I was very diligent

1221
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
as you all should be two people and I was

1222
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
asking like whoa whoa whoa. Now is this

1223
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
upgrade going to like lock me in for like

1224
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
a two year contract? Like what's

1225
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
what's your angle here? But no, they were

1226
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
very thorough. Nothing like that's

1227
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
happening. You portray yourself in your own

1228
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
stories. It's fucking hilarious.

1229
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Isn't it great? That's true.

1230
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Now

1231
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
just one second here

1232
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
it seems

1233
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
that you're trying to dupe me

1234
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
but I made the best

1235
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I'd like to think that is how you talk on the phone.

1236
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That's exactly how I do. You know I do

1237
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
change how I talk on the phone versus

1238
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
like as most people do.

1239
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm a very corporatized

1240
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
person. It's the same as my work voice.

1241
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I've gotten a lot of shit for the way that I throw

1242
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
my voice when I order food

1243
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
at places because I always

1244
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
say like yeah can I have a number

1245
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
four? Like that

1246
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
because it just makes your voice like pierce right

1247
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
through that particular type of speaker

1248
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
so that they will definitely fucking hear

1249
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
you. Well it sounds like it's working.

1250
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I'm really good at like

1251
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
figuring out how to

1252
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
make a speaker or microphone

1253
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
make the exact

1254
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
loudest noise it can

1255
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
make. Do you know what I mean?

1256
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's called screaming. Well if you

1257
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
sit there with like a megaphone for instance

1258
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
if you scream into a megaphone you're not going to

1259
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
get a very loud noise but if you put your

1260
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
lips directly on it and you go like

1261
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
it'll make a noise that is

1262
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
just unbelievably shrill and

1263
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
hear it throughout the whole fucking universe.

1264
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So you know it plays around

1265
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
with your speakers. I'm now just imagining you in your house

1266
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
with a megaphone. Just go like

1267
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Yeah. Well I used to use

1268
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
a megaphone like

1269
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
a toy megaphone very heavily

1270
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
in my music. A lot of my old

1271
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
shit. Oh yeah that blue fucking megaphone

1272
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
thing. Yeah. Dude I

1273
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
saw that in real life. Yeah

1274
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
even before that I had the IMT

1275
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
pain microphone which I would love to get another

1276
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
of. It's a microphone

1277
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
that you press a button and it makes you sound like

1278
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
T-Pain when you sing it do it.

1279
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
This is an app for your phone that does that too.

1280
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It's just like it's just any other toy

1281
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
like megaphone thing. It's just shaped

1282
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
like a microphone but like it when you

1283
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
hold down the button it's sort of like auto-tunes

1284
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
your voice a little bit. Oh you said it's called

1285
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
the IMT pain microphone. Yes

1286
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
IMT pain.

1287
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I think that was based on a phone app that

1288
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
blew up really big back in like 2009

1289
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that would make sense. Well I

1290
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
have a toy microphone of it and I used it on

1291
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
like a hundred songs

1292
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and then it fucking broke.

1293
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Including

1294
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Diddy's most famous

1295
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I am a boat starring

1296
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Gigi Bro. I am a boat.

1297
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah at first I was a GameCube

1298
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
now I'm a boat.

1299
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Alright speaking of

1300
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
music, speaking of like things

1301
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
skills and various

1302
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
abilities.

1303
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I've been on like one of those

1304
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
distractoid mindsets recently

1305
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
where I'm like oh you know

1306
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I should really work on

1307
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
skill A, B, C, D, E,

1308
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
F and G. All of these different

1309
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
things I could be doing instead of the thing I should be doing.

1310
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
You know the classic

1311
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
like procrastination thing.

1312
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But like it's

1313
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
very strong for some reason

1314
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
at the moment. I think it was also

1315
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Munchie and Tom's

1316
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
new podcast Killing Code

1317
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
when Munchie is like really excited about

1318
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
code and I was

1319
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
like yeah yeah I enjoy

1320
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
it when I learn the basics of

1321
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
a new thing and I'm getting on a path

1322
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
towards being a master at it. I never

1323
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
go all the way because I'm a fucking idiot

1324
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
but like fucking

1325
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
there's so many things I want to do

1326
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
there's so many like albums

1327
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I want to learn how to record

1328
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I want to draw

1329
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
people I want to draw

1330
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
myself I want to draw I was looking at

1331
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
fucking

1332
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Jaden animations

1333
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
the YouTube story time animator person

1334
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
one of the better ones

1335
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
one of the only ones that I

1336
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
really really enjoy the content

1337
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
of the thing despite it just

1338
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
being you know similar

1339
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
looking for those other ones

1340
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
like I think Davoo's talked

1341
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
about the odd ones out before and how he hates

1342
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
the whole concept of that

1343
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
channel where it's just a big blob of a guy

1344
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
talking about stuff that isn't funny

1345
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and is very relatable and gets

1346
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
billions upon billions of views

1347
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
and and there's like hundreds

1348
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
of different channels that are basically the same thing

1349
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
where it's like you know 17 million

1350
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
views my my

1351
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
guys I had a hard time

1352
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
in high school exams

1353
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
oh they suck don't they guys

1354
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
times I said something

1355
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
embarrassing yeah you know

1356
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
things like that I'm like yeah whatever

1357
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
rolls eyes like I don't really care for

1358
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
the relatable hashtag relatable stuff but

1359
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I just had this

1360
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
like urge to like

1361
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
be one of those people

1362
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and make my own channel

1363
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
get a million subs you yeah

1364
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
because I have like sad

1365
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
like oh I used to be nervous in school

1366
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
guys I used to be socially awkward

1367
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
and I could I could easily do

1368
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
things like that but I also wanted to be

1369
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
like the only one of those

1370
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
who was like really funny

1371
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
because I can I can be really funny

1372
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
of course and it's

1373
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
just that's that's just

1374
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
been on my mind and it's just one of many

1375
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
things that has been like

1376
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
distracting me from from

1377
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
the thing I should be doing he just gave

1378
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
me a big projects big new

1379
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
projects the ideas of like making

1380
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
new channels not necessarily to like grow

1381
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
a channel and be a youtuber again

1382
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
but to just to be to

1383
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
to be able to do one give I think

1384
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I think you should

1385
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
experiment in your free time

1386
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
making content like this and I would say posting

1387
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
it on give and take an established

1388
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
channel with some sub base

1389
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
exactly the start with something small

1390
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
because I would excuse me

1391
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
bet my bottom fucking dollar that kind

1392
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
of content would do exceptionally well

1393
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
as it does for so many hack fraud

1394
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
animators on YouTube already

1395
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I think you'd find success there guys

1396
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I just thought of an idea for

1397
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
a YouTube channel yeah it'll

1398
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
be called everyone is terrible

1399
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and the the host

1400
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
is like think of like a raven

1401
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
from teen titans esk figure

1402
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
like someone just like dark

1403
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
hair in front of their eyes you know low

1404
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
you know low misanthropic

1405
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and the idea of the channel is that it's sort

1406
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
of an analysis channel but the idea

1407
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
is that every video is about

1408
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
prove is about how everyone is

1409
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
provably terrible so the

1410
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
idea is that they take recommendations

1411
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
and you just tell like you leave

1412
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
a comment who do you want them to prove is

1413
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
terrible and then every video

1414
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
is just about proving another person

1415
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
is terrible and it could be literally

1416
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
anybody you could talk about your fans

1417
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
talk about

1418
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
celebrities talk about whoever you want

1419
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
just prove that everyone is terrible

1420
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I feel I feel like if

1421
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
like Tara Strong herself did

1422
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
that channel as raven people

1423
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
would love it but if it was a guy then it

1424
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
would be like just shut up dude just shut up

1425
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
it depends on if

1426
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
the guy if it's a guy it has to be

1427
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
more funny if it's a girl

1428
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I want it to just be like just

1429
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
a girl who's like just looks really dismal

1430
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and hates like legitimately hates everyone

1431
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
that does sound funny hilarious

1432
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
maybe there's maybe I'm getting head

1433
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Kennedy already but I imagine in my

1434
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
world this show would be something that

1435
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
the idea the conceit is to indeed

1436
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
anything that you say wants to be

1437
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
proved terrible this person will make it sound

1438
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
terrible and find the way but what that really

1439
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
indicates is that everything

1440
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
can be interpreted terrible so just

1441
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
don't assume

1442
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
it's not everything it's every one

1443
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
every one it has to specifically

1444
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
be about humans like every

1445
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
episode is another human being

1446
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
why that person is terrible

1447
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
sure

1448
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I want it to be like legitimately

1449
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
being spirited I want it to be like

1450
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
this channel

1451
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
is about proving that literally everyone

1452
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
is terrible and no one deserves

1453
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
to live

1454
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I think we can combine these ideas

1455
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm gonna do an animation youtube storytime

1456
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and I'm gonna hire a

1457
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
moody sounding girl to just say

1458
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
the lines

1459
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
it'll be called

1460
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
the character will be

1461
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
goth brisker

1462
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
she'll be like really like even more

1463
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
bitchy than usual

1464
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
she sounds dismal enough though

1465
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
she sounds too peppy

1466
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
she can do a really she can do like a

1467
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
raven voice okay yeah if she's

1468
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
doing a voice fair enough

1469
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I mean I remember

1470
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
when Jesse was always talking about his

1471
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
idea of having an MLP

1472
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
review channel hosted by

1473
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
what was it it was

1474
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
it was like a tropical sounding pina colada

1475
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
like some girl pony that he wanted

1476
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
to do and I still stand by

1477
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
that would definitely do well not necessarily

1478
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
pony anymore but like something like this

1479
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
it's kind of weird how little

1480
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
of people hiring other people to host

1481
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
their shows there is on youtube

1482
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
because like I understand

1483
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
why Mr. Throps and Lonely and shit

1484
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I understand why a lot of us just

1485
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
like have a point of pride we want it to be

1486
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
our voice on the thing because we know how to

1487
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
deliver it right because like I tried to

1488
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
hire a girl to

1489
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to voice one of my scripts once and she

1490
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
sent me like she sent me her test

1491
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
version and I was just like no

1492
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
like not happening like

1493
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
the cadence is completely wrong

1494
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
it doesn't give a point you know

1495
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
but like

1496
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I do think that if if you're somebody

1497
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
who can't do great delivery

1498
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
like by all means you should just hire somebody

1499
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
to read your scripts it's it's not

1500
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
expensive you don't even necessarily to pay people

1501
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
if you if you already have like a fan

1502
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
group fan base like people do it

1503
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
your fans will do it you know

1504
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
yeah though I never want to rely on

1505
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
fan goodwill pretty much for

1506
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
anything personally but whatever

1507
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I get you I get the mic

1508
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
uh yeah I stumbled

1509
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I stumbled through that that whole

1510
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
thing I didn't really know what I was

1511
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
gonna say I just know that

1512
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I should you like jaden animations

1513
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
want to do stuff like that

1514
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
yeah I want to be one of those

1515
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
people and I want to go to jaden animations

1516
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
when I've got like 20,000 subs

1517
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
and say hello and she's going to be like

1518
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
hey and then and then

1519
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
then we'll say hey don't get on me

1520
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
you silly animating boys

1521
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
no got them no

1522
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
is she like 19

1523
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
how old is she if anyone knows I'm just curious

1524
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I don't know

1525
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I think she's like 15

1526
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
but I have no idea if that's true or not

1527
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I've never seen this person's content

1528
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
this person

1529
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
the most recent video

1530
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
was just something about

1531
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
self-improvement

1532
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
self-improvement and

1533
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
and mindsets and stuff you know stuff that

1534
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
most people in the PCP

1535
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
like they're all right with that I occasionally

1536
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
like the laps and I'm

1537
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
stupid a lot of the time so I just need

1538
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
some like

1539
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
motivational but like like helpfully

1540
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
motivational I think that's the way I would describe it

1541
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
it's not merely like someone's here for you

1542
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I have this problem too

1543
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
it's like she actually is smart in the way that

1544
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
she goes about her scripts

1545
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
to talking about this stuff

1546
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
so I'm like yeah you're a reasonable

1547
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
intelligent person the animation is

1548
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
good and it's and

1549
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
you know the jokes are pretty good and I like

1550
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
them and I want to be your

1551
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
friend jaden animations but not through the PCP

1552
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
hey you know wanting to be

1553
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
someone's friend is how you got into youtube in

1554
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
the first place well okay not how you started

1555
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
but like pony stuff it's

1556
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
um wanting to be digi's

1557
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
friend was how I became a brony analyst I think

1558
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
right right right

1559
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
it works

1560
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
so keep it up

1561
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you know on that point give I've long

1562
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
thought that it was kind of strange

1563
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
that you didn't leverage more of your animation

1564
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
skills on youtube

1565
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
for your youtube content since it's kind of

1566
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
like your primary skill

1567
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
it's alright primary skill

1568
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
primary skill is like one way

1569
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
of putting it it is a skill that I have

1570
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
and I know a lot about it

1571
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
animation is very

1572
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
time intensive and it's very

1573
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
involved

1574
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
if I can get away if I can get away with

1575
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
not animating anything

1576
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I would

1577
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
it's like one of the biggest things

1578
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I was thinking about how Tom spent

1579
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
like a year and a half

1580
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
animating like six pages of

1581
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
emotion comic and Nate's like

1582
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
why don't you just do it

1583
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
two videos

1584
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
if only it was that

1585
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
god I'm smart

1586
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
like it's

1587
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
one of the major things I learned

1588
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
because you know to save time

1589
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
in animation

1590
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
there is an art to

1591
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
not animating

1592
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
like over animator stuff you draw

1593
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
on ones

1594
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
some things just don't work on one some things

1595
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
work when there's like just one frame

1596
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
extreme frame and then another extreme frame

1597
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
like a trigger does this a lot

1598
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
with stuff they leave

1599
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
out a lot of in-betweens to make it more punchy

1600
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
and so I learned

1601
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
that you can do a lot with

1602
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
a lot less as long as you know when to

1603
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
do a lot less

1604
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
so I'm you know especially with editing

1605
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I apply that to editing and

1606
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
anything visual you don't need to

1607
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
show everything that's why a lot of the animations

1608
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I did for

1609
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
my uni course were like

1610
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
you know the first one the fish at the door

1611
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
there is no background and the character

1612
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
there's no color but like the point of

1613
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
it is just to make you laugh with the joke

1614
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
so as long as the joke comes through

1615
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
with the right timing

1616
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
it really doesn't matter what it looks like

1617
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and that's how I managed to make that

1618
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
really good despite having no drawing in it

1619
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
really at all

1620
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
it's like yeah

1621
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
brief history lesson the trigger style you're describing

1622
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
is called limited animation

1623
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
it's basically

1624
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
all anime uses to some extent

1625
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
however in the

1626
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
70's animator Yoshinori Kanada

1627
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I believe was the guy who

1628
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
started making like really dynamic

1629
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
poses between extreme frames

1630
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and popularized that style

1631
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and uh, Gainax were big fans of him

1632
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
especially Maishi so they basically

1633
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
you know did that

1634
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm gonna tell that guy

1635
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
if he shows me that shitty animation

1636
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
take your ass back to Canada

1637
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
where you came from

1638
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
oh fuck you

1639
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
to answer the question

1640
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
of why I don't do animation in my

1641
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
content is really just

1642
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
it's a lot of work

1643
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
it's a lot of work and it's easier to

1644
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
just put a camera on and

1645
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
dance for the camera

1646
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
like how I look at my stupid dance in face

1647
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
that's fair but now

1648
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I look gross and I want to never be seen

1649
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
on live action ever again

1650
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
that's excellent motivation

1651
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I'd say

1652
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
uh, yeah

1653
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I mean it seems like animators

1654
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
just get a lot of views

1655
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
so it seems like

1656
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
there's something

1657
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I can imagine that if I was

1658
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
like more myself

1659
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
in the way that I approached

1660
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
topics and was like really

1661
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
analytical or really edgy

1662
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
that it wouldn't get really any views

1663
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
because

1664
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
part of it is like the hashtag

1665
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
relatable me and

1666
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
stuff and the teenage audience

1667
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and the demographic you see an animating

1668
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
like channel

1669
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
you know cool

1670
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
but if you see the title it's like

1671
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
relatable x thing

1672
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
it's like oh you know what I'm clicking on it

1673
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
yeah

1674
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
even though I know that it's very often

1675
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
like not interesting I do that

1676
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
these channels are kind of like the youtube

1677
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
equivalent of the four panel comics on tumblr

1678
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
and twitter it's like the same kind of idea

1679
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
of just like here's the thing that everybody

1680
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
does and it connects with them

1681
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
so they get views

1682
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
you know this really this reminds me that

1683
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
like so there's a resurgence a little bit

1684
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
this happens every once in a while the galco video

1685
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
which like start to get a bunch more views

1686
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
and it's really fascinating

1687
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
the success of that galco video is

1688
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
not at all

1689
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
what I intended and I kind of don't deserve

1690
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
the like success of it

1691
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
because while everything I said

1692
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
in it was true

1693
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
the message that people took away

1694
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
wasn't as like 1.15

1695
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
million views or whatever

1696
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
the reason is because it struck

1697
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
a nerve with fat girls

1698
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
fat girls who like

1699
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
think that they have such a great personality

1700
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
love that fucking video

1701
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
because they think when I'm talking about

1702
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
thick girls I'm talking about them

1703
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
when that was never intended

1704
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
but that's just what is read into it

1705
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
and uh

1706
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
it's like almost a body positivity

1707
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
video looking back on it now

1708
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
as a like just be yourself

1709
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
it's a literal I don't know

1710
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
nay nay you should make a follow up

1711
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
called fat is whack

1712
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I've been thinking about making a clarification

1713
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
we Agua on that video

1714
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
explaining it's just just like

1715
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
you can take away from it whatever you want

1716
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I believe in death of the author for the most part

1717
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
but I just want to explain what I meant

1718
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and I you're not gonna like it

1719
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
ladies but I'm gonna tell you

1720
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
what I meant to say

1721
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
that honestly that's a great idea

1722
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
it disappears

1723
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
it disappears it's gone

1724
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I can see it now you just like start with like

1725
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
a narration over like anime

1726
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
or whatever like more of a galco

1727
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
footage then just cuts to you like doing

1728
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
pull-ups like without a shirt on it's like

1729
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
do you really think I give a shit about you bitches

1730
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
that's true that's true and it's like

1731
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
like it was it's interesting because like people

1732
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
like like jessica nigiri started following me

1733
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
after I made that video and she's

1734
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
basically the target I was

1735
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I was hoping to reach that's like actually

1736
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
hot you know girl

1737
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
and whatever you can have whatever thoughts you want

1738
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
about old bald nigiri no offense Jessica

1739
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I love your content

1740
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I'm sure you're listening to this right now

1741
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
but like so she she's

1742
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
like a woman who takes care of herself

1743
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
she's fit but she was probably always like

1744
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
awkward weird anime girl

1745
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
in high school who didn't fit in and

1746
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
like that I get because

1747
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
she's someone who works hard and I respect

1748
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
what she does and

1749
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
that's all cool but but then

1750
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
you've got definitely definitely

1751
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
a bunch of fat girls just listening

1752
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
to this episode being like oh my god

1753
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
galco looks exactly like me and I'm such

1754
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
like a nice person but nobody can recognize

1755
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
it because they just judge me based on McCurves

1756
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I am positive that that

1757
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
is the demographic that like

1758
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
resonated with the video the most

1759
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
and I don't like you people

1760
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
so you know

1761
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
well it was big on tumblr so

1762
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I just get comments

1763
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
unironically gotten comments

1764
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and yeah it was big on tumblr so that's how you know

1765
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I got

1766
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
comments saying literally

1767
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
like OMG and I'm sure this person was like

1768
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
12 or something but with huge titties

1769
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
like OMG

1770
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
galco looks just like me

1771
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and also I'm super nice

1772
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
but everyone treats me you know

1773
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
like I'm just a dumb girl you actually

1774
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
got comments like that one

1775
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
absolute I'm gonna go find one right now

1776
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and read it off because it's it's it's

1777
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
unreal if she if they say

1778
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
galco looks just like me they're lying

1779
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
they are telling a lie if they say that

1780
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
or they're delusional what if there's a few of them

1781
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
that are actually like that

1782
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
those people wouldn't be dumb enough

1783
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
to comment on this fucking video saying that

1784
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
that's I unironically

1785
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
think that

1786
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I'm gonna go find one right now

1787
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
okay thoughtful a lot of shitty

1788
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
galco does not have a body type that is common

1789
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
no

1790
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
absolutely not

1791
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
hard to imagine dude I look just like galco

1792
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
in my dreams

1793
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
there's a lot of comments like am I the only one

1794
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000

01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
weaponized thickness for the forces of good

01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000

1808
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
it pretty well in showing us example

1809
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
of perfect girls that you can't find

1810
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000

01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000

and personality

1826
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
well guess I'm a weeb again

1827
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000

1828
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
comment on this

1829
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
video oh dear

1830
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
can you believe that

1831
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
that's real

1832
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
your fat I'm sorry but your fat

1833
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
you need to just address the reality of

1834
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
the situation you need to move on

1835
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
okay let's move on I'm sorry to waste

1836
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
this is it this is the one this is the episode

1837
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
that your work is gonna find

1838
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
and you're done

1839
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Nate we brown out you

1840
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
don't respect women and we have

1841
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
a clear no discrimination

1842
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
guys guys

1843
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
you know all women are queens

1844
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Nate doesn't respect fat men

1845
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
they're all women

1846
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I don't respect fat men that's true

1847
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
it's not a sexist thing

1848
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
our corporate policy dictates

1849
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
that being fat is a protected class

1850
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and so you can't say anything

1851
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I mean that's true in some

1852
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
fucking people's corporate

1853
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
anyway anyway

1854
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
we could go to voicemails

1855
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
unless somebody else want to talk about something else

1856
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I just really want to get a drink

1857
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
okay you can take a minute

1858
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
somebody say something entertaining

1859
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
well I'm gone

1860
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
oh Christmas I said that in the beginning

1861
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
it's coming

1862
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
if you guys want to get us a present for Christmas

1863
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
go to patreon.com

1864
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
slash the procrastinators

1865
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
get your significant other

1866
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
the gift they'll treasure forever at patreon.com

1867
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
slash procrastinator by stealing their credit card

1868
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and signing them up for an account

1869
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
you know go straight for the $100

1870
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
tier would be my recommendation

1871
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
the best Christmas present you can give your family

1872
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
is 20 amazing bonus episodes

1873
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
of the PCP they couldn't listen to before

1874
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
it's $5 a month

1875
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
it's funny to shill but it's not that funny

1876
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
we know this from

1877
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
from experience

1878
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
alright

1879
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Christmas decorating

1880
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
every year

1881
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
my family

1882
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
has the old tree

1883
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
the cut real wooden tree

1884
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
we put it somewhere we decorate things with lights

1885
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
but this is the first time

1886
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
we have the dog

1887
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
on a Christmas

1888
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and this dog loves chewing

1889
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
he loves eating

1890
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
we were really scared that he would

1891
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
destroy everything

1892
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
but he's been very good

1893
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
so that's my Christmas decoration

1894
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
story

1895
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
how do you guys decorate

1896
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
during the holidays

1897
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
you know just throw some shit around

1898
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I think we have a fake tree that we need to set up

1899
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
or something I can't remember

1900
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
no we definitely don't I should buy one

1901
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I'm feeling not Christmasy at all

1902
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
have you guys just fucking scrooge that I didn't

1903
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
even realize it was almost Christmas

1904
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
yeah me neither

1905
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
the holidays have ceased to exist

1906
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
when Halloween came around

1907
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
and Ben and Munchy just showed up

1908
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I'm like oh right

1909
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
it's Halloween

1910
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I guess we should do something and we didn't

1911
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I don't like being a scrooge

1912
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
if I'm not

1913
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
thinking about it I will forget

1914
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
but I also

1915
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I'm not huge into the preparations

1916
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
and the music

1917
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
it's just nice to have it around me

1918
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
maybe saying scrooge is the wrong

1919
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I'm just like so in my own shit

1920
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and disconnected from all of humanity

1921
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
that like

1922
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
it doesn't even occur to me until it's like

1923
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
on my doorstep, literally

1924
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
when the children are ringing the doorbell

1925
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
you're involved being a pure energy

1926
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I'm not even trying to flex

1927
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I'm saying it as a negative

1928
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
that I'm just so disconnected from everything that happens

1929
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
because it's fine

1930
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
to be a little disconnected and all

1931
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
but I get a lot of joy

1932
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
from like specifically

1933
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I'm actually not going to be with my family for Christmas

1934
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
for the first time ever because I'm going to Hawaii

1935
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
to hang out with Michelle and her family

1936
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
which is going to be dope

1937
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
but it's going to be a little sad

1938
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
because I'm not with those guys because I really like

1939
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
being with my family around the holidays

1940
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
but taking a year off

1941
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
taking a year to be doing something else

1942
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
my family is like

1943
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I won't say that they're

1944
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
insufferable around the holidays

1945
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
but it's like

1946
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
everyone's harder to be around

1947
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
when they're all like

1948
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
worried about the holidays

1949
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
when everyone's like trying to set up

1950
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
for the holidays it's just like

1951
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
anything about the holidays that stresses me out

1952
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I hate

1953
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I just want to relax and be happy

1954
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I've never understood why people do these things

1955
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
that stress them out for the sake of tradition

1956
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
it's just like

1957
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
because they're the same people who will be like

1958
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
the holiday isn't about this corporatization

1959
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
it's about spending time with family

1960
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
guys we have to get a treat

1961
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
and I'm like

1962
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
it's about family

1963
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
but it's more about impressing the family

1964
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
to let the parents know that we're doing well

1965
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
and we're not fucked up

1966
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
mom it's okay

1967
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I'm doing well

1968
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
my children are fine, it's all good

1969
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
my house is lovely and clean

1970
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
oh my god

1971
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
that's what Christmas is for a lot of people

1972
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
the weirdest thing is that my family is like

1973
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
three people

1974
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and I put on appearances

1975
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I live here

1976
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
all the rest of the days

1977
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I understand what this house is really like

1978
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
you're not fooling me, you just look like an idiot right now

1979
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
stop it

1980
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
very weird

1981
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
there's one positive thing

1982
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
when people come to visit

1983
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
my mom came to visit a couple months ago

1984
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
for the first time

1985
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
and we had to clean up around here

1986
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
because

1987
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
we had moved in fairly recently

1988
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
we were all just kind of around

1989
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
having my mom come was an excellent motivator

1990
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
to finally get our shit together

1991
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and actually clean up and make this place decently livable

1992
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
and now it is

1993
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
and it's nice and if she hadn't come

1994
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
we probably would have been so lazy

1995
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
that it still would just be like shitty stuff in boxes

1996
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
not totally moved in

1997
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
so like in that way

1998
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I kind of like having those kind of

1999
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
fires under my ass

2000
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
to actually get shit done be it like a holiday

2001
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
or just people coming to visit or something

2002
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
so I don't know

2003
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
there's an advantage I kind of like about it

2004
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
but I just like the traditions

2005
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I like having a tree

2006
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I like doing gifts even though it's kind of stressful

2007
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I just don't like

2008
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
ever having to do anything

2009
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
okay I'm with you

2010
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I like

2011
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I like some of it

2012
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I like the getting of gifts for

2013
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
at least my immediate family

2014
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
because it's something I don't really do

2015
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
well

2016
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
obviously I don't do it all the time

2017
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
my birthday presents

2018
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
but you know

2019
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
it's just a big because I like getting gifts

2020
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I had a phase when I was kind of a little

2021
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
younger when I was like

2022
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
you know what Christmas

2023
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I'm just gonna not ask for anything

2024
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
and then I didn't get that much and I was sad

2025
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
because I like getting stuff

2026
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
so like I

2027
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
made a point to be like

2028
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
you know I'm going to try

2029
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
and just do the giving part

2030
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I never did that as a child

2031
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
and my parents kind of made fun of me for like

2032
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
because I remember vividly

2033
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
there was an advert for like some

2034
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
fucking thing

2035
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
and in the advert a boy gave

2036
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
his parents a present and there's like

2037
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
enjoy the gift of giving with this fucking

2038
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
product

2039
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
and they said they look to me

2040
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
it's like hey you never did that when you were young

2041
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I didn't know I had to do that

2042
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
so then I started buying

2043
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
gifts for parents and brothers and

2044
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
it was good it's just

2045
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
a nice feeling to be like

2046
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
you know thanks

2047
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
for thanks some for this thing

2048
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
it's like yeah no problem

2049
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
unironically not a joke giving gifts

2050
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
just feels good I totally

2051
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
subscribe to that

2052
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
but it's annoying is all

2053
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
it costs money Christmas cards

2054
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Christmas cards are the worst thing because that's like

2055
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
the biggest obligation and it's easy

2056
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
enough to send like

2057
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
my mom has like

2058
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
boxes of

2059
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
upon boxes of like Christmas cards

2060
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
that she's bought in advance ready to

2061
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
like in like a

2062
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
fucking celebrity at a book signing

2063
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
to just sign a bunch of these cards

2064
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
get everybody around the family to sign these cards

2065
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
to send to every single relative possible

2066
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
and friend and it's just

2067
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
that's so much work

2068
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
it's a lot of work for a piece of card that people

2069
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
open they're like oh that's nice

2070
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I know I'm about to make an argument that I'm sure

2071
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
someone else has made before

2072
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
but like the problem I have with Christmas gift

2073
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
giving is that giving someone a gift

2074
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
is most fun when you happen

2075
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
to find something that they will like

2076
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
when you like see something

2077
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
that makes a big difference I feel like this person

2078
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
would like this before yeah and it's not

2079
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
as much fun when you have to like go out

2080
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
in search of something for that person

2081
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
and you can't find anything and then like

2082
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
so for me when it comes to holidays

2083
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
and shit I just always

2084
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
take people out to eat it's always been my policy

2085
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
it's just like I'll buy you a meal

2086
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
because

2087
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
because I get something out of it too

2088
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I have somebody to go eat with

2089
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and I love to go out to eat

2090
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
and like

2091
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
so yeah because in any other

2092
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
circumstances if I do just find

2093
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
something I want to buy for somebody and buy it

2094
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
and it's not Christmas I'm not

2095
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
going to hold on to it

2096
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
it's just like here just take the thing

2097
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
you could use it now probably

2098
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
why hold out

2099
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I never really like I

2100
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
started off like the first year I did it

2101
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
you know you never hear

2102
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
of people just asking each other for gifts

2103
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
it's always a surprise you have to get a surprise gift

2104
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
so I bought some crap

2105
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
at a toy store for my brothers and they didn't like it

2106
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
and that was the end of that

2107
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
so the next year I just asked them what they wanted

2108
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
and

2109
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
then they

2110
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
asked me what I wanted and it was like

2111
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
we just

2112
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
very upfront about it and then we forget

2113
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
what we asked for and then we get it and it's like

2114
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
it's still a surprise because we forgot

2115
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
by the time me and my brothers were adults

2116
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
we were like ordering our own

2117
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
off of Amazon like our own Christmas presents

2118
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
like my dad's just like here's your budget

2119
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
go buy as much whatever you

2120
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
okay you know what I'll just say on the

2121
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
on this subject I

2122
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
my fucking

2123
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
parents do this and I

2124
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
hate that they do this and it's exactly

2125
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
what you're talking about they'll say

2126
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Nate go find what you want

2127
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
for Christmas and we'll buy it

2128
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I don't want a homework assignment

2129
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
for a gift that I have to go do

2130
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
and I hate it I will never

2131
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
ever force anyone to do that

2132
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
and no one ever asked me

2133
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
to pick up my own fucking gift

2134
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
the funny thing is that it got so much better after that point

2135
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
because once we all finally grew up

2136
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
and we were like we're too old

2137
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
for Christmas I don't want anything anymore though

2138
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
that's the thing I just don't want to bother

2139
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I don't want anything I have my own money

2140
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
so then once it reached that point

2141
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
like where it was like yeah everybody's like

2142
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
because me and my brothers are all like that

2143
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
we're all just like I don't buy anything

2144
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I can get it myself

2145
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
because it got to that point my dad

2146
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
still wanted to have Christmas he just started

2147
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
buying people whatever the fuck he felt like

2148
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and it was way better

2149
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
that's where my robe came from

2150
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
like that's where my big fucking coat

2151
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
came from

2152
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
this is when your dad just started picking out stuff

2153
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
yeah when he just started buying us whatever

2154
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
he wanted us to have

2155
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
he liked goofy coats and stuff

2156
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
because he likes to see me wearing that shit

2157
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and those were sick

2158
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I'm like no problem dude

2159
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
it's called

2160
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
it's not giving if the person picks out

2161
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
exactly what it is

2162
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I know some people are into it

2163
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
some people just like to be pragmatic

2164
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I despise it

2165
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I don't know

2166
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I feel like it's

2167
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
nice when you get something that you want

2168
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
and you didn't have to pay for it

2169
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I don't know what it is

2170
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I'd even rather get something I don't want

2171
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
that somebody just thought I would like

2172
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
they put some degree of thought into it

2173
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
at all

2174
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
sometimes one of us just doesn't know what we want

2175
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
and then the other person has to think of something

2176
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
that's the real gift

2177
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
that process of thinking what we want

2178
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
as far as I'm concerned that's the actual gift

2179
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
that they're giving you

2180
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
the issue with

2181
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
getting gifts that you've asked for

2182
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
is that when you're in that situation

2183
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
you usually have to get somebody else a gift

2184
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
as well

2185
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
let's say I'm

2186
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
getting a gift from my sister

2187
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and she tells me what she wants

2188
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
and I get her something

2189
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I haven't really gotten a gift

2190
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I've just paid for what I got indirectly

2191
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
let's say I want a playstation game

2192
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
she wants a switch game

2193
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I basically just bought the game

2194
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I just wasn't at the register when it happened

2195
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
it feels

2196
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
not the same

2197
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I'm still at 60 bucks

2198
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
nothing's happened

2199
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I guess you're right

2200
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I don't know I don't feel so bad about it

2201
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and I don't want to start feeling bad about how

2202
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
feel bad

2203
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I'm not trying to say that that's wrong

2204
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
that's just

2205
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I think I'm too cynical about it

2206
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
and I think over thought it

2207
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
and I'm like damn it it's ruined

2208
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
what sucks for me is that

2209
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I had outsmarted all this when I was a kid

2210
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
but couldn't keep up as an adult

2211
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
because when I was a kid

2212
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I would just make shit for my parents

2213
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I would always just write my mom

2214
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
a poem or a song

2215
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
give them a card

2216
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
that had some cool writing a picture

2217
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
or something

2218
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
me and my brothers always made stuff for our parents

2219
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
because my mom is impossible to buy shit for

2220
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
she doesn't particularly like anything

2221
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
unless it's like an Alice in Wonderland

2222
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
collectible or the Sandman

2223
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
collectible

2224
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
those are the only sure-fire things

2225
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
or some kind of monkey

2226
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
plush or something like that

2227
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
maybe a plushie I don't fucking know

2228
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
she doesn't like anything

2229
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
so you just make something for her

2230
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
and she'll always appreciate it way more

2231
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
but then I kind of ran out of ideas

2232
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
the last thing I did

2233
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
for my parents was on each of their birthdays

2234
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
made them an analysis video

2235
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
back in the early pony days

2236
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
you could find thoroughly analyzing

2237
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Todd Collins or whatever in my playlist

2238
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
oh yeah

2239
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
but

2240
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
once you've done that once

2241
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I'm not going to make up new shit to say about you

2242
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
yeah

2243
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
well you know

2244
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
there's a lot I don't know about my parents

2245
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
alright

2246
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
this year

2247
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
it was particularly

2248
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
it felt good

2249
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
because me and mom were going around

2250
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
shopping for people

2251
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and mom was buying baby toys for

2252
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
new members of the family

2253
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
even more

2254
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
nephews and all that

2255
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
and she's buying baby toys

2256
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
and she's asking me like

2257
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
don't you know that my little pony thing

2258
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
what is this

2259
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
you know that was a weird moment

2260
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
but there was this

2261
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
this nice necklace

2262
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
and my mom was looking at it

2263
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and it was like 18 pounds

2264
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
and I was like I'll buy that for you for Christmas

2265
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and she's like oh really

2266
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
there's really nice views

2267
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
like a pound necklace

2268
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
for a second

2269
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
that's a chain boy

2270
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
we call that a chain

2271
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
yeah very good

2272
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
very funny

2273
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
god I've heard that so often for some reason

2274
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
like every time I speak in my own currency

2275
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
everyone's like

2276
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
oh you idiot

2277
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
that joke was the first thing that came into my head

2278
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
when you said that

2279
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
even to me that feels stale and old

2280
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I didn't say it as a joke

2281
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I legitimately thought that you were talking

2282
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
about an 18 pound necklace

2283
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
and I was like whoa

2284
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
yeah I know

2285
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
it's just I hate it

2286
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
anyway I felt like a real man

2287
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
because I had cash in my wallet and I paid

2288
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
for the thing and I have it

2289
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
and I'm gonna wrap it up nice and she's gonna open it

2290
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
and she's gonna be like oh yeah

2291
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
it's not really about like

2292
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
the surprise or like

2293
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
the

2294
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
it's the thought that counts and the thought is

2295
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I'm going to give you something

2296
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
yeah sure

2297
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I don't really

2298
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I mean my brothers I don't know how they feel about it

2299
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I assume they just don't really care

2300
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
and they don't feel like oh man

2301
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I would have rather gotten something random

2302
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
that you care to give me

2303
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
they don't give a shit

2304
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
they're just happy to have a new thing

2305
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
my thing right now is that my parents

2306
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
are still like we need to get you

2307
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
something for Christmas and I'm just like

2308
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
no you don't

2309
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
you can stop because

2310
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
my parents don't have a lot of money

2311
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
but they still try and do those things

2312
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
and I'm like on the one hand I don't want to like

2313
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I mean it's a matter of pride

2314
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I know it is because there was a time when

2315
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
my family they couldn't afford to throw a Christmas

2316
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
there was one time

2317
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
my grandma actually did it for us

2318
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
she didn't really have the money

2319
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
to do it but she was just like it's too important

2320
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
that they have a Christmas

2321
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
then like

2322
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I get that but like I'm 30

2323
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
it's okay because like they were talked

2324
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I was over there like a month ago

2325
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and I was talking with the parents and they were like

2326
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
yeah we want to get your younger sister

2327
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
because I have a younger sister who's like 17

2328
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and like she really wants a

2329
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
switch and we're like is there any way we can

2330
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
get it cheaper than $300

2331
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
getting Nintendo products on sale hilarious

2332
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
so I'm like no like it's gonna be

2333
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
like that's just how much you're gonna have to pay for it

2334
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
they might have a holiday bundle or something

2335
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
it's gonna be $300

2336
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
and so I was saying like

2337
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
just get me nothing and put my money

2338
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
that you would spend on me towards that

2339
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
like it's chill I don't mind

2340
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
you know and they were just like oh no

2341
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
but like we already like bought it and stuff

2342
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
like we're already planning on getting it

2343
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
like we still need to get you something we got your sister a guitar

2344
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
so like we need to get you something like

2345
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
you don't have to it's chill it's fine

2346
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
you know like use like because I don't

2347
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000

2348
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
for Christmas now is a cheap guitar

2349
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000

2366
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000

2374
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
viewer giving that one cent of ad

01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
revenue on imgames.com

01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000

01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
investment that is not fun sorry

was technically a Christmas

2383
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
present I believe like three years ago

2384
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
but like because it's so expensive

2385
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
there's like 400 bucks or whatever I asked

2386
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
my parents to put down like half the money and I'd

2387
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
put down half and that's how we would like

2388
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
you know kind of there's there was a lot of

2389
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000

2392
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
all right shit's expensive man

2393
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
where the money go

2394
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I just need that dick

2395
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
replacement but I you know it's more than

2396
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
get the money they're willing to spring for

2397
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
all right well guys good talk

2398
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000

01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
these voicemails okay so we got

2400
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
we got nine total but the first one

2401
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
is a public service

2402
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
announcement from

2403
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
from stop please

2404
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
is the name of this individual so

2405
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
hang on I know there's a little dead

2406
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
sound so I'm gonna let it play for a second here

2407
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
but okay here it goes

2408
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
stop

2409
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
talking over voicemails

2410
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
that's it but why

2411
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
how are we gonna make comments about things

2412
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
they say this okay this is an

2413
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
interesting one which is why I wanted to play it

2414
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
first so

2415
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
talking over voicemails I think

2416
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
is something that like adds to the experience

2417
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
but I don't want to make things inaudible

2418
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
for people either you know

2419
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
don't we post them in the show notes

2420
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
no we actually don't

2421
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
they're all hosted on SoundCloud

2422
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I mean the most important thing

2423
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
the most important thing to hear

2424
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
is laughter when there's a joke

2425
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
absolutely absolutely

2426
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
yeah I mean that person would be fucking

2427
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
probably devastated if they didn't hear any laughter

2428
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
over their joke

2429
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
yeah okay let's just try to talk less

2430
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
over the audio I guess when would appropriate

2431
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
but I'm not gonna fucking stop laughing

2432
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
okay duly noted thank you

2433
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
moving on here's Bobo the

2434
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
addicted hobo calling in

alright guys you know that funny ha ha

2437
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
meme about the pcp being addicted like

2438
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
ajo dust and you actually start

2439
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
craving it well it's not a ha ha funny

2440
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
meme for me it's actually real life

2441
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
so let me give you my backstory

2442
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
a year and a half ago I was

2443
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
at the gym and I was a wee

2444
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
weak boy and I was too embarrassed

2445
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
that people were looking at me so I started listening

2446
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
podcasts to distract myself

2447
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
it all started with a monkey and didgy one

2448
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and I liked it so much that I was like

2449
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
why not give the pcp a chance

2450
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
yeah then

2451
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I started listening to it even after I was

2452
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
doing the gym on my way to home

2453
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I liked it even more

2454
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
so I started listening to it every single

2455
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
time when I'm outside

2456
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
and I'm walking and I'm not talking to another

2457
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
person but I actually

2458
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
realized how bad this shit is

2459
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
two days ago when I lost my

2460
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
phone I wasn't able to listen to the pcp

2461
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I was riding my bike to

2462
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
uni my mind wasn't in

2463
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
normal state I was confused

2464
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I was scared and I actually hit

2465
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
a guy because

2466
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I was not doing the pcp

2467
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
fuck

2468
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
this shit is bad

2469
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
it was probably missed that five more episodes

2470
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
and I'll be caught up and I'll have

2471
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
to wait a week to get my

2472
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
dose fuck

2473
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I know you guys have other

2474
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
shit go try listening to that

2475
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
go listen hopefully

2476
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
okay hang on it will be like

2477
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
jesus christ good enough but

2478
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I don't know man

2479
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
it's scary

2480
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
it really is

2481
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
alright look look

2482
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
it's like the saying goes

2483
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
the first 137 hits are free

2484
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
but then you gotta pay

2485
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
for the bonus episodes

2486
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
that's exactly right

2487
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
that's the right way to go

2488
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
20 episodes waiting for you

2489
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
20 bonus episodes

2490
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
if you like digi bro

2491
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
there's the every youtube video

2492
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
featuring digi bro playlist with

2493
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
two months of content plus on it

2494
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
our boy here

2495
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
he's talking about how he's listening to

2496
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
all the pcp but he doesn't seem to have listened to any of

2497
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
our solo content so that's a world

2498
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
unto his own god there's a rabbit hole

2499
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
there's multiple rabbit holes

2500
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
watch the radcon playlist too but all three

2501
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
radcon playlist check those out

2502
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
and if you finish all our shit

2503
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
the dig show is also good for the same

2504
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
purposes

2505
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I am racist

2506
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
but I couldn't understand

2507
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
what he was saying

2508
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I got the gist of it

2509
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
did he run over someone on his bike

2510
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
he said he hit someone on his bike

2511
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
cause he couldn't listen to the pcp

2512
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
and he was getting the shakes

2513
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
and so he just swerved his bike

2514
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
oh like a drug

2515
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
there it is

2516
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
oh well good luck with your addiction

2517
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
keep listening though

2518
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
we're your sole provider

2519
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
alright next up moonju

2520
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
back at it again

2521
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
munchie tom

2522
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I love the fact that you're starting

2523
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
to code frankly it is my

2524
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
favorite activity

2525
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
and I too am learning to code through school

2526
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
but why python

2527
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
python like I

2528
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
looked at it and it seems to be

2529
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
a really hard language for beginners

2530
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
like

2531
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
you know me

2532
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
and presumably you

2533
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
seeing as you both have

2534
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
little to no experience

2535
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
in actual coding

2536
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
so why did you choose python over any other

2537
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
beginner friendly languages

2538
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
like game maker

2539
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
studios or

2540
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I don't know

2541
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
anything really

2542
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
game maker studios

2543
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
is very specific to video game making

2544
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
coding is not necessarily just

2545
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
games well I know

2546
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
the reason he's asking is because we both

2547
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
said the reason we're learning to code is to

2548
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
make games so the question is like

2549
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
a fair one to ask and I have

2550
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
the reason why is very simple

2551
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
it's because munchie is learning to code

2552
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
primarily to work on endless war

2553
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and that's a discord and you extend discord

2554
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
through python so that just makes sense for him

2555
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
and then for me the game engine

2556
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I want to use to make games in is godot

2557
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
and gd script its language

2558
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
is a derivative of python

2559
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
so just for our personal purposes the tools

2560
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
are going to be using pythons the one

2561
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
that makes the most sense

2562
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I mean if I was just going to go into it

2563
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
completely blind I would probably just choose

2564
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
C sharp because it's like everywhere

2565
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
it even can be using to go

2566
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
they just added version to go that supports C sharp

2567
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
and it's also in unity and

2568
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
so like that would be like the most

2569
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
logical one to do

2570
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
but just because of the tools that we're both

2571
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
using and they both happen to line up with python

2572
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
python was like

2573
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
the one to go with

2574
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I was curious about that

2575
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
you know I was actually his assertion that python

2576
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
is a particularly difficult language for beginners

2577
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I find that strange

2578
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I've heard the opposite I've heard python is a great

2579
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
beginner language python is in fact great

2580
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
in many ways one of which being

2581
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
you do not need to compile code

2582
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
in order to run it which is a huge advantage

2583
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
though one of the weird things

2584
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
about python is that white space management

2585
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
is extremely important

2586
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
and it will break your code

2587
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
someone got really mad at us for using python

2588
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
in the comments for that reason

2589
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
because they were just like oh the white space thing

2590
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
is bad and I personally because

2591
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I've done a bit of gd script which again

2592
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
uses white space indentations for

2593
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
breaking up functions

2594
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
so I was like I didn't have a problem

2595
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
so I was just simply asked why

2596
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
and there was a paragraph

2597
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
this huge essay about

2598
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
how he worked on a professional project

2599
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
and one tab

2600
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
and it came up for days

2601
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
and it was like the worst experience ever

2602
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
man that's his fucking fault

2603
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
python tells you when you just weren't

2604
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
reading your fucking errors when you're compiling it

2605
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
you dumb shit so fucking get in there

2606
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
do it again and figure it out

2607
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I personally like the white space

2608
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
because I am inherently lazy

2609
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
because like when I code an html

2610
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
it's a mess

2611
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
and I have to force myself to go back in after

2612
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
and format it so the fact that python

2613
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
forces good behavior

2614
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
shit in order

2615
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
or you're an idiot and it's not going to work

2616
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I like that aspect

2617
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I suppose you could kind of consider it

2618
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
training reels but whatever

2619
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
it's I find it kind of nice

2620
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
so whatever

2621
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
the other hand is like when I code an html

2622
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
tons of times I forget to close the bracket

2623
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
and nothing runs and I have to look through it

2624
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
everywhere trying to find where the bracket isn't

2625
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
for a present

2626
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
indeed

2627
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
you're fucked either way

2628
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
before the record I am in fact a professional

2629
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
programmer and python is the

2630
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
biggest language I use day to day

2631
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
that in Java but mostly python

2632
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
and you know what I thought might be fun at some point Tom

2633
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I listened to the whole show enjoyed it quite a bit

2634
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I thought that at some point maybe be fun

2635
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
especially since you're doing python

2636
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
to bring in

2637
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
my code that I made for the

2638
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
PCP pay calculator which is pure

2639
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
python

2640
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
dude it's funny that you say that because the last episode

2641
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
we just recorded last night

2642
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I said I wonder when we're going to get to the

2643
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
point when we could make the

2644
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
PCP pay calculator yes

2645
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
that's a and Munchy said he wants

2646
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
to try and recreate it

2647
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
in his spare time to see if he can do it

2648
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
he should I'd be happy to provide just finished

2649
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
version like 1.5

2650
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
the other day which

2651
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
incorporates now individual

2652
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
this wasn't in the in the functions before

2653
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
but now you can

2654
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
attach a minor or major penalty

2655
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
not only to editors but to

2656
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
participants in the episode for degrees of

2657
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
lateness so now that's a function

2658
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
that's in there that I was using for the last one

2659
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
because this was an issue

2660
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
anyway we can talk about that later I just

2661
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
like talking about this a little bit

2662
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
code is cool and I'm excited

2663
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
to learn more python I like it so far

2664
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
and to be honest I looked at C sharp

2665
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
because like the tutorials for

2666
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
like Godot they have a toggle where you can

2667
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
look at the code in C sharp or python

2668
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
or Judy script and

2669
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
C sharp looked really scary and python

2670
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
looked

2671
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
not scary so I've never used C sharp

2672
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
so I don't know about it

2673
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
all right it's in my code

2674
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
let's go to the next one

2675
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
this is from JustJapGirls

2676
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
on Bowie

2677
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
is the full name

2678
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
let's see what he's got

2679
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
okay so this question is for

2680
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Nate and I'm going to Japan

2681
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
for summer

2682
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
oh yeah

2683
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
see the new one this film

2684
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
and my question is what is the best

2685
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
length of time to be in Japan under two weeks

2686
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
because I don't have money

2687
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
for more than two weeks

2688
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
to get a good grasp of Japan

2689
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
yeah

2690
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
okay this is a preposterous question

2691
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
did you just use the whole two weeks?

2692
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
yeah the question was

2693
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
how much of a length of time

2694
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
under two weeks

2695
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
is the best amount of time

2696
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
to like get to know Japan

2697
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
all of it

2698
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
just use the two weeks

2699
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
okay I don't know

2700
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
if there's like some larger point there

2701
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I could imagine that like

2702
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I think he means bang for your buck ratio

2703
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
like what is the best?

2704
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
no what he means is that

2705
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
if he stays there for like five or six days

2706
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
it'll be okay but once you get over that

2707
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
people are going to start to notice that he's not Asian

2708
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
and they're going to start heckling him

2709
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
so he's going to have to get out of dodge quick

2710
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
it's one of those things

2711
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
where like

2712
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
potentially he could go for two weeks

2713
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
but if he could save money

2714
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and go for a little less time

2715
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and see basically the same amount of stuff

2716
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
he would rather go for less time

2717
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
how big of

2718
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
how much of Japan is he planning to explore

2719
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
that's the important part

2720
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
that's what I was going to say

2721
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
you don't need to be in Tokyo for one in a week probably

2722
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
so I spent all my time in Tokyo

2723
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
with one trip to

2724
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Kuro Tamago mountain

2725
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I forget what it is

2726
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
like I don't fucking know Japan very well

2727
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I was there one time for like two months

2728
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
and I

2729
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
lived in the city and I kind of know what that's like

2730
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
a little bit but

2731
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
basically I can't help you there

2732
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
but I'll just tell you what I tell everybody

2733
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
go check out the dope unlabeled restaurants

2734
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
just go in and explore

2735
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
go to Akihabara because why the fuck not

2736
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
and go to the side shops

2737
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
just do some research

2738
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
just look up shit that you're interested in

2739
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
you won't understand Japan after two weeks

2740
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
by flanderizing Akihabara video

2741
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
because shit tons of people

2742
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
who either live in Japan or have been there

2743
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
commented on that

2744
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
and weighed in with not only their impressions

2745
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
of Akihabara but also like what other places

2746
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
you can go to get cheaper merchants

2747
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
that was a truly fascinating video did you

2748
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
which I absolutely loved

2749
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
for some reason I thought that was

2750
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
a super bunny hop video

2751
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
it did not look like that

2752
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I copied his writing style on purpose sometimes

2753
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
sometimes I try to talk like bunny hop

2754
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
you didn't put epic noodles

2755
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
going up and down meme though

2756
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
oh yeah how could I have left that

2757
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I don't know if that's in Akihabara though

2758
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
oh really okay

2759
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
alright next call

2760
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000

2839
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
who was in tough times

2840
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000

2841
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
hey PCP I think a thank you's

01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000

2843
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000

2844
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
you also

2845
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000

2846
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
oh right the digi's advice

2847
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
and it worked I breaded all my meat

2848
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
and that's one food you can't steal

2849
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
and uh

2850
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
pipa was the real man the real MVP

2851
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I scheduled everything in my house and not only did I

2852
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
schedule it but just in case

2853
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
he was on time one in a million

2854
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I made sure I was early to everything

2855
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
so well there's absolutely no fucking way he could

2856
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
do anything so

2857
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
just wanted to say thanks to you guys and I guess

2858
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000

hear just a down home American white guy voice

2871
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000

hey that explains a lot

2895
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
like that all

2896
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
before

2897
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I had my second beer

2898
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
ever today

2899
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000

oh yeah I'm like

2903
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I think like 10

2904
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
10 drinks and

2905
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
something along those lines

2906
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
beer

2907
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,280
wine and shots I don't know what to split we gotta get this guy to start

2908
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:09,600
watching I am games but you're right I've got a suggestion to you guys okay you

2909
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:18,760
guys should give mage a button that when she presses it and it's everyone else

2910
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:28,120
in that way she can say things and she's she's the most relatable and

2911
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:36,400
important person really in the PCP you all should respect her more he relates to

2912
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:40,280
like scrapping in the streets of Lithuania with like angry squirrels or

2913
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:43,960
whatever her story was like he relates to this like amorphous color-based

2914
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:48,160
creature with no definable characteristics how you know you're drunk

2915
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:56,080
you relate to mage well that was sweet nonetheless well we'll try to give old

2916
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:01,480
mage you know give her give her a roll give mage a solo podcast we'll leave

2917
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:06,600
and let her the legendary solo PCP podcast will just be one problem because

2918
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:11,040
major solo podcast you just dream about it and that'd be it oh that's true that's

2919
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:16,600
true oh okay next one two more people this is from the anti-procrastinator is

2920
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:24,600
here oh shit are getting shit done man let's see what he's got all right news

2921
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:29,120
our solutions are pretty cool so just one little problem with them that's sad

2922
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:34,320
everyone waits till fucking January to start on what the fuck are you doing stop

2923
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:40,240
procrastinating starting girls right the fuck now he's got a good point he's got

2924
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:43,640
a great point personally though I try to wrap everything up before the end of the

2925
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:48,400
year so that I have a clean slate to do the new thing you know that yeah well my

2926
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:53,440
favorite thing to do is to get rid of obligations by January yeah yeah that's

2927
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:57,680
good that's good for me it's like I usually I really like the idea of

2928
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:01,720
thinking of things in terms of years just like I like having clear cutoffs the

2929
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:05,240
way I do my job is always like what do I have to get done by the end of this month

2930
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:10,440
you know yeah so like I always have that mentality of like okay everything has to

2931
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:15,680
be clear by the time the next increment starts so that we can you know we can

2932
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:20,480
hit the ground running and just do the whole new plan you know yeah it's it's

2933
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:26,080
a lot more difficult like even if you have a good plan if you're still supposed

2934
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:30,080
to be doing other things while your new plan is supposed to be implemented you

2935
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,320
like I guess like I should do the thing I said I would do but I still got to do

2936
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:39,480
this oh geez and then you you die I've never really been a big news resolution

2937
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:45,400
guy which I guess is probably weird for me but I don't know it just like I mean

2938
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:49,040
I guess I don't want to just like pretend like I'm so glad like well I just do

2939
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,360
everything immediately I'm so good just for whatever reason the whole new

2940
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:55,880
year's resolution thing I think it's the same thing for me right it's with

2941
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:59,280
holidays I just don't even like the end of the year doesn't even register to me

2942
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:04,920
I'll be like somebody yeah like oh my god it's the next year you know I just set

2943
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:09,120
all of my I kind of wish I did my new year's resolutions are just like a

2944
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:17,360
reasonably doable but kind of extreme goal for that year so like make a hundred

2945
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:21,200
thousand dollars this year it's like there's a chance it could happen there's

2946
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:25,680
a chance it won't happen it's good to move in on how things go but like that's

2947
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:30,240
this is where I'm trying to be you know if I fail I just make the same thing the

2948
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:35,400
next year until it works I make sense yeah but if I would have like a new year's

2949
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:42,920
resolution I don't often do but like I've been thinking 2019 is gonna be the

2950
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:49,440
year of music where I finally get around to all the music stuff to do so I will

2951
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:54,120
make albums I will make attempts to learn how to produce myself properly and

2952
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:58,280
record myself well and get better at certain instruments I'm okay at drums

2953
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:02,200
but I just need to get a little better before I can you know lay down some sick

2954
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:09,040
beats and all that maybe I'll even pick up FL studio again even though I hate it

2955
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:13,120
and I don't like it and it sucks and I would rather hit things with my drum

2956
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:18,560
sticks than click buttons to make the same thing happen much easier yeah but

2957
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,680
yeah that that's the year of music if it's the year if it's a whole year of

2958
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:26,480
like one thing then if I don't know what I'm doing or I finished a project and I

2959
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,800
don't know what to do next I know at least that it's the year of music I can

2960
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:34,240
do I can work on the next just like the year of Luigi that's our Nintendo yeah

2961
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:40,640
yeah the year of Sanji the year of my maybe I'll maybe I'll make an effort to

2962
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:46,120
kind of get into it more this year like I'm thinking of just making red to a into

2963
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:51,160
a thing where like I run every day for that year and then I like track my

2964
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:55,960
progress and like see what's changed over that time you gain 365 pounds in

2965
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:00,920
yeah exactly exactly I don't know and that's not that's not the currency this

2966
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:04,280
time and I've got I mean I've got some some big events happening in my life

2967
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:09,640
coming up hopefully relatively soon but I don't know I'll think about it I'll

2968
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:13,520
think about it as I go anyway let's get to our next fucking call here oh this is

2969
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:24,360
our last one too from oblivion fall not mad just passionate is the full I don't

2970
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:29,040
know okay let's oblivion go we can spend an age discussing the multitude of

2971
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:34,080
reasons why going to college for art is a waste of time no already art degree is

2972
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:38,480
worthless the only thing that matters is your portfolio and connections and

2973
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:43,880
college is really not necessary for that this is especially true if you are

2974
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:48,920
already an artist with an established presence I went no we don't need this

2975
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:53,320
anymore this is done this interesting course I was the top of my class and

2976
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:59,960
the only thanks I got was a worthless degree and $20,000 worth of debt but I

2977
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:05,960
am against a munchy going to college if munchy wants to go to college he could

2978
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:12,760
do great because I'm doing great I am only 23 years old yet despite college

2979
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:17,080
holding me back for two years I managed to emigrate from New Zealand to the

2980
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:22,560
United States of America I have a green card I am now happily married to a

2981
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,920
beautiful wife I am earning four thousand dollars a month working two dream

2982
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:32,840
jobs doing animation and animation directing on YouTube the products of

2983
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:39,360
which have earned over 250 million views that is more than all of your

2984
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:45,520
channels including side channels combined if I can do it anyone can fucking do

2985
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:49,280
it certainly munchy can do it he's a talented kid he's got a bright future

2986
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:53,120
ahead of him stop filling his head with doom and gloom he's going to be fine

2987
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:58,760
have faith in him interesting is that the fact that we had faith in him the

2988
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:04,000
reason we didn't want him to go to college well there's an maybe so I

2989
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,400
noticed one thing in that story that stands out as strange to me so his whole

2990
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:13,560
point is that you can you know like do just fine go into college and then be an

2991
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:19,640
artist whatever but but he frames it as you can overcome the setback that is

2992
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:24,800
going to college why so why encourage college if it's a setback why would you

2993
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:33,560
do that it isn't it's hired I was funny I gotta think that the funny thing for me

2994
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:38,080
is that like college is great it opens up all these opportunities I have 250

2995
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:44,320
million views on YouTube yeah YouTube well to be fair to be fair I think he's

2996
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,080
talking about like obviously he wasn't the only person working on these

2997
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:50,840
projects so is it really fair to say that he obtained every one of those views

2998
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:54,200
