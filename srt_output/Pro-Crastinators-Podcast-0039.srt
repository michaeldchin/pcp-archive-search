00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today is my graduation, I've done my dissertation. Even got a hat I can't bow.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is my graduation, I'm on the education. Doesn't learn a thing anyway.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I am the best guy ever. And we're here, I'm here with these guys to talk about stuff again.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here is Ben Saint. Hello everybody. And here is The Hippocrit. Hello everybody.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And here is The Mumkey Man. Hello everybody. What? You all owe me a dollar.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's a copyrighted phrase. That's the meme that made Ben Saint the man he is today on the internet.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So today's theme is, today's topic is exclusion. That's the real topic.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's bits of news, there's some exciting news people, which is kind of why I want to do this today.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And it is that both me and Mr. Mumkey Jones have both finished our college experiences.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We have gotten our degrees, mine's coming on like Monday or something, but we're done.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We have just finished our secondary education. Round of applause please.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
My graduation was actually earlier today, this morning.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh really? It was a shit show.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going full Kanye West and not going to my graduation.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I wish I had that option. My parents made me go.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know, if I was, I'm sure if I was like a reasonable human being like you I'm sure, and had like completed it within the relevant time frame and done it.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, he just said he wouldn't go unless it's, except that he has to for obligations.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's right. I've risen, I'm beyond obligations related to school at this point. I've transcended.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But nonetheless, so the reason why Ben and Gibbon here are because they too have gotten their secondary education degrees.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And we tried to get in everybody who had actually finished, who had finished college.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So that'd be, I believe Tom and Jeff.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where is Tom by the way?

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Tom is busy and didn't want to get his mic.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He and him were just having a real shitty Twitter argument that went on forever and was a complete nightmare for everyone.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Tom has time to tweet endlessly at work, but he doesn't want to like go get his microphone because it's at home or something.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Because he orders at work or something.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It was about, it was about art and whether it's the artists, it got out of my control really fast.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But it was intended to be, it was the point was that at work of art, if it has to be explained to get its message across, then that's a failure.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's the whole, the joker says, if I have to explain the joke, there is no joke.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I think that, and how I think it's the artist's responsibility to convey with their work.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And that if they, if you can't, you can't blame the audience if they don't get it.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The thing that everybody's getting confused about in that argument is that failure is not necessarily a bad thing.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, everyone thinks that what I'm saying is, oh, if, if you, the artist, don't make your work 100% accessible to 100% of the audience, if you don't dumb down your work, then you're a failure as an artist, which is just so not what I'm saying.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, well, I mean, okay, it sounds like this.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We don't need to talk about this at length.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right, there's, there's some nuance there.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not, I'm not sure where I'd land without thinking about some more, but this is not Ben's Twitter drama podcast.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm just saying the procrastinator's podcast.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We're trying to, trying to talk about how we ruined our lives through various things.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Now we're rising from the ashes like a beautiful Phoenix now.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So, um, let's, uh,

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, that's right.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I've been, I don't know whether Ben has been to like a ceremony with a hat and stuff.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ben has. I was there. I was at Ben's.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, I did. I had a very traditional college experience.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Nate, please tell me you have pictures of Ben in the full wardrobe.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, I'm sure we do somewhere.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, I'm sure they're around.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll have to talk to my parents and, uh,

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hell yeah.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, I mean, I actually know what, I don't care. Share whatever.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Show me in my goddamn, um, mortarboard.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The, the one thing I, I bet you're sexy as hell wearing that hat.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, the mortarboard, motorboard, mortarboard.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, that's what, motorboard.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The one thing I liked about the, the ceremony is that, I mean, it was boring and whatever.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I didn't care.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It was expensive because you had to rent the things to, to wear.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But while I walked across the stage, I was confident and I tipped my hat to the audience

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and people said, oh.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And it was all, it was all cool and I was,

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Did you fit that hat on your hair hippo?

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The hat looked absolutely terrible with my hair.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sure.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Was it kind of floating like a foot above where it's supposed to be?

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, I bet he just squished down the top.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And it was all squished down the top.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, yeah, I have picture.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, I got, you have to, you had to take a, you had to pay for like a professional photographer

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to take the picture with you standing in front of a pretend bookcase, holding a pretend thing.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And it was really fake and I really didn't like it and it was really expensive,

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
but my parents paid for it so I don't give a shit.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But the photo itself is absolutely awful.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I want to see that.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Nate, can I pitch an idea to you right now?

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sure.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I want a picture of hippo in his graduation shit and a picture of Ben

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and I want the audience to vote for who looks more dapper.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That sounds good.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It might be tough to get those, but...

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I look good.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My crazy hair just does not work with a classical school aesthetic.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's what makes you dapper.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It makes you a distinguished gentleman.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
When you get older, you're probably going to look just like Claudio from Cohen and Camry.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know what the biggest hair in the game?

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know what I'm talking about? That guy?

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That guy is the coolest.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I always think you look like Danny from Game Grumps.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, yeah, maybe that.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Only...

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
More small.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
SMOL, as Mage would say.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Small.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So okay, who's got feelings about having graduated?

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'd like to put out how there's a...

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I mean, in my case, it might be a little different because I found my job and did all my shit

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
before I finished my degree and so now that I have it, my only goal in life is to leave that job

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
because it was kind of backwards for me.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I got my job and part of that was saying that I'd get the degree

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
because you're worth more to your company once you have your degree.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It was also something I promised my parents and it's sort of like an insurance policy or whatever.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But my goal is only to leave, to no longer be doing these things and to do this shit.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I assume that's not the case for you guys and most of the people.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, I did get a bunch of jobs directly related to my degree after I got it for like a couple of weeks.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Should we all say what degrees we got?

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, good idea. Let's do those real quick. Let's run down.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Monkey, you go first.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I wish I didn't introduce it because I'm ashamed, but I...

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Originally, I wanted to be an English teacher, either high school or middle school,

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
so I was going English major with a minor in education.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then when I was signing up for student teaching, I realized that it was terrifying and I hated it.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So now I am graduating with just an English degree and nothing else.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So it's terrible.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a nightmare.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Wait, what were you originally going for?

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I was going to be a teacher.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, so you were going to get like a teaching certification or something.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My buddy John was also an English major and he's done some like copywriting work,

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
but it's basically worthless.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He's really just thinking about going back now to get like a computer science degree or something.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, fuck that. I'm not going back for shit.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My buddy Scotty was...

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He finished his degree as a...

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Fuck, what was it?

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Music, like a music guy.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He just did like a music major at TCNJ where we went.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And then he just...

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He was like half a semester away from finishing that degree and just decided this was a waste of time.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm just going back, taking all the computer science classes like my buddy Nate did

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and everybody else and just did it and just didn't even finish the first one.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But it was smart. I mean, he ended up...

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He did save money by doing it that way, but...

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Poor guy.

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Anyway, I'm sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So let's go, Gib, could you tell us what your degree was?

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I got a degree in animation.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think...

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, that's just what it was called.

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was just animation.

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I did three films over three years.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Can we watch these films anywhere?

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You can go to give and take...

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
youtube.com slash give and take and they're on the front page.

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, hell yeah.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
They're all great by the way.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Those were done for your school in or whatever, I forget.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Spiders are people too.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The tallest man and what's the other one?

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The fish at the door.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I love them all.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm going to go comment on them right now so then everybody will go there from this podcast

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and give me a bunch of upvotes on my comment.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Good idea.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a currency that really matters these days.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hell yeah, fucking upvotes.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Ben, could you tell us your degree please?

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, yes sir.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I got a Bachelor of Arts with a major in physics and a minor in philosophy.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, I thought you double majored.

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I did not, wait.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh shit, you're right, I did double major.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Fuck.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Four years of your life and you forgot.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The philosophy major is like the most requirements light.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It had like half the credits requirements of the physics part.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Most of it is just answering the question, what is a philosophy major?

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I took like one or two classes in it each semester so it felt like a minor

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
because I was doing so much less work for it.

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's cool.

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But you mean you fished in four years and you were done.

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I did finish four years.

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yep, I had a very traditional, got in, spent four years and got out when I was supposed to.

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And, Mumki, did you also just do it in four years?

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I did it in three and a half years.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's okay, so you, alright.

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Because I was supposed to spend my last semester student teaching but I dropped that so I had enough credits to graduate early.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've never understood what the fuck is a semester?

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's half a year.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay, it's real simple.

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Every school year, I mean summers are, you know, exempt and there's like a short winter break,

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but there's two semesters a year from around September to around the start of December

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and then I believe sometime in January, at the end of January, until May.

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And those are just two semesters and within those you take usually around four classes,

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
so you take like 80 years and you do that for four years basically and you get your degree for the most part.

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
See, it feels kind of weird, I mean the semester is like just a term that you know, you use.

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But the idea that you take multiple classes or you get majors and minor things,

193
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
like I don't know whether that's a thing over here, maybe it is.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's because you went to like a technical school basically, right, where you did like one thing.

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It was a creative school and I just did animation and that's it.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well see, that sounds, I mean, I wasn't talking about my experience.

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's like a typical liberal arts degree program.

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I know it's just different in different countries, but I think that like the way it works in America,

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
at least in my experience, is that you go to college and you only declare a major like later.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Sometimes you can declare right away, but you don't have to.

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can spend time not knowing what your degree is for and then like after a year or two you decide what your degree major is.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Alright, let me tell you my degree real quick.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And that's what your degree is in.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, well did you have another question about that, Gib?

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know, it just seems weird because like the only reason you'd go to university is to do a specific thing it feels like.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh no Gib, no no no, you don't know how America works now.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You go to college just to go to college.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, that's right.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Ask backwards as you would say.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's backwards, alright.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay, well let me just tell you mine.

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So I'll be getting a bachelor's of science with a major in computer science and minors in interactive multimedia and of course Japanese.

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Do you speak any Japanese?

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I always sounded like English to me.

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why'd you say something like that?

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
People would know English.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He's the only one.

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I can speak bad Japanese, you know, so I kind of get it.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So Nate went into the STEM field and the three of us wasted our degrees.

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I went into the STEM field, I was fucking physics major.

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, I just heard the philosophy part.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's easy to forget because Ben has no redeeming qualities.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's true.

226
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I majored in physics and then I went and I immediately after college I went and I was a counselor at Astro Camp which required a science degree.

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And then I was like a lab technician at a company that made fucking mirror coatings and I ran tests on samples and shit for like six months.

228
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes indeed.

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
By the way, we're talking about stuff that I got after like job wise.

231
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There was, due to my animations on my channel, somebody came up to me and said, these are funny.

232
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I would like you to write a few scripts for animations that we're working on and I've done those and I've been paid for them.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But I don't really know, like I haven't got any animation work and it's sort of just, that was just a sort of one time thing.

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Did those scripts ever become animations?

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
They pitched them to the things, like they're trying to get pitches together so they can get to a studio say.

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, I was wondering what was going on.

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The latest one is Nick Jr.

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh cool.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah, it's a thing that they're pitching and it's my scripts.

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That would be pretty fucking neat if the show got picked up and you got writing credits, wouldn't it?

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, it was funny. When you were talking about that, like I remember I think me and Digi were like, dude this is the coolest, you have to like do this shit, this is the coolest thing.

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This could be like legit professional animation cartoons that you did.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It would, but you know, it's kind of a long shot.

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, it is quite a long shot. I felt like everyone blew it out of proportion and was saying, oh look, you got a real job now, you're a real boy and I'm like, I don't know.

245
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, but you know, it's just like, okay, let's say that you did that as your job, like you just prepared these scripts for pitches for things.

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
One of those would probably eventually become a show and then it's just like whatever one that happens to be, that would be the one that was like the big breakout success, even if they were all equally good.

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What do you mean one of them would eventually become a show?

248
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, I mean, if you're a guy writing pitches for shows, you would think that at some point.

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Well, if you're writing for like a dozen different shows, but yeah, I mean, isn't that...

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Right, but that's not, we're talking about a particular company came and was like, write us a few scripts and we will pitch them with our show or something.

251
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, they had ideas for shows and they just brought me on to help write because they saw that I could do comedy.

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, all I know about it is, is that if Hippo did get a show on Nick Jr., then maybe did you would do an 18 episode series dissecting it?

253
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hippocrates show sucks. Part one.

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's gay.

256
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We gotta check out this new children's show. It looks pretty deep.

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, children's shows are deep, dude.

258
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, that's a good question. Hippo, did they pitch it to the hub?

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, the hub is dead, Ben. The hub is dead. It's something else now. It's like Disney.

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Disney XD.

261
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm trying to think. There was other ones when, I think, there was a bunch of things that they were pitching to that rejected them.

262
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Can I say the name of the company? Is that cool?

263
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't think...

264
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Well, I'm asking Hippo.

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, I can't remember the name of the company is...

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well, the one that I remember, can I say it? Is that okay?

267
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, sure.

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Wasn't it like Dragon Bee or something? Like Bee Dragon?

269
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's the name of the animation studio that hired me for that.

270
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And they were trying to pitch it to big studios that would help fund and produce it and publish it and all that.

271
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But they're just a small-ish studio that are making stuff.

272
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You did not get that as a result of education. You got that because your work was out there on YouTube and these people liked your stuff.

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, that is true, but I wouldn't have made those animations had I not gone to university.

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah, that's fair.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I like the time I spent there. I learned a lot of things, which has helped my YouTube as well as just, you know, animating.

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Can I tell a little of my story?

277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Wait, I just want to say that in addition to those real jobs that I had, sort of real jobs, I've also done a lot of work tutoring physics, mostly online, which is a field that there's always demand for.

278
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So, yeah, and I may continue to do that at some point in the future. Hopefully not. Hopefully I'll never need to do it again.

279
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
When was the last time that you were doing that?

280
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I haven't done it in quite a while, although maybe a couple months ago I was popping in here and there and like just doing like one or two lessons, just, I don't know, make a couple bucks.

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Ben, do you feel like your study of philosophy has helped you a lot with your comics?

282
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
With my comics?

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah, like trying to, you know, having a deep thing to say with them and all that. I'm being serious.

284
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think, this is going to sound so pretentious.

285
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Well, it's coming from Ben, so.

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, so of course. I think that your studying philosophy helped me understand just shit in general better and I think it informs my worldview a bunch in a lot of ways.

287
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And so I don't think, well, I wouldn't say that it's had a direct influence on any of my work. It did make me a different person and that has influenced things.

288
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That doesn't sound that pretentious. That seems pretty reasonable.

289
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I feel like philosophy is one of those subjects where people can go through it and they can get a passing grade, but there will be some people who understand what they, you know, will take on what the whole thing has taught them and use it in their normal life.

290
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And then there will be other people who will just, they will pass, but they will not understand what the hell they just did.

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I think you could come away from like a formal philosophy education with like wildly different understandings of what it is you just learned.

292
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah.

293
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's probably a good thing though, right? You wouldn't want everybody, like the whole point of philosophy is to think for yourself, right? You don't want everybody thinking the same way.

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It is true, but I don't like pretentious people and there's a lot of philosophy people that seem really pretentious and I like them.

295
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I mean, I know it's not everyone.

296
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I got into it because of totally pretentious reasons. I just thought it seemed like a thing that smart people would know about.

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I was like, I want to be a smart guy.

298
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I think philosophy is really cool and I would have, my entered in it if I was thinking that far ahead.

299
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't really know what would be involved in that kind of, I mean, I think about philosophical stuff kind of a lot, I guess.

300
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's one of the things like I hear about like degrees in philosophy and I'm like, well, I can be philosophical, you know, just thinking about stuff without having a degree, but you could do that with any degree.

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah, I was just going to say, you can learn anything that they teach you in college. You can learn it elsewhere, but yeah.

302
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, the intro class I took for philosophy was just reading, you know, things by Plato, things about Socrates, that kind of stuff, stuff that you can just buy yourself and read.

303
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah, totally.

304
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Well, you know, higher level classes in that were stuff like, they got into more like specific things like the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of language.

305
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And, you know, there would be a lot of readings from like, you know, contemporary philosophers on, and it was all like, it's all discussion with no conclusion, really.

306
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Right.

307
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I mean, there are conclusions. Some people have come to their own conclusions, but like it's all debatable, you know, like you can form your own theories about these things if you want to.

308
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's not like science where like, you know, you learn what it is, and then there it is. And maybe this is all obvious, I don't know.

309
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Well, it certainly makes sense, but it does sound like there were things that were gained from your education here, and Gibbs seemed to be expressing the same sentiment.

310
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
How about you, Mumpke, what do you feel like you gained from your experience at university?

311
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, I learned a lot about what it takes to be a good author, and that's been a passion of mine since I was like 11, was to write things.

312
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So even though I didn't really get...

313
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Did you do a lot of creative writing?

314
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I did. My senior project, I decided to do a creative project, and it ended up being like 55 pages.

315
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But what's cool about the senior project is that all of the professors in that area read it.

316
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So all of the English professors had to read it, and then I went into a defense where I had to defend my project and explain...

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's like some PhD shit, like our dad had to be on.

318
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, yeah, pretty much. And they would ask me questions, and I'd have to defend my project, and I did very well, and I'm happy about it, and I'm hoping I can turn it into a full novel.

319
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So I guess that's what I'll get out of my degree.

320
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Like, what was the project? Are you comfortable?

321
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah, yeah. Well, you guys know me. It's inspired by Elliot Rodger, of course, because it's the only thing I ever talk about.

322
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But it was a portion of another work that I've... like a novel that I've been working on.

323
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Was it a 55-page suicide note? They're like, wow, this is pretty well thought out.

324
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You really made it so that the people that you left behind are gonna be okay with your suicide. That's good.

325
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I thought you were gonna say like, oh, you've really painted a portrait of a madman here, and you're just like, yeah, yeah, that's right, painted a portrait.

326
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You guys are joking, but it's almost completely true, everything that you're saying.

327
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It was a manifesto of a school shooter.

328
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
A fictional one, though.

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Well, sure, I mean.

330
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But borrowing from Elliot Rodger.

331
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Right now it's fiction, but I've got big plans, people, big plans.

332
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm just saying it was like a character piece, right?

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Exactly.

334
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But yeah, I'm hoping to publish it soon, even if I just have to publish it myself and let everybody check it out.

335
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay, but now question.

336
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Sure.

337
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
How much did that cost? How much was your education? I mean, you don't have to tell me the exact number, but I'm just wondering, so was it worth the investment, do you feel?

338
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, you guys might get mad at me, but I got the presidential scholarship at my college, so I had to pay almost nothing.

339
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, shit.

340
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What do you have to do to get that?

341
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It was based off of my high school GPA and other things I did in high school.

342
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That's a pretty good deal.

343
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I mean, I can't be mad, I can just be pissed off.

344
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, people get worked up over college debt, and I feel you, even though I don't have that much.

345
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's why I was voting for Bernie, you know, a little beneath that fucking college debt.

346
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah.

347
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That's Jill Stein.

348
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Okay, well, that's interesting.

349
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So you've got like almost no debt now? You're pretty much good?

350
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, pretty much. My biggest debt is my fucking rent.

351
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

352
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I wish I had picked a cheaper college. I don't know why. I had like, I don't know, the college that I picked to go to, I guess it just fit my vision for what a college should look like, and that's why I wanted to go to it, even though it was way more expensive.

353
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I could have gone to a state college and paid like a fraction of what I did.

354
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Picking out a college is such a fucking trap for the kid doing it, because it's always going to go the same way.

355
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You're going to see a college, and you're going to say, wow, this looks nice, and then you're going to think of like your future there, and like, oh, I'm going to spend four years.

356
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And then when it gets to the price, and it's going to be huge, and it's going to say, well, you know what, I can just take out fucking loans, because this is where my future lies.

357
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is like where my life's going to be. I'm going to build a future, and I don't have to worry about that debt for like fucking 50 years when I die.

358
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So it's just, there's no way you can make like a thorough, well thought out decision about like what your money is going to get you.

359
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
When you're fucking 18, I mean, if we were fucking, you know, like World War II era guys, like we just came back, and we're trying to pick a college.

360
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
At that point, you know, like you're probably mature enough to make a good decision about this shit, but we're all, you know, fucking rich white kids basically.

361
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Fucking sheltered millennial 18-year-olds.

362
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, that's right.

363
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And it's all lies. When you go on a tour, it's all lies. They treat you like you're going to be the most special snowflake at that school, and everything's going to be great.

364
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And then the first fucking day that you're a real student, it goes to shit, and they don't care.

365
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I mean, those girls wouldn't even date me. They just date those fucking chads.

366
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I thought it was part of my fucking degree audit.

367
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Even though I'm so beautiful, and I'm such a distinguished gentleman, they just don't, they don't come.

368
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Oh, no.

369
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Did you just say Santa Barbara, dude? You gotta use the USB.

370
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah, you know, I don't want to talk about my specific history here.

371
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I guess this is a good segue into, like, what, like, the life of being a college boy is like for everyone.

372
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's a big change from high school.

373
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You, monkey, you mentioned it being worse than high school, almost, or maybe.

374
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, he did.

375
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That is totally not my experience.

376
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah.

377
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
When I'm all fucking sexy like you, Ben, getting laid every night, fuck.

378
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I mean, I can respect that. I have to give you that one.

379
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There's a reason why midway through college I started making mumkey anime reviews instead of going to parties.

380
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah.

381
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You know what, my experience was that there were no parties, because I didn't know the kind of people who had them and hung out an anime club instead.

382
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That sounds way better.

383
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
College was a pretty lonely time for me.

384
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I had my good buddies, but I did, and like, well, this was like the first three years.

385
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
My last year was a totally different experience than my first three years, which were hanging out with my buddies who were, to this day, some of my best friends.

386
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You talking about anime, playing video games, some of the happiest times of my life where we're just hanging out with those guys.

387
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But was not having the kind of life that I felt I expected to have, you know, like meeting lots of new people and doing those things.

388
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
A lot of it, I'm sure, was my fault.

389
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And then, the summer of my, after a third year, I went to Japan.

390
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Oh fuck.

391
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I just went completely insane and just became a hedonistic monster doing things that would definitely get me arrested in America.

392
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And then when I came back, I was a self-described fuck machine.

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I just wanted to do these things and I achieved those goals.

394
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And I'm a little sad that I've lost some of that fire just because I've been focusing.

395
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I've diverted my sex passion from that stuff into making anime videos on the internet.

396
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Nate, I'm empathizing so hard right now.

397
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah.

398
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
How so?

399
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, my college experience was I got there and I was lucky enough, I found, I got a girlfriend in the first month there.

400
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Fuck you.

401
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I know.

402
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I don't know how it happened.

403
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I had a girlfriend for like three years and it was very nice and lovely.

404
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And then I ended that relationship my senior year.

405
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And my senior year was just, my senior year was just this crazy time, this crazy time of just being a, like, just a complete slob.

406
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Just not giving a fuck about anything.

407
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That's when you became the king of fives, right?

408
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
It was just a wild fucking orgy every day.

409
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
No, it's not true, but it is true.

410
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I fucked random girls all the time.

411
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
God damn it, turn them off.

412
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It was beautiful.

413
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And now I'm like, yeah, now I'm like mad.

414
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Now it makes me mad because I'm not in a position to live like that anymore.

415
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And like, I would.

416
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't know.

417
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I feel like, I don't know, I just don't, I don't have like a social, there's not that atmosphere in my life right now where like I can be out like mingling with people.

418
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That's all I want.

419
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I want to move to a city so that I can have a lifestyle where I'm going out and meeting people and socializing with people.

420
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So that I can be fucking doing things with my life.

421
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's why I hate it here in Virginia Beach.

422
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Because it's not, I don't know.

423
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I understand.

424
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I know it's kind of pathetic.

425
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I know it's kind of pathetic to look back, you know, with fondness on your younger years and be like, ah, those were the days.

426
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But yeah, senior year of college was probably the good old days for me.

427
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I'd like to get back there sometime.

428
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Same, same for me.

429
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, it was in the sense that I was, in terms of socializing, was definitely the peak of my whole life.

430
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But in other ways, obviously it was worse.

431
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I didn't even make videos about anime.

432
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I mean, come on, what the fuck?

433
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
That's the killer.

434
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Well, my college uni experience was, I mean, my whole school experience has kind of been like a steady,

435
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
very slow incline of getting better.

436
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Mostly because I just, over time, got better at talking to people.

437
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Like I had one or two friends in primary school, as a little boy.

438
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
In secondary school, I had one or two friends early on.

439
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But as Facebook and mobile phones became a thing, I didn't really catch onto that.

440
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And I sort of drifted away because I wasn't keeping, you know, contact with people.

441
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So by the end of secondary school, I had no friends.

442
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And then I was really depressed and I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life.

443
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Wait, what age is this we're talking about?

444
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's like 13.

445
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
This would be the end of high school age.

446
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So 18, 17.

447
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah.

448
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I took a year off because I was too scared to go into university.

449
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Because I thought it was just going to be the same bullshit school that doesn't actually teach you anything and whatever.

450
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But that was worse because my parents got mad at me for just not doing anything, not looking for work.

451
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And I didn't want to work.

452
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So I went to college for a year and I met some arty people.

453
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And it was kind of cool, but it was, you know, it was different because it was like people who just did art.

454
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And it was a foundation thing.

455
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I was friends with a couple of those people, but it was, they were sort of not really my people.

456
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
They were normie-ish and they were into different sort of things, but it was nice.

457
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I was making friends on my own, starting from scratch.

458
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So after that year, I went on to university for an animation degree.

459
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And since it was animation, there are a lot of people there who liked Egoraptor, John Tron, Game Grumps, Total Biscuit,

460
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
all the sort of internet things that I liked and I gravitated towards those people.

461
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And those are like my best friends that I've ever had in a school setting.

462
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Really, like my best real life friends I've ever made.

463
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And I'm still talking to them because it was over time where I was, technology was like,

464
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I was all up in that shit with Skype.

465
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So I could actually stay contacting with them and it's just been, it's just got better and better.

466
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So for me, college, university, that was the best time and it's just continuing to be the best time.

467
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Even though it's finished, we're still talking, we're still playing games.

468
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Are those the guys you play Minecraft with and World of Woe Craft?

469
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes and yes.

470
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I hate them.

471
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Well, we don't play Minecraft because we're Minecrafters.

472
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I know that you're a 12-year-old kid, fucking logging on a mom's PC to go play Minecraft with your friends from school.

473
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I probably would if I was a 12-year-old when Minecraft was big.

474
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah, me too.

475
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But the idea that anything has gotten worse after I left is not true at all.

476
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I mean, during the school years, it was like in that one year where I was doing nothing, where I started making pony videos.

477
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And from there, I made the analysis videos and then I met you guys and then that's just gone.

478
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And it's all downhill from there.

479
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's all uphill.

480
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I like being a video guy and an animator and having lots of friends.

481
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's all great.

482
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Everything's great.

483
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm glad.

484
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yeah, on the subject of friends from school, I would just like to say that almost all the friends that I had,

485
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
literally all the friends that I had in high school and almost all of them from college, I have nothing to do with anymore.

486
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Interesting.

487
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I just haven't held on to any of those except for two.

488
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
There's two friends that I hung out with a lot in college that I used to room with them for a while.

489
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh, yeah.

490
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I had that weird experience of talking to my oldest friends from primary school when we were little kids.

491
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And I was friends with him the whole way through primary school.

492
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And then on Facebook, I was like, I'm friends with him.

493
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I haven't said anything to him for a decade.

494
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And then I just said something to him.

495
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And he was like, oh, hi.

496
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And it was good that I did it, but we never talked after that.

497
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And I guess it's just not going to happen anymore.

498
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Dude, there was this girl that I was sort of involved in in a very kiddie way.

499
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We were sort of dating, I guess, when we were like, we were like 10 or something and Amelia.

500
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And so I messaged her on Facebook, I think.

501
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
This was like two years ago or something.

502
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
But at that time, she had moved to Arizona like 10 years before that.

503
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So we hadn't talked at all.

504
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And we had the most, actually it was kind of a lovely conversation, but it was like, God, I don't know.

505
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
If you guys have read that manga, Oyasumi Poon Poon, there's like, when Poon Poon was a kid and there was that girl, Aiko, who he was like madly in love with him.

506
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It was like his whole world.

507
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Like they were like so tight.

508
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But then years and years later, he sees Aiko again and she's just like some normie girl.

509
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But like she had just fallen away from what he thought.

510
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And actually, as they talk and get to know each other, they kind of break through that and they kind of rekindle like what they had known of each other before.

511
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But if you just stopped that experience when he first met her and thought she was a disgusting normie, that's where I got to.

512
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That's the point that I reached.

513
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Oh, what a joy.

514
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And then she went on a flight around the world and was never heard from again.

515
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That's right.

516
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Oh, Amelia.

517
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah.

518
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The saddest.

519
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The way that's easiest to make you depressed about school is looking at people's Facebook feeds.

520
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Lucky I never go on Facebook, so it's perfect.

521
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah, neither do I.

522
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But it's like I friended them all at the time.

523
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm like, I can't be bothered to delete them.

524
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But then I see that some of them were married, pregnant, graduating.

525
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Dude, my friends are starting to get married now.

526
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's really weird.

527
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's really strange.

528
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Like one of my buddy Michelle has always intended to get married and did and that's perfectly expected.

529
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Nothing weird there.

530
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But now my friend Doug, who has been my friend for a long time, is getting married next year.

531
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And he's like, he's one of my brothers.

532
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I can't believe Doug's getting married.

533
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Doug's getting married like next, I don't know, September or something?

534
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah.

535
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's fucking weird.

536
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But I mean, I like his fiance.

537
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
She's a great person.

538
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So it's nothing against her.

539
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'll be there.

540
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Are you going to object like Shrek?

541
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Stop it!

542
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Don't kick!

543
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Wait, what is, what is, oh god, I'm so ashamed that I forget the actor's name.

544
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But in the graduate, what does he yell?

545
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Mike Myers.

546
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
No, at the end of the graduate.

547
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Eddie Murphy who plays donkey.

548
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
When he rushes into the wedding.

549
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Doesn't he like bang on the glass and he's yelling something?

550
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Oh, I don't know his name.

551
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Stella!

552
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They parroted it in the Simpsons when Grandpa Simpson wants to marry Marge's mom.

553
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
He's like, he's Mrs. Bouvier and he's like banging on the glass in the church.

554
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It doesn't matter.

555
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Dustin Hoffman was yelling the lady's name.

556
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Dustin Hoffman, that's it.

557
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Oh, okay, that's your, yeah.

558
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Anyway, the graduate's 10 to 10 movie.

559
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It was probably Mike Myers.

560
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I thought it was.

561
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Michael Myers, the killer.

562
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
He's just like, through the fucking mask.

563
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Hey, okay, so let me tell, I wanted to talk about my experience of going through college,

564
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
just kind of in general.

565
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Because things, as everybody knows, things did not end with that fourth year of college.

566
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That was a very good time for me.

567
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Things continued on for years until this very week and they'll be over on Monday.

568
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So you weren't there for like seven and a half years or something?

569
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The grand total was eight and a half years.

570
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Eight and a half years.

571
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I am, I am 20.

572
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh God, 26.

573
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah, I'm 26.

574
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That's right.

575
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But yeah, but okay, it was not like I went there the entire full time for eight years.

576
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Okay, so, so I spent four years in the school doing undergraduate stuff and I changed my major a couple times up until sophomore year.

577
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I started out, I wanted to be a doctor when I was a kid, you know, and because I'd watched a lot of blackjack cool anime about a doctor man.

578
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I wanted to do that.

579
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But then like in freshman year of college, I realized that that was too much work.

580
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Ironically, I said, I don't want to be in school for eight years.

581
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That's ridiculous.

582
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That's ridiculous.

583
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I thought there's no way I'd want to waste my life that way.

584
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Jesus.

585
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yeah, I know.

586
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
But anyway, it's not quite that bad as I'll explain.

587
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
That was a bad Dick Masterson impression.

588
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I understood it.

589
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Thank you.

590
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, okay, four years later.

591
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm not as smart as I think I am.

592
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So four years later after that.

593
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You jackass!

594
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Is that one?

595
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I got to the end, right?

596
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That's from the guy's mom, Angelo's mom.

597
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
What? Who are you gay?

598
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Come on.

599
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm sorry to talk over you.

600
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I love you, Maddox.

601
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

602
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Okay.

603
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Four years later, and I reached a point where all my friends were graduating

604
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
because they had done things right,

605
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and I had failed like maybe just like two classes,

606
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
but really the bigger issue was that I still had like eight left,

607
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
which was like two semesters worth.

608
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And so I thought to myself,

609
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
okay, how do I do this?

610
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This was followed by several years of me thinking like,

611
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
oh, I've only got a couple left and I'll be done.

612
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So I'll just take like one this semester and one next semester.

613
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And of course that did.

614
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I took like one per semester.

615
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Over the next eight and a half years it's been,

616
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and some of them didn't even get counted because I fucked up the paperwork in various ways.

617
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I remember a time when it seemed like you were on the cusp of graduating.

618
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah.

619
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay, here's the thing about me.

620
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
When I'm not interested in something,

621
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and I'm sure a lot of people are like this,

622
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
when I'm not interested in something,

623
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I will put like the minimum amount of brain effort into like figuring it out

624
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and like making sure that everything's on track.

625
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So I continually fucked myself up repeatedly thinking like,

626
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
okay, I've only got this, I've only got that.

627
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Okay, I'm done.

628
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
That's enough thinking about that and it'll be fine.

629
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It was not in fact fine.

630
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And I ruined everything for myself for many years.

631
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
But so my actual life during this time was just working like part-time jobs

632
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
as close to full-time as possible, like shitty ones, like stocking shelves.

633
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And I worked at a peer one just like building things

634
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and working behind the counter doing retail and stuff.

635
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It was terrible. It was terrible.

636
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But I believe a year after I had been out of school

637
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and was doing that shitty stuff,

638
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I was taking like one class at a time at various schools in Massachusetts.

639
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That's when Ben suggested that we do a fucking My Little Pony video

640
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and I thought, ah, this is crazy, no one's going to want to see it.

641
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It's all downhill from there.

642
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And it was just because I was in this shitty position,

644
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
because I hadn't finished my degree on time

645
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and was just wasting my life doing this bullshit.

646
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You know, me and Ben were in the same place

647
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and were able to do this, you know, video thing together

648
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
because Ben happened to be home and I was there and we did that.

649
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And just ever since then, I've been, you know, finishing my degree,

650
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
just taking one class at a time and it's been like three years now since then.

651
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And finally, at long last, have reached all the things that were necessary to finish it.

652
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
At that time when we started making videos, wait,

653
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
you were still working on that, you had that first internship, right?

654
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Or was it after that?

655
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I think it was, I don't know, I think it was after that.

656
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Oh, I forgot, the other fucking physics job I had

657
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
was when I was a physics teacher in Poland.

658
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I completely forgot about that whole year of my life.

659
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh yeah, that's true, that's true.

660
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah, and then I had just come back, I had come back from that

661
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and was living with parents because I had no fucking idea what to do with myself.

662
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Right, right.

663
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Yes, and then we made a pony video.

664
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And just ever since that point, I have been saddled with a whole bunch of shit I had to do personally.

665
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Just having to work because I had to pay rent and I had to go to school at the same time

666
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and also wanted to make YouTube videos.

667
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And man, that was a glorious time when we would bust those videos out in one week

668
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
and they were due as soon as possible and we became the guys who got them out first every week.

669
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I remember that very fondly.

670
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It was a glorious time.

671
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm sorry for asking because I'm not as enriched on my Ben and Nate histories.

672
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's cool.

673
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So when you guys made your first video, did you already have an audience or did you guys just, you grew it from scratch?

674
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, it was totally from scratch, yeah.

675
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It was just because you put out videos so consistently and on time that people came and then you grew the audience.

676
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Well, the pony thing was big, so there was an audience waiting.

677
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Anything that was about ponies was guaranteed a few thousand subscribers.

678
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
A certain level of viewership.

679
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

680
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I don't want to go too deep into people's past or whatever because I know you guys are whatever the fuck.

681
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But I know Hippo, I know that your Gibbentake channel has a lot more subs than the Hippo.

682
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So, Nate and Ben, did you guys have a lot more subs on a different channel or just the most you've ever had?

683
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
We did.

684
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Actually, it was just about 17,000 by the end.

685
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
We had, I think we slightly passed Hippo's channel.

686
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
We were always ahead of Hippo once we got ahead.

687
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We guys, like competing against each other or what you guys had?

688
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That was a short period where I was very jealous of the fact that they were all taking me.

689
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But I was jealous because I respected them and I didn't want to feel jealousy, but I did.

690
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Did you already on the scene at this point or were you guys...

691
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh yes, he was around before us.

692
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
He started that whole scene.

693
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
He gave us all the ideas.

694
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh, okay. You guys all ripped off Digi.

695
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
We ripped off the idea of ripping off Digi.

696
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It was already well-worn ground when we got away.

697
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
That's true.

698
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
But we distinguished ourselves amid the thronging mass.

699
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The teaming throng.

700
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes.

701
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Anyway, that was a whole history thing.

702
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I didn't really want to spend that much time on, but...

703
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Sorry, I didn't want to...

704
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
No, that's cool.

705
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I think he's talking about his personal history.

706
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Maybe not.

707
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I just wanted to kind of explain all that so that I could say, when you look at it,

708
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
the things that I'm doing now that I want to do, it's true.

709
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I do have a good job that is based on my education and I'm thankful for that.

710
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But really, I'm also just kind of not liking that because, I mean, if you look at my situation now,

711
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I have this job, it's fine.

712
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But the thing that I really care about doing and that I'm by far the best at in life

713
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
is making these videos and things.

714
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Okay, do you think you would be doing what you're doing now if you had not gone to college?

715
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, I mean, you have to think about it in the full context,

716
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
because we've been making videos for like three years,

717
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
but I mean, I spent eight of those years, you know, it's been a total of eight doing the school stuff.

718
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I mean, if I just hadn't done school, I first of all wouldn't be in massive amounts of debt.

719
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
That'll take me a long time to pay off.

720
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And I wouldn't have had to, you know, kind of waste my time doing this.

721
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I do consider it a waste of time for the most part.

722
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But that's not my question.

723
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I probably wouldn't be doing videos, but who knows what I'd be doing.

724
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It could have been anything.

725
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And the work I'm doing now is totally, I just learned it all myself.

726
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It has nothing to do with any education stuff.

727
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It was totally a separate thing.

728
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So I don't want to say like school is always bad because it's definitely not.

729
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
There are definitely good things you can do and use it for.

730
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But for me, it was a pretty huge waste of time, especially for what I wanted to do.

731
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I heard this school sucks podcast, and I was pretty sure the message was don't go to school.

732
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I was the only one playing defense for school at all.

733
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
A lot of those guys, unlike us educated folks, didn't even finish school.

734
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah, yes.

735
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But what I wanted to express was the feeling that you need a plan.

736
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
If you're going to go to school, for God's sake, the thing I really object to

737
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
is the idea of defaulting to going to school and just figuring it out at the time.

738
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Because I really feel like that did me wrong.

739
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Unless you can go free.

740
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
If it's free, go for it.

741
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Definitely do that.

742
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The thing is that it's just everyone who has to make those decisions is too young to make them.

743
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah, that's the problem.

744
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Parents, I think we're at a time right now where parents have had such great success.

745
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
A lot of our parents have had such success going to school.

746
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It's worked out fantastic for them, and they assume that things are exactly the same.

747
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
We'll work out the same way for their kids, and it really is not the case.

748
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Because there are so many more degrees now.

749
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
School is so much more expensive now than it ever was when our parents went to school.

750
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
The way and the job market is much like, because there's so many people with degrees,

751
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
the jobs that are available require more and more expertise in whatever fields

752
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
and more and more degrees and shit.

753
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's a different landscape, and I think it is a reckless thing to do to throw your kids in

754
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
and say, it'll be fine, don't worry about it, figure it out as you go.

755
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I think it's way smarter to have a plan and do what Mumkey did basically.

756
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Get your shit done as fast as possible.

757
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
If you can do it early, all the better.

758
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It would be better if your degree was worth anything.

759
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That would be a plus.

760
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
On the subject of student loan debt, I have a lot of it.

761
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And let me tell you what I've been doing.

762
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Patreon.com slash Benson.

763
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That's right.

764
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Well, so I have a ton of student loan debt, but when I was doing real jobs,

765
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I was paying back some of it.

766
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So I have repaid a certain portion of it.

767
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But since I've been doing internet stuff, since I've been being an artist,

768
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
well, here's the beautiful.

769
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I make so little money, and I'm so fucking poor.

770
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I'm so far below the poverty line that it's not even funny.

771
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Not at all.

772
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's kind of funny.

773
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm low enough that I qualify for deferrals, so I haven't actually had to pay back any.

774
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm just putting it all off until I'm making more money, and then I'll start paying it back again.

775
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And am I accruing some interest debt?

776
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Yes, it's not a huge amount, but yeah, the amount I owe is going up slowly as this time goes by.

777
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But I can't do it right now.

778
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I mean, thank God, thank God that I've, I don't know, maybe in the future I'll regret deferring,

779
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
but I think it's the only option.

780
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's the only option that'll allow you to keep doing what you want to do.

781
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
If I had to pay back my student loans, I would probably have to get a real job to do it.

782
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Patreon.com.

783
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Well, speaking of having a plan, I'll go ahead.

784
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
If you had to, like, well, say you stayed at this sort of level of money,

785
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
where you were below the threshold or where you needed to pay back any money at all,

786
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
would you keep that up forever?

787
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Or would you strive to get more money and then pay it off eventually?

788
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well, one of the things is Ben and I both owe our parents a big chunk

789
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
because they paid for a bunch with the expectations that we would pay it back at some point.

790
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Some of my debt is to our parents, some of it is to the government.

791
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I mean, I want to, if I had money to pay back the loans, I would pay back the government first.

792
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Yeah, me too, because parents won't charge interest, so.

793
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And I mean, not like the debt's not valid or anything,

794
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,000
but to a certain degree, their money is our money, because eventually we'll just inherit it, you know?

795
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That's fair, that's fair.

796
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So you're just waiting for your parents to die so you can pay off your college debt?

797
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I mean, in the grand scheme of things.

798
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
In the grand scheme of things, you know?

799
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah, their money, we all have the same pool of money, in a sense.

800
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I don't know. I guess that's kind of how I see it.

801
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Can I ask everybody on the subject of, you know, having a plan, and this might go...

802
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry to bring you up.

803
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But what you said, that's what makes me feel better about the fact that, you know, like, parents sent me to college.

804
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I picked my college, but like, they let me make the choice.

805
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And I could be upset, like, I could be mad that they let me choose this expensive school and put myself into all this debt.

806
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:32,000
On the other hand, since their money is my money to a certain extent, I kind of feel like it's both of our problems, like they fuck themselves over just as much as me.

807
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So that's why I try not to sweat it too much, I guess.

808
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Well, I don't spite them for that, but I do think it's not an optimal choice.

809
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I could spite them for that if I wanted, but I try not to.

810
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Anyway, Momke, what were you saying?

811
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Well, now that we're all graduated, I'm curious what your guys' plans are.

812
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Hippo and Ben, or Hippo and Nate, you both want to do YouTube videos as your career, right?

813
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
That's right, that's right, up to a, yeah.

814
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
As long as, I mean, if there's some way to do that, like, that's what I want to do.

815
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I want to tell my own stories through videos, you know, and YouTube appears to be the best way to do that, so, yeah.

816
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Because right now, oh, yeah, go ahead, Hippo.

817
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Right now, it seems like a good idea, because I know that I'm pretty good at it,

818
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:28,000
and if I get the right, you know, big breakout video, I could get quite a lot of money from being a big old gay guy on YouTube.

819
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Make a review of roast things.

820
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I do like creating things like writing and animating, so eventually, I'll probably try to make, you know, create stuff.

821
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
If not either instead of, or, you know, if not in tandem with YouTube, so.

822
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Create stuff, yeah, I want to fund myself by converting energy into matter.

823
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I want to create stuff, that's where I see my career going.

824
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I mean, I get a lot of money if I could make a machine that creates energy.

825
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Yeah, that's true.

826
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
The reason why I'm asking is because I'm now in the position where I need to find a job,

827
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,000
but I have a useless degree, and I'm also, you know, all three of us pretty much have the same sub count at this point,

828
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
like we're all about the same on YouTube.

829
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So I'm thinking like, am I going to be as crazy as these guys and pursue this as a career,

830
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
or do I be more of a boring guy and get a real job and do this shit like in my free time?

831
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I don't know.

832
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I've been a bit of a bitch, and I have, you know, been working this whole time, full time,

833
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and I sort of had to, but really, I mean, it was my choice ultimately to work a full time job while making videos,

834
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,000
and that's something I did because I'm not the same exactly as Ben here or Digi,

835
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
where they're willing to kind of just fucking say fuck it and just like quit their job and just do it immediately.

836
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I don't have exactly as much, I would say, carelessness.

837
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That's a good word.

838
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I'm a little more conservative in my financial risk-taking abilities.

839
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I felt like all the time I was spending doing a real job was...

840
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Miserable? Because I feel pretty miserable doing it.

841
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It's not just that it was miserable, it's that, I mean, some people might see it as more responsible in the long term,

842
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:30,000
but I'm not convinced that's the case because you can be laid off for no reason from your job that you've sunk countless years

843
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:43,000
into, and I feel like the possibility exists that you could end up, you know, really regretting your decision to work a regular job just as much.

844
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
When you get laid off, they don't take back the money you made, Ben, you still make money, it's responsible.

845
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That's true, but you still end up at square one.

846
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
You end up with money.

847
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Well, you have job experience and stuff.

848
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Well, okay, because I actually do feel pretty strongly about that subject, and all the time I find myself looking at guys like Digi,

849
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and this is the negative side of the kind of cautiousness I have with my financial situation.

850
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I think about the last year and a half that I've spent at this current job, and in the last two years, Digi has blown up in a big way,

851
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and it's because he has devoted his life wholeheartedly to making this content, and my current channel has existed for about a year

852
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and has gotten way less content, but again, that's the kind of style of video I do, so obviously I know it's not complete apples to apples,

853
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
but all the time that you devote towards doing stuff on YouTube grows your viewership base,

854
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,000
and that leads to more likelihood of financial success, and so it can be a snowball effect where the better you do,

855
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
the more content you make, the more money you can make, the more economically viable it is.

856
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So to actually divert yourself to work a full-time job and try to do that at the same time is probably the least efficient way to do it

857
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:14,000
as opposed to maybe saving up some money and then just going for it, and just going as hard as you can to try to grow to get that base that will support you.

858
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Especially if you want to do, it makes sense to go as hard as you can, because even if you fail, you've got to spend that time doing what you love,

859
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
so there's no downside.

860
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But then you're living in poverty, that's a pretty big downside.

861
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Well, I mean, it depends how you do it.

862
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Hey man, take it from me, living in poverty can be a pretty great time if you know how to approach it, you know what I'm saying?

863
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It depends what your needs are, you know?

864
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
It's easy to wave it off and say, oh, it's poverty, but why does poverty have to be a dirty word, you know?

865
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Why can't we all just accept it and stop being so fucking classist, you know?

866
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It depends on the situation.

867
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I just want to be able to pay for my rent and for my internet and for my gas.

868
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Okay, but see, if you do the calculations for that, which I have, those numbers aren't necessarily that high, like I could get away,

869
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
and this is actually something I did on my Patreon recently, where I tried to calculate how much I would need based on my output of content,

870
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
like what the Patreon number I would need to be for me to be pretty sure that I'd be okay.

871
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And I found that $750 per video, because I do it per video,

872
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and I'd post like twice a month.

873
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Well, I know it's high, but that's what it would take for it to be a livable wage and I could do the things I do.

874
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Why is it that high?

875
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
For me, $600 a month, and I would be in the black.

876
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah, but do you guys even pay rent at Digi's house?

877
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Of course I pay rent at Digi's house.

878
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I thought he just got the fucking house for free.

879
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
He did not get the house for free.

880
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
My rent is not particularly high, but I do have to pay rent.

881
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It's about what I was paying at my last place.

882
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I mean, let's just say that rent is like $500, and you'll need, I don't know, like $300 left for various expenses throughout a month,

883
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and then on top of that, there's being able to invest in things that you need and pay off student loans, because that's a lot for me.

884
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So, I mean, we're looking at $1,500 is not a lot of money.

885
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I guess that's true.

886
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
If I ever want to start paying back my student loans, which I do, a big priority for me is paying off my student loans.

887
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
As soon as possible.

888
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I mean, my student loans, they want me to pay like $350 a month, so that's, I know I could negotiate that down.

889
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Just make less money, just make less money, and then you have to pay less, and there you go.

890
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, that's one way to go.

891
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I don't know.

892
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Well, that's the thing, 750 was the target, and even if I don't reach that, then that's, you know, I could probably still live with, you know, some amount less than that.

893
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But that's the goal for like a comfortable way to be.

894
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Hippo, I've always been curious about your plan on living and surviving off of YouTube.

895
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Well, right now, I have a pretty good deal, because my rent at my parents' house is very low compared to anywhere else I could possibly be.

896
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And also, they cook food for me.

897
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So, I really don't have to worry about as much as many expenses as other people.

898
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So, doing the YouTube is very easy, a decision for me to make.

899
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I don't have any work at the moment, and I could spend time doing, you know, looking for animation work.

900
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,000
But it's more fun at the moment to just be doing YouTube with the hopes that it gets bigger.

901
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And if it does, then it'll just work out.

902
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I don't really have a bad situation going on unless my parents start asking for a lot more rent.

903
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Let me briefly return to what I was saying before about, like, if you get laid off from a job and, like, all you've got is you've got work experience left.

904
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And, like, yeah, when you work a regular job, you get work experience, which helps you get another similar job.

905
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And I guess the thought process for me was, I don't want work experience in a field that is not something I want to do.

906
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You know, like, I didn't want to be a lab technician or a physics teacher or whatever.

907
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
So, like, getting that work experience is only going to help me continue to be a lab technician or a physics teacher.

908
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
That's how I feel about my programming, which I don't care about.

909
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Yeah, so I feel like bailing at the first, bailing as soon as possible was the smartest decision.

910
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
It's not a bad idea.

911
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Ultimately, striving to do the stuff that you want to do will be just better for yourself.

912
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You may have, like, financial trouble, and eventually if it gets so bad, you might have to take a normal job.

913
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
But I think if your goal is to do stuff that you want to do...

914
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I know that it's going to sound shitty.

915
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I know I could be making more if I spent that time, you know, climbing the corporate ladder or whatever.

916
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But my end goal is not to end up at the top of the corporate ladder.

917
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Well, I mean, obviously not.

918
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
That's all I'm saying.

919
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I hear you, and that's fair, but this is going to sound, I don't know, maybe hypocritical or something.

920
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Despite me choosing the safer road and to, like, do a job that will kind of allow me to live okay while, you know, trying to do my other shit sort of in my spare time,

921
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I also feel kind of resentment for people who do it full time because they have so much free time.

922
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And I sort of feel like my way is sort of like the way that I've been trained is the right way to do things.

923
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So, you know, it's shitty, but I'm kind of pissed off at people who have the kind of personality that will allow them to just be like,

924
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
yeah, fuck it, I'll just go do what I want.

925
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Whereas I'm over here like, guys, that's irresponsible. What are you doing? That's not the smartest way. What if you fuck up?

926
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Yeah, I'm not sure that I would be doing YouTube if I wasn't so financially stable.

927
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Like if I was on the edge, I'm not sure I would just say, fuck it, I'll do whatever I want.

928
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Although Digi was never that on the edge, was he?

929
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Well, at the beginning Digi was very, you know, up in the air.

930
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
He just didn't have much of his own money.

931
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yeah. And he lived with his parents, so he had kind of, you know, he wasn't going to get thrown out if he didn't make any money,

932
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
so he had some stability when he was able to start, which was definitely a good thing for him.

933
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And I'm just bringing up Digi because he's the guy who's made it, you know, he's doing great doing what he's doing.

934
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
We're not talking about school anymore.

935
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:41,000
We have gone off the rails, but school is related to a lot of other things in life, so I still think we're kind of sort of related.

936
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:51,000
The podcast about being graduated smart boys is all, you know, very civil conversation with smart topics.

937
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I agree. We're all very intelligent, and that's the lesson.

938
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I mean, if some of those other guys are fucking dumb.

939
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
If those other guys were here, I really think that the conversation will be dragged down a lot.

940
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So I'm glad that only the brightest of boys can be.

941
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Thank God we're here.

942
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Sivilly discussing just how civil our conversation has managed to be riveting.

943
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
That's right. Well, I mean, if you guys don't have anything particularly relevant to say on the topic,

944
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
we could address, we could get to the final portion of our podcast.

945
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Wait, how long have we been going? An hour?

946
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
About an hour.

947
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Okay, so yeah, so we're people, as you know, at TP Crastinators on Twitter.

948
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
At the start of our recording, we put out a little message that's like, hey, tweet us here if you want us to answer questions,

949
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and we will grab a couple of them and see what the fuck is going on with them.

950
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Have we been getting tweets?

951
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
That's right. So when I just checked now, after tweeting, we had like 48 notifications here, so that's a good amount of shit here.

952
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So let's see what we got.

953
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Maybe I'll go check those out too.

954
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Do they know who's on the episode?

955
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
No, they have no way of knowing.

956
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So it's a surprise. It's like those Wonder Balls with a surprise in every chocolate coated thing, you know.

957
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Can I say one quick thing about this episode in particular, though?

958
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
This is the third time I've been on, guys, and I thank you so much for inviting me back again.

959
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I hope to come back many more times.

960
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
But like every time I come on, there's always like six or seven guys and it's a cluster fuck.

961
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So it's been really nice this time to have four people, two of which are my favorite PCP and one of which is my least favorite.

962
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So it's been a great mix.

963
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Oh no.

964
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I think I know.

965
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
That's all I have to say.

966
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Oh, I think I know.

967
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yes.

968
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It's been.

969
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It's been, of course.

970
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Okay, so you're gonna like me a lot less after our next battle month.

971
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Oh shit.

972
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Oh shit.

973
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I forgot that there's sworn enemies trying to kill each other's best friends.

974
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Yeah, we've tried to keep it civil this whole time.

975
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
That's good.

976
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
But I fucking hate this game.

977
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
The rage barely contained.

978
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Okay, here we go.

979
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Bubbling just under the surface.

980
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Yup.

981
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I'm about to break everything used.

982
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Okay, here we go.

983
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Here's a question for you.

984
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I want to stand closer to the edge and I'm about to break.

985
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
All right shut the fuck up.

986
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
You won't do what you tell me.

987
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Here's one that's going to be relevant to your interest, Ben, by at Steel Viper 77.

988
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Hey, Steel Viper.

989
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Sure, I know that guy.

990
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Oh, I know that guy too.

991
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Is it the audience's fault if they do not understand a piece of art?

992
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Oh.

993
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I don't know if that one's been addressed.

994
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Yeah, okay.

995
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
That's a good question.

996
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Clearly he saw me and Tom arguing about it.

997
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Yes.

998
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
No, I mean no.

999
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's the artist's fault and the artist is not obligated to make his work accessible,

1000
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
but if the work is not accessible to someone, there's no one else to blame.

1001
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
There's no one else to blame but the artist.

1002
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Who at what?

1003
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Is it the audience's fault?

1004
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Some people think it's...

1005
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
What if the audience is too stupid to understand it?

1006
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Then if you wanted stupid people to understand your work of art,

1007
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
you should have made a stupid work of art, you know?

1008
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's your fault.

1009
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So then it's just the fault of the stupid people according to that logic?

1010
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
No, no, you have to make your own...

1011
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:10,000
The argument was flawed from the beginning because it's implying that the artist,

1012
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
like, failing with their art to reach a certain person is like their goal

1013
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and they fail at their goal, which means they're bad.

1014
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
That's not necessarily the case.

1015
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It just means that if somebody doesn't like something,

1016
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
it's not their fault.

1017
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
They didn't do something wrong.

1018
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Yeah, maybe that's a better way to phrase it.

1019
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Well, you know, there are ways to do things wrong actively and sort of passively.

1020
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Like, if you don't understand English and someone asks you a question in English,

1021
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
it's not like you did anything wrong by not getting it, but...

1022
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
That was my example.

1023
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It was like...

1024
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Yeah, if a work...

1025
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
If the artist writes their work in English,

1026
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
then people that don't speak...

1027
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It's not people that don't speak English as fault

1028
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
if they don't get anything out of the work.

1029
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It's because the artist made that choice to write it in a way

1030
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
that would include some people and exclude others.

1031
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And like, everything about making a work is like that.

1032
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And it's not a bad thing.

1033
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
It's just the way it is.

1034
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
You think you can find that as a failure?

1035
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Well, no, not in the sense that...

1036
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
If I like something in English, it's a failure.

1037
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Yeah, this is where it comes in because people have interpreted that word failure in different ways.

1038
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It's not a failure in that the artist has not failed in doing what they set out to do,

1039
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
but in terms of conveying something of value to the audience

1040
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
or to a particular audience member,

1041
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
yeah, I would say that the artist has failed in that because of the choices they made,

1042
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
which is fine.

1043
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
By writing something in English, they failed?

1044
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah, they've failed to convey anything of value to non-English-speaking people.

1045
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And like, a certain amount of failure.

1046
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
A certain amount of failure.

1047
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Let me fucking finish this point.

1048
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
A certain amount of failure is always unavoidable.

1049
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So it's not like I'm saying that an artist sucks

1050
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
or is a failure as an artist for doing that.

1051
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Wait, but hang on, Ben.

1052
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It's such simple shit to me.

1053
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
If I intend it, if I only intend for English-speaking audiences to get it

1054
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
and it is not my intent for French-speaking,

1055
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
haven't I not failed in my goal?

1056
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
No, you've succeeded completely.

1057
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
That's exactly the point that I just made,

1058
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
is that that's not how I'm defining failure here.

1059
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Do we have better questions, Nate?

1060
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Yeah, I thought that was going to be a joke and he wasn't going to respond seriously,

1061
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
but he's fucked up.

1062
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I'm just going to do a couple here. These are small ones.

1063
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Okay, at GTR Santiago.

1064
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah, okay, there we go.

1065
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
What's your alcohol of preference?

1066
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Gin and tonic.

1067
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Just like our grandpappy used to drink, right?

1068
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Did he?

1069
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah, I know he was a big gin fan.

1070
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I didn't even remember that.

1071
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Well, I'm pretty sure that's what he drank.

1072
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Yeah, good.

1073
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Apple cider is nice.

1074
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
That is nice.

1075
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Monkey.

1076
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I've been drinking a lot of vodka and lemonade.

1077
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Are you drinking that now?

1078
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I did like two hours ago.

1079
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That actually sounds really good.

1080
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I wonder if I have any of that.

1081
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And I don't know.

1082
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I'm not picky, but I like Guinness.

1083
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
So I like Guinness.

1084
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Okay, here's two short ones more.

1085
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
What's the most extreme measure?

1086
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Oh, I forgot. This is by at 69...

1087
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Wait, is that 89?

1088
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
At 89, taqueso.

1089
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
What's the most extreme measure any of you

1090
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
have had to take because of the stupidity of others?

1091
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
No, they're 14 meters.

1092
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
What does that mean?

1093
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
The stupidity of others.

1094
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You know, I actually, when I read this,

1095
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I thought he meant the stupidity of the other procrastinators.

1096
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I didn't realize it was so general.

1097
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I didn't actually listen to the question.

1098
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
But yours is the best answer.

1099
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I don't even have an answer for that.

1100
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I don't have an answer either.

1101
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Ben, are you still thinking?

1102
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh, this is Santiago asking.

1103
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Yeah, I see that all the time.

1104
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I don't know.

1105
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
The stupidity of others.

1106
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
What's the most...

1107
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That's such a broad question.

1108
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You see, I was going to say something like,

1109
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
well, there was this one time when Jesse got real upset

1110
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
about the color of his films,

1111
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and we had to talk him down for a while.

1112
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I wasn't going to say anything,

1113
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
but his videos are kind of yellow.

1114
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Have you guys seen them?

1115
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Oh, no.

1116
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Okay, let's move on.

1117
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Here's the last real question.

1118
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I feel like I can think of an example,

1119
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
but what's something someone did to me that was really stupid?

1120
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I said a mean thing.

1121
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
People just don't understand that you can fail to convey meanings

1122
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
as an artist.

1123
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It's a real big problem.

1124
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yeah, I had to get in a fucking argument on Twitter,

1125
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
because Tom didn't agree with me

1126
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
that the artist's responsibility, whatever.

1127
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Yeah, that was gay.

1128
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I'm still with Ben on that.

1129
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Thank you.

1130
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Okay, great.

1131
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
All right, anyway, here's our real question.

1132
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
This is the last one by at magos underscore sigma.

1133
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
What's the real meaning of Christmas?

1134
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Because it is Christmas coming up in a couple of days.

1135
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And behold, there were three kings,

1136
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Martin Luther, Don and Rodney.

1137
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Martin Luther was the smartest of the three.

1138
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
He preached equality, peace, and self-respect.

1139
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
He was the good king.

1140
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Don was a hoopty who got hoopty from a hoopty

1141
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
while brass and diarrhea all over his crib.

1142
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
He was a bad king.

1143
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I don't know the whole quote.

1144
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I'm quoting Charlie Brown's Christmas.

1145
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And that's the real meaning of Christmas, Charlie Brown.

1146
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's like the black, like, really racist version.

1147
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Yeah, it is.

1148
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Oh, Charlie Brown, Kwanzaa.

1149
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1150
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yeah, the true meaning of Kwanzaa.

1151
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Fuck, I was going to say something.

1152
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Oh, right.

1153
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
But forget Christ's birthday.

1154
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Actually, do you guys want to answer that?

1155
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Any other meaning Christmas?

1156
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Is that all you have to say?

1157
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Just forget Christ's birthday and that's the meaning of Christmas.

1158
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I was going to go on to another point that relates to that.

1159
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Okay, we're done with that question.

1160
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Okay, right.

1161
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
There is a more important birthday three days before Christmas

1162
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
and it is that on December 22nd is the one-year anniversary birthday

1163
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
of the Procrastinator's Channel.

1164
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Right.

1165
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Of the release of our first week.

1166
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Our first podcast.

1167
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It's also my mom's birthday.

1168
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Is it?

1169
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It really is.

1170
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Well, is she the Procrastinator's podcast?

1171
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
She might be.

1172
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I'll ask her.

1173
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I'll call her on to the podcast.

1174
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Yeah, she really is.

1175
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
The Procrastinator's podcast.

1176
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Monkey is a virgin birth created by the Holy Spirit

1177
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
of the Procrastinator's podcast.

1178
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Yeah, find out.

1179
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Get back to us on that.

1180
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Like half of my subs are because of this shit.

1181
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Oh, really?

1182
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
That's great.

1183
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
They mostly came from Digi, but I'll give you guys all credit.

1184
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
All right.

1185
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
All right, that's good.

1186
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And also shout out to my new microphone arm, which is wonderful,

1187
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
and I can move my microphone everywhere and it stays in front of my face,

1188
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
which I'm doing right now.

1189
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I love it when you say shout out to inanimate objects.

1190
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Yeah, that's what I do.

1191
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Shout out to my microphone arm.

1192
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It's not like you put a microphone on the end of your arm like Barrett Wallace.

1193
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
No, you fool.

1194
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I'm not Mega Man who just killed microphone man and I got a microphone guy on my arm.

1195
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
This is a, it's like a metal thing that you kind of screw it as it clamps to your desk,

1196
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and then it can kind of swivel and extend the microphone out.

1197
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I see.

1198
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
And it's wonderful.

1199
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I can't recommend it highly enough.

1200
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I've been using a stand and it was bullshit and I hate it.

1201
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
This is a thousand times better.

1202
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It was like a hundred bucks, but everyone should get one.

1203
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
It's fucking wonderful.

1204
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
It was great.

1205
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Great.

1206
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I think that's enough of that shit.

1207
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Thanks for listening, everybody.

1208
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Yeah.

1209
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
We'll tune in next week.

1210
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Oh, next week's going to be a very special episode, actually.

1211
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,000
We've been cooking up something for a little while and it's going to be a big fucking thing.

1212
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Oh, is it that thing?

1213
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Oh, it's that.

1214
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Oh, man.

1215
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
We're going to show them that.

1216
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
It's going to be a crazy time.

1217
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I'm really, really excited for that.

1218
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
What are you guys talking about?

1219
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh, you'll find out next week.

1220
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Everyone here is going to be on that.

1221
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
We're all involved and it's a couple other people in the procrastiners will be there, too.

1222
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And it's going to be fucking dope.

1223
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
So stick around and we'll see you then.

1224
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Wait, can I give a hint?

1225
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Can I give a hint?

1226
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Oh, you can give a little hint.

1227
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Sure.

1228
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
If you're a fan of Retro, if you're a fan of Gen 1, if you're a Gen 1er for life.

1229
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Oh, boy.

1230
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Oh, shit.

1231
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I am part of this, ain't I?

1232
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Yeah.

1233
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Yes, you are.

1234
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Yes, you are.

1235
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Oh, I forgot I was.

1236
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Okay, people.

1237
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So go speculate.

1238
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So go speculate.

1239
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah, go be hype.

1240
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That's insane.

1241
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Go to YouTube slash MomKeyJones.

1242
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Go sub to my channel.

1243
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Go to Hippo and give them a thumbs up.

1244
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And don't go to Nate's channel.

1245
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Okay, thanks everybody.

1246
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Okay, we'll see you next time, everybody.

1247
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Thanks for watching.

1248
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Bye.

1249
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Bye.

1250
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Yeah.

1251
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Hooray.

1252
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Yeah, everyone.

1253
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

1254
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

1255
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
But I'm not working.

1256
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm doing nothing.

1257
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
My dick, I'm jerking.

1258
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Myself, I'm sucking.

1259
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I am an asshole.

1260
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I am a stupid.

1261
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I've got a deadline.

1262
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Don't want to do it.

1263
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:17,000
What the hell is wrong with me?

1264
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I'm supposed to be making money.

1265
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I'm supposed to be creating money.

1266
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Think that the people gladly will pay for artistic genius.

1267
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
That's what they came for.

1268
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Instead, I'm tweeting.

1269
