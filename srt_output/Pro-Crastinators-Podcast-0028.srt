00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am your hero and God Emperor, the best guy ever, Bestie Boy.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,000
Thanks for joining us once again. And today, we've got, in addition to our regular Digibro over here.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Hey buddy boy.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:24,500
My partner in crime. We've got two outsiders, two guest people as we like to have some times, who in recent times, I've become friends with who I really like.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,000
And I think make great videos that you guys should definitely check out. And you probably already have, to be honest.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So first is The Gaming Brit.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hate these things because this is why I've got to introduce myself and sound all charismatic just by saying my name.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's okay. The only goal is to let people hear your voice so they can distinguish you later.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Charlie. I do The Gaming Brit on YouTube. I review games.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, like Hyperbit Hero is here with us. He was the one who said, yo, yo Charlie, I'm gonna be on PCP tomorrow.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah. That's right.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And he was like, you're not invited.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And I was like, yo, you've watched this podcast before, right? Things get savage. You're gonna need someone in there backing you up, man.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Like, you got him. You got him. You got him.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So he was like, okay. You don't just do PCP without a partner. It's a dangerous drug.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is a tag team match. So let's hear from you Hyperbit Hero. What's happening?

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Not much.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, there you have it. All right. All right. So we're doing things a little differently today.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So we're gonna start with one topic. And if things go long, which they probably will, if we run out of stuff to say for the first one,

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we still need to fill some fucking time. We're just gonna go into our second one.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But our first one is a sort of, it's sort of nebulously defined right now. We're gonna flush it out.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But the word that I want to use, the word that I want to use is cred fags. You know, cred fags.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There is no Urban Dictionary definition for this because we just made it up. In fact, we should enter this into Urban Dictionary,

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
our own definition we come up with. How full circle will that be? So why don't, was it Charlie?

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Charlie came up with it, right?

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah. Why don't you tell us about this?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, I just find that today on the internet when, you know, we all tweet, we all do our YouTube videos,

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and we all meme it up. Sometimes we're all a bit guilty of doing that. And sometimes, obviously, you know,

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
people want to be in on the popular things and what other people are playing, what other people are talking about.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And sometimes they go out of their way to try and weasel their way in to these popular things.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Obviously not that interested in just being part of the franchise, the anime or the game.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And it's like so annoying because you get so many questions on YouTube and Twitter and stuff about which parts of this franchise

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
can I skip and like where should I start. When obviously it's just if you're interested and you care and you want to have

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
lots of entertainment, just start from the beginning and wake your way up. Like what's the big deal, you know?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I know Hayden gets this a lot as well, especially with the...

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The thing is like, you know, they do want to get into it. They just want to get into it as quickly as possible,

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
as easy as possible. They don't want to fucking experience the story or anything.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Like of course, talking about the Yakuza franchise, that's where I get to ask this all the time.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Listen, you want to get into Yakuza, there's one just called Yakuza. That's the fucking one to do.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Dude, oh my god, I gotta tell you, fucking, I can't tell you how many times I've gotten this question and it baffles me

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
that anyone has to ask this, which is, what order do I watch Neon Genesis Evangelion?

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There's only one order!

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There's a TV series called Neon Genesis Evangelion, a movie called The End of Evangelion,

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and then a TV show called Rebuild of Evangelion, or a movie series called Rebuild of Evangelion.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm not following, you need to break it down.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The watch order is in the title.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And, you know, even a lot of the times you can kind of follow a progression of, you know, one, two, three, four.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They're structured, you know?

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like Charlie's saying, the best advice is usually go to Wikipedia and look at the chronology and watch them in the order they released it.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you want to be a serious investigative journalist, you can put in the extra mile and go to Wikipedia and look it up, you know?

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It baffles me, because even with like the smallest of franchises, it happens, you know, I'm big into my Devil May Cry,

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and I get questions like, can I skip to three? Can I just skip all these?

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because I know three is the one with the memes, right? That's the one with all the jokes that I want to be in on.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But the biggest joke is Devil May Cry 2, though.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's like, there are four games, guys.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You don't, like, that's what confuses me, right?

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And numbered for your pleasure.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hold on, Charlie. Are you saying you think everyone should play DMC 2?

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Like, even knowing that it's...

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know, I am two ways about that, actually, because it is a terrible game,

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
but at the same time, if you play two and then you play three, it's like, whoa, you're experiencing this jumping quality, you know?

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have a lot of sympathy for that viewpoint.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I agree. I would like everyone to play.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If they, like, you know, people bring up Final Fantasy as an example of games that you pretty much can skip,

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
but I would really like it if people would, when they get into the series, play all of them in order,

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
because that gives you so much context and, like, a lot can be lost if you don't...

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And I didn't. I started with Seven, it was my first Final Fantasy,

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
but I look back at what old fags have done when they've played through the whole series in order,

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and seeing that growth happen is such a beautiful thing.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And that's when, like, they talk about, like, classical long-term fans.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah, then the disappointment when you get to 13 can be all the more sweet.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, that's right.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you boot up Devil May Cry 3 and experience that opening after playing through two

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and the way far that it was, it's like, like, it intensifies the passion of that scene, you know?

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And you know what else it does as an ancillary benefit is if you start...

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's say, like, a new person started playing Final Fantasy when 13 came out,

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and they're like, I'm gonna play 13. It's numbered 13 of the series, but I'm gonna start with this.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And if they don't like it, they're like, well, Final Fantasy's done, you know, I'm done with it.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like, Hayden, tell them how silly it is, especially with Yakuza,

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
how people want to start so much with Yakuza 3.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Because 3 isn't that good compared to 2 at all.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, it's because Yakuza 3 literally begins with the ending of Yakuza 2.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Like, it's a continuation of, like, the same cutscene?

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I think, no, I think, because especially with Yakuza, it's such a seasonal series, really,

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
when you think about, like, each game is like a season, really, and like a long-running crime drama.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So it's like the silliest series.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hey, there's some people who jump into TV shows like Season 5.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You know, I'll say, I mean, for some defense of this, I do think that it's entirely possible

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
to play one of the later ones, and then, you know, that makes you want to go back and do the rest.

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And I think, depending on the series, it can be fine.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Like, you know, the Souls series, for instance.

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Like, Demon's Souls was not very widely known, because it was a PSD exclusive,

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
it was a, like, not an indie game, but it was like, you know, not, well, it's a weird obscure Japanese game.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Dark Souls then blew up super huge, and I do think a lot of Dark Souls fans went back and played Demon's Souls,

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you know, and like, and most people got into it through Dark Souls, but it also wasn't even presented as though it were a sequel.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's fine though, it's like, it's when people like with Yakuza start asking, is there a recap of two and one in three?

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can I just read it?

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, it's when you start to ask the questions, like, what can I do to make up for the fact that I haven't played the first games?

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's like, just fucking play them, dude.

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I would never tell people to not jump into a series at any point.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I have to play Devil's Advocate here, because my brother Victor is a hardcore cred-fag.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think we're using this term correctly, but he, because me and him have gotten into arguments over this,

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
specifically because of me following Charlie and Hayden on Twitter,

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
because I've seen these guys make this argument over and over again that like,

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
if you want to get into a franchise, play them all, right?

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I've thought about it and been like, yeah, you know, I kind of agree.

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think it's the healthiest way, you know, I've never played through like Metal Gear, for instance,

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
but if I did, I would want to start from Metal Gear Solid because,

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh yeah, for sure, for sure.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
For what it's worth, technically you should start from Metal Gear, but you know, like,

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I would like to play all of them in order if I was going to.

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And my brother Victor, who has only played through Metal Gear Solid 4,

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh no, the worst one.

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But it's one of his favorite games ever.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And here's where we get into something complicated, because Victor's argument is,

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
yeah, but you'll never play them, which is a sound argument.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because for instance, okay, the Witcher series, right?

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Super Bunny Hub did this whole video series on the three Witcher games and I was like, cool.

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Now I kind of understand them and stuff and it really seems to me like the Witcher 3 is the only one I'm going to really get into.

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Because the Witcher 2 seems like it's too hard and the Witcher 1 seems like the controls suck.

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So like, why not just skip to Witcher 3, but at the same time,

123
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I know that there's a lot of references to the past games,

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that there's a sort of an ongoing narrative through all three games.

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And so I keep saying to my brother, like, I'd really like to play through Witcher 1 and 2.

126
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And he's like, yeah, but you'll never do it.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You will never play through Witcher 1 and 2.

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And there's a chance you'll miss out on what could be one of your favorite games, Witcher 3, if you just play it.

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But you'll never play it because you're waiting for Witcher 1 and 2.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And I don't think he's wrong, because I don't think I'll ever play through all three of them.

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But why won't you play them?

132
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because I don't really play a lot of video games in the first place.

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So it's like a time management thing.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But when I look at myself with that argument, like, I played all the Final Fantasies

135
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and there's a million of them.

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And it's, you know, I think that that kind of argument.

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I played them all in high school, didn't you, when you had like lots of time

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and like you could just do that.

139
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But all that is, is that's making concessions.

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're making concessions to not take on a responsibility to do something.

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And like, if you're willing to compromise, then okay, you can go be a guy who manages his time efficiently,

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
but you're also a cred fag.

143
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's the trade I've been making.

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's what it is, you know?

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah.

146
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, sorry, go on.

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No, you can go ahead.

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
No, I was just going to say that I feel like whenever I'm like,

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
because I'm in the same position with the Witcher,

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I feel like the third game looks really interesting

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
but I want to play the other two first and I'm going around to it.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But I feel like when I don't get around to it, I'm just going on to play another thing.

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And the thing that weirds me out about cred fags is, you know,

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
it seems like people just want to have, like, to me, playing a long series, playing a lot of content,

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
it's still content and entertainment.

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And that's why I really don't get why you'd want to sort of spend more money on more products and more things

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
when you have a few that can sustain you for a long time.

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah, that deeply fascinates me as well.

159
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And I, from observing my brother, who at this point I'm thinking of as the ultimate cred fag,

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
because he does everything that we're insulting here.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Fuck you, Victor.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Like, watching the way he plays games, like, he can seemingly only get excited about a game

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
if there's some kind of hype, you know?

164
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Like, even if it's just him, even if no one else cares about the game, it has to be, like, new and fresh.

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Because, like, he has all these...

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He sounds like a big LMFAO fan.

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He has so many games that he has never beaten.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Which I am too, by the way.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Shut up.

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He has so many games that he's never beaten, that he'll never go back to,

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that he has, like, you know, this huge stockade of games.

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But for some reason, it'll be like, you know, a new game comes out and he's like,

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm gonna go buy that.

174
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I'm like, well, what about the last game you never finished?

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And he's like, yeah, but I'm not hype about that.

176
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This one's a new game.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And so it's new and now I'm excited, you know?

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And it's like, if he doesn't play through a game when it's new and all at once,

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and, like, beat it, then he'll never beat it, you know?

180
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If it stops being new and it fades into the background of his collection,

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
he'll never finish it.

182
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It'll just sit there forever.

183
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You know, I can't, like, say that that's wrong or anything,

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
but, like, that's just, that's a very emotion-driven reason to play games

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
as opposed to any kind of intellectual reason, which is, you know, it's fine.

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
There's nothing wrong with that, but I feel differently.

187
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's just weird to watch, because I'm always like,

188
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
there's, because for me, I get excited to go play a bunch of Super Nintendo games.

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You know, like, for me, the idea of spending $60 on a new game is such an ordeal,

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
because, like, you know, newer games are longer,

191
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and they really ask for more, like, investment on your time and energy,

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and, like, I don't have patience for, like, the cinematic games that come out these days.

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know, we're like, if I'm gonna have to sit through, like,

194
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
10 minutes of, like, them taking control away from me, the game's not worth my time anymore.

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Like, I need to be, you know, I like Dark Souls and Doom.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like, those are the recent games that I've enjoyed,

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and so, like, and even Doom fucking pissed me off when it did take control away from you.

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
How long were those sections that it did that? That was too scary.

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I would say there's probably grand total 10 minutes of, of, like, forced cutscene.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, I didn't find it too much.

201
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Compared to what's out there, that's great, but in a game like Doom, it's gonna be annoying.

202
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, it's still annoying.

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And you can't skip it even when you replay the levels.

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's what's particularly annoying.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's like, guys, look at us being so cheeky, saying fuck, being forced to watch cinematic sequences

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
through a forced cinematic sequence.

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, that was really obnoxious.

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But, but anyways, like, you know, for me, the idea of, like, going out, spending $60 on a game,

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
that's gonna go down to 20 bucks in six months anyways.

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You know, like, for me, it's like an anti-hype cycle.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A new game comes out and everyone gets hyped about it, and I take one look at the price tag,

212
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and I'm like, I don't want to play that for a year.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's a very, that's a very interesting point, because I think something me and Hayden find

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
when we're recommending PS2 games that are hard to find, it's like that, like, they find the PS2 game on eBay,

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and it's like $40, and it's like, ugh, I don't want to pay $40 for a PS2 game,

216
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
but you'll go out and buy the latest shitfest for, like, $50.

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, I love that argument when you made it.

218
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This PRR, thank you.

219
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, well, like, the, yeah, and I went out because, like, based on Hayden's videos,

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I've bought, like, Folklore, which was like 20 bucks, and it was, you know, an older game.

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It shouldn't probably be $20, but I wanted that game.

222
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I didn't want to just own a game because it's new.

223
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Like, it's, like, like you said, these are classic games.

224
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's like if someone was saying, I don't want to pay $15 for Super Mario RPG,

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
it's like, but you think it's going to be one of your favorite games?

226
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You know, like, that's the funniest thing to me is I'll have people say, like,

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
oh, that game is a classic, and I've wanted to play it for 10 years, but it's 20 bucks,

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and that's too much, and it's like, if it's a classic, it's going to be worth more

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
than any of the new games that you play.

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
To play Devil's Advocate, maybe they just feel that way because they have been told

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that old games are cheap, and having to pay more money for an old game just conflicts

232
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
with what they expect to, you know, do for that.

233
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So, but whatever, I agree.

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I agree.

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Me and Aiden, here's the thing.

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The ultimate cred-fag move is to buy a game because you heard it's good,

237
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
just to own it and not play it just to have it on your shelf like a figure or something like that.

238
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So when people come over, they look at your shelf and think, oh, where?

239
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This guy's got a music case and video game.

240
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
God, I wish I could believe there's no one like that,

241
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
but I know there's people like that.

242
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's like on another level.

243
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's like a level where it's like none of us would ever know a person like that.

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You know what's like a more reasonable...

245
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Like a woman in disguise, man.

246
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I can see something like that happening when like, you get it.

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Like, if you're like a rich kid that your parents just buy shit for you

248
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and they give you a bunch of games and stuff, you know, like FIFA, 2,000...

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Aiden's in the military.

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I could see this happening there.

251
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
In fact, my ex-girlfriend was a little bit like this

252
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
because she was in the Air Force and she would just spend lots and lots of money.

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And so she would buy a lot of games that she would just never actually play

254
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
because she just bought them to spend money, you know?

255
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You gotta spend your money.

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Steam has kind of caused that with Steam sales because prices get so low,

257
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
you can't afford not to buy these games.

258
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I remember years ago, years ago, Hayden, you told me that one of your friends was like,

259
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm gonna buy all the Metal Gear toys even though he hadn't played any of the games.

260
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That was a friend, he said he was gonna buy like a giant couple hundred dollar

261
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
like Metal Gear Rex figure even though he's never played any of the games.

262
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I mean, I guess if you really like the design, then that can, you know, exist outside the games.

263
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't think he ever showed interest in Metal Gear Solid aside from that.

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
He's like, I'm gonna buy this shit, bro.

265
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Interesting.

266
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And you know, there's a whole other side to this that we haven't really talked about

267
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
which is when people buy specifically obscure things for the sake of them being obscure

268
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and being able to tell on places like V on 4chan, like,

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
you guys, have you even heard of these fucking games I'm playing right now?

270
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But they're obviously the best because you don't know about them.

271
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And I think they're objectively right.

272
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes.

273
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's my stance.

274
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, I don't know, like, I don't know how, it's hard to gauge that.

275
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's really a music thing a lot of the time, but people do that music all the time.

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't know.

277
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's hard to gauge with those things because there's, like, how do we know if they don't just like the thing, you know?

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But I do, I mean, obviously posturing happens and I think it's a thing people do.

279
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But I don't know.

280
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Personally, I'm someone who loves seeking out obscure shit for real,

281
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
so I'll just go out and watch every weird fucking thing, you know?

282
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What's the point of posturing to anonymous people?

283
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
To feel good about yourself.

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Dude, you haven't gotten addicted to the use, man.

285
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They don't know who you are, though.

286
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah.

287
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But it doesn't, you're a person on the internet.

288
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Well, that's what you have a 3x3 for.

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You see, if you have a 3x3 that shows what your favorites are and you post it on 4chad

290
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and it looks like you have great taste, then everyone will give you...

291
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No, but Digi, you've created the opposite effects now when you were complaining about 3x3s

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
because now people are going to try and make 3x3s on purpose to get cred that aren't cred.

293
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Because you...

294
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You were complaining about too much.

295
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
3x3s became a fucking nightmare after I made that video.

296
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Because now people are like, to get cred, I've got to talk about things that don't have cred.

297
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, shit.

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
On each of these sites, there's a different sort of internet currency.

299
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And in the case of the 3x3s, there's a new currency which is like the Digi buck,

300
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
which is like, it's endorsed by the degree to which people are here.

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, god, I really never thought of it this way.

302
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's how I could trust any of them.

303
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You can't trust any 3x3 again?

304
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
They've all been, they've all got ulterior motives, theoretically, so they cannot be trusted.

305
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Well, I like to think the result of this is just that everyone is now willing to put kill or kill on their 3x3s.

306
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I think that's the only major difference I've made and I think that's a proud thing to have done.

307
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You know the worst thing about cred-fagging is when it backfires on people?

308
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Like, I've seen people like on Twitter, they ask like, where should I start with JoJo?

309
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And then someone in the comments will be like, that's the one.

310
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's the one I was trying to think of.

311
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
People always ask what they can skip when they're reading fucking JoJo.

312
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Read the whole thing, you piece of shit.

313
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They're like, but that's the thing.

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Being a cred-fag can get you into trouble because then you can get replies from like, just like,

315
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
dunderheads who are like, start with part 3.

316
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Part 3 is the best, because it has the radio.

317
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Part 2 is objectively superior to part 3 people.

318
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Accept it.

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Accept it.

320
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Well, that's the funny thing about JoJo is like, everyone seems to have their favorite part

321
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and like, people talk about which ones are the best.

322
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Personally, I think JoJo is always like, the same.

323
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Like, there are differences in each arc, but the tone of the series is always the exact same.

324
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's always over the top, scatological, insane, you know.

325
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm a JoJo savant expert, super empowered, brilliant man.

326
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And I can tell you that when people are making that argument, what they're really talking about

327
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
are the characters and like, the specific stands and as well as the general slight difference in tone.

328
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Like, part 4 is like, a slice of life with stands.

329
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And that's really fun, which is why it's one of the better parts.

330
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But it's also like, I mean, I don't think it's that, like in terms of what's going on moment to moment.

331
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's not that different from every other JoJo's.

332
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's entirely true.

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
If the tone is the same the whole time, that's all the more reason to start at the beginning

334
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
because it's not going to get a super different experience if you start at part 4 or part 3 or whatever.

335
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But you see, that cuts to the nature of what crowd fagging is, which is,

336
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
they just want to get to the stuff that's most commonly discussed

337
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so they can be a part of the conversation as quickly as possible.

338
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I think the worst example I've ever seen is Link.

339
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Hayden sent me to NeoGaff of some guy who played Dark Souls.

340
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you want to explain it, Hayden?

341
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't remember this.

342
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh, you don't remember?

343
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It was like, he's like, I've played Dark Souls and I've been told that a lot of the...

344
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This is a NeoGaff Fred, so of course it's gonna be like,

345
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I've heard that all these designs are from Berserk.

346
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Tell me.

347
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh yeah.

348
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Which parts of the Berserk manga can I skip?

349
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh my god!

350
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh no!

351
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Just to see the references.

352
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The fucking Berserk manga.

353
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Just read the whole thing.

354
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Why would you do this?

355
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The man doesn't want to get triggered obviously, which is understandable.

356
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I mean, I kind of, like when something is broken up into parts,

357
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
it's a little easier to understand, right?

358
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You got, you know, okay, there's the first game, the second game,

359
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
maybe they had different staff behind them,

360
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
maybe they're not quite the same type of game.

361
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The Berserk manga is just one ongoing manga.

362
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
There's no like, you know, it's not like Gunsmith Cats

363
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
where there's like Gunsmith Cats and Gunsmith Cats Burst, you know,

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
like there's two different...

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
No, it's just all Berserk!

366
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Why would you think it's okay to skip any of it?

367
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And you know, I gotta tell you, the thing that I,

368
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
since we're talking about examples of this that infuriate us,

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the one that really sticks out to me is people in all seriousness

370
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
will just, I don't know how they do it,

371
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
but they will just jump into reading one piece.

372
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Like, and a lot of it happened during the giant war in the middle of the series

373
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
where all the characters were coming together throughout the series

374
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
to like, do something, and these people,

375
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
there is no way they could have known what the fuck was going on,

376
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
who any of these people were, what the stakes were.

377
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Everything in one piece builds on itself because it's a story,

378
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
it's a continuous linear story.

379
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No, it's just all all so random.

380
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
To me, to me, like, it excites me.

381
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If I start something good from the beginning

382
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and I know there's like hundreds and hundreds,

383
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
like loads of content coming up,

384
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
does that excite me?

385
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm like, oh shit, I'm not like,

386
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
well, you see, I don't know who the characters are in Opening 14,

387
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
which I watched on YouTube, so I'm just going to skip to that part.

388
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's like, no.

389
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's like, I want to go on the journey, man.

390
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I want to go on the journey.

391
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The only argument I can even kind of accept is that like,

392
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
my life is too busy, I don't have time to do all this.

393
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Like, it's not a good argument.

394
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Like, you're being a cred-fag when you do that,

395
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
but it's like, I get it.

396
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, here's the thing.

397
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Here's another thing.

398
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I think a big part of this is also that all four of us are

399
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
analytically minded YouTube journalists of a sort

400
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
about these mediums, right?

401
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Right.

402
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And I think the way that we, because how do I put this?

403
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
None of us give a fuck what's current and new,

404
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and I think this really reflects,

405
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
because I've been following Hayden and Charlie here

406
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
for over three years on YouTube,

407
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and neither one of them has-

408
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I haven't been following myself that long.

409
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Neither one of them has ever really been someone

410
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
who makes videos about new games,

411
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
unless those are games that are, like,

412
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
really relevant to the franchises that they talk about.

413
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You guys have made a couple Uncharted 4 and, like,

414
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
DMC videos, but, like, you didn't cover fucking

415
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
BioShock Infinite when it came out, you know,

416
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
or, like, the last of us in any depth.

417
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And even in that brilliant Metal Gear Solid 5 video

418
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
by our friend the Gaming Brick here,

419
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
a lot of that was about the context of the entire series

420
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and why it, you know, it's legacy stuff, you know?

421
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But these are guys who go back and do fucking

422
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
a bunch of Devil May Cry videos

423
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
at a time when, you know, like-

424
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Bayonetta's the new thing.

425
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
No one would be talking about it, yeah.

426
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Or just anything, you know, they talk about older games.

427
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I go back, I talk about tons of older anime.

428
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Nate, you've only so far covered shit that,

429
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
well, I don't know.

430
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You did Monster Musume.

431
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I did Monster Musume, that's the one.

432
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I got one.

433
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, yeah, that's true.

434
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, yeah, and One Punch Man.

435
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Well, that doesn't apply to you at all.

436
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It was a little late on One Punch Man, but, like-

437
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Ah, fuck you.

438
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But the point is that we're the kind of people who,

439
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I think we care about history and we care about classics

440
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and we care about going back and finding the best stuff

441
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
of the medium, and I think that a lot of these credit fags,

442
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
all they care about, like Charlie said,

443
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
is being a part of the conversation.

444
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's all about, like-

445
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They care about being in on the meme.

446
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That's what it's about.

447
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They see something trending on Twitter

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and they want to, as quickly as possible, get it.

449
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Whereas I see something trending on Twitter

450
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and I'm like, I don't fucking care.

451
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'll get to it when I get to it.

452
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
If everyone's talking about, like, Metal Gear Solid 5,

453
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't run out and go, I need to play Metal Gear Solid 5

454
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
so I understand what everyone's saying.

455
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm like, one day I'll play all the Metal Gear Solid games

456
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
if I get around to it, and then I can know all the memes.

457
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But I don't-

458
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I mean, no hurry, because I'd rather-

459
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I would much rather know the entire story

460
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
than know a part of it so that I can be-

461
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So I can spit memes for the two weeks that the game is relevant

462
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and then immediately fades into-

463
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You can't play MGS5 and then just pretend to be mad

464
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
about the things they missed.

465
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Right.

466
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

467
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And you know, it's totally-

468
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh god, I totally forgot what I was going to say.

469
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
God damn it.

470
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I think I satiate my desire to keep up with stuff

471
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
because I just watched tons and tons of analysis videos.

472
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So I know a startling amount about Metal Gear Solid 5

473
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
because I watched, you know, I watched our good friend Jesse

474
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
play through like a lot of the game on the Blue Glow.

475
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I watched Charlie's analysis of it.

476
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Bunnyhop wrote a bunch of videos about it.

477
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So like I get why everyone feels the way that they do.

478
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And yeah, like Charlie said, like me jumping in now,

479
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I would feel so much less than what Charlie felt.

480
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You know, like watching his video, I understand,

481
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
okay, this is what the series veterans are feeling.

482
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But if I play the game, I'm not going to feel those things.

483
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm not going to feel anything.

484
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm just going to be like, oh, it's a game.

485
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You know, I don't know what the fuck-

486
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I don't know what who these characters are,

487
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
who the fuck is Big Boss.

488
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't know.

489
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You know, I kind of think of it like,

490
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I really do consider myself an educator, among other things.

491
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And like, it's not like because someone came up with a new idea

492
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
that we like throw out the old one when it comes to like,

493
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
okay, your times tables, like those are fine,

494
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
but I've got like a new version,

495
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and I'm going to teach everyone this.

496
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's like, you take the best ideas throughout history,

497
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
and that's really my interest,

498
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
is finding the things that are the best examples of what they do

499
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
and highlighting them so that we can improve them

500
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and people can learn from them in various ways.

501
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, you're talking about educating, Nate,

502
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and the thing is never give the cred fag any leeway

503
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
just because you want somebody to be into something you like.

504
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Because even in that Berserk example I gave you,

505
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
there were people with Berserk avatars in that post saying,

506
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
well, I guess you can skip this part of the thing.

507
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's like, no.

508
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, no.

509
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Never give anyone else.

510
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
People just go with Yakuza saying,

511
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
yeah, you know, you can skip to three.

512
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
There are recaps of the first two games.

513
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You don't need to watch them.

514
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You know, you can just read a fucking Wikipedia article

515
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
about them and know the story.

516
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's like, that's the worst part.

517
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's like, each one of these games has its own story

518
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and like, twists and...

519
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And it's a real shame with Yakuza,

520
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
because like two is so good.

521
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's like, it's such a fun game.

522
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Two is like the best story in the entire series.

523
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
After two, the entire storyline for each one of the games

524
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
fucking takes a huge dip.

525
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But you know, I'm with you on this,

526
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
but just to play Devil's Advocate,

527
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I do understand people's urgent desire.

528
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It really ties back to the human desire to be loved

529
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and be in a community.

530
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
They want to be in on the thing that everyone's talking about.

531
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So there's a desperation to know,

532
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
the game of Thrones is talking about Game of Thrones,

533
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
which has happened to a lot of people out there.

534
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's like, oh man, I want to be in.

535
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I want to know.

536
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And so a lot of people, just out of sheer,

537
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
this is pretty philosophical now,

538
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
out of a sheer desire to be loved

539
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and to be a member of the human species,

540
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
they will do, they will, as soon as possible,

541
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
cut to the chase of understanding the idea

542
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
that is, you know, caught on with the people they know

543
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
in their lives.

544
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Well, guess what, bitch?

545
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'll never love you if you don't.

546
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I think with video games, though,

547
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
there's this whole technology element where it's like,

548
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't want to play on those old systems.

549
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Me and Hayden talk about this all the time,

550
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and it's the fact that, oh, that PS2

551
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
has this icky vibe to it.

552
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I want the HD thing.

553
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That's some bullshit, because the PS2

554
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
does not give me icky vibes.

555
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Playing shit on the PS3 gives me icky vibes,

556
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
because it's just fucking all the games run like ass.

557
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

558
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And it's the same for, like, you know,

559
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
old anime or something, like, the animation.

560
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, man.

561
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And it's four by three.

562
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

563
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
There was another NeoGaff thread where it was like,

564
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Hayden said, it was like,

565
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
when Yakuza 5 was getting localized and some guy was like,

566
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
well, if it's not on PS3, like, he owned a PS3,

567
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
but he was like, yeah, you're exciting, Hayden.

568
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I already packed my PS3 up into the attic.

569
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I ain't getting it back down.

570
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Hello.

571
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I've seen a lot of stuff like that.

572
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But that's the real shit, dude.

573
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Those are the real reasons people use to, like,

574
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
dismiss works of art or whatever,

575
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
because they don't want to fucking unpack their old TV or whatever.

576
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That's always been funny to me, because, you know,

577
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
people talk about, like, backwards compatibility,

578
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and I think that...

579
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I think all these consoles should have it.

580
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But it's always been really funny to me that people make,

581
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
like, such a huge deal about it,

582
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
because I still have all my consoles, you know?

583
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Now, I wish I didn't have to, like,

584
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
when I went out to buy Yakuza as a result of Hayden's video,

585
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I was sans PS2,

586
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
because seven of them have broken on me over the years,

587
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
so I had to go buy a new one,

588
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
but it was, like, $25, you know?

589
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And it would have been nice

590
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
if I could have just popped that fucking disc into my PS4,

591
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
my fucking supercomputer sitting on my desk,

592
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
but whatever, you know?

593
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
This idea that you, like, have to pack away your old consoles

594
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and never touch them again,

595
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
it just reeks of not giving a fuck about history

596
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and old games and being, like, I'm never going back,

597
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm never playing something old.

598
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I do think the companies that make these things

599
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
should play a role in preserving that

600
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
with the backwards compatibility, though.

601
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I agree, I agree.

602
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But here's the thing, those people don't have those consoles,

603
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
because they're the ultimate cred fags,

604
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and they didn't play games until recently.

605
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh!

606
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
They were young for what it's worth.

607
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
They were fucking young.

608
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But those old consoles, like I said, are fucking cheap.

609
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I went out and bought, like, I literally went to,

610
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I was at a used game store,

611
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and it's like, oh, there's Yakuza, and there's a PS2,

612
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and this is less than $50 combined, you know?

613
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I mean, I guess if you're 10, that's a lot,

614
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
but that's less than what a new game would have cost.

615
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
A whole console and a great game for that console

616
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
was less than buying one shitty new fucking $60 game.

617
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But I think this is particularly bad in gaming,

618
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
which is probably why we're using so many gaming examples,

619
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and there's a great article that I read this one time

620
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
that I wish I could remember what it's called,

621
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
because I cite it all the time,

622
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
but there's this guy who was a professor

623
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
teaching game design at a college,

624
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and he decided to run a little experiment

625
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
where he asked everybody in the crowd,

626
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
who hears the fan of the Elder Scrolls games,

627
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and like 80% of the class raised their hand,

628
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and he said, who all has played Skyrim

629
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and all those hand-staters?

630
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, yeah.

631
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Then he said, who's all has played Oblivion,

632
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and like more than half of the hands went down,

633
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and then he says, who's played Morrowind,

634
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and it's like two guys left,

635
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and then he's like, who's played Daggerfall?

636
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Nobody, right?

637
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And he's like, you know,

638
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
you say you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls,

639
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
but you're really a fan of Skyrim,

640
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and you clearly have no context of the history

641
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
of this franchise, and it's like,

642
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
it's so weird that people seem to think,

643
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
especially when it comes to games,

644
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
that the newest one is just the best one,

645
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
just because it's the newest,

646
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and they have no interest in looking back

647
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and finding out if there's anything different

648
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
or interesting or better about the old games,

649
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
which in something like the Elder Scrolls,

650
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
a lot of people consider Morrowind the best one,

651
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and these people will never know.

652
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The advantages of that one,

653
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
because it doesn't look new like Skyrim.

654
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm so glad you got to this point,

655
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
because at least for me, and maybe not everybody agrees,

656
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
because not everybody sees games the way I

657
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
and possibly the rest of you do,

658
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
it is not about the most polished presentation,

659
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
what matters about all art

660
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
is the density of valuable ideas,

661
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and the density of artistic merit,

662
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and that is what it's about,

663
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and that's why a game that looks like,

664
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
just for example Final Fantasy VII,

665
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
it looks pretty ass, is so widely loved,

666
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
because it is so much density.

667
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Don't say it looks ass, it has dated graphics.

668
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I don't even agree with that.

669
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The graphical design is fantastic,

670
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
it's just that it has dated graphics,

671
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
but that doesn't...

672
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I think that that game looks better

673
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
than most modern games with state-of-the-art graphics,

674
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
because the art design is great.

675
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You're shaming me, you're schooling me on my own game.

676
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Let's not even get started on stuff like Silent Hill 2,

677
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and 3 and stuff that look amazing on PS2,

678
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
and now the updates come along,

679
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and that's the version I have to play,

680
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
because I don't want to PS2.

681
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
If you guys have seen the amazing videos

682
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
by the real Silent Hill experience,

683
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
the real Silent Hill experience by Twin Perfect,

684
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the way that they so clearly lay out the case,

685
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
that in Silent Hill 3, for example,

686
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
every room had unique assets

687
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
that were specifically constructed

688
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
to evoke a specific scare and emotion for that room,

689
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
versus in downpour,

690
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
it's like the same fucking desk with pencil and paper

691
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
in the exact same location,

692
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
like a thousand times in an empty world

693
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
where there's nothing to do,

694
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and not even random spawning monsters.

695
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's the difference between creating a piece of art

696
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and creating a product, like downpour.

697
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That's right.

698
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But it's the newest one, so I gotta skip to it.

699
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The gaming press perpetuates this,

700
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
and not just in the whole buy-the-new-game thing,

701
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
in the whole recent trend of people going,

702
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
finally, games are getting good.

703
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And I'm not saying there aren't great games at the moment,

704
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
but there's this culture that...

705
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, the whole Citizen Kane game

706
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
has become legitimized only recently.

707
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Everyone was retarded before no one

708
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
you had to make a game for the PS3.

709
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The fucked up part is in any other medium,

710
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I feel like you would get laughed out of a room

711
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
if you tried to be a critic who hasn't seen the classics.

712
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
If you're a film critic,

713
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and you haven't seen Citizen Kane,

714
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
then people are gonna be like,

715
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
what the fuck are you doing?

716
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Why have you not seen the Godfather?

717
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I've never seen the Godfather,

718
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
but I'm gonna review a gangster movie.

719
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
People are gonna be like, why would you ever do that?

720
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You clearly have no context into what gangster movies are,

721
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
because you haven't seen what is considered

722
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
by many to be the greatest film of all time.

723
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Did you? All old games are problematic,

724
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
so there's no reason to go back and watch them.

725
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You know, guys, the real question I have here

726
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
is why are schools wasting our time teaching our kids

727
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
with these old-ass books for grandpas?

728
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You know, like, Catcher of the Rye is a million years old.

729
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Let's move on. We've got, you know...

730
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah, we got the right to.

731
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We read an old book like Catcher of the Rye.

732
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You know, Crime and Punishment was great.

733
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Crime and Punishment was great, but we've got a new version.

734
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's called Death Note. It's better in every way.

735
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Let's just all read Death Note instead.

736
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It is replaced. It is superseded in artistic merit in every way.

737
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That's what I'm saying.

738
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
People were fucking Neanderthals until recently,

739
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
when we got iPhones.

740
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
There's something so, like, sad to me

741
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
about the idea that we have, like, so much gaming criticism,

742
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and none of it's looking back.

743
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And, like...

744
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You know, I've made this point before,

745
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and Endless Jess had a great video

746
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
called Fuck the Citizen Kane of Gaming,

747
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and both of us were kind of making the point that, like...

748
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
If there's a Citizen Kane of Gaming,

749
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
it's fucking Super Mario Brothers.

750
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You know, like, that's a classic game.

751
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Every element of it is amazing.

752
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You know, it still holds up to this day.

753
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
People still play it.

754
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's been beloved for decades by people around the world.

755
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
How is that not, like, an impeccable classic game?

756
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And how can you really, like, talk about games as a medium

757
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
without knowing about it, you know?

758
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I agree. I completely agree with that.

759
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It's the Gazomp-Gazverk, or whatever that word was.

760
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah, Gazomp. I'm not gonna try.

761
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Watch that video by Mr. Beaton. That's the one.

762
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah.

763
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Like, I find that this is just me personally,

764
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
but...

765
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And, like, I'm becoming, like...

766
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I guess maybe this even makes me, like, a cred-fag,

767
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but it's, like, I find that, at least with me,

768
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
just in terms of this Citizen of Gaming as Super Mario Brothers thing,

769
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I find, like, a lot of people love in America, like, Tatari,

770
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and a lot of people in Britain, like, ZX Spectrum and stuff,

771
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
but, like, it feels like, to me...

772
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
To what?

773
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The modern video game began with Super Mario Brothers.

774
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Like, if you think about it, like, that's the point to me

775
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
where I'm like, damn, games got good.

776
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Like, finally, you know, that's how I feel, at least.

777
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Did any of you guys even beat the original Super Mario Bros?

778
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Or am I hanging out with a bunch of cr-

779
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I have.

780
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I have.

781
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I beat it on Game Boy in, like, the third grade.

782
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I remember doing it well.

783
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Dude, World 8 is no joke.

784
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Like, World 8 is no joke.

785
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's a hard game, dude.

786
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I have beaten Super Mario Brothers by use of save states.

787
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah, alright.

788
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And by which I mean...

789
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
By which I mean, I save state after every jump.

790
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Every jump.

791
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah.

792
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That's how I got through that game.

793
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Dude, yo, this neg over here maps save and reload save state

794
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
to the X and Y of his controller when he's playing.

795
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You just don't know when you're going to run into a credit flag.

796
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's like every...

797
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
No, I said...

798
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
That game is fucking hard.

799
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's hard.

800
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's hard.

801
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's true.

802
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And it's hard in a way that's in fear.

803
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Like, the thing is, I mean, there's an extent to which I'm like,

804
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
alright, you have to see everything in order to talk about stuff.

805
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But there's also an extent to which it's like,

806
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm not going to play a game I hate, you know.

807
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

808
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Mario Bros. is not my type of game.

809
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like, it's...

810
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
The fucking live system alone is enough to make me not want to play it.

811
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's designed to be played forever and it's like,

812
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I now live in a world where there's a thousand games I could be playing

813
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
as opposed to one that was the one that came with my console

814
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
when I was eight and I had all the time in the world.

815
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I feel like Mario Bros. is a lot easier to play through

816
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
in that circumstance as opposed to, like, getting frustrated

817
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and knowing that I could put it down and go do anything else, you know.

818
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah.

819
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I say, like, saying that Super Mario Bros. is like,

820
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
where I think games got good makes me a cred fag

821
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
because now it's like, hey man, you didn't play Atari.

822
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You don't know what it's like.

823
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You can't appreciate Mario Bros.

824
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Oh, yeah.

825
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Well, you know, like, the distinction between the modern era of video games.

826
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That's true.

827
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm just distinguishing errors.

828
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I will say, I feel like a cred fag now

829
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
because of the fact that I have always looked,

830
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
like, there's certain Atari games.

831
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Like, Adventure is considered to be, like, the first, like,

832
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
adventure game, first RPG.

833
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And, like, I always see it on lists of, like, the best ever

834
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
just because it's the first, so people feel the need to list it.

835
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But I always look at it and I'm like, yeah, but it looks like shit.

836
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So, obviously, who cares.

837
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But then it's like, well, I haven't actually played it.

838
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
What if it's actually really great, you know, for reasons

839
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I couldn't possibly foresee by looking at the graphics.

840
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's like the grand scheme of the medium, though.

841
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Obviously, if you're looking at a franchise or a series,

842
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
like, isolated from the rest, it's like, obviously,

843
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
if you're skipping around, then obviously, you know.

844
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's tough, man.

845
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You've gone full cred on that one.

846
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But, you know, really, we should, like, we're all in the spectrum.

847
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
We're all in the cred fag spectrum.

848
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
We're all in the cred fag spectrum.

849
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I haven't played, I haven't beaten Sound Hill 1,

850
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
but I absolutely love Sound Hill 2 and 3.

851
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Maybe I'll get to 4 someday.

852
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And, you know, I feel a little bad about that,

853
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
that I played 3 without playing 1, so I don't have, like, all the content.

854
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But, you know, you only have so many hours in a day, you know.

855
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'll do it someday.

856
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I want to play.

857
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If I had to put up an argument to people who are, like, you know,

858
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
who never go back and who, like, just look at them as, like, old games,

859
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
it's like, dude, if they're made a franchise out of it,

860
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
chances are the first game was great.

861
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Like, there's got to be a reason people liked it enough

862
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
that they could afford to make another one, right?

863
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That's a good argument.

864
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The reason these, like, I mean, people will say, like,

865
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
well, okay, but the technology's gotten better, but we've built on it.

866
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But, yeah, but at the same time, those old games have,

867
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
they have an art to them.

868
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It's not just about the technology.

869
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And, like, you know, I went back a couple years ago and played Zelda 1,

870
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
and I thought it was fucking phenomenal.

871
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And it's a style of game, no other Zelda game has been.

872
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You know, they've all sort of, none of them have that same free form,

873
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
roaming, just exploring, having to find everything for yourself.

874
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And, like, if you just look at a picture of Zelda 1,

875
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
it just looks like, eh, but the graphics are,

876
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
how am I ever going to feel a sense of adventure?

877
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I had a similar experience with that,

878
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
because, like, I remember playing Zelda 1 when I was a kid,

879
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and I was like, oh.

880
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But then, like, I played it, like, recently, again, I'm like,

881
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
this is amazing.

882
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Like, this is, like, open-ended.

883
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
People out there deeply misunderstand, you know,

884
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
it's just what we were saying before.

885
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah, they don't appreciate the way that it is the sum total of the parts

886
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
of a game that determined the quality,

887
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
which is why, you know, we've talked about this before,

888
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
like, they can show us all these previews for a game like Final Fantasy XV,

889
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
but ultimately, what do we really know,

890
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
not a heck of a lot about how it's going to be as a whole game,

891
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
which is what ultimately matters in the end, you know?

892
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And, like, my brother, Victor, like, again, Ultimate Cred-Fag,

893
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
like, he's a huge die-hard Zelda fan, you know,

894
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and we both got into Zelda through Ocarina of Time.

895
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
What is his title now? He's the Ultimate Cred-Fag?

896
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Right.

897
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
He's going to listen to this, too.

898
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
He will.

899
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But we both got into Zelda with Ocarina of Time,

900
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and, like, you know, he's played all the other ones since then,

901
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
whether it's 2D or 3D,

902
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
he's played all the ones since Ocarina of Time,

903
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
but he's never gone back and played Zelda 1,

904
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and he's barely played a Link to the Past, if at all.

905
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And, like, to him, it's like he sees it as, yeah,

906
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
like, for me, Zelda is all about the big, the feeling of scale

907
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
and the bigness, you know, his favorite one's Twilight Princess,

908
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
because it looks epic.

909
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And I'm like, yeah, but if you actually played Zelda 1,

910
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
what you'll find is that the graphics, that fades away,

911
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and mechanically, you feel like you're on an epic adventure

912
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
because you have to find everything yourself.

913
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And it's such an interesting feeling to, like, learn this map

914
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
to go back and forth to all these locations

915
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and figure things out that, eventually,

916
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
it feels like an epic adventure,

917
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and you can't get that through screen caps, you know?

918
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I do sympathize with his position, just in the sense that it sounds like

919
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
he doesn't really experience what you're talking about.

920
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Like, he's not really familiar with that particular motion.

921
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But he has no idea, because he hasn't played Zelda 1, you know?

922
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, sure.

923
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
That's an experience he hasn't had yet, maybe.

924
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm not trying to show you, Victor, but he hasn't had it,

925
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
so if he had experienced it, that would open his mind to other things

926
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
that he can experience, but I get his argument.

927
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It logically makes sense from his perspective,

928
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
but obviously, you know, there's more out there.

929
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I think that there's an extent to which we've been playing these games,

930
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
like, we'll play these Zelda games on DigiBros,

931
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
and he never wants to play an older one,

932
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
because he's like, it won't, you know,

933
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm just going to get bored, I'm going to zone out and stuff,

934
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and I'm like, well, okay, I don't think we should play any of them first on there.

935
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I don't think your first experience with the game should ever be on Let's Play Show.

936
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah, I agree.

937
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If he sat down and played Zelda 1, I think he'd like it,

938
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and I think you have to be willing to try, you know?

939
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's true.

940
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I mean, if you're going to consider yourself a huge Zelda fan, why would you not?

941
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Why would you not go back and do Zelda 1, you know?

942
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Do you want to, every time that you say you're a huge Zelda fan,

943
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Victor, put that little asterisk there, like,

944
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
oh, but I haven't played any of them before, link to the fucking Ocarina Time, you know?

945
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Yeah, me and Hayden were actually talking about how Zelda is like the biggest

946
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Kred Fag series of all time.

947
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
That's true.

948
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's got such like fake, complex lore, you know what I mean?

949
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, like the timeline.

950
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
There really is no lore, it's just stuff they made up in the game,

951
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
but it's like, yo man, the timeline, like, it blows my mind when I see people talking about it.

952
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I don't know why, people's investment in the timeline baffles me,

953
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
because it doesn't matter at all.

954
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It has no narrative importance.

955
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I find it so crazy when new Zelda gets shown,

956
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and people are trying to decipher where it takes place in the timeline.

957
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter!

958
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It makes literally zero narrative difference.

959
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The people who make the games literally gave you a timeline,

960
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
because you wanted a timeline, not because there was a timeline,

961
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
they made one up, because...

962
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm sure they only came up with that as of Skyward Sword.

963
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Right, but that's the thing, like, bringing it back to what we first said,

964
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
like, playing a series in release order,

965
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
like, where you're talking about how he doesn't want to go back and play the original Zelda's,

966
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
because they're not as epic as the new ones.

967
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
That's the problem, that's why I don't want people to go and play the more recent games,

968
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
because then it makes the original games,

969
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
which had the original ideas, which came up with these mechanics,

970
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
which started this all, which eventually led up to this game you love,

971
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
you know, like, that now looks like a piece of shit,

972
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
because now it's been topped by its sequels.

973
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
But I guess if you play it in release order,

974
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
you're going to be like, that was awesome, then play the next one, that was awesome!

975
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Right, and that's such another great advantage to playing things in release order,

976
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
as you can see the progression of things,

977
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and even if they're negative, ultimately,

978
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
like, to go, I think a lot of people who just blindly transitioned from pixels to 3D,

979
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
you know, there was obviously some sloppy shit going on there for a while.

980
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's interesting to see that.

981
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I love it, because especially in games,

982
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
like, I feel like more than any other medium,

983
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
it's like you play a game on one console,

984
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and then like years later, you jump to the next game,

985
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and it's like the world looks different, you know, the characters look different.

986
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
You're experiencing this upgrade, because it's like,

987
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
it's like you're now seeing the vision of the creators

988
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
for a new lens of what they can now do, what they wanted it to originally look like.

989
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That's what's so exciting about Yakuza 6,

990
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
that's what's so exciting about it.

991
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And don't go thinking people that that means like,

992
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
oh, that means actually just play the lace one,

993
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
because it's the closest to their artistic vision.

994
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
No, that's not how it works.

995
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You know, I want to speak directly to CredFags,

996
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
because I have two pieces of advice.

997
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
My first piece, because you all know who you are,

998
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
if you've been listening to this, you figure it out.

999
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Two pieces of advice.

1000
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
One, try them all even if you don't necessarily beat them.

1001
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Like you don't have to, like if you go back to Elder Scrolls,

1002
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
like each one is unique and has its own pieces of intrigue.

1003
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
If you start up Daggerfall and you immediately want to vomit, as I do,

1004
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
because the way that the perspective is and the way,

1005
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
not just that the graphics aren't good,

1006
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
but that the way they're presented is like nauseating,

1007
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
in a way that only a 90s first-person PC game could be.

1008
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Fine, at least give it a shot.

1009
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I mean, some of you might play it and realize,

1010
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
hey, these graphics don't nauseate me at all.

1011
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Here's what you'll get out of it.

1012
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Daggerfall has the biggest map in any video game ever.

1013
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
People talk about Skyrim has a huge map, right?

1014
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Skyrim has a six...

1015
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It's the size of Great Britain in Daggerfall, isn't it?

1016
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Yes, Daggerfall is actually larger than Great Britain.

1017
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
To put that into perspective, Skyrim is about 16 square miles in size,

1018
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and Daggerfall is like 20,000 square miles or something like that.

1019
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh my God.

1020
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Well, games have just gotten better and better, guys.

1021
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Only today have they finally achieved that.

1022
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Well, look at these technological wonders we've got now

1023
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
that can make such huge maps.

1024
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Fuck yourself, people.

1025
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I believe it's procedurally generated, I think.

1026
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But I think it might be in the same way as...

1027
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
What's it called?

1028
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Oblivion, where oblivion was a procedurally generated map

1029
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
that was then solidified and they put it in the game.

1030
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But oblivion was like 10 square miles or something like that.

1031
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Daggerfall is fucking massive.

1032
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So if that sounds interesting to you,

1033
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
then if you play the game and then you find that out,

1034
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
then there might be someone who starts off thinking,

1035
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
well, this isn't going to be as good as Skyrim,

1036
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
but then you find out that there's something so unique about it

1037
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
that it ends up actually being your favorite one.

1038
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's like such a fallacy that the newer stuff is better,

1039
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
because it's like, oh man, when assets were more simple

1040
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
and they didn't take as long to make and it wasn't as expensive,

1041
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
we could make more game.

1042
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
And now we can't.

1043
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
You see so many sequels that are like,

1044
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
we removed this feature and this feature and this feature,

1045
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
because they didn't have time to do it.

1046
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And the real issue with this whole thing is that

1047
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
it's a vicious cycle of, you know,

1048
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
there is consumer, quote unquote, demand

1049
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
for like higher resolution stuff as in the meme is

1050
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
that it has to be, you know, like Square Enix's thing,

1051
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
it has to be picture perfect,

1052
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
like the best possible have to spend all the resources

1053
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
making Lightning's tits move in a slightly more realistic way

1054
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
than anything else.

1055
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And then the resources get diverted there

1056
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
because there's this perceived demand for that

1057
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
as opposed to artistic...

1058
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Well, part of the problem is fucking...

1059
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I think part of the problem is review scores.

1060
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Well, Lightning's tits, I mean, okay, we all want that.

1061
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Aside from that...

1062
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
There's a lot of Japanese developers

1063
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
who seem to perfectly understand this.

1064
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And when a new game comes out from like Nipponichi

1065
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
or Falcom or like most of the things that are published by Atlas,

1066
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
like those games tend to look old,

1067
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
but they also tend to have way more content

1068
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
than any newer games.

1069
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And you end up with a situation where like...

1070
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
You can play Disgaea for literally forever,

1071
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
as I recall.

1072
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Right, and they keep making new Disgaea

1073
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and they all look like Disgaea 1.

1074
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
The textures are in HD now,

1075
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
but they're still fucking the same pixel art drawings, right?

1076
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I think...

1077
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Oh, sorry, go on.

1078
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I think like, you know, those games are still as big as ever.

1079
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You can still play a new Disgaea for 80 to 300 hours, you know?

1080
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And I think that when these games get...

1081
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
When you open up a game in former magazine,

1082
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
the game they're going to give a 10 out of 10

1083
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
is going to be the one, the BioShock Infinite,

1084
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
the one that like looks beautiful

1085
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and looks like it's, you know, modern and cutting edge

1086
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and it seems to be saying something with its story, so...

1087
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
10 out of 10, you know?

1088
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Like God of War 4, looking for that 10 out of 10.

1089
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So I think...

1090
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You've got Trails of...

1091
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Sorry, you've got like Trails of Cold Steel coming out

1092
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
or something like that, which I haven't played this myself,

1093
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
but like I've heard from our friend Mother's Basement,

1094
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
like it's like one of his favorite games of all time.

1095
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And that game is like pixel art,

1096
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
but it's like a huge, unbelievably massive world,

1097
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
you know, with all these different moving parts.

1098
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Every NPC has a story and stuff

1099
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and there's side quests everywhere and like,

1100
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
if that game, even if that game was perfect at what it wanted to do,

1101
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
if you open up a Game Informer, that score will never be above an 8.5.

1102
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It will not happen because it doesn't look like a 10

1103
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and they won't give it a 10, you know?

1104
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And it's just all about the different standards

1105
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
that they're using to judge versus guys like us?

1106
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Right.

1107
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
They're only going to give the 10 to the big modern game.

1108
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I once went to like the library in my university

1109
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
and they had like a bunch of old gaming magazines.

1110
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
They had like reviews from like the 90s.

1111
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Ah, cool.

1112
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And they had like a big compilation of like loads of scores

1113
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
they gave to games in like the end of the 90s.

1114
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And you won't believe it.

1115
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It's like, they like review like these polygon, like horrible messes.

1116
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Like, oh yes, Siphon, you know, I haven't played Siphon yet.

1117
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Maybe it's really good.

1118
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But it's like, oh, it's like this polygonal, like,

1119
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
like terrible draw distance game, like 9 out of 10.

1120
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And then it's like, well, simply of the night,

1121
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
it doesn't seem to really be pushing any boundaries here.

1122
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It just seems like a Super Nintendo game.

1123
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Nothing to see here.

1124
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Six out of 10.

1125
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And then it's like...

1126
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
There's no X.

1127
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
There's no X.

1128
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah.

1129
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I do think the reviews have gotten slightly better,

1130
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
because it used to be you'd read a review and it'd be like,

1131
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
there'd be sections and it'd be like graphics,

1132
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
five out of 10 gameplay.

1133
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And it's like, if the graphics weren't out of 10,

1134
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
then it wouldn't be a 10.

1135
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It's like, at least now people are moving away a bit from scores

1136
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
and that kind of rhetoric.

1137
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
The thing is like, I've never read reviews.

1138
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I've never given a shit.

1139
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
If there was ever a review, all I'd do is look at the pictures

1140
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
and then be like...

1141
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Well, I grew up on reviews.

1142
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Like, how I got into doing this kind of writing

1143
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
is that I would read like, Nintendo Power Magazine

1144
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and as a teenager, I read a lot of GameStop reviews

1145
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and I was always fascinated with the scores.

1146
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Because to me, growing up, it always seemed like

1147
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
knowing what is the highest scored game

1148
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
tells me what are the classics.

1149
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
If I know that GameStop gave their highest score ever

1150
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
to Metroid Prime for the longest time,

1151
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
then I now need to go play Metroid Prime.

1152
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And when you find a reviewer who you really trust their scores,

1153
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
then that can be really helpful.

1154
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Because I used to really trust...

1155
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Have I been saying stop? I meant spot. GameSpot.

1156
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I used to really trust the game in Britain, then he went to shit.

1157
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Well, you surely trust GameSpot because of the fact

1158
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
that they were super strict with their scores.

1159
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
They only gave the high scores to very rarely.

1160
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And so I always thought, cool, those must be the true classic games.

1161
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
But then, over time, I realized that they fall into the same trap

1162
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
everyone else does of if it's not new and modern

1163
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and a big fucking graphical powerhouse,

1164
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
it's not going to get that 10.

1165
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Even if you make the best JRPG of all time,

1166
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
it will not get a 10 because it's a JRPG.

1167
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The YouTube evolution of reviews is a really great thing,

1168
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and it's got positive and negatives,

1169
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
but it's so great to really be able to get deep into like...

1170
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
You don't have like one page to fill with text,

1171
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and that's all you get.

1172
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
You can have a guy like, you know, a bunny hop

1173
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
going into like the history and make a half an hour fucking video

1174
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
about every little detail you could ever want to know

1175
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and why this game is an artistic masterpiece

1176
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
for collecting all these various aspects

1177
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
from all the different games in the series

1178
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
and presenting them in this way

1179
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
that will perfectly capture everything

1180
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
that longtime fans of that series has wanted.

1181
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
That's what's really valuable.

1182
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That's the kind of review that has real merit in the world.

1183
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Well, I think these journalists are like,

1184
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
what the fuck?

1185
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I got to keep my finger on the pulse of the gaming landscape.

1186
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
What am I doing wasting my time with this game

1187
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
that looks like a fucking PS2 game or whatever, you know?

1188
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So they're like, fuck, just get it over with.

1189
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah, whatever, 7.2.

1190
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
They come in, I think it's like people who,

1191
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
they jump in and then like, they just have to go,

1192
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
because news happens fast, right?

1193
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I know a lot of anime fans who get into anime

1194
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
because they saw one or two older shows

1195
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and then they start watching current stuff.

1196
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And if you're trying to keep up with current stuff consistently,

1197
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
it can take up all your free time

1198
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
because there's 45 fucking shows that come out each season.

1199
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And so I know a lot of people

1200
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
who pretty much never watch older anime, you know?

1201
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I think Jeff somewhat falls into this trap

1202
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
where like, I only ever hear Jeff talk about watching current shit, you know?

1203
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Kind of.

1204
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And like, to me, that stuff is,

1205
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
like, because current anime lets you be a part of the conversation for now,

1206
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
but what it doesn't do is give you perspective on what's been great, you know?

1207
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Like, if this current season that has just started,

1208
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
there's not a single show on right now

1209
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
that I like immediately think this is going to be talked about in five years,

1210
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
you know, like, nothing gives me that impression,

1211
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
whereas you can go watch a show that has been talked about for five years,

1212
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
and now you're going to get like a new perspective on the history of the medium

1213
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and what, like, what highs it can reach and like, you know,

1214
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and that will enrich you for the future

1215
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
when you actually want to talk about like, deeper shit.

1216
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
You know, if you want to talk about a new game and be like,

1217
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
this is how it reflects the state of gaming,

1218
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
you need to know the state of gaming, you know?

1219
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Dude, that's really cool because in terms of games,

1220
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
if you think back to like, from like just five years ago,

1221
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
what are the games that have stood a test of time and are imitating now?

1222
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
You think of stuff like Dark Souls,

1223
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
which was like a low-budget JRPG made in like a million bucks

1224
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
that like wasn't cutting edge, no one really knew about it,

1225
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
had a small, had a slow sort of like, ascent into popularity,

1226
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
and now that's the game everyone wants to be

1227
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and all the mechanics, loads of RPGs copy,

1228
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and that's why, and that's exactly why,

1229
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
like just because the game is the prettiest and the most hype

1230
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
doesn't mean it's going to be the most relevant.

1231
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
That's a good point, man.

1232
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
No one's going to fucking, no one's going to care about,

1233
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
like, because that year, I think Dark Souls came out in 2011,

1234
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
and so this would be before Bioshock Infinite and stuff,

1235
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
but like, what would you say are some games from 2011

1236
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
that were like big then, you know,

1237
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
like Skyrim, Skyward Sword, Uncharted 3,

1238
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Deus Exe Revolution, Batman Arkham City,

1239
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
does anyone still boot up Batman Arkham City, you know?

1240
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Right, baby.

1241
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Like, I think a game, I think a series like the Souls games,

1242
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
like each one has been such a big deal that yeah,

1243
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
it'll be talked about forever, it'll influence a million games,

1244
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
there's been countless articles written on it,

1245
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
it's studied in academia, you know.

1246
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You know what game came out in 2011?

1247
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Minecraft.

1248
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Oh, well that's, I mean, that is a big deal.

1249
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
People are still talking about Dark Souls 1

1250
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
more than they do fucking Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3,

1251
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
or even Bloodborne.

1252
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I mean, I tried to, I was trying to like,

1253
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
find something from 2011, but like,

1254
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
even to use Bioshock Infinite from 2012 or 13,

1255
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
it might have been 2012, now that I think about it.

1256
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I think it was 2012, I want to say.

1257
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
That game was such a big deal when it came out,

1258
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and I don't think anyone cares anymore.

1259
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Like, no one goes back to play Bioshock Infinite again.

1260
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It's not going to be like...

1261
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh, thank God, yes, just waiting.

1262
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Like, you can buy that game for $5 at a bargain bin

1263
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
at fucking GameStop, you know, but like,

1264
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
that's a game that I don't think is going to have

1265
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
nearly the cultural footprint that a Dark Souls has, you know.

1266
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It got exposed as the piece of shit it was right after it came out.

1267
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
It got exposed quite a bit.

1268
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I think I saw someone link to an article the other day

1269
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
where it was like, a reviewer for like,

1270
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Eurogame I think, taught like, he did an article on Bioshock

1271
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
and I wasn't talking about how, man, I way overhyped this game.

1272
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I remember it today.

1273
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And now we're going to...

1274
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Every...

1275
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Does that mean...

1276
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Overhyped, yeah.

1277
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I think I get it.

1278
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I live in Britain, I don't get it.

1279
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
You know, right now, we're going to get like,

1280
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
No Man's Sky is like a new game.

1281
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Well, I don't know what it's even talking about it,

1282
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
really, even though it's not.

1283
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
People at my work are talking about it,

1284
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
it's going to be the most epic game ever, dude.

1285
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Right, like, a game like that comes out,

1286
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and like, again, for a week,

1287
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
it's going to be a big deal,

1288
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
everyone's going to play that,

1289
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
but imagine if all those...

1290
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Imagine, just for a second,

1291
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
if everyone who played No Man's Sky

1292
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
instead played like, Deus Ex.

1293
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Like, everyone just took a classic game

1294
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
that everyone agrees is a classic,

1295
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and we all just decided to play that

1296
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
instead of the one new game.

1297
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Because here's...

1298
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
This was my other advice.

1299
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Back when I said I had two pieces of advice

1300
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
to the people who are...

1301
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
What's the word we're using?

1302
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
CredFag.

1303
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
The other piece of advice is,

1304
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
like, and Charlie was kind of saying this before,

1305
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
it's still the same amount of content

1306
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
to play like an older one, right?

1307
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Like, people think of it as,

1308
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
oh man, I have to play through

1309
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
all these Yakuza games, right?

1310
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
But like, you can probably beat a Yakuza game

1311
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
in like two days,

1312
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
and so playing through six Yakuza games

1313
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
is going to take you like a week and a half.

1314
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
How long did it take you to play through all of them

1315
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
for your next favorite video?

1316
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It actually took me a while.

1317
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Over the course of like a year,

1318
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I recorded footage for that video.

1319
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Okay, but it's not like the games themselves are that long.

1320
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Hey man, Hayden gets distracted easily.

1321
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's not like he was late playing shit back to back.

1322
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
He also, he has a job and...

1323
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
You know, point me.

1324
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Quick, backtrack!

1325
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Like, I mean, if it's all the Final Fantasy games,

1326
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
that's going to take you a while.

1327
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
But even then, like,

1328
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
when I play through a game,

1329
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I usually play through it really fast.

1330
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I play through it in like one or two sittings.

1331
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I did all the Souls games in a week,

1332
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
like at the start of this year.

1333
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I played through Bloodborne in three days,

1334
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
then I did Dark Souls in two days,

1335
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Demon Souls in two days,

1336
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and Dark Souls three in two days.

1337
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Yeah, I did Bloodborne first.

1338
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I had played the other ones before.

1339
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I just never beat any of them.

1340
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Bloodborne is what made you want to play those other ones,

1341
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
as I recall.

1342
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Well, it was that Bloodborne existed,

1343
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and Bloodborne is like perfectly my aesthetic,

1344
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
and it was like a game that I felt I had to play.

1345
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
So you were saying it was hyped up,

1346
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
and you felt like you wanted to be part of the conversation?

1347
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Well, I didn't...

1348
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
No, I played it a year after it came out,

1349
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
so it was definitely not still hype.

1350
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I resisted hype forever,

1351
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
because I actually wanted to play...

1352
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Like I said, I'd gotten halfway through Dark Souls 1,

1353
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
and I'd played a bunch of Demon Souls.

1354
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I knew about the series since it came out,

1355
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and then everyone was hype about Bloodborne,

1356
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
and I refused to play it because of the load times.

1357
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I was like, I will not touch this game until they fix the fucking load times.

1358
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I played that whole fucking game through with those load times,

1359
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and then after I beat it...

1360
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
But the funny thing is, because I didn't...

1361
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I feel like, because I didn't ride the hype wave,

1362
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
which would have done nothing for me to play it when it was hype,

1363
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
it made no difference that I played it a year later.

1364
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I still loved the game,

1365
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
and I feel like I got a better experience out of it for waiting,

1366
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and my brother Victor makes it out like I'm weird for that.

1367
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
He was talking about Pokemon Go came out,

1368
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
and I wouldn't play it because it was so fucking broken,

1369
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
and Victor was like,

1370
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
but it's what everyone's doing,

1371
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
and I'm like, yeah, it sucks!

1372
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It's a shit game,

1373
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
and then they finally made it playable,

1374
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and now I'm willing to play it.

1375
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And he was telling his girlfriend,

1376
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
he even played Bloodborne just because of the load screens.

1377
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I'm like, that's what a sensible person does.

1378
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
That's a pretty reasonable decision.

1379
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Victor clearly values the sense of community involved.

1380
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Because they said when they were going to patch it,

1381
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
when the game came out, they were like,

1382
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
yeah, we're going to have a patch at the end of the month,

1383
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
and I was like, okay, I'll wait for the end of the month.

1384
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
There you go, I can go do something else.

1385
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And that's what I mean when I'm saying that playing another game

1386
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
takes just as long.

1387
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You're always thinking Deus Ex is this old game,

1388
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
it's considered a classic, everyone loves it,

1389
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
it's considered one of the best games of all time,

1390
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
but I don't want to have to put the time into playing this old game.

1391
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It'll take you just as long as playing a new game,

1392
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
which is a couple days.

1393
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Take out one of the new games you're going to play,

1394
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
and go play Deus Ex.

1395
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Especially if you're just a regular person

1396
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
who only plays games for entertainment.

1397
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I think this is something me and Hayden run into,

1398
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
sometimes, where it's like,

1399
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
we've got loads of video ideas we want to make,

1400
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and so whenever we're playing a game,

1401
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
we're thinking in the back of our minds,

1402
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
man, I could be playing a game

1403
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
that I should be making a video on right now.

1404
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
That's the trap I fall into.

1405
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
The reason I haven't played the Witcher games

1406
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
is that BunnyHup already did such a good job

1407
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
of talking about them,

1408
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
that I know I can't make a video about the Witcher games,

1409
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
so it's harder to justify them.

1410
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
That Hearthstone DLC looks tight as fuck.

1411
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I want to get into that shit.

1412
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
How can I justify over 100 hours into a game

1413
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
that doesn't impact my career at all?

1414
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It would just be leisure time.

1415
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Imagine that.

1416
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Just have an anime playing in, like, the background.

1417
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Adopt of course, so you can hear it.

1418
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Adopt of course.

1419
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You still play the game, obviously, you know.

1420
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Right.

1421
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
If you watch the Tales of Zestiria anime,

1422
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
you can review the game and the anime

1423
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
at the same time.

1424
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Dude, I don't want to do that.

1425
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
No one should do that.

1426
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So what you're telling me about Dark Souls is

1427
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
you didn't play Kingsfield first.

1428
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Oh!

1429
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Let's leave over here.

1430
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It's funny you say that, though,

1431
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
because I have always wanted to try to play

1432
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
every From Software game.

1433
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
That's how my mind works, is I play Dark Souls

1434
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
and I'm like, I want to know everything

1435
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
these guys have done.

1436
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Because surely they've done great shit.

1437
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Surely Kingsfield has awesome elements to it.

1438
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But it inspired Souls later.

1439
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I knew about Demon's Souls because

1440
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
my friend was a huge Armored Core fan,

1441
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
so now I want to play

1442
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
all the Armored Core games as well.

1443
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I'm differentiating between two tiers of

1444
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Cred because when we're looking at

1445
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Cred as in,

1446
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
there's a story and I want to

1447
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
experience it, but then I want to jump around

1448
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and just get the important stuff and get the Cred.

1449
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
And then there's this whole

1450
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
in an analytical sense.

1451
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
If you want to play the Dark Souls series

1452
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and play the Dark Souls series,

1453
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
don't skip around, play the Dark Souls series.

1454
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And now if you want to have

1455
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
an analytical idea of the

1456
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
entire design of Dark Souls, then you should

1457
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
play the Demon's Souls and all the other games.

1458
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I think we've stumbled upon a thing with Cred Fags.

1459
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
There's actually two ends to

1460
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
the spectrum of Cred Faggery.

1461
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And each end is actually

1462
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Cred Fags. Like going too far in the other direction

1463
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
is also a bad thing.

1464
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
If you're just playing anything just for the Cred,

1465
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
you didn't play this,

1466
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
you didn't play that.

1467
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I don't want to play them all

1468
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
just so I can laugh at people, but

1469
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I do think some do.

1470
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Well, because once you start looking

1471
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
into this stuff, and we've talked about it a lot

1472
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
in this podcast, so now no one in our audience

1473
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
can claim ignorance of this fact anymore.

1474
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
That

1475
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
the new ones aren't always the best, right?

1476
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And my friend who played

1477
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
who was a huge Armored Core fan,

1478
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
he always said that 4

1479
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
toned it down a lot. It made it a lot more simple

1480
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and accessible because

1481
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
they wanted the

1482
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Cred Fag audience. They want the people

1483
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
who don't, because Armored Core

1484
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
is never a super successful series, so

1485
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
you obviously toned it down a little bit for new players.

1486
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And then Armored Core 5 came out

1487
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
and my friend didn't even like it.

1488
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Huge fan of the franchise doesn't even like the newest one.

1489
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So really, you got to play 2 or 3.

1490
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Those are the most acclaimed ones.

1491
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And I can totally see people who

1492
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
play Dark Souls going, I want to know

1493
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
what From Software did before.

1494
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I'm going to play Armored Core 5.

1495
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
That seems like, you can totally

1496
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
see that you understand this happening,

1497
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
but you should say

1498
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I want to know where Dark Souls came from.

1499
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'm going to play Armored Core 1

1500
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
on the PS1, or at least 2 or 3

1501
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
because they're the ones that

1502
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
at least look into it and find out which ones

1503
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
people actually care about.

1504
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And that's the thing about us, because we're analytically

1505
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
minded, bringing it way back

1506
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
to what you were saying before. It's like we care about

1507
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
the context of the series

1508
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
as it moves forward.

1509
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
We want to

1510
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
criticize the story, its gameplay mechanics

1511
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and stuff like that. We want to see how it evolved

1512
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
over the course.

1513
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's like ignorant of a certain aspect of it.

1514
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
What we're trying to say to people is that we're

1515
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
smarter than you and you're all dummies.

1516
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And I don't care about your opinion.

1517
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
That's the summary here.

1518
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Well, that's true.

1519
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I just think, I guess what we're really arguing for

1520
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
is not so much to say that we're

1521
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
necessarily better, but that we want

1522
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
more people to feel the way we do

1523
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
because it would make for

1524
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
better conversations and

1525
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
my brother being such a huge Zelda fan,

1526
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I would love to be able to talk to him

1527
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
about Zelda 1.

1528
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
He's never fucking played it.

1529
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I've begged him to for years now

1530
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and he won't play it.

1531
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I think we can have such a more interesting

1532
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
conversation about Zelda.

1533
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
We've got all these people like me

1534
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
who played Zelda 1, who are so excited about

1535
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
this new game.

1536
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Breath of the Wild, is that what it's called?

1537
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Because it goes back to that shit, man.

1538
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It's going to take it back.

1539
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It's using the Zelda 1 formula.

1540
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
There's people like me

1541
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I know Matthew Matos has mentioned this

1542
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
in his live stream

1543
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
and someone else did.

1544
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Maybe it was one of you guys, but

1545
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
we're all like, yeah, wow, this looks like

1546
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Zelda 1, that's really cool.

1547
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And people who, Jesus Christ.

1548
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Never played that.

1549
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I think a tree just got knocked down

1550
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
right near my house.

1551
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Holy shit.

1552
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
The cred facts are coming, man.

1553
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
They're coming at you.

1554
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Somebody draw that.

1555
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Look out the window.

1556
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Okay, while you're doing that,

1557
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
what I was going to say is

1558
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I really was...

1559
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It's not like I hate everyone who's a cred fact,

1560
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
but it's their existence that encourages

1561
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
things like

1562
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
this trend of

1563
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
casualization, that sort of thing

1564
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
where people aren't really invested in

1565
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
the things that made it great

1566
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
so much as new stuff, new technology

1567
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
and it really reminds me strongly

1568
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
of a thing like the Final Fantasy 7

1569
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
remake, which as a po...

1570
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
We don't know yet, but the signs

1571
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
are there that what they're going for

1572
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
is this kind of, like you said,

1573
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
homogenized experience of action,

1574
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
RPG...

1575
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Final Fantasy XV style.

1576
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Almost a whole other can of worms, which is like...

1577
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah.

1578
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It does encourage this, because every company...

1579
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
The big problem is that all these companies

1580
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
want to have the biggest game.

1581
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And we've talked about this before that,

1582
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
again, with those Japanese developers

1583
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
who are still sticking to their PS2

1584
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
graphics and still making big, expansive

1585
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
games with really unique systems.

1586
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Those people are making those games

1587
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
because they know that there's an audience

1588
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
who wants those systems.

1589
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Whereas Final Fantasy VII

1590
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
was a great game,

1591
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
and it had its own style,

1592
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
and the problem is not that Square Enix...

1593
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
The problem is they want a bigger audience.

1594
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
They want Final Fantasy VII to be played

1595
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
by everybody.

1596
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
They have to sell 10 million units

1597
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
because they're fucking in the red.

1598
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
They're going to make it the most broadly appealing

1599
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
game possible, which loses out on hitting

1600
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
anyone deeply, because something that's

1601
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
niche will...

1602
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
The people who are into something niche

1603
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
appreciate it way more than

1604
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
the people who are into something strong.

1605
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Some of the decisions, though, on a logical level

1606
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
just blow my mind.

1607
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
When I played the Ratchet remake,

1608
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
and I'm getting all these

1609
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
tutorial messages on where to go,

1610
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
like, you run out ammo, change weapons,

1611
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
everyone's talking to you, and I'm like,

1612
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
okay, this game is for kids, but I was a kid

1613
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
when I played the original game.

1614
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I didn't get any of this,

1615
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and I beat the game, and it wasn't like...

1616
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I'm thinking, like,

1617
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
what has changed?

1618
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Like, are kids dominoes?

1619
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Is that what they're trying to say?

1620
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Can kids not handle a more sarcastic narrative

1621
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
with under-characters?

1622
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Can kids not handle good writing anymore?

1623
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
What it really shows is that the adults

1624
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
think that the kids can't handle it.

1625
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
That's what it's really telling you.

1626
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
No, because they probably did some, like, stupid,

1627
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
like, study where they got a few kids in a room

1628
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
to play the game, and then they were like,

1629
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't know where to go for, like, two minutes.

1630
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Which is, like, too much. You gotta know

1631
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
what to do at all times. It's a larger issue, man.

1632
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
It extends to a lot of the things in our culture

1633
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and the way society's changed.

1634
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But let me ask you a question, though, about this.

1635
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Is it even possible,

1636
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
since we're talking about this, is it even possible

1637
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
to avoid this kind of cycle of

1638
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
small developer makes great game,

1639
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
it does really well,

1640
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
they grow in size, they

1641
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
get more responsibility, forcing them

1642
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
to achieve larger, more

1643
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
mainstream success, and they will just begin

1644
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
to pander, you know,

1645
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
and lose their creative spark that drive them

1646
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
in the first place. Is that an inevitable thing?

1647
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Can it be fought?

1648
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I don't know. I think, here's what I think

1649
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
is gonna happen. I think Square Enix

1650
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
is gonna burn themselves out.

1651
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Like, literally, they're gonna run out of money.

1652
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I agree. They've been losing money

1653
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
on all these fucking games.

1654
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Every single day, a new promotional

1655
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Final Fantasy XV thing comes out

1656
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
and I send it to Nate.

1657
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
It's happening every day.

1658
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Guys, let me just set the stage.

1659
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Little while ago, there was this thing called

1660
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Uncovered Final Fantasy XV,

1661
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
which was a big event for Final Fantasy XV,

1662
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
which is coming out, it was revealed

1663
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
when the release date was. At that event,

1664
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
they revealed that not only

1665
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
have they spent the money to make

1666
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
this game over the course of ten years,

1667
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
but they also

1668
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
made an anime.

1669
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
They paid for an anime. They made

1670
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
a movie. They made a fucking car.

1671
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
They've made

1672
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
so much extra shit. Two fun games.

1673
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
They didn't have to spend money on.

1674
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
They chose to, and they have to make

1675
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
that kind of money back.

1676
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And here's the question. Here's the question.

1677
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
If Final Fantasy XV had come out five years ago

1678
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
with PS2 graphics,

1679
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
would it be a lesser experience?

1680
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
No, it would have had gameplay.

1681
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
It could have been a story or whatever.

1682
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
It could have been just as

1683
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
hard-hitting and just as good.

1684
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
What I think is going to happen,

1685
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I think we're going to see,

1686
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I think Final Fantasy XV,

1687
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
which it could sell five million copies

1688
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
and still tank in terms of

1689
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
what they needed to make, because the

1690
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
fucking budget is crazy on this thing.

1691
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Because that's what happened with

1692
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Tomb Raider and Hitman

1693
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
and whatever the other one was

1694
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
that they had published that year, where they reported losses

1695
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
of games that sold unbelievably well.

1696
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Tomb Raider sold

1697
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
six million, not enough.

1698
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
By the way, guys, the Final Fantasy XIII

1699
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
trilogy as a whole has sold

1700
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
only over 11 million copies.

1701
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And that's three games.

1702
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It's three games together.

1703
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
15's not going to work.

1704
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I think once Square Enix

1705
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
tanks and once we start

1706
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
losing, because I feel like

1707
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
all those big developers are

1708
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
in trouble and it's only getting worse.

1709
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
With this new generation

1710
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
of games where no one can even

1711
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
make fucking games for these consoles,

1712
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
because it's too much

1713
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
to try to make these games.

1714
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I think that eventually

1715
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Steam

1716
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
is going to kill it all

1717
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
because everyone loves indie games now.

1718
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Indie games are no longer

1719
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
a thing that only

1720
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
weird niche PC players

1721
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
who are not

1722
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
a part of the crowd play.

1723
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
A game like

1724
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Minecraft

1725
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
or even just Braid or Meat Boy.

1726
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
These games are such huge successes

1727
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and there's more and more.

1728
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Every year there's more indie games

1729
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
that everyone's talking about.

1730
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
With YouTube reviewers

1731
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
pumping out reviews of these games

1732
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
where, again, if you follow someone

1733
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
like Bunny Hop, an indie game

1734
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
is being presented with the same amount

1735
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
of care and seriousness

1736
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
as a mainstream title.

1737
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
As indie games become more mainstream,

1738
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
more and more people are going to go,

1739
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
why the fuck would we spend all that money

1740
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
on a big game that's probably going to fail?

1741
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
The change has started, the shift has begun.

1742
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
You have to get all those people

1743
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and as soon as you have

1744
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
like, if you need

1745
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
7 million people to play your game

1746
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
and your game comes out in the same

1747
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
week as an indie game

1748
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
that gets 3.5 million

1749
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
players because it just sparks wildfire

1750
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
and everyone plays it, your game's fucked.

1751
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I think that's what's going to happen.

1752
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
YouTube has finally

1753
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
it hasn't totally set us free

1754
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
but it has created an environment

1755
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
where you can get reviews of things

1756
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
with the least possible amount

1757
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
of corporate influence

1758
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
of these people

1759
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
are just doing it out of passion

1760
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
and they turn it into a career

1761
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
and there's going to be little things that creep in

1762
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
but in the specific cases

1763
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Square Enix and more specifically

1764
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Final Fantasy XV has become

1765
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
a forced meme at this point

1766
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
it is an extremely forced meme

1767
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
and every forced meme is doomed to die

1768
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
a horrible death and like I've said before

1769
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
like I said in my Final Fantasy VII remake video

1770
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I would really like

1771
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Square Enix to just die

1772
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
in order for them to stop

1773
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
raping their legacy just let it go

1774
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
just break into small groups and make little games

1775
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
you make Bravely Default

1776
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
you can make games like that, make little baby Final Fantasy's

1777
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
just do those

1778
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
and we'll all be better off

1779
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
what if the game is good

1780
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
what if the game is good though

1781
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
what if the best game will matter

1782
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
mate, you haven't done your research right

1783
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Tabata is catering to the fans

1784
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I don't know what you're talking about

1785
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
how could you say this

1786
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
how could a fantasy Final Fantasy XV

1787
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
could be the greatest game ever

1788
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and it still won't sell enough

1789
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
to make back its money

1790
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
it'll still kill Square Enix

1791
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
isn't that funny though with Final Fantasy

1792
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
the way the Final Fantasy franchise started

1793
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
like they were dying

1794
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
they created this one last game and it saved them

1795
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Final Fantasy XV is finally

1796
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
full circle

1797
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
it kills itself

1798
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I don't think it's going to die right after 15

1799
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
because they've got their other

1800
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
branches that sustain

1801
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
they've got KH3 which will sell

1802
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
KH3 will do fine

1803
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
but will it make back its budget

1804
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
the game's been in development for quite a while

1805
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
it's going to be a long, every jug or not

1806
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
when it begins to go away

1807
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
it will kick and scream

1808
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
it cannot do anything but resist

1809
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
its inevitable death and decline

1810
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
so there will be a long

1811
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
if it does in fact die

1812
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
which I mean everything dies eventually

1813
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
it will be a very long drawn out painful process

1814
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
for every party involved

1815
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
and no one's going to come out good at the end of that

1816
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
especially not my beloved Final Fantasy

1817
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I mean somehow Konami is still

1818
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
kicking

1819
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
for how much longer man who knows

1820
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
they're Pachinko

1821
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
they're a gambling company

1822
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
that's the sad thing though

1823
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
when these IPs die

1824
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
they don't just die

1825
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
they become chained

1826
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
turn into a fucking Pachinko machine

1827
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
it's like watching her

1828
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
she was so much more

1829
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
it's hard to even say it but

1830
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
she was treated with more respect

1831
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
by being a character in Metal Gear Solid 3

1832
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
and now they're fucking slapping her

1833
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
it's so disrespectful

1834
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
it's like these franchises

1835
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
they can't get off the ship

1836
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
they got to go down with the ship

1837
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
and drown in the water because

1838
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
the companies aren't going to sell these giant IPs

1839
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
it's all they got left

1840
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
but what they are now is the ship has gone down

1841
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and the company is rapidly wrapping duct tape

1842
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
where the water is coming in through the sides

1843
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
and they're like oh god we got to hold it

1844
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
we got to survive as long as possible

1845
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I think what all these companies are missing

1846
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
like the forest

1847
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
that they're missing for the trees

1848
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
the trees being their big budget games

1849
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
back in the 90's

1850
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
a new great game came out

1851
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
all the time

1852
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
we keep saying our Final Fantasy

1853
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
had a game every fucking year

1854
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
in the 90's

1855
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
when I looked at that Wikipedia page

1856
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
sorry I muted my mind

1857
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
who's got a dick in his mouth right now

1858
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I muted my mind to have a biscuit

1859
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
but I had to jump in

1860
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
so I unmuted it halfway through

1861
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
it blew my mind when I looked at that

1862
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Wikipedia page of the Final Fantasy timeline

1863
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
release dates

1864
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
and it's like seven, eight, nine, ten

1865
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
four games in like four or five years

1866
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
one who's linked to that bitch

1867
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and tactics too

1868
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
don't forget tactics

1869
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
what is the benefit of waiting

1870
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
five years for one first game

1871
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
these people have not decided this model

1872
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
it has been basically forced upon them

1873
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
by perceived

1874
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
demands

1875
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
the thing is that the reason that

1876
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
they're not getting that

1877
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
why that's such a big problem

1878
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
is that you look at your PS2 library

1879
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
there's a million thousand fucking games

1880
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
you look at your PS3 and even that

1881
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
eventually it had a decent catalog

1882
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
you look at your PS4, it's been out for years

1883
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
there's nothing on it

1884
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
the Wii U has been out for years

1885
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
it has like ten great games

1886
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and they're all great but that's all there is

1887
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
literally zero

1888
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I go to a shop

1889
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
and look at the PS4 section

1890
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I don't see like

1891
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I don't see like this is like the game

1892
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
of the generations

1893
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I guess Bloodborne

1894
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
if you go to GameStop

1895
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
they still have an Xbox 360

1896
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
section that covers three fucking

1897
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
walls because so many games came out

1898
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
for that console

1899
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
the PS4 section is so weird because it's like

1900
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
like PS3 ports

1901
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
a few new games and then loads of PC

1902
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
indie games that have been ported over into boxes

1903
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
it's the weirdest thing

1904
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
it's so

1905
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
like it's like maybe there'll be like ten

1906
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
original PS4 owner of games

1907
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
and the rest is like ports and

1908
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
the fucking Wii U shelf is depressing

1909
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
because I was there

1910
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I was there the other time, I was at GameStop just like yesterday

1911
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and it's just this one

1912
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
little rat and I'm like that's it

1913
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
you know that's the whole Wii U

1914
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
and it's going out

1915
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
the Vita section?

1916
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
some stores don't have a Vita section anymore

1917
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
it's like

1918
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I'm not surprised

1919
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
why this is such a problem is that

1920
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
people need

1921
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
like people there is a huge demand

1922
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
for there to always be a game to play

1923
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
because people aren't going to wait around

1924
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
and you know and this is why a game like

1925
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Overwatch is such a huge deal

1926
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
because Overwatch is a game that will keep you busy

1927
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
for indefinitely

1928
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
you know like it's a game that because

1929
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
people don't want

1930
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
people want you know those big games

1931
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
but they want them every weekend

1932
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
because the way people play games is they go out

1933
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
and they buy one and they play through it

1934
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
and then they need something else

1935
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and that is why credit facts go back and play

1936
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
the old games

1937
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
there is one game that keeps me

1938
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
plenty busy on my PS4 and that game is

1939
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Dead or Alive Extreme 3 Fortune

1940
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
oh the only problem is it got

1941
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
fucking banned in America so you had to

1942
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
import it so it's not going to see that

1943
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
on GameStop shelves

1944
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
point being I think what will kill the big

1945
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
industry is just the fact that people need

1946
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
there to be people need another game

1947
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
people are going to finish a game and they crave

1948
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
another game and no games are coming out

1949
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
from these big publishers and

1950
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
you know when you have

1951
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
a game like Overwatch come out and everyone can

1952
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
play it then like they're not going

1953
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
to bother with anything else they're just

1954
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
going to all play Overwatch

1955
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
they won't but what they really should do

1956
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
is they should completely revamp their development

1957
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
cycle have the hardware people work

1958
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
with the software guys I don't know

1959
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
it's obviously too complex to do easily

1960
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
but reinvent the

1961
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
idea of like a great game coming out from

1962
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
your studio every year whatever

1963
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
sacrifices you need to make do that

1964
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
because that will make people buy your

1965
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
consoles that will drive up

1966
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
PS4 is like winning

1967
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I heard is like doing by far the best

1968
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
somehow I don't know how but it

1969
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
is it was all about

1970
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
winning people got so fucking hyped

1971
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
for being the console

1972
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
to play that makes you sell

1973
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
marketing did it I think

1974
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
we ran into like a I think

1975
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
the saddest thing about all this is

1976
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
the loss of the middle ground

1977
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
where we every every game is all or nothing

1978
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
it's all either like a huge fucking

1979
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
kind of like the loss of the middle

1980
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
class know what I'm saying like a tiny

1981
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
indie game and it's like what happened to a time

1982
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
where we could have like a hundred

1983
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
like what happened when there was a hundred

1984
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
games that could come out they were all just the coolest

1985
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
you know dude like it for the last

1986
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
two generations everyone like

1987
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
has been like yo Nintendo where the

1988
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
franchises where the franchise is going

1989
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
it's like you remember the GameCube it was like

1990
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
and within three years it was like boom Mario

1991
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
boom Zelda boom stuff

1992
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
boom F zero boom like you know it was like

1993
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
nothing is a better example of this

1994
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
than what Matthew Matosis pointed out

1995
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
in his Metal Gear Solid 4 video

1996
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
when Otacon does his speech about

1997
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
like snake you need to change the disc

1998
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and he's like Otacon what are you talking

1999
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
about oh that's right we're on the

2000
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Blu-ray double technology

2001
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
is so fucking amazing you don't

2002
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
even need to change the disc cue the five

2003
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
hour loading period

2004
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
between when you feed fucking need to load

2005
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
the next section of the game as opposed

2006
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
to just swapping

2007
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
yeah great it only takes ten hours to install

2008
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
the whole thing fantastic just what I want

2009
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
thirty minutes dude yeah right I'd rather

2010
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
just buy a game with three discs

2011
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
and swap them out in ten seconds each

2012
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I'm just saying to your next game you fucking

2013
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
you know this

2014
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
yeah

2015
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
yeah yeah you should have to take longer

2016
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
to play games like we did back in the day

2017
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
no the point

2018
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
is technology is

2019
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
not doing it's not

2020
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
helping uh

2021
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
games achieve a better

2022
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I don't know it's not it's it's it's working counter

2023
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
to the goals that I think we can all agree on

2024
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
you know in a lot of ways

2025
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
games wise is such a big problem to have to

2026
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
install MGS4

2027
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
because I'm a Nintendo

2028
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
who can't construct his own computer

2029
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
so you know I think

2030
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I think the Metal Gear Solid franchise

2031
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
right there this like all I have to do

2032
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
is say a few dates and we can put

2033
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
everything we've just said into perspective

2034
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
yeah the first three Metal Gear Solid games

2035
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
are pretty much considered the best right

2036
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
the fan favorites four is considered

2037
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
kind of a let down by a lot of people five

2038
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
is considered a huge let down by a lot of people

2039
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
not saying this is true of everyone

2040
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
because I'm the credit say that it's the

2041
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
greatest game that's ever been made but like

2042
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
fucking played that's right but I

2043
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
think that I've never played

2044
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I think

2045
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I think if you really want perspective on

2046
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
whether or not you like Metal Gear Solid 5

2047
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
we can all agree that they're that

2048
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
like Metal Gear Solid 1, 2, and 3

2049
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
are not that contested

2050
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
the way that 5 is

2051
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Metal Gear Solid 1 came out in 98

2052
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
three years later we got Metal Gear Solid 2

2053
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
well to be fair Metal Gear Solid 2

2054
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
is a little too smart for a lot of people to get

2055
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
initially

2056
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
let me finish the states 1998

2057
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
three years later we got Metal Gear Solid 2

2058
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
three years after that

2059
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
we got

2060
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
three years after that we got Metal Gear Solid 3

2061
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
then somehow it took another four years

2062
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
before we got the next game

2063
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
and it's somehow worse than the first three

2064
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and then it takes another

2065
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
seven years

2066
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
before we get the next game and it's somehow

2067
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
worse than all of them

2068
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
this is the trajectory we're on

2069
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
it takes longer to make a game

2070
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
and yet it somehow is worse

2071
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I'm just gonna put the rule out there the shorter

2072
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
your development lifetime the better the game

2073
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
will be I'm just throwing that out that's a rule

2074
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
a week might be a bit

2075
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
no that's it I've made great games

2076
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
at Game Jams dude we have made great games

2077
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
at Indie Game Jams over a 24 hour period

2078
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I'm just saying

2079
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
in terms of Metal Gear I am

2080
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
as if they come up behind you and say surprise

2081
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
motherfucker and you go holy shit you know

2082
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
you can't know the games come out

2083
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I do like that that's like you know like

2084
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
hype is bad you know hype is real bad for these

2085
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
sorts of things from this day forward I'm deciding

2086
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
there are four Metal Gear Solid games

2087
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
is V it's just V

2088
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
it's just a spin-off called V

2089
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
about a guy called V

2090
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
and there's four Metal Gear Solid games

2091
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
and it ended at Metal Gear Solid 4

2092
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Metal Gear Solid 5 starring

2093
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Big Meme

2094
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
imagine though okay like Metal Gear Solid 4 gets a lot of

2095
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
shit deservedly for a lot of things

2096
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
but imagine if that ending of Metal Gear Solid 4

2097
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
had come now

2098
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
with Konami's death how legendary

2099
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
that game would have been

2100
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
it would have been the more

2101
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
like it is it's already probably one of

2102
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
the most legendary games ever but it would have been

2103
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
like you know

2104
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
it would have elevated it more than

2105
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
this like going out on a wet

2106
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
fart and like yeah

2107
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
you know oh well hey you're forgetting

2108
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
about Peace Walker dude

2109
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I like Peace Walker a lot

2110
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
actually it

2111
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I'm a crit fag I didn't finish Peace Walk

2112
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Peace Walk is a piece of shit

2113
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
the final boss the final boss against

2114
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
pass with the J Rock

2115
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
fucking 10 out of 10

2116
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
don't listen to Matthew Matosis it's the

2117
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
best final boss of all time

2118
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
no Peace Walker is

2119
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
inoffensive but it's only

2120
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
offensive when it's combined with Metal Gear Solid 5

2121
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
that's for sure

2122
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
they become a duo

2123
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
of destruction

2124
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
towards the entire franchise

2125
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
so we've kind of explored this

2126
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
topic thoroughly I mean we had our second

2127
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
topic I don't know

2128
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I don't think we need it

2129
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
definitely I think this is a pretty good

2130
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
place to wrap it up so anybody have

2131
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
any final thoughts oh I've got okay

2132
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I've got some final okay final cred

2133
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
thoughts sure

2134
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
so I think

2135
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
whenever I play a game and when I've

2136
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
played series I really in my mind I really want

2137
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
to recreate what like if I've missed a series

2138
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I want to recreate what it would have been

2139
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
like if I'd played them in order and if I had

2140
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
experienced them as totally as they came out

2141
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and I think in that sense

2142
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
like because you can't really

2143
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
match that kind of experience you can never

2144
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
approximate what it would be I mean me and Nate

2145
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
have talked about this multiple times

2146
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
yep you know like when we played a series

2147
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
like Kingdom Hearts growing up

2148
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
and like you

2149
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
you play that first game and then you

2150
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
wait years and you play that second game

2151
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and it's like it's like meeting all the characters

2152
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
again and like experiencing that full story

2153
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and then having payoffs that

2154
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
you know were hinted at in the first game

2155
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
and then years later like two is probably

2156
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
is like a better game I guess

2157
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
than one and you could tell someone to go play

2158
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
two first it's contested

2159
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
but I do think that like

2160
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
you you will not

2161
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
experience it you will have a much better

2162
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
experience and at the end of the day that's what

2163
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
that's what media is about it's not about

2164
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
being on Twitter and knowing what happened

2165
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and being able to be in the conversation

2166
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
it's about having a great experience and if you want

2167
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
the best experience go to the

2168
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
start start it from the beginning and

2169
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
just incident and and immerse

2170
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
yourself in that journey that's that's what I

2171
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
say Kingdom Hearts 2 release 2002

2172
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Kingdom Hearts 1 2002

2173
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Kingdom Hearts 2 wait

2174
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Kingdom Hearts 1 2002

2175
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Kingdom Hearts 2

2176
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
2006 so even that four years

2177
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
at the time felt like forever

2178
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I know right and now we're like used to

2179
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
like okay new Kingdom Hearts 10 years

2180
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
alright let's strap in

2181
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
that's normal that's

2182
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
and by the way chain of memories came out

2183
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
in the middle of that so there was a real

2184
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Kingdom Hearts game to say you're you know

2185
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
hungry in the middle of that so man there's

2186
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
been like 20 fucking Kingdom Hearts games

2187
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
on DS in that time

2188
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and I've played literally all of them

2189
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
and I'm still pissed that Kingdom Hearts 3

2190
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
is taking this one

2191
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
literally all of them people

2192
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I guess if I have parting thoughts two

2193
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
credit fags which is probably going to be

2194
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
most people listening to this because I think most

2195
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
of us have credit fag tendencies

2196
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
we've all credit fagged at least once

2197
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
in our lives

2198
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
and we probably will continue to do

2199
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
so regardless of

2200
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
knowing better but like

2201
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
you know I don't I don't think it's

2202
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
necessarily I mean you

2203
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
you play games you watch shows or whatever

2204
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
you do it because you just

2205
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
want to in the moment right and for a lot of people

2206
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
it's just I got home from work I want to

2207
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
get excited about something that's not work

2208
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and I understand how hype can be

2209
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
fun when you've got all your friends are doing it

2210
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
you know but

2211
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
if you're if you

2212
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
have any interest in being a reviewer

2213
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
or speaking about the medium at all

2214
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
or if you're a fan who wants

2215
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
to appreciate the medium at any depth

2216
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
go back and play the old shit

2217
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
because it will deepen your understanding

2218
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
of the new shit to degrees

2219
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
that you did not realize were

2220
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
possible

2221
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
and that goes for every medium

2222
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
go back and look at the old shit even if you

2223
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
don't like it it'll still in it it'll

2224
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
make you like the new stuff more just

2225
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
knowing how far things have come

2226
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
you know yeah yeah in a big

2227
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
way and being able to see things like

2228
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
like like again to use

2229
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Zelda like just to be able to see how

2230
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
the controls of

2231
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
like the newer games evolve from the old ones

2232
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
and like

2233
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I don't know there's a lot that fascinates me about like

2234
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
playing Zelda one and then playing a newer one

2235
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
and being like wow these

2236
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
everything that's in this one is also

2237
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
in this one but it's different

2238
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
it's great go do it play

2239
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and you know

2240
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
going to go I was just going to say you're never going to enjoy it

2241
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
as much as those people who you want

2242
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
to be part of the conversation with

2243
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
if you're not watching the whole thing

2244
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
yeah especially if it's a bunch of

2245
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
if a bunch of Metal Gear fans are mad

2246
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
about five you're not going to be as mad

2247
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
about five by just playing five

2248
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
it's not going to happen and you might start it

2249
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
and go I don't get it

2250
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I don't like this like if you started with

2251
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Yakuza 3 just say

2252
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
and I guess my only

2253
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
thoughts

2254
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
you know I was just going to say you might miss out

2255
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
on like

2256
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
your favorite game of all time

2257
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
you might miss out on it

2258
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
if you start skipping

2259
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
that's true

2260
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
don't let like the reviewers

2261
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
and oh it's new so it must be good

2262
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
determine whether you play

2263
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
new games or old games because like what's to say

2264
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
you won't enjoy those old games more

2265
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
like you don't know you didn't play them

2266
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
that's true man

2267
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
and I guess

2268
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I just want to say that I

2269
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I think we're all cred fags at various

2270
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
points in our lives like everybody said

2271
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
and like did you said I think a lot of it

2272
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
is just an issue of people

2273
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
have different life experiences they go to work

2274
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
they come home they've had a hard day

2275
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
you know doing whatever that has nothing to do

2276
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
with you know criticizing media in any

2277
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
capacity they turn on the big bang

2278
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
theory they turn on Metal Gear Solid

2279
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
5 and they go to town and to those

2280
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
people I empathize with you but I'd also like

2281
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
to say fuck you

2282
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
you gotta start

2283
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
big bang theory from the beginning

2284
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
and I gotta ask

2285
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
what's the origin of

2286
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Bazinga I don't know I need to know

2287
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
maybe you'll like the joke if you

2288
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
see the origin

2289
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
what if it's been this

2290
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
watch as Bazinga has been like a brilliant social

2291
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
commentary joke

2292
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
like every time Sheldon experiences existential

2293
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
pain when he remembers the death of his father

2294
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
as a child he says Bazinga

2295
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
reflexively oh my god

2296
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I'm a cred fag I didn't even know

2297
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
didn't even know

2298
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
did you be saying something

2299
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
yeah just if you if you're

2300
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
if you are a cred fag I have to ask

2301
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
do you want to be this way forever

2302
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
cause like that's whenever

2303
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
there's someone who like keeps playing the new games

2304
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
and you're like but what about the classics and they're like

2305
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
oh I'll get to it someday it's like

2306
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
you're never gonna you're never gonna get

2307
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
to them if you keep following

2308
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
the hype cycle and only playing the hype games

2309
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
you're never gonna end up

2310
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
like like Charlie said you're gonna end up missing out on

2311
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
probably some of your favorite games

2312
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
cause a vast majority

2313
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
of the best games in existence

2314
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
are old

2315
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and you know people if that seems overwhelming to you

2316
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
like oh there's so many old games

2317
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
they'll never be able to play them all

2318
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
pick a series that you're most interested in

2319
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
start with those and your life will immediately be more

2320
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
even if it seems like it's on the

2321
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
it's on the clunkiest oldest system

2322
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
of all time just give it a go

2323
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
just start it

2324
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
to your friends oh no I'm encouraging people to

2325
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
play obscure things just to brag about it

2326
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I take it back be a cred fag forever

2327
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
another piece of advice

2328
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
emu paradise

01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000

there is technology these days to just play

2333
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I don't think anyone's

2334
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
gonna be sponsored by a fucking illegal

2335
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
you don't know

2336
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
you don't know

2337
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I'm just saying don't be afraid of the law

01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
emu paradise I will accept your

2339
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000

01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I'm supposed to be

2383
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
creating funny

2384
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
things that the people

2385
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
gladly

2386
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
will pay for

2387
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
artistic genius

2388
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
that's what they came for

2389
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
instead

2390
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'm tweeting

2391
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
hashtag repeating

2392
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
that's why

2393
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
there's no heat

2394
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
and holes in the ceiling

2395
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
yeah

2396
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
it's quite the

2397
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
burden

2398
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
it's a hard knock life

2399
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
being a genius
