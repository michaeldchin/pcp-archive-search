00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,420
Fantastic.

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,740
And he's going to be the star of the show folks.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,740
We already know this.

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,780
Alright guys, here's the topic.

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,900
You've been waiting for it.

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,900
You've been asking for it.

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,940
You've already seen the name of this episode so you know that it's time for the long-awaited

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,500
PCP fetish cast.

21
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,780
We're diving deep baby.

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,260
We're going both hands into that pussy, in and out, making it happen, expansion, ballooning,

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,260
a scat.

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,260
What else you got?

25
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
I don't know.

26
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,760
Seaman drinking, snowballing.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,340
It's all on the table folks.

28
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,340
It's all coming out.

29
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,140
Yeah, that's right.

30
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,740
For all three of the ladies at home, be sure to get your dildos ready now because you're

31
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,140
going to be tickling those clits all night long.

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,620
Now just come right out.

33
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,100
I'm going to come right out.

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,140
I'm just going to say I'm probably going to disappoint everyone here because it's not

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,940
that I'm more weird than normal.

36
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,460
It's just that I pre-planned how I would talk about my weirdness in a properly paced distributed

37
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,460
way.

38
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,900
It's sort of good storytelling.

39
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,980
I've been putting lots of thought into exactly which details to say when.

40
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,060
For example, to know the right time to tell people that when I'm reaching for the lube

41
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,820
I sometimes accidentally grab the baby powder because the bottles are right in the lube.

42
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:59,260
It's all about delivery, more so than the actual substance of the thing you're fucking.

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,540
I'm just here for you to deliver, Davoo.

44
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,780
I don't care how you do it.

45
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,500
Speaking of that, we're into delivery.

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,380
Can we get in some baby birth pregnancy kind of shit?

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,380
That sounds good.

48
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,260
Brilliant Nate, we thought the same thing.

49
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,260
We did.

50
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,500
Okay, let's read our Urban Dictionary definition of fetish that we can move on.

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
All right, here we go.

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Number one.

53
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,700
Urban Dictionary of every single fetish.

54
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Oh shit.

55
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,220
That's a good idea.

56
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,340
Okay, number one.

57
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,580
We might have to refer to it for some more obscure ones.

58
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,100
Okay, fetish, number one.

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,140
An object thought to have magical, especially magical, sexual powers.

60
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,140
So my cock.

61
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,420
Okay, number two.

62
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,060
A sexual fixation or obsession with a usually non-sexual object.

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,660
Example, socks, horses, monkeys, pain, bondage.

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,660
Who says horses aren't normally sexualized?

65
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,660
Get the fuck out of here, dude.

66
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,660
Come on.

67
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,300
What about the monkeys being on that list?

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,300
That's not cool.

69
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
We are monkeys.

70
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,180
Yeah, have you guys ever been to blacked.com?

71
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,180
Oh no.

72
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,180
Okay.

73
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,740
Well shit, guys, where do we start this thing?

74
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,500
Where do we launch in order to scat you?

75
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Well, you just said shit, so I think we should start there.

76
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,780
Let's start with scat.

77
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,780
Okay.

78
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,340
I mean, DeVoo, why don't you take us away?

79
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
What do you got on?

80
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,340
Well, why are you jumping to DeVoo so quickly?

81
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
Because actually, yes.

82
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
I want to get to DeVoo.

83
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,740
He's the most interesting one here.

84
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Fine.

85
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,260
And the logical connection there is a taxonomy, I don't know, there's sort of a distinction

86
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:27,100
between being attracted to the substance of something and being attracted to the concept

87
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
of something.

88
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,100
And I am a very concept centric person.

89
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,500
Like I know that there's a lot of porn.

90
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,420
I sometimes, the hentai that I really connect with are the ones that have a lot of details

91
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,500
about how the character is feeling and what they're being put through.

92
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,460
Actually, it's more common in Western drawn porn, right?

93
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,620
Where the character will experience this horrible torture and often they just sort of shrug

94
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,620
it off.

95
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,780
Like they just sort of like, oh, well, I guess this terrible thing just happened to me.

96
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,260
And like every panel will add on more and more details of the terrible, unfair, cruel

97
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,420
suffering that they're going through.

98
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,420
And often they don't really react to it with that much suffering.

99
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,860
And there's something about context that can really get my cock tested.

100
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,860
Yeah, okay, okay.

101
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,980
Yeah, so it's like cruelty, unfairness, like tragedy, like just terrible things happening

102
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,660
to someone for no reason at all.

103
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,580
If it's then coupled up with some sort of other more specific thing I'm into, I'm probably

104
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,660
going to download it even if the art is shit, right?

105
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
Sure.

106
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,340
So just if we can dissect this as we go along.

107
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,300
So the first point you're making is if people are suffering and it's connected with something

108
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,300
sectional.

109
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,180
Well, suffering, yeah, suffering is like one of many contexts, right?

110
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,980
So does any of this have like, like, do you have a rationale for it or is it just like

111
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,780
an innate animalistic design?

112
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,340
There's different logics to it, you know.

113
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,300
So regarding shit, I am very much not into the substance of it.

114
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,300
And I can tell it some people.

115
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,140
No, when you see some scat thumbnails out there, it's like those people just like the

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,740
feeling of it.

117
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:18,180
No, but the humiliation of it, the intimacy of it, right, is some is kind of captivating

118
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,180
to me.

119
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,100
I mean, P obviously is a much more is a much more managed is the PG 13 of that kind of

120
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
direction.

121
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Sorry.

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,780
The thing about P is like, I don't like the smell of feet, right?

123
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,540
But I like the fact that that's so, um, it's so TMI, right?

124
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
It's so intimate.

125
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
Sure.

126
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Sure.

127
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,740
So, I mean, you know, me and my girlfriend walking on each other in the bath bathroom

128
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,620
peeing like all the time, right?

129
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,660
It's great sometimes we make out while peeing because it's so intimate, you know, make out

130
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
while peeing.

131
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,660
Oh, yeah.

132
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
So it's great.

133
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
That's great.

134
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
At my house, we lock the bathroom door.

135
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,700
Remember that scene in Almost Famous when the kid walks in on the girl peeing in the

136
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,900
bathroom and she's just like, yeah, no, don't worry about it.

137
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Just stay here.

138
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
Yeah.

139
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
That was always a kind of romantic scene.

140
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
That's really hot.

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,380
And like, you know, I think also P is really fetishized because, um, hold on, the door is

142
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
being opened.

143
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,100
I have to wait until the door is shut again before I continue talking about this stuff.

144
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,340
Normies get out.

145
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,980
And now the door, I mean, it was my girlfriend.

146
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,700
Anyway, so now she shut the door again.

147
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,940
So anyway, Normies get out.

148
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,180
Um, because like, I think another big fixation of P is that guys and girls do it differently,

149
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,380
which I'm assuming is a big part of sexuality.

150
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,700
Like boobs and abs, respectively, can be attractive because that distinguishes the male and female

151
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
figure.

152
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,900
So like peeing out the front or down the center, you know, front ish is like different.

153
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,620
And that difference is what is captivating in a heterosexual way.

154
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,100
You know, like that's, it's like, wow, that's not how I am.

155
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Right.

156
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,500
And it's that constant, uh, curiosity of what that must feel like.

157
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,780
Like my girlfriend a number of times, like, what does it feel like to have your dick sucked?

158
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,220
I'm like, it feels like if my clit was several inches long and was being sucked, like, how

159
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,620
do I communicate that to you?

160
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,620
There's never a way to do it.

161
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,580
And it's like constant fascination, that constant mystery that, um, I remember Jesse said that

162
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,500
after the first episode of the plebeian weeb was recorded, that he forgot to mention that

163
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,900
in his, his personal political philosophy is that if a boy and girl ever switch brains,

164
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,180
they are fucking obligated to have sex because it will be your only chance to know what it

165
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,340
feels like on the other side.

166
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,860
And so I think that is, um, yeah, differences in that is, uh, captivating.

167
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,780
So you're talking about, there's kind of an umbrella here of like, um, just sort of

168
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,620
exploring the unknown or, or, or experiencing something that's a very private personal thing.

169
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,620
That's sort of the underlying thing that makes the stuff.

170
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,340
There's a number of umbrellas I'm talking about, like probably two in the pink, one in

171
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,380
the stink, if you know what I mean.

172
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,300
And, uh, I don't know what you mean.

173
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
What is that an expression?

174
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,460
I'm just, I'm just like imagining like, like umbrellas going inside the girl.

175
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,620
I'm sure there's a point of that, right?

176
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,820
I'm imagining, I'm imagining it then opening and it's like, oh, no, it's like, oh, no,

177
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,340
people have died doing that.

178
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,340
Really?

179
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
Shit.

180
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,740
There was a, like a hundred ways to die.

181
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,260
Somebody, it was like a, um, those circus performers who swallow things all the way

182
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,820
down their throat and the fucking umbrella opened inside of them.

183
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
Oh, no.

184
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Oh, that's fucked.

185
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,820
That's fucked.

186
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,820
Yeah.

187
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
That's not even like a fun, sexy way.

188
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,260
Like if it's in your pussy, at least that's kind of fun, but I died from an umbrella opening

189
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
in my pussy.

190
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,740
That was the sexiest way to die.

191
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,740
There's worse ways.

192
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
Okay.

193
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,740
Uh, okay.

194
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,460
So we're talking about some, some, some general themes here.

195
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,660
Um, here, let me say a specific fetish of mine that I, I just thought of, I was trying

196
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,620
to think of one, I was afraid that my tastes are like two vanilla, but I actually did think

197
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,860
of one that I, I recognize in myself, I do actually like a lot.

198
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,740
And you guys can tell what you think of this.

199
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,700
And it's basically, um, you know, cause I'm, I'm more attractive to like when the women

200
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,780
do things like the, like the porn I watch, the guy is just like, you know, he's just

201
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,740
the dick in the situation doing whatever.

202
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,220
So it's like the women doing things that's the interesting part.

203
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,460
I like it when the women are treated just like meat or like flesh lights or like not

204
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,740
even people, like they're just there.

205
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,940
They're like sex toys.

206
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,100
When you like treat a woman like a sex toy, I find that extremely,

207
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
It's that context.

208
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Yes.

209
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
It's absolutely the context.

210
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,820
Now, obviously I'm not into dehumanizing people in general, but you see this a lot

211
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,300
in hentai with the mind break porn, where you just see a woman get fucked for such a

212
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
long time.

213
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,900
And then eventually at the end, like she's just like, she either is now into it and

214
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,140
she's just like, yeah, everybody fuck me.

215
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
It's great.

216
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,140
It's a fun time.

217
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,140
Or she's just like her, the, the, you can see in the eyes, the way they draw the eyes.

218
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
Yeah.

219
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,780
They always draw the eyes with this vapid expression, this vacant expression, like they have no

220
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
mind left.

221
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Exactly.

222
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Yeah.

223
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,900
Like when there's a bunch of porn I've seen where like, uh, there are these, these, these

224
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
are interesting to me.

225
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,060
There's like, um, uh, there's, there's a bunch of porn with like high schools, right?

226
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,180
And they're like very high performing high schools.

227
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,980
And so I forget the name of the show, but like what they did is they assign or there's like

228
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,180
a bathroom with female women, like strapped into the wall as flesh toilets.

229
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,180
Oh yeah.

230
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
They're just for public use.

231
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,180
Yeah.

232
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
Public use.

233
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,180
That's what you'll see on D sometimes.

234
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Public use.

235
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
Uh, yeah.

236
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,180
It's, it's too, yeah.

237
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,660
It's as dehumanizing as possible.

238
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,300
It's to make them just this fucking product in a goddamn wall.

239
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,740
Though to self analyze myself on this, I think the reason I'm into it is because for a long

240
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,060
time I had a great deal of difficulty actually getting sex.

241
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,500
And so I would think about all the, wouldn't it be great if there was just like a toilet

242
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,620
somewhere which had women just strapped down that I could use?

243
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,620
Yeah.

244
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
Wouldn't that just be great?

245
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,620
I'm sure that factors in.

246
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,620
So I'm not, I understand that.

247
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Oh, of course.

248
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Oh, absolutely.

249
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,780
It's the, um, I mean, there's a pretty decent reason why there's a correlation between out

250
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,540
there fetishes and shut-ins or otherwise unattractive, unaccepted people.

251
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,180
I don't still self identify as a guy who gets laid ever.

252
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,660
There, I still have all these moments of like, oh yeah, I have like a girlfriend and shit.

253
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Right.

254
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,180
Like, you know, and I feel like especially when I'm like 13 or whatever, the whole idea

255
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,300
of having actual sex is about as foreign to me as the concept of say, uh, like a fantasy

256
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,980
where like everyone in the world except me and like maybe five or so girls like vanished

257
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,900
like the fucking left behind series all of a sudden, right?

258
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,300
Which were some of my earlier fantasies, right?

259
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,540
And I thought like, yeah, like I know logically actual sex is plausible, whereas like a fucking

260
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,180
anthro transformation is not, but, you know, it's still felt that my dick felt that way.

261
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,460
Let's say, you know, the dick has its own fucking train of logic and its own ideas.

262
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,020
Um, and I think that if you, you know, I'm just going to talk about sex in general for

263
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,020
10 seconds.

264
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,300
This is sort of a general like moral thing.

265
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,740
I thought of like my, my, this is like my favorite neck beard of fedora, a statement,

266
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,460
which is that the whole idea of sex before marriage being bad was a rule that was invented

267
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,180
back when people got married at like 13 and now sort of religion and other things in general

268
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,940
societal standards have subjected us to this situation where people go into their twenties

269
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,060
as virgins, which is probably a thousand fucking times more unnatural than fucking a member

270
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,260
of the same sex.

271
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,540
And I think it is probably quite instrumental in getting people to fuck everything that they

272
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,940
see laying around their desk.

273
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
I hear what you're saying.

274
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,940
It makes sense to me.

275
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,580
Humans are obviously extremely sexual creatures and we want to do it all the time.

276
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,820
I mean, at least men, I can't speak for women, but they seem pretty similar.

277
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
They seem pretty similar.

278
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Yeah.

279
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
You can speak for women.

280
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Yeah.

281
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,820
Yeah.

282
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I know some women.

283
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,900
You know, when I was a kid, I really thought that like women just didn't have sex drive.

284
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,980
Turns out I just met a bunch of shitty prudes.

285
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
That's not true.

286
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
That's not true.

287
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,700
Turns out I was a kid and they weren't revealing that information to me.

288
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Yeah.

289
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
Yeah, it's true.

290
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Hippo, what are your fetishes?

291
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Like holding hands, kissing?

292
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,700
No.

293
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,660
Hippo was like, I remember whenever we, whenever.

294
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Mud puddles.

295
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,660
It's mud puddles, obviously.

296
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
Ew.

297
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,740
No, no, no.

298
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
It sounds like an offset of Davoo.

299
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Hippo's pretty high up there.

300
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:47,700
Hippo, I think he's the only one like me who was like firmly from the sort of deviant art

301
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,740
school of fetishization, whether or not he's using that website.

302
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,420
Well, like inflation, there, because there's a number of different categories, right?

303
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,420
There are the sort of certain sort of fetishes.

304
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
All right.

305
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Hippo speaks for himself.

306
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
Let's hang on here.

307
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Move on.

308
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Yeah.

309
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,180
Well, I mean, I guess I am kind of up there.

310
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,260
Like Davoo, I have an umbrella of like, I don't know about many umbrellas, but I have

311
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
a lot.

312
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Eat your pussy right now.

313
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
Is that what you're getting?

314
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,260
Yeah.

315
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
Like I keep buying them.

316
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Yeah.

317
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,260
I just keep putting them in because they get lost and I just have to keep adding more.

318
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Okay.

319
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,260
I'm sorry.

320
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,340
Like the, I feel, I feel all apprehensive about this.

321
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,700
I'm not as gung-ho as about me.

322
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,300
Dude, no matter what you say, it will not be as fucked up as the shit I already said about

323
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,580
wanting to dehumanize women and treat them like meat.

324
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,580
So don't worry about that.

325
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,100
It's, it's, you know, you shouldn't be hyped up for what I'm about to say.

326
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:43,060
It's really just that I have, I don't, you know, my umbrella is more about like, growth

327
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
and growing.

328
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,940
So inflation is part of that, but it's, it's not like, all right, I'm trying to think of

329
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,900
a way to put it.

330
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:57,140
Growth in humans in any facet is like something I'm really interested in, a realistic or not,

331
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,380
but usually I prefer the realistic stuff.

332
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:06,580
Like, like the natural breast growth of girls, just like if they, they just, you know, a

333
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,540
young teenager and then, you know, over the years they get like real big boobs and they're

334
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,220
like, oh yeah, I'm, I'm a sex god and I'm like, yeah, that whole, that whole process

335
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,220
was great.

336
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
It's, it's the sequence.

337
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,220
It's the process.

338
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,900
It's the, the going from one to the other doesn't necessarily have to be, yeah, it doesn't

339
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,340
necessarily have to be a thing that I would like otherwise.

340
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,220
Like, you know, it could be a penis.

341
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,860
It could be like a, just a person go like a giant, giantess.

342
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,060
It could be somebody getting really fat, even though I don't like fat people.

343
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
I think that's the thing.

344
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,060
Yeah.

345
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,500
Like the flat thing falls into like the humiliation, demeaning, you've become worse, specific fat

346
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
women are beautiful.

347
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
All right.

348
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,580
The thing is, I'm talking about it.

349
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,500
I'm talking like actual, like fucking round.

350
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,740
Like I'm talking like there are D threads of blue barrification straight out of really

351
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
long.

352
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
I'm not kidding.

353
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
It's really long.

354
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,740
I'm not.

355
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,140
It's not even like, that's not even hyperbola, man.

356
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:08,180
Willy Wonka that one did in fact in set, like incepted a very specific blueberry based

357
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,740
fetish in the dicks of many young men.

358
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,740
You're right.

359
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,740
Not me.

360
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
I mean, I'm pretty flexible.

361
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,380
I can do it sometimes, but, but, but some people are pretty into it because it's like

362
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,580
when you see that girl reduce to this pathetic little blob out of her own misdeeds.

363
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,540
It's like that's some fucking great a context right there.

364
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
You know what I mean?

365
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,940
It's just how the, the Disney cartoon Robin Hood got all you guys into my little pony.

366
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Yeah.

367
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
Exactly.

368
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,380
I mean, yeah, obviously if you, if you want to talk about correlation and causation with

369
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,820
fetish is Disney and furry is pretty fucking objectionable.

370
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,020
Zootopia baby.

371
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,340
It's a, I was a late bloomer, but I want to go fuck a rabbit.

372
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
Yes.

373
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,580
You know, I do want to talk about anthropomorphized stuff, but I want to give to go on first.

374
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,580
Yeah.

375
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,780
But now I've lost my train of thought.

376
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,280
I was talking about, yeah, yeah.

377
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,900
It's not necessarily the thing in question, like the, the being fat, like I don't like

378
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
fat people.

379
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,580
I don't like just seeing a fat person, but the idea of somebody just eating like so much

380
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,300
that they become a giant, like even to ridiculous proportions, just becoming a giant blob of

381
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,780
like, you can't even see their face there.

382
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,220
So, you know, it's like, it's like weird.

383
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
It's, it's, yeah.

384
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,460
Conflation feels weird because that it's just a sphere and they just go outwards in a, in

385
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,340
a sphere and it's like, that's so far removed from human anatomy that I can't even.

386
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
I don't understand what's, what's attractive about that though.

387
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Can you explain to me?

388
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
Yeah.

389
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,860
I wanted to ask, but I didn't want to seem rude.

390
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,660
Uh, what, what about the fat thing?

391
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
Well, like, yeah.

392
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,460
So like somebody gets blown up and you can't recognize their face and it's all like, it's

393
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,940
it's not, yeah, but that's the thing.

394
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,300
It's not the end result.

395
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,260
It's the fact that it just goes from one to more.

396
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Yeah.

397
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,780
It's like the growth aspect, the, the going.

398
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,300
Like accelerated puberty.

399
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Yeah.

400
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,860
Well, anything, any, any sort of growth thing, that's just really what I'm into any, any

401
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
growth thing.

402
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,980
And, and what I'm into like the most is the stuff that could actually happen in real life

403
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,060
like, like breasts enlargement.

404
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
Just over time.

405
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Yeah.

406
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
Like a girl turning 14.

407
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,060
I'm into that too.

408
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
Yeah.

409
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
Okay.

410
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Well, that's interesting.

411
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
But like what I think this is, we're coming from a slightly different perspective, at

412
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,380
least the way I view this stuff, uh, whereas at least how like this specific fetish works.

413
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,220
Cause like what I'm thinking about porn or like what gets me off is like, I think about

414
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,940
how my dick gets involved in this situation.

415
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,220
And like, that's what I'm really focused on.

416
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,060
And I just don't understand how my dick gets involved in like an inflation situation.

417
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,380
That's, that's, yeah, that's, that is the thing is, it's, it's, it brings us back to

418
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
the thing I said before.

419
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
But how, wait, wait, wait.

420
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,380
I really wasn't sure if he was going to say or not.

421
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
I'm sorry.

422
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,180
Well, I'm say, I'm going to say it, it's, it's the concept, it's the idea of something

423
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,180
happening.

424
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,100
Um, I'm trying to think of like exactly like the fat thing.

425
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,860
Cause like sometimes it's, it's nice when they just get put, uh, like chubby, they just

426
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,580
a little bit and they're like, Oh no, I put on weight, but you know, you love them anyway.

427
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,180
Like that's, that's all right.

428
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,820
But then there's the stuff where it goes way over the beyond, beyond what I would consider,

429
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,980
like after I'm finished, I look at it and I'm like, Oh God, that's not the point that

430
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,980
you'll use it.

431
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,580
But beyond the point where once you're done, you're like, yeah, and it's not, it's not

432
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,540
about sex at some point, at some point, like, um, there are things that aren't sexual about

433
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,220
growth that get me feeling weird, but it's not, you know, it's not my dick that's feeling

434
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
it.

435
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,660
It's just like anything that, where there's like, uh, like a monster in a thing that

436
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,980
just eats souls and it grows to a gargantuan size.

437
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,020
It's not about sex, but it does make me feel a similar feeling.

438
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,060
So really all it is is to this feeling.

439
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:37,660
Um, I don't know like, like, I think the last time I remember it like very vividly was when

440
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,860
in one piece, Gekko Moria was like getting loads of shadows and he was going in and he

441
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,740
was just becoming gigantic, but not only that in the anime, he had his voice deepened

442
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,380
like several octaves and it was, it was terrifying.

443
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,180
I was absolutely terrified of it and that, I think that was what it was.

444
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,500
It's the, it's the behemoth like gargantuan size that is uncontrollable.

445
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
It's like a Godzilla.

446
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,780
It's like, that's, that's, you know, it's way beyond anything I could even imagine.

447
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,780
It's terrifying.

448
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,660
That's, that's what makes me feel weird.

449
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,900
And then if they have tits, then it's also sexy, I guess.

450
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,740
So the, the, the female pirate from one piece, episode one, do you like her?

451
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,020
Doesn't she get all big and fat?

452
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,380
Alveda, she was just a baddie from the start.

453
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,380
She actually gets, she actually gets way skinnier later and becomes like a sex god as a,

454
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
oh shit.

455
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
Yep.

456
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,380
Wait, she comes back later on.

457
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,420
They have to bring back even the, the episode one villain for this shit.

458
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,700
She comes back with like a whole new context and is actually a much more interesting character

459
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,260
when she does and is pretty cool.

460
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,260
So, uh.

461
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
She does.

462
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
She comes back quite well.

463
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
She salvaged her well.

464
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,940
Oda doesn't forget, man, but okay, we don't need to get into a lot of these things.

465
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,220
So the whole issue that we were just talking about, once again goes back to the whole,

466
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,940
if you're a fucking virgin, your dick thinks that nothing is going to happen to it, so you

467
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,620
might as well fantasize about anything.

468
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,380
Like you can just keep going further and further down the, the fucking giant fat rabbit hole

469
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
there.

470
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,900
And having sex is a good way to stop sexual exploration, you know?

471
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Yeah, yeah, it really is.

472
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
You gotta, yeah.

473
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,700
And like, so like inflation, right?

474
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,220
I think a lot of it does, once again talking about the whole context and also tactility

475
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,260
thing, right?

476
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,340
Like, um, I'm looking, I've deviant art search some, uh, and there's a, there's a pretty

477
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,700
decent, uh, focus on panty shots, which is to say this giant white wedge that is vaguely

478
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,260
in between their two feet, right?

479
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,900
And like imagining what that must feel like to have those panties be so stretched out,

480
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,220
which, you know, realistically, the clothes should just rip off, but usually the clothes

481
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,140
manage to stretch out, right?

482
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,180
And it's that feeling of like, hmm, what would have a giant feel like if it was this giant

483
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
12 foot ball?

484
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,860
Now I see how my dick can get involved here.

485
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,100
This makes more sense to me.

486
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,340
Nikki's looking at me.

487
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,380
My girlfriend has her name and, uh, just letting you know, like, I'm not particularly into

488
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,380
this one.

489
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,940
Like, I mean, if I had to, I could do it, but not really, but like, but again, also there

490
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,900
is the context of like a fact that a girl could be reduced to something like that is

491
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,500
like, oh man, that is so hot that she could be so like, I'm talking like a ball.

492
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,620
I'm talking like an actual fucking ball.

493
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,380
Nikki's like looking at me like shaking her head.

494
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,380
And that's the thing.

495
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,940
Don't kink shame this man.

496
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,940
Get the fuck out.

497
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,420
You're going to be, you're going to be bottling up my hero to food.

498
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,260
This is a sexual safe space.

499
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
Exactly.

500
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
Exactly.

501
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
That's why pedophilia is okay.

502
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Triple S.

503
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
Yeah.

504
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,260
No, we'll get into pedophilia.

505
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
I'm looking forward to it.

506
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
You got more turns coming up.

507
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,700
That's perfectly natural.

508
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,140
We will, we'll, all right, we'll get to that.

509
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,260
I've got something else to say about, uh, stuff.

510
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,780
There's the, the, the futonari fetish, uh, chicks, chicks with dicks, um, oh, uh, this,

511
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,660
this whole thing is called a trap.

512
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,660
It's called a trap.

513
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
No, it's, it's a separate thing.

514
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
It's a separate.

515
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,940
I mean, sometimes I see images of, of when it's just a girl and traps or distaste, it's,

516
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,420
it's just a girl with a, you know, not even wearing anything down there.

517
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,740
Just sort of having the dick swing around cause it's like 50 feet long, doesn't make

518
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
any sense.

519
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,780
But, um, I, I, over the course of like looking at that sort of stuff, I've come to realize

520
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,820
that I like it, um, not because, because I can disassociate the idea of a male and the

521
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,820
idea of a penis.

522
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:12,860
I don't know whether it's, it's like the cause, cause as a man, I have a penis and I'm

523
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:18,540
not repulsed by it because it's not gay to look at your own dick because you have it.

524
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,580
So the idea of someone else's dick, it's just, uh, you know, the dick isn't inherently male

525
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,220
because the, you know, it's like, there's an idea of maleness being, uh, gay, but you

526
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,020
can't be gay if you look at yourself, you know, so the dick isn't inherently gay.

527
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,700
So if a girl has a dick, then it's just, it's just, you know, a girl with a thing.

528
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,580
And, you know, I actually had thought about this point for a long time because my favorite

529
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,580
hentai to this day is still Bible black and Bible black is just full of food.

530
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,140
It's like food is central and, uh, I really had to think about like, okay, so you've

531
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,300
got just a woman here having sex with, well, you've got, uh, Professor Kitami, uh, Kitami,

532
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,020
yeah, Kitami, who is, she's just a woman, but she like uses magic to grow a dick like

533
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,820
above her vagina and then she has sex with women with it.

534
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,860
So like that, that's cool, but like what's, what are the, what are the, uh, the bits of

535
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
this equation here?

536
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,820
So you've got two women plus one dick basically.

537
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,380
So like basically when you're watching them having sex, so like, for example, uh, in episode

538
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,220
one they're having doggy style sex, her and this green haired girl.

539
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,420
So like when you, when you're watching from the front angle, you get to see two pairs

540
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,540
of tits bouncing around while they're having sex.

541
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,940
So that totally fulfills my criteria of imagining where my dick would be in the situation and

542
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,620
I get to see two accidentally animated pairs of tits bouncing around.

543
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,620
It's fantastic.

544
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,900
It's really great.

545
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
And I love it.

546
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,100
Now I actually do prefer, uh, like one man, one woman just because it's that much easier

547
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,620
for me to project myself into it.

548
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,820
In case you can't tell, like my tastes are extremely basic here.

549
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,300
I just want to be able to imagine how I'm having sex with this person.

550
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,900
That's what I do like every time.

551
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,100
I'm wondering about that because I don't know whether I even think about that when I'm

552
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
looking at porn.

553
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
I mean, I'm not sure either.

554
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Really?

555
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,140
I think what I do is I've never been into like lesbian porn at all because like I can't

556
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,500
I'm not really into that easily because it's, you know, lesbian porn is boring.

557
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,060
I mean, I legitimately think so.

558
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,060
Did you would argue against that?

559
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,340
But I do think that I think so too.

560
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,340
I wouldn't watch that shit.

561
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:19,180
I think it's like, I get a grasp of what the character is and then I just imagine how

562
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,740
I would interact with that person instead of just literally taking the place of whoever

563
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,740
is actually having sex with him.

564
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,380
You're using more imagination than I am because like I'm just projecting myself whereas you're

565
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,900
kind of coming up with your own stuff.

566
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,900
I'm coming up with like lore and stories of like potential like what would happen.

567
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
He's coming up with cum.

568
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Indeed.

569
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Oh, of course.

570
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
But yeah.

571
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,420
Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting.

572
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,100
That's why I like, I like, like characters a lot.

573
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,340
Like I have so many waifus because I just keep thinking about what they would do to me

574
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,780
or what I would do to them.

575
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,460
I've got a couple of waifus myself, so I'm no stranger to that.

576
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,660
But yeah, I hear you.

577
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
I hear you.

578
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,940
When it comes to specifically porn though, I do notice this about myself and my viewing

579
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
habits.

580
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,540
I'm looking for a guy fucking a woman because that's what I want to do and I want to see

581
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
most of the woman.

582
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,980
I don't want to see the guy's face.

583
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,540
Like whenever they put a guy's face in, I mean, I just prefer it if they don't.

584
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,660
Obviously.

585
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
You know, you see that in porn all the time.

586
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,660
They try to keep the guy out of the shot.

587
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,660
Oh, you know what?

588
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
You know what?

589
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:21,140
It might be, it might be because I'm not like, like built like the sort of normal, I'm not

590
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:26,580
either fat or muscular and whenever there's a guy fucking a girl, I'm just, I'm just kind

591
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
of small.

592
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,780
I'm small and skinny.

593
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,620
And that's, that's more similar to the shape of a woman that it is the shape of the man

594
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,040
that is usually fucking the girl in the hentai.

595
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,620
So I can't really project myself onto that big muscular man.

596
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,140
So it's easier to project myself into like one of the futonari girls.

597
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,140
Maybe.

598
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Maybe that's how it works.

599
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,900
Girl, I know a girl who like she can't enjoy porn if the girl who is in the porn is like

600
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
not white.

601
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Right.

602
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
And she feels bad about that.

603
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,300
I'm like, Hey, man, it's how you see yourself.

604
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,940
And like for me, I don't really think of myself racially.

605
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:03,140
I just think of myself as like having like curly hair and like having sort of my general

606
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,660
kind of face.

607
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Right.

608
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,980
If there's like a guy who's like a big manly man with a beard, I can't project it all.

609
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,980
Right.

610
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,780
Or if they've got like straight hair or like short hair, I can't project it all.

611
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,100
But if it's a guy black or white or whatever, but he's got like kind of thick hair and sort

612
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,540
of like just doesn't look like a grown ass man, I can project myself way more easily and

613
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,540
I'm way more into that.

614
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,540
You know what I mean?

615
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,540
Yeah.

616
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,500
I mean, I do like it when the guy looks as much like me as possible and if he's like super

617
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,420
ripped or anything that will be distracting as if he's like black or something because

618
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
I'm not black.

619
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,900
So it's like, okay, well, that's not me.

620
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,580
Um, yeah, but it's never really been like a huge issue for me.

621
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
Yeah, I don't know.

622
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,300
I feel like usually at the moment of actual like coming, I'm thinking intensely about

623
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,940
the feelings that the female is going through.

624
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,660
I'm, I'm, I'm latching entirely onto that fascination of what it must feel like for them.

625
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:56,220
I feel like that's the moment where I usually like end up at, uh, because I don't know.

626
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,820
That's just, so that's usually why I can, I can, I can, I don't need a guy to be involved,

627
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,580
although it does often help, but I do plenty of like just two girls just thinking about

628
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,940
what they are feeling, you know, just constantly empathizing with that.

629
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,260
And by the way, to those of you, I, there is a contingent of people out there who argue

630
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,020
that like lesbian porn is the straightest porn for guys to watch because there's no

631
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
man there.

632
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,700
Obviously it's less gay than watching a man have sex.

633
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
Like what are you gay, bro?

634
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,300
Why do you like looking at dicks, dude?

635
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,700
Uh, just letting you know that's incorrect guys.

636
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
It's incorrect.

637
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
Yeah, reasonable.

638
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,700
Yeah.

639
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
I think they're onto something.

640
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Uh, okay.

641
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,580
They should chop those all their own one off and then they won't be gay anymore because

642
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
they won't have a dick.

643
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
That makes a lot of sense to me.

644
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,020
Well, did you have more of your diet tribe to go through because we cut you off like

645
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,020
an hour ago?

646
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,620
Well, I mean, no, I'm willing to like just, I mean, I do have more.

647
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,620
I do have some notes.

648
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,620
Yes.

649
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
Well, I'm ready for it.

650
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,620
Yeah.

651
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
Let's me enter through that again.

652
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,500
So as I was kind of alluding to a little bit ago, like there's sort of like, um, different

653
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,380
cores or different layers of fetishism, you know, based on like how obscure it is.

654
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,700
Like, you know, people might say like, it's, it's a debate as to like what fetish is more

655
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
weird than another one.

656
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,660
Like say choking, you could argue, well, that's like bringing about death.

657
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,220
That's like pretty fucking extreme.

658
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,860
And also fairly common.

659
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,860
Yeah.

660
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Tons of women.

661
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
There's a thing, right?

662
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,220
Like, you know, all that inflation stuff.

663
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,940
I think DVNR is still primarily the, uh, the home of stuff of that sort of sex sector.

664
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,940
Right.

665
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,540
I'm sure there's plenty on Tumblr, but Tumblr tends to be more of a quality zone, uh, in

666
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,740
terms of what you're going to see.

667
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:29,820
Uh, DVNR is an absolute dumpster fire of quality, uh, and that is what inflation is.

668
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,380
You know, I'm sure there's probably a number of people drawn to it because of the amount

669
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,740
of quantity of it because inflation is easy to draw because it's a circle.

670
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Anyway.

671
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
Oh, true.

672
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
That's true.

673
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,900
Does Kirby Count as inflation porn?

674
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,900
Just inherently?

675
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
Oh, shit.

676
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Oh, probably.

677
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,540
Oh, there's probably, like, I'm, I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of people who work

678
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,260
at Nintendo were into inflation, there's a couple too many times.

679
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,260
No, man.

680
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,380
Like, you know, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Yoshi has a power up in that, and Mario like doggie

681
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,060
style grabs onto Yoshi's ass and floats up with him.

682
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,860
I'm like, this was animated with a little bit too much, uh, TLC, for me to like not

683
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,500
be entirely unsuspicious.

684
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,140
I hear what you're saying, and it also happens that in, uh, both the Galaxy games, there's

685
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,620
those lumas that you have to force feed tons of bits to, and then they get fat, and then

686
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
they explode into a star.

687
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,460
Oh, and let's not even get into fucking Mario and Luigi Bowser's inside story, which is

688
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,860
all about being inside every intimate detail of Bowser's body, and also he grows and shrinks

689
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,420
a number of times, and also he has a weight gain scene.

690
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Yeah.

691
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,060
Someone who works at Nintendo jacks off to Bowser daily is what I'm saying, come on.

692
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Is Shigeru Miyamoto.

693
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,060
I think somebody...

694
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,380
Yeah, it's true.

695
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,980
You think anybody jerks off about playing Dig Dug?

696
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
Oh, God.

697
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,700
There's the inflation, and not to mention, of course, it's mentioning Miyamoto, there's

698
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,660
the whole power mushroom thing that makes Mario big, you know?

699
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,660
Oh, yeah.

700
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660
That's pretty similar.

701
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,660
Yeah.

702
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,620
So anyway, so like, there's a whole DeviantArt section, and like, but the thing is, if you

703
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:53,700
go to DeviantArt and search fetish, then click newest, you're gonna get bondage, bondage,

704
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,180
bondage, latex, latex, latex, latex, latex, latex, latex, latex, furry, latex, bondage,

705
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,180
bondage, bondage, inflation, bondage, bondage, bondage, uh, and cutoff.

706
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Right.

707
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,060
So the thing is, those fetishes are way more common, right?

708
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,140
Those fetishes are much more in the realm of people who do actually, you know, go out

709
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,340
and meet people, right?

710
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,980
So there's this website called FetLife, which is a dating website for fetishes, and it's

711
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,060
all about the...

712
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
Those kinds of fetishes, right?

713
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,660
And this list that I posted on the Discord chat, I might even share it on the internet

714
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,740
somewhere, it's a list of FetLife's top 100 fetishes as picked by its users, like how

715
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,900
many, like, users have identified with a fetish.

716
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:34,540
So bondage, oral sex, spanking, hair pulling, anal sex, blindfolds, um, then you go down

717
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,460
to the bottom, you get stuff like enemas, daddy girl, bisexuality, teasing, submission,

718
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,740
orgasm denial, cock-sucking, flogging.

719
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,620
These are all things that can be done in real life.

720
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,620
Cock-sucking is at the bottom?

721
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,620
This is basic.

722
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,620
This is basic shit, yeah.

723
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
I know, right?

724
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,620
And there are some weird stuff.

725
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,620
I mean, one time I saw...

726
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,620
Getting a blowjob is a fetish?

727
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,940
The thing about that life is you can actually add any fetish you want, and what you'll see

728
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,420
is a lot of profiles, men and women, they'll just start, like, mass adding, like, hundreds,

729
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,740
literal hundreds of fetishes that were submitted to the site while they jack off.

730
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,380
So some of them get really specific, you know, like, laying down while daddy rams his cock

731
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,900
through my left ear socket.

732
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
That kind of thing.

733
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Oh, no!

734
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
Okay.

735
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,340
Davoo, is this the website you used to meet your current girlfriend?

736
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,940
Uh, no, that was a different one.

737
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,100
This website kind of sucks, because I'm not into these kinds of fetishes enough, you know?

738
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Right.

739
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Right.

740
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
And whatever.

741
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Anyway, so, like, there's that difference.

742
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,380
So when you go to somewhere like DeviantArt, it's a much more obscure realm of, like, such

743
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,260
that the sex doesn't even have to be involved.

744
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,980
In fact, that's actually another thing I want to talk about in a minute, but I might have

745
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,060
to, like, restrain myself so I don't just go on straight for over two hours.

746
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,060
Oh, please don't.

747
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,220
Um, which is that, like, um, sex isn't even, most of my fetishes, like, the whole diaper

748
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,300
thing, right, the whole ABDL segment.

749
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Yes.

750
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
That's the acronym, right?

751
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,820
But what does ABDL stand for?

752
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,380
There's two different subgroups.

753
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,100
There's diaper lover, that's the group for the diaper thing, right?

754
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,860
Then there's adult baby, which is in phantalism, right?

755
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Yeah.

756
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
You can't be one without the other.

757
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,660
I mean, I think a lot of people are, but ABDL is the place.

758
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,460
Vote up in phantalism, people.

759
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Yeah.

760
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,660
So, um, so, so, like, that often, if you go to DeviantArt and you look up, like, diaper

761
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,780
art on there, most of it, in fact, the vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of it, never

762
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,220
is explicitly sexual if you don't have that fetish.

763
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,420
And if you were somehow unaware as to how fetishes work or you just weren't cottoned

764
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,820
on to the nature of the internet, you might just be generally weirded out and not even

765
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,100
realize that there is anything sexual going on.

766
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,100
And in fact, the comments section and the whole community on DeviantArt is amazingly

767
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,660
chased or chat, roundabout.

768
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,140
It never, there's no one who can just comments, I came to this picture, like you'd find on

769
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,140
certain other websites.

770
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,860
There's other, there's a site called diaperedanime.org where people will say, I came to this picture,

771
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
right?

772
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,820
Um, but I'm just like, if you go to DeviantArt, is there a gif of the Rugrats theme song when

773
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,140
Tommy's diaper falls out of the air and lands on his legs perfectly?

774
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,220
Uh, probably, yeah, but you know, there's some good art.

775
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,580
I came to that too.

776
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,580
Yeah.

777
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,740
Well, anyway, no one ever talks about sex there.

778
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,100
No one talks about being turned on by all that shit.

779
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,820
People just sort of say, ah, cute.

780
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,980
Everyone is on DeviantArt, you're saying?

781
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,260
Yeah, yeah, it's almost like a weird, like sort of drug deal.

782
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,420
Like it's like, it's like a drug market where everyone's like, hey, do you have the, uh,

783
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
the gashi?

784
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
Thank you.

785
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Mmm.

786
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:19,180
Ah, this one will be quite nice up on my mantelpiece, you know, are you suggesting there's Deviancy

787
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
on DeviantArt?

788
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,260
Yeah, well, in the diaper community specifically, but all those like, I don't know what to call

789
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,340
them, like the pure fantasy ones where no sex is involved, like most characters aren't

790
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,780
hardly even drawn in sexually compromising positions half the time, right?

791
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,100
There's never any like genitals involved, almost never, and it's like, but it's still

792
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
entirely something you can jack off to.

793
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I can jack off to.

794
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,700
It's entirely something that's like, it's, it's all those things I mentioned before,

795
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,260
context, humiliation, the sensation of like what it must feel like, you know, like what

796
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:55,220
a diaper feels like tact-highly, you know, maybe some people think, or think it's a really

797
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,220
good feeling.

798
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
I don't fucking know.

799
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,100
See, that's, that's interesting because I just fundamentally do not understand anything

800
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,660
that isn't like, like jacking off to anything that isn't just sex, and that's a limiting

801
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,660
thing for me.

802
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,420
That's a, that's a hang up I personally have.

803
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,740
So I'm just very interested to hear all about this.

804
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,140
You're only living half a life, Nate.

805
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,140
I know.

806
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,260
I need to expand my horizons.

807
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,820
And it's right.

808
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,820
Yeah.

809
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,220
I should have got a diaper for this and be crapping in it as well.

810
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,420
This is my favorite episode so far, and we're like half an hour in.

811
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
Yeah.

812
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
This is good.

813
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
This is good.

814
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
I'm actually learning from DeVoo.

815
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,780
I didn't know all these things existed, and he's like educating us on the communities,

816
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,460
and I'm really interested in it.

817
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Me too.

818
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,860
Well, do you have any, any further points to make?

819
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,180
I mean, we've got some other things we can go to if you like, but.

820
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,620
Dude, he has two hours.

821
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,020
He has a whole PCP lecture of points to make.

822
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,020
I'm sure he does.

823
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
Oh yeah.

824
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,380
So what you were talking about a little bit ago, Nate, is that like, because you can

825
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,820
go pretty deep dive into de-esque stuff sometimes, right?

826
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
What is de-esque?

827
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,420
Like D, four-channel board.

828
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,420
Oh, de-esque.

829
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,420
Yes.

830
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Yes.

831
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
Yes.

832
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,420
Yes.

833

Yes.

Yes.

847
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,420
Yes.

848
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420
Yes.

849
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
Yes.

Yes.

851
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
Yes.

852
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Yes.

853
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,420
Yes.

854
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,420
Yes.

855
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
Yes.

856
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,420
Yes.

857
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,420
Yes.

858
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Yes.

859
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
Yes.

860
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,420
Yes.

861
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Yes.

862
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,260
Yes.

863
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,420
Yes.

864
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Yes.

865
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Yes.

866
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Yes.

867
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
Yes.

868
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Yes.

869
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Yes.

870
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,420
Yes.

871
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
Yes.

872
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
Yes, yes.

873
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
Yes.

874
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
Yes.

875
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,640
makes you look like a little girl.

876
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,480
Yum, yum, yum.

877
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,440
Big difference between that and like writing a, yeah.

878
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,200
Big difference between that and then like extensive

879
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,840
multi-branching stories on cyoc.net

880
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,640
about a girl becoming incontinent and shitting herself

881
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,960
and being changed by every different member of her family

882
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,080
and coming to that for about a week and straight,

883
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,840
maybe something along those lines

884
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,440
where sex never even gets involved.

885
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,280
That's being submerged into the same fetish

886
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,920
that for others is a garnish.

887
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,680
So for you, are you saying it's a garnish or a submerge?

888
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,320
Yeah, that's my dude, that's my guy.

889
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,160
If I can ask, what is the appeal of a girl becoming retarded

890
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,480
and her parents changing her diaper?

891
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,880
Well, doesn't Incontinent just make you

892
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,720
take control of your balance?

893
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,960
Nikki, what's the feeling about a girl becoming retarded

894
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,360
and her parents changing her diaper?

895
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,200
Good question.

896
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,520
She just gives me a sad face.

897
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,520
It's just deep personal trauma.

898
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,160
That's really the root cause.

899
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,000
No, I'd add it back.

900
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,840
Yeah, you wanna answer?

901
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,240
Oh, I'm gonna give her the mic.

902
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,600
She's coming up.

903
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Get in close now.

904
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,760
Any second.

905
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,080
What's the time to get everybody retarded?

906
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,360
Yeah, what's hot about your girl being retarded

907
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,480
and then changing her diaper?

908
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,320
Being retarded?

909
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,640
Her being, okay, I can relate to that.

910
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,200
Yeah, it's not hot for the guy or the girl.

911
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,320
So she just says being powered.

912
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,480
Sorry, I have the headphones on so she can't hear you.

913
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,560
This is a really awkward idea.

914
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,360
I knew having her being in the room would be weird,

915
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,000
but whatever, it's the sheer powerlessness.

916
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,320
The sheer dehumanization of it.

917
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,080
They have no independence now, right?

918
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,920
Well, what about you?

919
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,800
Those are the things I usually whisper

920
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,640
in her ear during sex.

921
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,480
Is it?

922
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,800
You have no brains, no ability to think,

923
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,560
no independence, no ability to make decisions,

924
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,400
no freedom.

925
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
You don't have the option for freedom.

926
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,200
You have no ability to choose.

927
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,320
Okay, all of that is true in Trump's America

928
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,160
for a woman anyway.

929
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,520
It is, I mean, in North America.

930
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,240
Now, I know that sounds weird people,

931
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
but I'm sure there's a lot of virgins.

932
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,080
Listen to this.

933
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,680
This is normal shit to say during sex.

934
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,880
It is not weird to say the most fucked up shit

935
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,720
to get me out for sex.

936
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,880
They don't even know why you're bringing that up.

937
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,320
I thought it was perfect for fun.

938
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,360
All right, I got a question.

939
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,480
I got a question.

940
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,320
Oh, Nikki wants water.

941
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,400
Remember, I thought she wanted the microphone.

942
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,240
She just wants some water.

943
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,800
She must be sweating a lot.

944
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,920
Okay, all right, okay.

945
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,880
All right, debut.

946
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,760
Yeah?

947
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,800
That would back...

948
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,040
More like Dupu.

949
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,440
There it is.

950
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,280
Nailed it.

951
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,720
I've been holding that one in all night.

952
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,160
Hey, that's what you're gonna say tonight, aren't you?

953
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,120
Oh, hey.

954
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,040
All right, everybody, shut up.

955
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,880
Give, go on.

956
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,480
Would that idea work also with somebody

957
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,120
who was just a vegetable?

958
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,840
Like they had brain damage and they can't move.

959
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,600
Not as good, no, not as good, no.

960
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,760
All right, why is the diaper part of that then?

961
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,840
What...

962
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,680
Why is that?

963
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,720
I don't think they're tart enough

964
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,280
to be needing to wear diapers.

965
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,320
It's just kind of a, I guess, sort of an indicator

966
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,160
of the low level that they're functioning at,

967
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,800
sort of if they need that, you know.

968
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,160
But it's only attractive if you know it's an illusion,

969
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,760
because if it was like an actual person,

970
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,360
you wouldn't want to do, right?

971
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,200
Right.

972
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,040
Maybe.

973
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,880
Yeah, so yeah, I can see that.

974
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,720
Maybe he slips that in.

975
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,800
Well, if there was a real 20-year-old girl

976
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,720
who actually fell off a motorcycle without a helmet

977
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,280
and became retarded and wore diapers,

978
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,160
who would want to have sex with her?

979
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,080
Well, okay, all right, all right,

980
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,800
let's not put this position.

981
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,360
Guys, you gotta listen to me on this, okay?

982
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,640
Because there's nothing wrong with being attracted

983
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,440
to the most fucked up shit.

984
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,760
But it's not like you have to,

985
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,160
even if you admit that you're attracted to something,

986
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,680
that doesn't mean that you're going to like

987
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
fuck a person who meets these people.

988
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,400
Yeah, I wasn't, like, it's okay to be attracted to it.

989
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,160
I was asking if you would actually rape this retarded person.

990
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't think-

991
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,880
No, because I would feel bad.

992
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
If I was brought up in a society

993
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,760
for whatever reason rape was not frowned upon, then yeah,

994
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,560
but that's not the case.

995
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,640
You know, that's all we need.

996
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,720
That's all we need.

997
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,560
Let's keep going.

998
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,400
Because I mean, like, it's not like,

999
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
oh, I'm not doing it because I'm not allowed to.

1000
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,480
It's like, because people would feel bad about it,

1001
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,400
I would feel bad about it, right?

1002
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,160
Okay, everybody needs to understand,

1003
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,280
if you raise in a culture where like you,

1004
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,960
when you get older, like you and your brother

1005
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,520
have to fight and you have to kill each other

1006
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,200
and the winner gets the inheritance or whatever,

1007
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,080
like you would do that.

1008
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,520
Like that's, that's what we're talking about.

1009
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,200
Like being in an immoral culture,

1010
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,800
we understand of course that these things are not good

1011
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,480
that you shouldn't do them in real life, but like-

1012
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,640
But if society thought it was okay, we would just do it.

1013
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,480
Well, if society thought you could do things

1014
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,320
that you wanted to do that aren't okay now,

1015
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,280
then you would do them too.

1016
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,360
Like that's just how humans work.

1017
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,200
It is.

1018
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,600
Oh no, I'm totally on board.

1019
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,760
Why are you so defensive?

1020
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,600
I'm on board.

1021
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm on board of people getting involved, like doing,

1022
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,480
like, like, but when it comes to not doing harm,

1023
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,440
like, you know, maybe do I Google like medical journals

1024
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,080
of parents raising their retarded children

1025
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,000
and jack off to that?

1026
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,840
Sometimes potentially, you know, I don't know.

1027
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,760
Sometimes we've all been there, Nate.

1028
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,600
This is fascinating.

1029
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,440
Why are you freaking out?

1030
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,280
I'm not freaking out.

1031
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,720
I'm just making sure people understand.

1032
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,560
That's my only goal.

1033
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,880
I understand completely.

1034
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,160
It's very much not as bad to say out loud,

1035
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,560
but the same sort of things sometimes happens

1036
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,920
with me with like breast expansion and stuff

1037
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,960
where I would look at charts of like the average cup sizes

1038
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,200
over certain decades and I would jack off exclusively

1039
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,760
to the idea that breasts in general are getting bigger.

1040
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,600
Yeah.

1041
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,440
Oh yeah, man.

1042
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,280
That's kind of funny.

1043
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,560
I mean, like, okay, I want to talk about sequences

1044
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,960
for a second because like there was some like medium sized

1045
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,880
kerfuffle on the internet a few years back

1046
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,360
over like some image that was meant for Tumblr alone,

1047
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,440
but somehow found its way into the SJW anti SJW sphere

1048
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,360
on Twitter and Facebook and such.

1049
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,280
Of an image sequence.

1050
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,560
It was probably Sargon of Akadu leaked it.

1051
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,080
Of like this girl who's like a bimbo, a gyaru,

1052
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,360
or however you say it.

1053
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,200
Gyaru, yeah.

1054
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,880
And she slowly transforms into becoming shorter,

1055
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,000
smaller, pail, darker haired, glasses wearing,

1056
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,600
book carrying, right?

1057
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,440
And you look at it.

1058
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,560
Are you sure it wasn't the other way around?

1059
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,120
Doesn't she become the bimbo?

1060
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,960
No, it's the other way around.

1061
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,160
Wait, no, it's the other way around.

1062
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
I remember specifically.

1063
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,000
And like.

1064
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,840
Okay, if you say so.

1065
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,040
And like for me at first,

1066
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,480
because I had heard about it in the context of this SJW fight,

1067
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,120
I was like, oh wait, huh?

1068
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,320
Is that trying to send this message of fucking,

1069
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,320
it's important to not be attractive and be bogus instead?

1070
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,760
But then I looked at it more closely.

1071
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,640
I'm like, oh, it's a transformation sequence.

1072
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,440
And I posted it without context on the PCP chat

1073
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,200
and Gib was like, oh hey, it's a transformation sequence.

1074
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,120
It's a very classic medium of like,

1075
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,760
have point A to point B, you show the steps.

1076
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,360
You know, maybe they turn into a pig,

1077
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,040
they turn into like twice their age,

1078
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,800
two characters merge into one, you know, that kind of thing.

1079
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,640
It's the sequence of events

1080
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,720
that itself can be attractive.

1081
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,560
Yeah.

1082
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,720
And I remember people got mad about that

1083
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,960
cause, okay, I honestly can't remember

1084
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,120
which step came first,

1085
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,880
but like she went from like what appears to be like a smart,

1086
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,160
I mean, she gets a tan or like she loses her tan,

1087
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,600
but people took that to be like a racial thing that like,

1088
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,160
she's like becoming like people thought it was that,

1089
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,120
which it wasn't at all.

1090
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,320
She just like got a tan

1091
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,360
and became like a sexy housewife or whatever.

1092
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,040
Yeah, I mean, it was a racist thing.

1093
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,960
It was a racial thing.

1094
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,600
It was a fetishistically racial thing,

1095
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,040
not a politically racial one.

1096
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,380
I'm not sure I agree with that.

1097
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,020
I mean, maybe that's true,

1098
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,340
but it looked to me like she just got a tan.

1099
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,380
Yeah.

1100
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,660
But okay, but putting that aside,

1101
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,620
like it doesn't matter either way.

1102
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,980
It's about the transformation and that's it.

1103
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,260
I was thinking about like why it is that like growth

1104
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,380
and like big things getting bigger

1105
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,780
and like not getting smaller,

1106
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,980
like getting smaller is bad.

1107
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,820
I don't like that.

1108
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,380
But getting bigger is good.

1109
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,900
And I was thinking probably that stems from-

1110
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,380
Is it because you want to be bigger?

1111
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,580
Is that like a personal thing maybe?

1112
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,420
I don't know.

1113
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,260
I think it might stem from the fact that I'm just small

1114
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,380
and I'm used to people being bigger.

1115
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,380
And the idea of a giant woman is pretty good, you know?

1116
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,220
Giant woman.

1117
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,420
Like that Steven Universe episode.

1118
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,260
Yeah.

1119
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,100
Oh man.

1120
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,220
See, that's the first one I ever saw.

1121
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,060
Oh man.

1122
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,900
I like that a lot.

1123
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,740
And I thought, you know,

1124
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,060
this is going to be good jerk off material later on.

1125
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,340
We were talking about relating,

1126
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,940
connecting empathizing with the guy in the fucking thing.

1127
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,100
You know, you also have like the contrast of the fantasy.

1128
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,020
I'm sure a lot of people are like,

1129
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,460
well I want a guy who's all attractive and muscular

1130
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,820
because that's what I want to be.

1131
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,340
And of course that's obviously why dicks are so big.

1132
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,860
You know, as a potential alleged,

1133
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,020
slightly above average dick user myself, right?

1134
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,380
That has no appeal to me.

1135
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,500
And honestly, I just look at like a 10 inch dick

1136
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,620
and I'm like, whatever.

1137
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,180
Small penis humiliation, SPH as it's called on D,

1138
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,780
is pretty good.

1139
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,700
I'm really down for that.

1140
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,980
Like when like the anime girl just grabs the dick

1141
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,860
and it's like, this is it?

1142
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,380
Wait, isn't it going to get, wait, it's already hard?

1143
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,340
Huh, I don't think this is meant to go inside a girl.

1144
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,620
Because from your perception,

1145
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,900
that's such a fantastical situation

1146
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,500
that you would never find yourself in.

1147
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Yeah, of course.

1148
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,740
We got a real Mike Matei over here is, you know.

1149
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,220
Yeah, wait, what the fuck does that mean?

1150
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,580
Mike Matei has a huge cock.

1151
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,420
He does?

1152
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,260
That's canon.

1153
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,740
Yeah, it's like 11 inches long.

1154
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,780
You can see it in a video when he shows it off.

1155
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,620
Oh, really?

1156
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,460
I haven't seen that, but.

1157
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,140
Yeah, he tells James like that his wife loves it.

1158
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,940
Well, that's nice.

1159
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,860
Yeah, cause James Rolfe is a cuckold.

1160
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,700
Well, that's true.

1161
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,940
Okay, well let's move on.

1162
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,780
I have another one, like a whole separate topic

1163
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,620
that I wanted to bring up.

1164
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,660
And I know this has been discussed many times

1165
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,980
by various members of our organization here,

1166
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,260
but I want to talk about anthropomorphization,

1167
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,420
specifically when it comes to like animals and shit.

1168
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,780
And I just want to make a broad point at first,

1169
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,540
at least how I look at this stuff.

1170
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,300
I mean, and several of us have made videos about this,

1171
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,140
but like when I, like for example, my little pony, right?

1172
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,460
Okay, so those, those, those.

1173
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,300
What's that?

1174
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,140
That's, it's this, you know,

1175
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,700
it's this famous Japanese anime you probably have.

1176
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,540
But it's.

1177
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,700
Oh, don't they have a movie coming out soon

1178
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,420
that we're all going to go review together?

1179
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,260
I'm pretty.

1180
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,100
I'm pretty excited.

1181
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:53,940
On an ABAP channel.

1182
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,780
There's going to be some things.

1183
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,620
There's going to be some things happening with that movie.

1184
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,440
Uh-oh.

1185
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,780
I'm very excited for it.

1186
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,980
But so like when I jack off to my little pony,

1187
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,820
as I do all the time, like what, what I'm jacking off to

1188
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,340
is their human characteristics that are attractive to me.

1189
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,060
It like, there's no difference to me

1190
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,340
between jacking off to like, I don't know, rarity

1191
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,260
or like some anime character,

1192
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,340
because neither of them are exactly human.

1193
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,580
So what you're jacking off to is this sort of representation

1194
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,420
of a human female, which I find sexually appealing

1195
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,140
because I am a human male and I am programmed

1196
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,420
to respond to these things.

1197
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,260
Like they've got a pussy.

1198
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,100
There it is.

1199
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,260
The hood, the mane, the cutie mark.

1200
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,580
Yeah, exactly.

1201
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,820
All those human things.

1202
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,660
Their faces.

1203
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,660
To me, like anthropomorphization is so like banal.

1204
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,740
It's like.

1205
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,580
Exactly.

1206
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,900
A lot of the time it's really just surface level features.

1207
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,260
As long as they have tits, you know.

1208
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,100
But the ponies don't have tits.

1209
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,620
Okay, but if you doggy style fuck them,

1210
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,620
then you just look at their ass,

1211
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,500
but you just look like a human ass.

1212
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,340
No, no, no.

1213
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,860
Like the anthropomorphize images of ponies

1214
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,660
as if they were humans, they're just girls with tits

1215
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,620
and what are you talking about?

1216
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,700
Well, I'm kind of talking about like.

1217
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,780
Are you fucking free?

1218
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,700
I'm talking about the ponies themselves

1219
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,300
and the way they have human character,

1220
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,740
like they aren't just horses.

1221
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,980
They're like this cartoonified version of horses

1222
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,940
that have a lot of human characteristics.

1223
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,220
Come on.

1224
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,860
Well, I made a video about that many years ago.

1225
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,100
And I think it was great.

1226
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,940
I'd love that video.

1227
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,780
I think it made a lot of good points.

1228
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,140
I think the appeal makes a lot more sense.

1229
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,340
It's much more apparently obvious, self-evident

1230
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,700
if you check out monster girls.

1231
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,540
And I mean, monster moves that made the show

1232
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,460
will immediately educate you as to the appeal,

1233
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,420
which is you're getting everything that,

1234
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,300
usually 75 to 85% of everything

1235
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,740
that you like about human girls

1236
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,380
with some cool animal features tacked on.

1237
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,300
So it's like the idea of like,

1238
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,980
man, wouldn't it be cool if you could ride your girls back

1239
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,540
and like she's perfectly comfortable

1240
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,060
taking you around town like that, you know?

1241
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,380
How would it feel to be fucking her from behind

1242
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,060
but so far behind that her head's all the way

1243
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,900
like fucking over there

1244
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,900
because she's a goddamn horse, right?

1245
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,500
She's a centaur baby, right?

1246
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,700
That's the thing that like.

1247
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,660
Spider girls are pretty good.

1248
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,500
Rockin' air is great.

1249
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,340
Rockin' air is great.

1250
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,940
Best girl, lover, she's a beauty.

1251
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,340
I like Lola Bunny.

1252
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,660
You could do her Bunny style

1253
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,180
and then play human basketball with her.

1254
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,740
Wait, what's Bunny style?

1255
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,660
Is that where they fell?

1256
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,940
You just jumble, get into that and fetish his part too.

1257
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,760
Okay.

1258
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,020
Well, I mean, that's pretty much my entire point.

1259
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,020
I just want to kind of go over that.

1260
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,740
Like, yeah, I will jack off to furries all the time.

1261
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,340
I'm not a furry at all,

1262
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,580
but I have absolutely no problem

1263
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,420
like jacking off to a furry.

1264
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,260
But the furry doesn't necessarily.

1265
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,100
I mean, like.

1266
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,940
Yeah, like that's not what I'm into.

1267
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,260
I'm into like the female human aspects.

1268
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,100
Oh yeah, there's plenty of furry stuff.

1269
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,100
The further furry it gets, the furrier it gets,

1270
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,620
the more I have a hard time with it.

1271
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,420
Some ears, nothing, right?

1272
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,420
Some fur on the skin, as long as the art's good.

1273
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,100
Muscles, you better have a really hot context

1274
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,540
and some good dialogue that I'm gonna be able to jack off to,

1275
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,260
or I can't go any further, right?

1276
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,140
And like sometimes I specifically seek out furry art

1277
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,060
because it has its own culture, its own style,

1278
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,780
and sometimes I'm into some of the things it does.

1279
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,660
Furry art is way more just abrupt

1280
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,180
with getting to the point of what it wants,

1281
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,380
at least like in the whole diaper zone,

1282
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,580
like art that is both furry and diaper,

1283
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,180
is just way more like, all right, here's what you want.

1284
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,460
Boom, crank it up to 11.

1285
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,820
Furry art tends to crank things up to 11

1286
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,620
and be even more shameless and direct.

1287
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,060
What's that, Gib?

1288
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,020
Now I've noticed that as well,

1289
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,820
like furry art is like always like.

1290
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,020
Shameless.

1291
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,260
Like, they're huge.

1292
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,100
Yeah.

1293
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,020
It's huge, every time, every single thing that they could be.

1294
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,740
Right, so I was on a pretty big furry kick

1295
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,340
for like a week, a month or two ago,

1296
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,860
because I was just really into a shamelessness kick.

1297
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,620
And the furry community provides that.

1298
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,260
You know what's like a good example of that?

1299
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,700
For many, many years,

1300
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,020
there's been a vast shortage of like Kingdom Hearts porn,

1301
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,460
but like Kingdom Hearts furry porn.

1302
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,620
Now there's a diverse community out there.

1303
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,180
Really? That's it.

1304
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,020
To some extent.

1305
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,020
I mean, I'm not an expert,

1306
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,540
but like I feel like I've seen at least as much,

1307
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,380
if not far more.

1308
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,660
Is there the Lion King in that?

1309
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,100
Is that one?

1310
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,540
Well, Sora does become a lion in Kingdom Arts 2,

1311
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,100
which you should play and find out yourself,

1312
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,300
because it's pretty cool.

1313
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,020
Does somebody have sex with the Keyblade?

1314
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,420
The Keyblade is not too involved in this situation.

1315
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,620
You just gotta be a porn of a woman fucking.

1316
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,460
I have a key fetish, so that's my problem.

1317
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,180
An actual Keyblade model, right?

1318
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,500
It's gotta be somewhere.

1319
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,900
Probably.

1320
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,620
People who are into like fucking metal things

1321
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,460
are probably called Shinies, right?

1322
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,660
Oh, they're called by that, maybe.

1323
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,980
Well, when it comes to like,

1324
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,380
my mind as a porn consumer of my mind,

1325
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,580
crows are into shiny porn.

1326
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,620
Crows would be into that.

1327
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,100
My mind, when it comes to Kingdom Arts 4,

1328
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,580
if you wanted to involve the Keyblade,

1329
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,900
it would be like some sort of situation

1330
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,460
where they're like unlocking this

1331
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,140
like ultimate Chastity Belt or something, you know,

1332
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,100
where like you, the key is used to access the vagina

1333
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,980
in some way, and Chastity Belt comes to mind.

1334
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,460
You know, I'd go for something like that.

1335
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,780
Or you could fucking with the Keyblade,

1336
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,940
though it would be pretty uncomfortable.

1337
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,220
It's not really shaped for that.

1338
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,780
But you know, you get it.

1339
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,540
Like, oh, sorry. Life finds a way.

1340
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,100
What if you, yeah, go ahead and give.

1341
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,300
What if it's like an anthropomorphized door

1342
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,060
with a keyhole vagina?

1343
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,260
Oh my God. Hell yeah.

1344
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,100
Hell yeah. I've never seen that one, but.

1345
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,420
That's a good idea.

1346
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,660
Let's get to it, boys.

1347
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,620
Let's get drawing.

1348
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,180
Let's get writing.

1349
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,500
That's the next draw cast.

1350
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,860
That's a good idea.

1351
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,740
Whichever. If all the artists in the audience

1352
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,740
haven't been drawing everything we've been saying,

1353
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,220
up to this point, they should be.

1354
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,340
If any of you. I need lots of fan art of Davoo

1355
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,100
and his girlfriend pooping on each other.

1356
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,900
Oh, no, that's just scat zone.

1357
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,340
That's just the actual zone of like being

1358
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,380
into the tactility of it.

1359
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,860
That's too far. Don't do that.

1360
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,020
No, no, no. That's really just for people

1361
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,700
who want to have the feeling of it,

1362
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,740
which I am not into at all.

1363
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,500
That's why I'm pretty hesitant to do it.

1364
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,740
It's like. Can we draw Davoo in a diaper?

1365
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,020
Oh. I don't want to jack off to myself.

1366
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:50,860
I mean, I guess.

1367
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,260
I don't know what your girlfriend looks like, dude.

1368
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,420
I can't draw her.

1369
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,660
No one wants to jack off to like their own situation.

1370
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,260
What's fascinating about porn is like the newness of it,

1371
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,140
the fantasy of it that you can get involved with personally.

1372
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,500
Yeah. Porn yourself.

1373
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,700
I don't know.

1374
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,740
I mean, there was a little porn

1375
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,020
of drawing of my, of keg standard back in the day,

1376
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,820
which was fine, but.

1377
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,660
Nate, the other day,

1378
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,500
somebody drew the art of you as a girl

1379
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,380
and you jerked off to that in the PCP chat for like an hour.

1380
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,940
But that's because that's.

1381
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,540
It's different from your real life, yeah.

1382
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,660
Fantasy and sexy and something?

1383
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,740
Well, it's still you.

1384
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,900
I definitely get turned on by PCP to the

1385
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,220
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1386
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,700
Monkey. Hold the fuck on.

1387
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,660
You tell, like, like rule 63 versions of yourself

1388
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,580
are like some of the hottest things to jack off to.

1389
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,420
Cause like, to know yourself.

1390
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,580
It's not just you though.

1391
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,500
It's girl you.

1392
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,220
And contrary to popular belief,

1393
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,060
there are actual differences between women and men.

1394
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,900
Look it up.

1395
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,260
Google is a big fan of this theory.

1396
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:49,260
So, you know, like there's differences there

1397
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,580
and we could explore them together

1398
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,420
while I pound the shit out of her vagina.

1399
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,380
I mean, I will say right now on my channel,

1400
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,620
I'm doing an art contest to draw me as a girl

1401
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,700
doing lesbian shit with Luna Lovegood.

1402
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,940
But I, like I don't masturbate to it.

1403
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,260
I just appreciate it.

1404
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,980
But I guess I'm just not in that head space

1405
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,540
of wanting to jerk off to myself.

1406
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,140
I mean, if there was like a dogen

1407
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,540
of like this female version of character of me

1408
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,340
that someone had made, like I would absolutely

1409
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,420
jack off to it without a doubt.

1410
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,260
But like.

1411
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,100
Get to work PCP.

1412
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,340
You know, I've never been much of like

1413
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,020
a jack off to picture kind of guy though.

1414
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,900
That's just not really my.

1415
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,100
I actually don't know whether I would

1416
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,740
if it was like a girl version of me.

1417
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,780
Yeah.

1418
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,060
Well, I don't know why that's.

1419
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,140
It depends on the situation though.

1420
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,340
Like if it's me like editing a video

1421
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,420
and like releasing it and I'm like,

1422
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,540
yay, that was fun.

1423
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,500
Also, I'm a girl.

1424
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Also, I'm going to suck this cock now.

1425
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,340
Like.

1426
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,180
Hell yeah.

1427
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,100
Wait, just let her masturbate to yourself,

1428
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,860
sucking a cock?

1429
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,460
Well, if it's girl version of me,

1430
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,500
that's one of the many sexual acts that she could do.

1431
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,540
But the thing is, when you watch porn,

1432
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,980
you imagine yourself as the dick,

1433
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,300
but now you're imagining yourself as the person sucking.

1434
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,140
Well, yeah.

1435
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:51,980
No, no, no, no.

1436
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,820
I'm still projecting.

1437
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,660
You're sucking your own dick.

1438
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,300
Exactly what you're sucking somebody else's dick.

1439
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,100
I'm projecting myself in the situation

1440
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,900
as the guy getting fucked by the gender swapped version

1441
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,740
of myself.

1442
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,060
Wait, so you're imagining you having sex with yourself.

1443
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,900
Oh, come on.

1444
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,300
This is basic shit.

1445
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,500
I know that you've thought of this a thousand times yourself.

1446
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,340
No, I haven't.

1447
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,180
Oh, come on.

1448
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,020
Come on.

1449
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,700
What are you fucking talking about?

1450
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,180
I'm thinking of girl version of me

1451
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,180
and I'm thinking of me getting fucked by a dude.

1452
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,540
I'm thinking, oh my god,

1453
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,380
well, how would I feel being fucked with the vagina?

1454
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,980
Okay, I am not thinking about it that way.

1455
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,300
I'm not thinking about that.

1456
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,900
You're thinking about sucking cock.

1457
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,780
I'm thinking about like a female version of me

1458
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,580
that exists that I could then fuck.

1459
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,980
And that's what I'm, you know.

1460
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,820
That's what I'm doing.

1461
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,860
I mean, that is kind of like funny

1462
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,260
because you are the best guy ever.

1463
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,860
So of course you'd have enough of an ego

1464
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,340
to want to fuck yourself.

1465
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,860
Dude, every person in the world,

1466
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,620
I don't believe that you don't want to fuck

1467
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,380
your own gender swapped version of yourself.

1468
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,700
Because everyone knows about it.

1469
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,980
The girl version of me is going to be as ugly as me

1470
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,540
and I have higher standards.

1471
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,380
I'm a golden god.

1472
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,300
I'm a fucking beautiful hero, man.

1473
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,140
Don't push your beliefs onto me.

1474
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,060
I don't want to fuck me.

1475
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,900
I'm hideous.

1476
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,740
You know what, that's fair.

1477
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,860
I think I wear a monkey mask in these fucking videos, dude.

1478
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,700
Yeah, all right.

1479
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,540
Okay.

1480
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,380
I don't want to fuck that.

1481
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,340
I've had the thought because everyone has the idea.

1482
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,500
Like what would it be like if you met

1483
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,220
a female version of yourself?

1484
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,060
Yeah.

1485
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,420
And I'm just, all I think about is like the conversations

1486
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,620
we would have or how awkwardly it would begin

1487
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,460
or whether we would even want to hang around each other.

1488
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:22,220
And then it doesn't really ever go further than that.

1489
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,540
I don't know why it's so different for you

1490
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,260
and for me.

1491
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,140
Well, it's like a pair of twins

1492
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,940
where one's a boy and one's a girl.

1493
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,860
Like do they wanna fuck each other?

1494
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,900
Is that masturbation?

1495
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,740
Absolutely.

1496
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,900
I do enjoy like,

1497
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,780
I do kind of enjoy like the idea of me as a girl

1498
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,500
just for the cute aspect.

1499
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Like seeing like drawings of me just gender bent,

1500
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,580
just doing normal things.

1501
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,940
Like just being a pretty girl.

1502
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,700
Like yeah, that'll be nice.

1503
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,540
That's cool.

1504
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:54,220
I like that idea, the idea that I'm the other gender

1505
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,300
and I just look better because, you know.

1506
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,140
Yeah.

1507
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,940
And of course when I play Pokemon,

1508
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,100
I always play as the girl.

1509
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,460
I'd rather be a girl,

1510
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,220
but that doesn't mean I wanna fuck me.

1511
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,700
And of course there's like a bit of a fantasy element to it.

1512
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,460
Like, you know, you can like in your head

1513
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,180
make your female version look like basically

1514
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,020
whatever you want.

1515
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,380
So like, yeah, of course that's real.

1516
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,740
But like when I kind of think of this female version of me,

1517
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,940
she's also an anime character.

1518
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,260
So, you know, like that's, that's.

1519
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,980
It's also my little pony.

1520
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,820
Of course.

1521
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,660
Yeah, anime.

1522
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,500
I already covered that.

1523
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,140
D'Voo, have you finished your big story yet?

1524
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,140
Big story?

1525
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,620
He's got the rolls points I think, right?

1526
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,740
You said that he had like a whole thing planned out.

1527
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,940
Oh, I've just been like taking down notes occasionally here

1528
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,780
and there.

1529
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,060
I have another one, which is like,

1530
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,180
Hippo talked about like other emotions that get attached.

1531
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,140
Because we are an hour in just to let you guys know.

1532
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:42,980
That's true.

1533
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,820
I'm looking at the waveform.

1534
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,660
I'm paranoid about audio glitches.

1535
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,540
So like Hippo was talking about how like things can be scary.

1536
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,020
And I believe he was alluding to the idea

1537
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,620
that it sort of enhances the emotions.

1538
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,420
Like, gets your blood rolling a little bit faster.

1539
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,380
And that can like, that can like, you know,

1540
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,660
enhance the groin area action if you know what I mean.

1541
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,460
It's like some subdom should, right?

1542
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,300
Right.

1543
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,700
And like, there are lots of things

1544
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,620
that I'm just fascinated with in general,

1545
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,020
that then also become fetishes.

1546
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,580
They were like, hold on.

1547
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,420
Wait a second.

1548
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,820
Oh, anyway, there are things that I can.

1549
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,140
Wait, what?

1550
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,660
There are things that I can stick out?

1551
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,500
Of course.

1552
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,860
Sorry, there's just people walking around.

1553
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,300
I haven't been, I haven't had like much of my own room

1554
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,900
in the last handful of months.

1555
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,180
Anyway, there are things I was fascinated with

1556
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,460
for a long time, even like as a child.

1557
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,140
And my body did whatever it could manage

1558
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,660
to do to turn me on in some way.

1559
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,700
It didn't have the resources yet, right?

1560
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,700
There's just general fascinations, right?

1561
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,660
Gender bending is definitely one of them.

1562
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,940
The exploration of the other sex back and forth

1563
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,700
is a very interesting concept for me.

1564
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,980
So much, I'm just really so obsessed with that concept

1565
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,300
that it pisses me off when it shows up

1566
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,620
in a piece of media because it's always done

1567
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,180
as a joke or for quick fan service

1568
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,020
or for like some sort of sitcom-y thing,

1569
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,540
although Ranma One Half,

1570
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,100
and never really explored as a real theme,

1571
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,500
as a real narrative, right?

1572
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,300
And I love it when it's really talked about,

1573
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,420
when it's really like explored

1574
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,620
like in an interesting, intimate way,

1575
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,060
but it's almost never done that.

1576
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,540
And it always teases me so, it pisses me off so bad,

1577
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,260
both for my dick and for my heart,

1578
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,300
because I find it a fascinating concept.

1579
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,500
And so I feel like I'd never be able to like

1580
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,420
watch Ranma One Half.

1581
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,860
I'm even really hesitant about watching Your Name

1582
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,100
because I know it's gonna have that thing.

1583
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,500
And I know they're not gonna really explore that in depth.

1584
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,660
They're just gonna have some scenes that tease me

1585
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,300
and I'll just be left frustrated, right?

1586
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,420
But what I wanna do, and I have done sometimes,

1587
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,380
is there are some, there's some ecchi fricking mongas

1588
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,540
out there that really explore it.

1589
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,820
There's one where this guy gets into the body

1590
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,020
of like a seven-year-old girl.

1591
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,020
And like, it's great.

1592
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,340
For the first, it's called Ichinense Nina Chaturla.

1593
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,500
And it's like almost every page is in service

1594
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,420
of either your dick or like feeling the concept

1595
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,540
of what it would be to suddenly be

1596
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,740
in this different body, right?

1597
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,300
And so what does he do as the seven-year-old girl?

1598
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,900
Oh, he'll go to school, but still secretly study

1599
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,580
for his exams in high school,

1600
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,540
because that's what he has to do.

1601
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,380
Hang on.

1602
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,540
How's that sexual?

1603
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,100
Yes, I think I may have seen that,

1604
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,700
or seen something very similar.

1605
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,780
I think I told you about it, yeah.

1606
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,500
No, but it was like this idea

1607
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,100
that this guy got transformed into the body

1608
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:21,060
of a little girl or a little boy, I forget.

1609
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:26,060
But it was like, he thought it was great

1610
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,740
because like, oh, I'm younger now,

1611
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,660
and I have all this future knowledge.

1612
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,380
But then slowly, his like future knowledge

1613
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,860
started to go away as you realize

1614
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,700
that he had a child's brain.

1615
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,940
You're gonna have to find that and link that to me.

1616
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,780
Because then he was like,

1617
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,020
oh, I don't know how to count anymore.

1618
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,700
What's going on?

1619
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,620
Oh my God, I had to read that one.

1620
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,820
I don't even know what it was.

1621
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,900
It may have been like, it was years ago

1622
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,980
that I think I've seen that.

1623
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,380
Yeah, that's definitely not the one I'm referring to.

1624
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,420
Now, I was gonna talk about age regression.

1625
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,620
That's just my outright favorite concept in anything.

1626
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,380
Mental thought, hypotheticals, science fiction,

1627
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,580
fetishes, anything.

1628
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,580
That's my favorite thing ever.

1629
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,340
The series movie 10 has a bunch of age regression

1630
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,740
of all the characters,

1631
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,740
but especially Nami becomes a little baby girl

1632
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,540
and Robin goes from like 30 to like 27 or something.

1633
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,020
It looks, no, she goes like 16.

1634
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,020
She goes exactly the same, but it's amazing.

1635
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,860
14.

1636
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,700
See, the same problem.

1637
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,660
It would just piss me off

1638
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,300
because it wouldn't go deep enough.

1639
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,700
What about Benjamin Button?

1640
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,700
There's a whole movie about that.

1641
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,820
I actually didn't finish that movie.

1642
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,060
I mean, it's a dude, I'm not like, you know.

1643
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,740
Yeah, I didn't finish.

1644
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,580
Yeah, I love it.

1645
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,220
But anyway, yeah, like so the manga I mentioned before,

1646
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,540
Ichi Nensei Nina Chattara.

1647
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,820
It's like probably the most complicated Japanese title

1648
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,860
I can enunciate.

1649
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,580
I know Nichi Nensei means first year.

1650
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,620
That's what I know, folks.

1651
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,460
There you go.

1652
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,220
Right, so he, like in the second,

1653
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,660
the book always refers to him as he,

1654
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,460
just because he never accepts it, right?

1655
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,940
He eventually gets cured at the very end.

1656
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,780
But like-

1657
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,660
Because as we all know, gender is what you identify as

1658
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,660
as opposed to your biology.

1659
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,500
This is what it all just did.

1660
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Right, so chapter two, he like wakes up and like-

1661
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,340
Nate, shut up.

1662
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,860
And like starts walking around the room

1663
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,700
and like immediately, like it has all this dissonance

1664
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:09,020
with how many steps it takes to get from place to place,

1665
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,580
how much he has to reach to grab shit.

1666
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,700
And like just, it always explores like

1667
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,300
how different things feel for him.

1668
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,380
There's a part where like, he has to like jump up

1669
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,140
on a pole to like save himself.

1670
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:19,980
And he like-

1671
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,940
Oh, he's jumping up on that pole.

1672
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,260
How can we tell you about that?

1673
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,980
Well, yeah, but what happens is that

1674
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,860
as he's holding to the pole really tightly,

1675
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,660
he's like, oh man, in my old body,

1676
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,460
this would like, I'd be feeling the pressure

1677
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,300
against my dick right now and this would be fun.

1678
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,340
But in this body, it doesn't do anything for me, right?

1679
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,180
Oh, they're going deep.

1680
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,820
There's like a multiple part chapter

1681
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,700
where he's like tries to figure out whether or not

1682
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,260
he can like, you know, masturbate

1683
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,220
in that young girl's body or not, right?

1684
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,940
So like, it's like, it's just constantly exploring

1685
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,100
like what is happening to him.

1686
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,300
And that's what I want.

1687
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,340
I actually found out about it, I think from D

1688
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,900
because someone posted a comment saying,

1689
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,980
I really, what I really want out of age regression

1690
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:59,980
and like transgender stories is not so much just going ham

1691
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,140
on the fan service as much as explore

1692
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,380
what happens to their life.

1693
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,900
Like show them hanging out, right?

1694
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,420
I remember some people talking about they like it

1695
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,060
when like a guy gets turned into a woman

1696
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,740
and it just stays like that for years and has kids, right?

1697
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,980
That's what I really want to see.

1698
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,580
I want to see like Bruce Jenner.

1699
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,580
Yeah, exactly.

1700
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:20,100
So that's, and then for me, it's like, I don't know

1701
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,620
that exploration of being in a different body

1702
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,980
of having that like age taken away from you

1703
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,860
is a very fascinating concept

1704
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,500
that is definitely my least favorite thing about reality

1705
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,740
is it doesn't have that or gender-bending remotes.

1706
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,820
I know for months, I mean, I know for months

1707
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,740
like gender bender and age regression remote

1708
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,940
should be a real thing was a suggested title topic for PCP.

1709
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,660
That's true.

1710
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,700
Next week.

1711
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,140
No, we already did that.

1712
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,220
There's not really much to say about it at this point.

1713
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,380
We did gender swapping, right?

1714
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,020
Yeah, so like the fact that I'm so into it as a concept

1715
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,580
gives it so much allure,

1716
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,500
even if somewhere were to just cut off my dick.

1717
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,860
And like the fact then that it also feeds into it, right?

1718
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,500
And it creates this feedback loop

1719
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,140
of still having a burning passion for it

1720
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,380
even after I'm done.

1721
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,820
I'm still thinking about it being like, yeah.

1722
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:09,780
You know what I mean?

1723
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,060
Oh, I know what you mean.

1724
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,740
Well, all right, there you go.

1725
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,300
All right, let's, anybody got some final points to make

1726
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,380
on this before we go to questions?

1727
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,300
I think it's about that time.

1728
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,700
Well, I could talk a little bit more

1729
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,460
about the whole like giant woman thing

1730
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,380
because I didn't really say anything about that.

1731
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,460
Okay, let's do it.

1732
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,500
Well, I think I like the idea of like girls

1733
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,380
that are taller than me, which is usually,

1734
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,580
it's the other way around, like the short girl

1735
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,900
is the cute one and you got to be a tall man,

1736
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:39,940
but I'm not tall.

1737
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:42,580
And I've always annoyed that the fact that I'm not tall

1738
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,940
because it seems like tall guys get everything.

1739
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:46,780
So it was like-

1740
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,900
Don't worry, manlight uprising is coming.

1741
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,740
Don't worry.

1742
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,500
Yeah, yeah, at some point I just-

1743
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,940
You can finish what Allie gets started.

1744
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,780
That's right.

1745
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:58,780
Like the idea that a woman could be like bigger than me

1746
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,060
and like, you know, put our arms around me

1747
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,900
and then cradle me like an idiot,

1748
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,020
like a stupid, small little man.

1749
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,380
Sure. I don't know.

1750
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,420
Do you masturbate to the P-E-T-A sculpture?

1751
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,500
The what?

1752
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,060
The P-E-T-A where it's the Virgin Mary

1753
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,380
and she's like nine feet tall,

1754
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,140
cradling a little tiny Jesus.

1755
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,940
Oh.

1756
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,580
Someone should draw that picture

1757
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,940
and replace Jesus with a gift.

1758
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,180
You have to do it.

1759
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,020
Someone, please.

1760
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,700
Please give me hippo in the P-E-T-A.

1761
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,260
I guess I didn't really have much to say about it.

1762
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,180
I like giant stuff.

1763
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,140
I like big things.

1764
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,980
It's good.

1765
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,860
Big things from a small packages, Gib.

1766
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,980
Yeah, that's why my last girlfriend broke up with me.

1767
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,580
She liked big things too.

1768
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,060
The big things coming small packages argument

1769
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,500
wasn't really enough for her when I, you know-

1770
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,700
She wasn't buying it.

1771
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,060
She didn't give a fuck about the motion of the ocean.

1772
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,660
She wanted the wave.

1773
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,460
It's sad, but true, folks.

1774
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,660
Let's all kill ourselves.

1775
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,100
Okay, let me just finish.

1776
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,300
I just want to make one final point

1777
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,780
just to sum up what I was saying before.

1778
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,500
Remember, folks, it's totally normal

1779
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,260
to be in all kinds of weird fucked up shit.

1780
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:10,020
A lot of it just stems from the experiences

1781
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,420
you have in your life, you know?

1782
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,260
Yeah.

1783
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,980
I'm sure that's an explanation for most of the reason

1784
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,100
why I'm into the stuff that I'm into sexually.

1785
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,620
Not that I'm that weird or anything,

1786
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,140
but yeah, just, I don't know, don't shame anybody.

1787
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,620
This is all totally normal, you know?

1788
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,460
I think it's pretty normal.

1789
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,100
Don't shame anybody, but if they rape a retarded person,

1790
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,260
do arrest them.

1791
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,220
I agree.

1792
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,660
Yeah, I do endorse that, by the way.

1793
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,220
I'm not, I'm saying that should be arrested,

1794
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,220
that that wouldn't be allowed, that should be allowed.

1795
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,100
As Davoo slyly slides away his proposition

1796
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,260
to make rape illegal,

1797
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,540
just slide that under my desk here.

1798
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:44,020
All right, well that's it.

1799
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:46,140
That would be the great PCP civil war

1800
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,820
is that Davoo wants to make rape legal

1801
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,820
and Munchy wants to make sex outline.

1802
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,660
Yeah!

1803
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,500
He'll have to go to war.

1804
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,340
That's a great idea.

1805
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,180
It'll just be like in the near future

1806
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:54,940
where probably smoking will be banned

1807
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,260
and weed will be legal everywhere.

1808
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,540
Everything just gets flip-flopped,

1809
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,380
you know what I mean?

1810
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,220
See, if there is a war, I can't be on Munchy's side

1811
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,100
because people always confuse us for each other

1812
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,540
and I'll probably get assassinated

1813
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:05,580
when they're trying to get him.

1814
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,180
That's true, that's true.

1815
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,380
Wouldn't it be even worse if,

1816
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:09,940
even if you were on the opposite side,

1817
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,060
they still assassinate you by mistake?

1818
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:12,900
Now that would be bad.

1819
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,740
Somebody on my team.

1820
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:14,580
Exactly.

1821
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,420
That would be real, you see.

1822
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:18,460
So actually a war of people who like sex

1823
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,660
and people who don't like sex

1824
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,220
would instantly, well, not instantly,

1825
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,980
but eventually the people who like sex would win

1826
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,300
because they would make more soldiers.

1827
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,140
Exactly.

1828
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,980
But then again, maybe it's a good point.

1829
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,900
Maybe our heroic virgins, like Isaac Newton types,

1830
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,820
like they would all get together in advanced science

1831
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:33,940
by like a thousand years

1832
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,820
because they're not distracted

1833
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,780
by disgusting sex havers anymore.

1834
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,780
Maybe that would happen, you know?

1835
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,900
Those heroic virgins, like Elliot Raj

1836
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,140
or the Columbine kids.

1837
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,460
Yeah, exactly.

1838
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,780
The Columbine kids are heroes.

1839
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,860
Elliot Raj would have been a fine warrior

1840
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,460
if he had a cause to wave his, you know,

1841
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,660
to a banner to wave, you know.

1842
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,100
If he had a real card to batter people with.

1843
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,940
He had some issues to sort out

1844
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,140
beyond just his main thing.

1845
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,860
He was pretty good at World of Warcraft.

1846
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,260
Hey, no argument there.

1847
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,540
And who, what makes a man beyond his Warcraft account,

1848
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,940
really, not much.

1849
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,980
All right, let's go to our questions here, everybody.

1850
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:13,220
Remember, hashtag askPCP, we do it every Saturday.

1851
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,100
There you go.

1852
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,620
Hey, can I come out with like a little bit of an announcement,

1853
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,060
like to talk about some shit that's happening?

1854
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,780
I was just checking my Twitter.

1855
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,220
So, okay, here's some YouTube titles for you.

1856
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,540
The big change in the anime industry

1857
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,700
that has people, I can't read the rest.

1858
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,660
Her potential is insane.

1859
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,060
He saved this one, dot, dot, dot.

1860
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:31,900
Oh no.

1861
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,260
You, five exclamation marks.

1862
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,100
Digi has gotten into some Twitter beef

1863
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,580
with some guy who doesn't like his thoughts

1864
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,020
about this shit, about the whole anime streaming thing.

1865
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,020
He's doing it publicly,

1866
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,980
so I'm not breaking any boundaries here.

1867
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,780
Now, I'm not gonna make any comment myself.

1868
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,740
I haven't watched this guy.

1869
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,780
His name is Forneverworld,

1870
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,940
or as I like to call him, Forlorn Hope

1871
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,940
that he'll ever get laid in his life.

1872
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,740
He said, I'm not a bad YouTuber.

1873
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,500
He said, I'm a bad YouTuber,

1874
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,780
responding to Digi calling him a bad YouTuber.

1875
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:02,020
He says, when you don't have to rely on clips and images

1876
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:05,100
to get audience retention, come back to me.

1877
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,900
Wait, wait, what?

1878
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,940
I think he's referring to how Digi's videos,

1879
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,060
like with Unate, like the podcasts,

1880
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,180
get less views.

1881
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,420
Listen, it's not because they don't have images.

1882
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,540
I mean, that's part of it.

1883
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,340
The fact that you don't rely on images

1884
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,900
to get views of Forlorn Hope that you'll ever get laid

1885
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,260
is that all of your videos have clickbait titles

1886
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,980
and his do not as often.

1887
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,660
So anyway, that's all I have to say about that.

1888
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:29,940
I don't give a fuck about this beef

1889
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,060
between Digi and this other guy,

1890
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,380
but like, is he making a,

1891
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,540
I don't understand the point.

1892
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,420
Is he saying that it is bad to add clips

1893
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,580
and images to your videos?

1894
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,060
I don't understand. I think he was saying

1895
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:44,700
that the only reason people watch your videos

1896
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,660
is because you put clips in them.

1897
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,700
Yeah, but you're one of those mainstream guys

1898
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,620
who dole the senses of your audience

1899
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:55,260
with a bunch of fancy clip keys dangling before their forehead.

1900
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,700
That's why I don't understand the point

1901
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,500
of what you said about like,

1902
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,700
he's like, but that isn't an insult to the videos

1903
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,540
of that's just a still image from one anime

1904
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,380
that we just leave up and don't animate

1905
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,980
because we're not editing anything.

1906
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,540
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

1907
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,900
It looks like all of his videos are just vlogs

1908
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,180
with his big face in the camera, so.

1909
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,980
Okay, well, this is a huge waste of time.

1910
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,220
It's funny that I'm jumping into like,

1911
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,900
putting my, like sticking my dick in this horrendous nest

1912
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,820
on the podcast that is literally loaded

1913
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,340
with the most material against me

1914
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,340
that could possibly be posted.

1915
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,380
Hey, fucking whatever.

1916
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,860
Well, to be fair, you posted a picture

1917
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,700
in this for never world guy.

1918
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:36,940
His own chosen profile picture looks like a retarded person.

1919
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,820
So I wouldn't feel too bad about what he has to say.

1920
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:40,660
Yeah.

1921
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,020
I don't give a shit about any of this.

1922
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:43,860
Let's get to the question.

1923
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,780
I just had to get that off my tongue.

1924
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:46,860
Okay, here we go.

1925
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,180
Okay, here's one.

1926
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,180
At Aaron underscore fell asks,

1927
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,820
why did you all pick your respective names?

1928
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,860
Apart from Nate, we all know why.

1929
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:57,780
I'm the best guy ever.

1930
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,700
What can I say?

1931
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,620
Shut the fuck up.

1932
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,780
That's a good question.

1933
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,660
Hippocrite was just a-

1934
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,820
I've been trying to figure out the meaning behind that.

1935
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:10,180
I can't tell what hippocrite means.

1936
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,020
Please explain to me.

1937
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,860
What do you mean to me?

1938
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,820
It means that puns are awesome.

1939
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,780
It means it's, I thought like critical hit

1940
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,020
and also gaming critic.

1941
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,780
Like critical hits are in games, gaming critic, crit

1942
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,660
and hippocrite as in like it's an animal.

1943
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,860
And I just thought of that one day out of nowhere

1944
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,380
and I thought I gotta have that if that's gonna be,

1945
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,700
I gotta keep that name.

1946
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,980
So I made a YouTube channel.

1947
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:35,820
Yeah.

1948
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,980
So that I could, you know, keep it.

1949
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:38,820
And then that's it.

1950
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:39,740
Good boy.

1951
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:40,580
I was protecting.

1952
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,060
I thought it was because you always logically

1953
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,260
contradicted yourself and we're acknowledging

1954
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,260
that you were a hypocrite,

1955
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,540
but also you are very bad at spelling.

1956
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,860
Cause you're English.

1957
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,700
Yes.

1958
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,540
Yeah.

1959
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:53,140
I'm surprised there's not like a you in there or something.

1960
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,780
At the beginning, my thing was also

1961
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,780
on top of all those other parts of the pun,

1962
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:03,620
hippocrite as in I will say things hypocritically

1963
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,300
so that in case I actually do be a hypocrite,

1964
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,100
I could say, look, well, look at my name.

1965
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:08,940
What are you gonna do?

1966
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,340
Nigga, what is the channel called?

1967
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,700
What are you fucking talking about?

1968
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,220
You've got cover for life.

1969
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,860
I haven't really utilized that at all

1970
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,860
because the only way I'm a hypocrite

1971
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:24,140
is that my name is hypocrite, but I'm not hypocritical.

1972
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:24,980
That's true.

1973
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:25,980
That's how I use it.

1974
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,820
Oh, that makes sense.

1975
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,660
Monkey, how'd you come up with this?

1976
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,500
The appeal of Hippo's channel for me is that

1977
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,740
he is so authentic and genuine with his love

1978
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,580
for like the games he played when he was younger.

1979
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,020
So I wouldn't like it if he started saying

1980
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,220
hypocritical things like for a meme,

1981
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,140
I had to take away from some of the magic.

1982
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,940
I'm glad you haven't done that.

1983
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:47,820
My name is, it was not chosen as a username.

1984
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,300
It was a name thrust upon me in high school

1985
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,100
by my so-called friends because they noticed

1986
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,140
that I resemble both a human and a monkey.

1987
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:59,860
So they went ahead and threw those words together

1988
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:02,580
and it stuck and I embraced it and now that's me.

1989
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:05,060
Oh, I didn't know that that came from friends or something.

1990
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:05,900
That's pretty cool.

1991
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,540
Yeah, I could see where they got that idea

1992
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,220
from the way you look in videos.

1993
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,260
You do kinda look like a monkey.

1994
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,180
Yep, I'm very happy with it.

1995
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,380
And it helps that I'm five foot seven

1996
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,940
because I'm about the height of a monkey too.

1997
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:20,780
Okay, DeVoo.

1998
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,860
That's tall in me.

1999
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,260
My username means that...

2000
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,100
Well, yeah, but you're a gibbit.

2001
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:24,940
You're smaller than a monkey.

2002
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:25,780
That's true.

2003
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:26,620
When I got on the internet,

2004
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,020
I didn't really feel like having a username.

2005
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,580
My first name was just my name, but condensed a bit.

2006
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,820
But then my dad was like,

2007
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,300
it just looks too much like your name.

2008
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,980
It looks kind of dangerously Google-able.

2009
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:37,820
I'm like, okay.

2010
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,780
It's very interesting that your dad was giving you critiques

2011
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,140
on your user names for your online activities.

2012
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:45,980
I mean, it was like my name and then my last initials.

2013
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,820
And he was like,

2014
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,220
I don't know, that seems a little dangerously Google-able.

2015
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,300
I'm like, you're right.

2016
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:52,180
And I just had this, I don't know what day, what moment,

2017
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,980
what fever dream, just the whole idea of taking my name,

2018
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,820
which is David,

2019
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,660
just changing the last syllable to an ooo came from.

2020
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,860
And I just came up with it when I was 13

2021
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,940
and never changed it.

2022
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:03,780
Pretty fortunate,

2023
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,180
because it seems to age pretty well.

2024
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,540
Like the further I go on in my life,

2025
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,180
it just seems to take on new meanings.

2026
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,980
Like people, my PCP friends,

2027
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,460
you guys tend to describe it as like sounding all mysterious,

2028
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,980
like I'm some sort of abstract mythological beast.

2029
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,060
Yeah.

2030
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:19,700
Or like it rhymes with the dupu, which is a getup.

2031
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,180
And that too.

2032
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,700
I always thought of it as soon as I saw it,

2033
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,580
I thought davoodoo, like he's a witch dog.

2034
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,140
Oh, shit.

2035
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,180
It reminds me a little bit of my friend John

2036
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,300
that I reference sometimes on here.

2037
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,740
He actually, he calls himself-

2038
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:33,580
John Tron.

2039
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,420
John Tron, that's right.

2040
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,540
Yeah, he's a different John.

2041
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,980
He calls himself John-os sometimes.

2042
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,940
It's not his name.

2043
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:39,780
He just came up with it

2044
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,980
and introduces himself as John-os sometimes.

2045
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:42,820
Nice.

2046
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,660
No idea why.

2047
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,180
Yeah, no, the part of my name that didn't age too well

2048
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:48,300
is I was calling myself like the great davood,

2049
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,980
because that's like internet,

2050
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,180
making yourself all grandiose.

2051
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,500
Usually because davood is usually taken from most websites,

2052
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,780
cause I think it's like a Spanish word name or something.

2053
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:01,060
So it's actually not, up until a couple of years ago,

2054
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:04,140
my name was like very, very bad for Google.

2055
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,180
Like, cause there'd just be like some,

2056
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,140
I think it was some rapper called davooda producer

2057
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:07,980
or whatever.

2058
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,100
So it's not great for Googling.

2059
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,580
But usually the davood is never taken.

2060
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,180
So it's a perfect middle ground.

2061
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:15,980
That's why the duff stuck around.

2062
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,580
How great is it to finally beat Google

2063
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:20,740
and overcome that like search result thing

2064
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,460
when like, I remember for like a year

2065
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:23,700
after starting Best Guy Ever,

2066
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,700
like when I searched it,

2067
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,700
all this other shit comes up that I didn't give a fuck about.

2068
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,180
But now finally, I have conquered Google

2069
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,340
and now my shit comes up.

2070
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:31,340
But I've been noticing,

2071
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,380
hypocrite does not come up initially

2072
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,940
when you search hypocrite and it pisses me off.

2073
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,500
It's all people misspelling it.

2074
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,340
Yeah.

2075
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,180
Or it auto-corrects to normal hypocrite.

2076
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,980
It's one of the biggest tragedies.

2077
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,020
I didn't even think about that.

2078
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,260
It will be fixed in time.

2079
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,700
You just have to grow more and that just works itself out.

2080
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:47,540
You just have to grow more,

2081
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,340
but just like all that art you look at it.

2082
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,180
Exactly.

2083
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,140
So I can jack off to it.

2084
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,060
I was about to say though,

2085
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,900
that the poddy curse actually came up

2086
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,100
when I typed it in.

2087
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,220
I was having that same problem.

2088
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:58,460
That's great.

2089
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:00,460
Do you have to put like the period after the D and shit?

2090
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:01,540
No, I didn't.

2091
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,380
Whoa.

2092
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,220
Just put a space.

2093
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:04,620
Well, fuck, I gotta try that out.

2094
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,460
Uh, okay.

2095
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,060
In my house, all the period comes before the D.

2096
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,220
Okay, here we go.

2097
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,860
At papa mutt dog asks,

2098
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,340
is the vape pen Mike?

2099
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,900
Shout out, you ruined my flow.

2100
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:22,060
Is the vape pen mightier than the sword?

2101
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,580
There's a vape sword?

2102
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:26,540
Is the vape pen mightier than the sword?

2103
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,020
Could you imagine, could you imagine a vape sword?

2104
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,140
Like it's actually the size of a sword

2105
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,820
and you blow or you suck on one side

2106
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:37,180
and it comes out of the tip of the sword right at the end.

2107
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,980
I imagine it's like just take this potion sword

2108
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,620
and just go and hit people with it.

2109
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:44,300
Saying vape sword reminds me of invisible air,

2110
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,860
which is the name of saber sword from Fate, Stay Night,

2111
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:49,220
which is actually just, it's actually just Excalibur,

2112
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:50,700
but they pretend that it's invisible air.

2113
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,260
I would like Ben to have a vape sword.

2114
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,100
Me too.

2115
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:54,940
It would be very, it would be very cool.

2116
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,260
That would be his fucking,

2117
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,100
that would be a striped sword.

2118
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,780
I would like Ben to not be alive.

2119
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:01,420
No, wait, a vape katana, there we go.

2120
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,260
That would, that would,

2121
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:03,380
Ben is practiced.

2122
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,340
When he's been striped as a specimen,

2123
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,420
it would be vape, it happens, right?

2124
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,140
Well, Ben is practiced in the art of Kendo

2125
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,700
and has maxed out his Bushido stat,

2126
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,260
so he's ready for that vape katana.

2127
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,780
Okay, here's the greatest comment.

2128
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,940
This isn't a question, it's just a comment,

2129
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:20,980
but at Jam Shmain, it's spelled kind of funny,

2130
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,100
says, thanks for fat shaming me

2131
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,540
into losing 10 pounds, hashtag fit boy.

2132
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,500
Oh, shit.

2133
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,380
Hell, yes, ya main man, Manny,

2134
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,220
is his, like, his main thing.

2135
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,580
Oh, well, that guy, I know him.

2136
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,420
You, you're welcome, dude,

2137
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:34,780
and I will continue on this quest

2138
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,740
to fat shame everyone into getting their shit together,

2139
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:42,420
cause there's no excuse to not, you know, be a fit person.

2140
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,900
Excellent, thank God for you, you're a hero.

2141
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,740
Oh, here we go, at Swagdude.

2142
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,980
I don't know if you want to answer this, Davoo,

2143
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:52,060
but he's asking, how's Davoo's video game going?

2144
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,900
Oh, very, very slowly, I just keep, you know,

2145
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,420
I'll spend just weeks at a time,

2146
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:59,100
just editing videos and then watching anime.

2147
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,260
It's definitely, like, I don't know

2148
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,860
exactly what speed it's gonna take,

2149
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:04,780
but I'm having a huge fun time with it.

2150
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:07,860
I am learning the incredible power of, like,

2151
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:09,420
and when you're a teenager, you have unlimited time,

2152
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,020
but no purpose in life, so you're depressed,

2153
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:13,300
you're too depressed to make anything and all that good.

2154
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,420
Well, at least that's how I was.

2155
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,140
As an adult, I have that sense of mission,

2156
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,900
but the sense of mission and the needing to make money

2157
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,140
can also sort of trap you,

2158
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,620
it can keep you trapped in this need for money.

2159
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,860
So, basically, I've made enough money to,

2160
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:26,540
well, I have not really a decent amount of money,

2161
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,820
but I have my own career now and I have all my spare time,

2162
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:31,820
and so I've bought myself that teenage sort of lifestyle

2163
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,700
to work on something because I want to make it

2164
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,220
and it doesn't have to make its money back.

2165
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,180
I think it might, because, I mean, I don't know,

2166
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:40,940
probably only, like, 108 people are gonna buy it,

2167
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,700
that's basically what I'm prepared for,

2168
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,060
but it's so great to just have all this time

2169
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,740
to make something that I want to make,

2170
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:49,700
but yeah, it's going around very, very, very slowly.

2171
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:52,540
Don't expect it out by the end of the decade.

2172
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,620
The decade? Looking forward to it.

2173
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,900
Hey, that's only three years, you know, it's not that bad.

2174
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,540
Oh, I thought he meant, like, the next 10 years,

2175
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:58,380
I was like, well, four.

2176
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,500
Well, this decade's almost over,

2177
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,620
so it probably won't be this day.

2178
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,500
D'Vu, I want to be alive to play the game,

2179
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,420
so please don't take 10 years, I'll be dead.

2180
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,900
Yeah, definitely not taking that long, yeah.

2181
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,900
Okay, here we go, Hindu, Hindu God of Homoes, as-

2182
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:10,900
Oh, yeah!

2183
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,740
Yeah, good, yeah.

2184
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,380
Our boat's good, what is the best boat?

2185
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,820
No, I love boats.

2186
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:21,660
Boats, the best kind of boat is a boat that can fly.

2187
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:24,100
And her name is Going Mary.

2188
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,660
Going Mary is the best boat.

2189
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:29,460
No, no, really, like, the idea of a pirate galleon

2190
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:32,020
that has either magically or scientifically

2191
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,300
the ability to fly through the air

2192
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,860
is my favorite thing of all time.

2193
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:36,980
Hey, you know what you would like then?

2194
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,700
Final Fantasy, specifically Final Fantasy IX,

2195
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,060
because it's full of those.

2196
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,620
Well, there we go.

2197
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,460
It's aesthetic as fuck.

2198
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,460
You'd also like the music video Boats and Hose.

2199
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,460
You gotta have me, my Boats and Hose,

2200
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,300
I think is how it goes.

2201
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,300
That's pretty good, that's pretty good.

2202
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,140
Yeah.

2203
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,020
Okay, okay, here's one.

2204
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,700
At the Wolf Heart, hey, what's up, dude?

2205
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,980
This guy's a good artist, man.

2206
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,540
Between single and multiplayer,

2207
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,100
do you think one is superior,

2208
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:01,940
and does the lack of the other-

2209
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:02,780
Single player is superior.

2210
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,540
affect your interest in a game?

2211
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,660
Single player will make me want to play.

2212
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,060
Very singularly focused on single player games

2213
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,260
for the most part, yes.

2214
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,140
Yeah, multiplayer, as long as it's,

2215
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,700
if it's turn-based multiplayer, like a card game,

2216
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,500
it's okay, but generally,

2217
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,340
the idea of playing online with people,

2218
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:24,060
the internet fucks me over more often than I would like,

2219
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,020
and it just annoys me.

2220
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,020
I have an idea.

2221
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,420
I'm back to having not viable internet,

2222
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:29,940
so it doesn't even matter anyway.

2223
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:30,860
You know what's funny about this?

2224
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,020
I almost exclusively play single player games,

2225
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:34,940
but I just so happened,

2226
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,420
I got Splatoon 2 recently from my Switch,

2227
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:40,980
which I have been playing more than any other video game,

2228
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,420
which is to say, I'll play one or two games a day,

2229
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,740
which is 15 minutes, but I'll still do it,

2230
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,580
and it's fun, and I'm certainly playing

2231
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,020
in more than any other game right now.

2232
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,580
Of course, I did just beat Hollow Knight,

2233
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:53,660
and that took 40 hours split out

2234
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:56,020
over many weeks of playing, so.

2235
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:57,420
I guess I should clarify,

2236
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,860
competitive multiplayer games, I hate.

2237
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,980
Playing on a Minecraft server with people, that's fun.

2238
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,620
That is super fun, that is super fun.

2239
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,060
I used to play League of Legends a lot,

2240
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,340
but I just cut the time out because it's not fun,

2241
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,580
and it sucks.

2242
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:11,060
Didn't everybody say Splatoon 2 sucks?

2243
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,460
Splatoon 2 is fun as fuck.

2244
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,620
I mean, I bought it because-

2245
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:14,860
Splatoon 2 splats.

2246
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,860
The biggest complaint was that it's too much

2247
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,300
like Splatoon 1, and it certainly is,

2248
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,860
but the thing is, I never owned Splatoon 1,

2249
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,500
so I just wanted to play this game all the time,

2250
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,020
and I don't have a Wii U, so I needed to get Switch,

2251
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:29,260
and I already had a Switch, so I bought Splatoon 2,

2252
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,780
and it's exactly what I wanted,

2253
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:33,180
and it delivered, and it's fucking great for me,

2254
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:34,860
maybe not for everybody.

2255
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:36,820
The only thing I know about new video games

2256
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,780
is what video game Donkey tells me,

2257
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,380
so I just assumed it sucked.

2258
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:43,420
Yeah, he was one of the guys making the criticism,

2259
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:45,340
I think, that's just like, it's not enough,

2260
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:46,820
it's just like the same game again,

2261
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,780
with some extra couple of things.

2262
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:52,020
It's like a DLC that you got conned out at 50 bucks for.

2263
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,140
For people who played Splatoon 1 and owned it,

2264
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,700
and if they were buying this to get an upgrade

2265
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,980
or get the new game, I can see why they'd be

2266
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:00,620
a little disappointed, but I-

2267
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,340
Like any Call of Duty game ever.

2268
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,180
Yes.

2269
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,300
Yeah, it's like, this is one of the only times

2270
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,140
Nintendo's gonna pull this kind of fast one on people, so.

2271
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:13,140
But like the flavor I loved, and I got to be around,

2272
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,900
fuck, it's her name, Callia Marie, it's Marie.

2273
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,980
Yeah, Marie is there, and she's cute as fuck,

2274
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:17,820
and the squids are squids.

2275
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,660
They're minerals, Marie.

2276
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,500
I don't, I don't know.

2277
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,340
Jesus Christ.

2278
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,340
I don't know what that means, explain that.

2279
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,340
That's from Breaking Bad.

2280
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,460
Oh, good, excellent.

2281
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,140
Good joke, good joke to end on, everybody.

2282
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:29,380
Hippo, you're supposed to get it, Hippo.

2283
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:31,380
I saw that movie on the show.

2284
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,860
I, you're goddamn right I got it.

2285
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:34,700
Okay, we're done.

2286
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,540
Yeah.

2287
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:36,740
Oh, it's excellent, excellent.

2288
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,540
Thank you for saving us, we're done, everybody.

2289
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:39,700
Thanks for listening.

2290
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,580
Make sure you pledge to our Patreon.

2291
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,420
Go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2292
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:47,540
Get those bonus episodes, of which there are five now.

2293
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:50,460
Last one was Kill, Luck, Kill versus Hey Arnold.

2294
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,860
Come the fuck on.

2295
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,020
The result was shocked.

2296
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,140
Is that the one that Ben released for free?

2297
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,020
That is the one that Ben released for free

2298
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:57,860
for a minute accident.

2299
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,820
So everybody, you already heard this episode,

2300
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,340
so go buy the other ones.

2301
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,860
But even if you've already heard that one,

2302
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,500
you can't get to any of the others

2303
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,860
unless you go to the Patreon and pledge five bucks.

2304
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,020
So there you go.

2305
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,140
And there it is, folks, we're all done.

2306
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,100
You ask us more questions next time

2307
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,620
using the hashtag AskPCP on Twitter.

2308
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,540
Follow us at tbcrastinators, subscribe, comment,

2309
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,340
fuck you, et cetera, et cetera.

2310
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,540
All right, we're all done.

2311
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:22,380
Thanks for listening, everybody,

2312
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:24,900
and we will see you next week with another one.

2313
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,460
Oh, and I almost forgot, this is episode 69.

2314
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,140
This is episode 69.

2315
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,300
We did it, motherfuckers.

2316
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,140
We did it.

2317
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,060
Nailed this.

2318
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,820
A convenient coincidence that we didn't bend over

2319
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,500
as backwards to ensure happened.

2320
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,180
I know it, my dude.

2321
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,740
All right, everybody say goodbye.

2322
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:40,580
Bye.

2323
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,420
Bye.

2324
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:43,780
Yeah.

2325
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:44,620
Yeah.

2326
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:45,780
Uh.

2327
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:50,780
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2328
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:56,220
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2329
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,620
But I'm not working.

2330
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:02,220
I'm doing nothing.

2331
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,700
Why did come true?
