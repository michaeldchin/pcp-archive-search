00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, hey, whoa, everybody. Welcome to the first and only Bustercast with me, Ben Saint, and my buddy in anime, Tom Oliver.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, the two most anime people in the entire Pro Crastinators Podcast. The only ones with the guts to fucking commit.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
To watch an anime for this cast.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We talked about it for months, but when the chips were down, the other guys just couldn't swing the bat.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Tom, have you? Okay, I might feel stupid, but you've seen Fooly Cooly, right?

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've seen Fooly Cooly multiple times.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay. Well, never mind. I guess we should talk about Gun Buster first. I guess we should move in chronological order.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Gun Buster is based. It's the greatest anime of all time. It's got funny memes about time dilation and what else?

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Isotonic crystals that retain mass and declining gravity or warp speed. I have parentheses, question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I took a couple of notes whenever they talked about some weird science mumbo jumbo because I thought that's cool.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The one thing that I really love about Gun Buster is how seriously it takes its hard sci-fi shit.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, absolutely. I think we should maybe frame this for everybody. We talked about doing this podcast and talking about Gun Buster and Die Buster a couple months ago.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We as a collective have referenced Gun Buster and Die Buster in the past, especially Nate because Nate talks about them in passing multiple times.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That was the first time I heard about it because you guys had all watched it. I'd never seen it before.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know if Nate showed it to me if it was someone else, but yeah. I'd seen it years ago.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
After Fooly Coolie. By the way, historically, this is the Gun Buster was Hideaki-Ano's first anime he ever directed.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No shit.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, okay. God, I hope I'm right about that. But I think it said so in Wikipedia.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Die Buster is a direct sequel to it, which happened in 2001 or something?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It was much later.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You know what? We should make sure we got, okay, Die Buster.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, Gun Buster is 1988. Die Buster is, I think it's like 2001. No, 2004.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And this is the same people. Well, a lot of the same people that went on to make Fooly Coolie, which was, no, Die Buster was after Fooly Coolie.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Really?

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, Fooly Coolie was 2003. Okay, I had it backwards.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's interesting.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's weird how much watching Die Buster feels like watching Fooly Coolie sometimes.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, there's a lot of just aesthetic and vibe similarities. Of course, the aesthetics are the same because it's fucking Gainax.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But just the way the characters are designed and the way that they move and a lot of the down time stuff in between the high octane shit tonally, there's a lot of similarities to FLCL.

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's interesting.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
A lot of the characters just resemble each other. A lot of the faces they make and the shots they use seem very similar.

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Like the scene when the space monster or the fluctuating gravitational well or whatever they call it is standing up.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Looks exactly in the mist. Looks exactly like when the hand monster in the trench coat stands up in episode five of Fooly Coolie.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Alright, getting ahead of ourselves. We should talk about Gun Buster first.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are we assuming that people have watched it already?

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I would hope so. I would say right now, if you're just walking into this being like, oh, what the fuck is Gun Buster, Die Buster?

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Go watch them first because we're probably going to spoil the fuck out of everything.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll just tell you upfront that they are the best anime ever made and you should definitely watch them and you probably want to do that before we spoil it.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is my rating for each is 10 out of 10. They are both the best.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They are very different though. They are supremely different, which is one of the things I definitely want to talk about.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Gun Buster is like old Gundam crossed with Rocky. All the training stuff in the beginning with the coach, it just is Rocky.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They just ripped off Rocky and put Rocky in it. What if Rocky was a girl and piloting a giant robot?

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Other than that, the shots of them running along the beach while the coaches on the bike and stuff.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What if Japan made Rocky? You get Gun Buster.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They straight up just ripped Rocky off. I'm 100% sure of it. I think Rocky was like four years before Gun Buster.

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The training montages of her doing training exercises in the robot, jumping jacks and running in the robot is pretty funny.

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's very funny. It's very cool.

50
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do we want to point by point through the story or just gush about the cool parts?

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The first really cool part to me is the first time when they get sent on the assignment to the space station and they go into sub light speed for the first time.

52
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
While they're in there, every minute is like six months on earth or something like that.

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Someone who just watched this a month and changed it over the first time, I was like, this is a pretty good anime. This is pretty cool.

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's kind of hitting the notes. There's some cool little visual stuff, but yeah, this is good.

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When they do that jump to high speed, they're like, oh yeah, we're actually going to take time dilation into consideration with all of this.

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That just continues to go on to frame the entirety of the rest of the story.

57
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm just like, oh, I am in for this. This is fucking sick.

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's basically what it's about later on.

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I know there's that other anime by the guy who did your name.

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You know what I'm talking about? One of his older movies is about a boy and a girl communicating across interstellar distances with time dilation.

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I haven't seen it, but presumably it's kind of the same.

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That was way after Gun Buster.

63
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They go on this mission and I didn't remember this part from the first time I see it, but when she was a kid, her dad died in space.

64
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
When they go into sublight speed, they find the ship that her dad was in.

65
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
To her, her dad died when she was a kid, so it would have been like 10 years ago.

66
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But because it's at sublight speed, the ship only two days have passed on the ship.

67
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There's a serious possibility that her dad might have just survived and been camped out here on the ship for a mere two days.

68
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What's the word?

69
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Rotational frame? His frame of reference, right?

70
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know.

71
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Later on, it happens in reverse where Noriko ends up spending time.

72
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They come back from that mission and they were gone for 10 minutes and everyone's like,

73
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
hey, congratulations, six months have passed. Pretty cool, right?

74
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then it happens more. It happens a lot more.

75
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There's this whole conflict with the space monsters and stuff, it's like funking up with humanity.

76
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But the story really does focus a lot on the consequences of space travel.

77
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Someone had the idea of, you should get that Rona check, dude.

78
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No, it's just water.

79
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is water and pasta.

80
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The whole story kind of feels like, you know, I guess, because the space mecha genre and shit,

81
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
there's a lot of glorification of space and stuff. Space is so fucking cool.

82
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wouldn't it be great to go to space?

83
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Space travel is fucked. It's really bad.

84
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Your romantic ideal of space travel is ignorant and dumb.

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is what it would really be like.

86
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Time just stops being a thing.

87
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Noriko going to space just ruins her whole life.

88
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It just ruins everything.

89
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Every relationship she ever had is torn apart by age difference.

90
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I think the first time she comes back to Earth, her classmate that she was in the same class with

91
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
has aged like 10 years while she's aged like 6 months.

92
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And then she's like a mom, she's got a kid.

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They're in totally different stages of their life now.

94
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They're all bully from school, has become the drill sergeant at the academy.

95
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And they're just in a whole different league now.

96
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
They just don't even have anything to relate to each other anymore.

97
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then, I don't know, there's more of that.

98
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But I think you get the idea. Time dilation, everyone ages while she stays young.

99
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's interesting because we kind of have an analog to that in real life, right?

100
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're close with somebody, you can go to high school with someone,

101
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and your life beats are kind of on the same path.

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And then you go to college, whatever, and your paths diverge.

103
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And life becomes so much different.

104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And this is another stage of that.

105
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Because time is a constant that we have in our lives.

106
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But they're saying with space travel, even your ages and stuff can divide up and go on different paths.

107
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And all of a sudden, you can be different ages of people you grew up with together.

108
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's such a fucking weird concept.

109
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And the fact that it's grounded in some theoretical,

110
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
this is kind of how we're assuming it works, if all the science checks out.

111
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's pretty wild that way.

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And that was really the fascinating thing that kept me invested throughout the whole thing.

113
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This could happen.

114
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is literally real science.

115
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This just is what would happen in the real world if we did this stuff.

116
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I was saying on stream last night that, dude,

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
the way how Noriko suddenly finds herself confronted with her much older former classmates

118
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
who have completely moved on with their lives.

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It feels like real life.

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
In my life, that's how I feel about my old classmates and stuff.

121
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Only I also got old.

122
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I just didn't do any of that other stuff.

123
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So it's just worse in every way.

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But still, relatable.

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, man.

126
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And then there's, let me say, I have some notes here.

127
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So at some point, they're in space and shit's going bad.

128
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The space monsters are being real, real toughies.

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And then they reveal that they've got this super robot.

130
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This real, super better robot called the gun buster.

131
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And it's just really big.

132
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And she pilots it.

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And it's a really good robot that's really good at killing space beasts.

134
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And it kind of comes out of nowhere to be honest.

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It really does.

136
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's not built up at all.

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We should point out that Noriko, the main character,

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
she's like a klutz and a fuck up and a dumb ass.

139
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And that's the whole thing.

140
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She wants to go into space.

141
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
She wants to find slash honor the memory of her father and wants to be a badass.

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But she's just inept at every stage.

143
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
She's kind of inept at every stage.

144
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The coach picks her and favors her at every turn.

145
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And it's implied that he sees talent in her, that she is innately talented.

146
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I guess I have to just assume he's correct because it ends up working out.

147
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
She ends up piling that gun buster pretty good.

148
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's too bad that we couldn't see her potential.

149
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know what I mean?

150
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He might be like, oh, no, no, I can see she's got potential.

151
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But we just have to take his word for it because it looks like she's just fucking up and not that good.

152
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's the typical anime thing where they're just like, no, the guts and the tenacity.

153
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's what really matters.

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, but I feel like it's established over and over again that Amino, her senpai, has more guts and more tenacity.

155
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And yet, even though it's implied that Coach and Amino are gonna get married later, which is funny,

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
even though it's implied that they're in a relationship like that,

157
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Coach still definitely thinks Noriko is the one who's gotta be the one to do this stuff.

158
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I guess he ends up being right.

159
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I guess he does know.

160
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The funny thing I wanted to mention about Coach, and this just shows how much of a not anime guy I am,

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
is that the voice actor, the VA for Coach, is the same guy who does Johnny in Guilty Gear.

162
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So the whole time, Johnny's just hitting on this little girl.

163
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's like, what else is fucking new, I guess.

164
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's pretty funny.

165
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Johnny's the one with the...

166
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He's friends with the anchor girl, right?

167
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, he's the guy who puts the coins.

168
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, it's the same guy.

169
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So I was just like, man, that's pretty cool.

170
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
At first I was like, oh no, Coach is like fucking his student.

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But then it's implied later, no, they didn't fuck or anything, but she wants to, and maybe they would have later.

172
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If he didn't die of space radiation syndrome, which I guess he got on the ship that the dad also died in.

173
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Space radiation is a thing that gets mentioned again in Die Buster.

174
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I really like in Gun Buster how the end of the episodes have these little science explanation pieces.

175
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Did you see those?

176
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, I think I saw some of them.

177
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It was a while since I saw Gun Buster, so...

178
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, if you wait till after the credits, they'll sometimes have these little like the two, like Almanot and Noriko, like explaining science, and then Coach shows up.

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And some of it's real science, like Lorenz transformations and like time dilation.

180
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And some of it is fake, like ice, that thing called ice seconds, which I guess is some kind of like power source.

181
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They never talk about it.

182
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They mentioned that a lot of the science was discovered by a guy called Dr. Tanhauser, who created the Tanhauser Gate, which is just a reference to Blade Runner.

183
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The guy at the end of Blade Runner references Tanhauser Gates, and I guess they were just like, we need a name for a scientist who came up with some fake technology.

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Let's just use that.

185
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Funny, I don't know.

186
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I like it.

187
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There's like...

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay, back to the moment when the Gun Buster was revealed.

189
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Basically, she gets in the Gun Buster, and all of a sudden, a space battle that was going to just like wipe out their whole fleet and kill everyone.

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
She turns the tides and beats the bad guy, and like all of a sudden like bam, like happy music.

191
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Like it's like a tragedy, and then all of a sudden it's like bam, no.

192
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No, we won.

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No, it's good though. Everything's good.

194
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Life is beautiful.

195
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I thought some of the music transitions were a little abrupt.

196
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I thought Gun Buster is definitely more amateur.

197
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't know, not amateur, but it's definitely like less advanced.

198
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't know. I feel like by the time they made Die Buster, they had like figured out how to like really pack a punch, like an emotional punch, and do a story better.

199
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Because Gun Buster is like, it has a pretty emotional ending, but it doesn't...

200
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's not on the level.

201
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's not on the level of like Fully Coolie and Die Buster, which come later.

202
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I feel like, you know, in between, like this is obviously the late 80s, and I feel like there's a lot of like kind of modern tropes and kind of just like techniques you can use to build tension and relieve tension in storytelling,

203
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
especially that anime is adopted that maybe weren't as commonplace.

204
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Because like Gun Buster doesn't implement, you know, a lot of the kind of traditional Gainex sort of techniques that are used all the time in Die Buster, you know?

205
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Because it feels like Fully Coolie.

206
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It has those like, I don't know, it's kind of like hard to kind of pinpoint and say exactly this, but like that feeling, that feeling of like rising action.

207
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like when you're like, when like a really hype moment happens, like you fucking get rock hard, you're like, alright, this is the best shit ever.

208
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, Gun Buster really, really nails that.

209
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Like a bunch of times, and it's super fucking good.

210
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Just like the Gun Buster is like really not built up or foreshadowed, like, hardly at all.

211
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I kind of feel the same way about like, the ending.

212
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Like, okay, they, there's more like time, like Amino ends up getting, like she ends up aging like another like 10 or 20 years or something while Noriko stays on the ship and she only ages like one year.

213
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So for like the, they finally get back together again for like their big last mission or whatever against the space aliens.

214
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Because the space aliens are like breeding in stars, so they have to go to like the center of the galaxy and basically like destroy the center of the galaxy, because that's their like breeding hive or whatever.

215
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They gotta, they gotta have a black hole bomb, and they make this black hole bomb that's like, bigger than the fucking earth.

216
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Or it's like, it's like planetary size.

217
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, it's massive.

218
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah.

219
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And they're just gonna fucking make a big black hole in the middle of the, of the galaxy.

220
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And there's, you know, like the plan fails, but then they're like, oh no, we gotta go in there and we gotta use our degeneracy generator and, and we can add the necessary mass to make it happen.

221
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I didn't understand, like, why did the bomb not have enough mass?

222
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Like, why wouldn't you make the bomb just have enough mass?

223
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Did something happen to the mass?

224
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Did someone reduce the mass?

225
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why isn't there, where did the mass go?

226
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What is a degeneracy generator?

227
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What, does it supply mass?

228
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I mean, I guess so.

229
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
They've, they mentioned degeneracy generators like a whole bunch of times over the-

230
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah.

231
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
They don't really, they don't really say what they are, I assume.

232
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
There are times when, like, the explanations turn into like Star Trek techno babble, and I just kind of nod my head.

233
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm like, okay, the plot says that this, we need, we need a high stakes ending, I guess.

234
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They're, um, by the-

235
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And I've only seen it once, so maybe there's something I missed.

236
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's very possible.

237
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Um, I'm gonna blow your mind right now.

238
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Alright, go for it.

239
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Um, so, like, oh wait, there's a gunbuster wiki.

240
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The degeneracy generator was the standard power source for the buster machines, and other mecha up to the technology was lost sometime between, blah, blah, and gunbuster and diabuster.

241
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, there's like nothing else to it.

242
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Boring.

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Um, alright.

244
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So, like, when the series starts, like, all the technology and science stuff seems pretty grounded, like, it's just like, you know, oh, time dilation.

245
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, fair enough.

246
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And then later on, there's like degeneracy generators, like, um, okay.

247
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then, there's like, one or two shots in the sixth episode, where you can see that, like, some of their technology is based on, like, diodes and, like, helmets that, like, connect to, like, the brains of dolphins.

248
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Like, there's one or two, like, shots in the sixth episode where, like, a dolphin is, like, hooked up to, like, some machinery, and his brain is, like, doing the calculations to, like, pilot the ship, or, like, do the degeneracy generation or whatever.

249
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, god, I forgot about that.

250
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But yeah, that does happen.

251
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So, it definitely moves into, like, okay, we're moving into, like, some, like, softer, like, weirder side by.

252
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The reveal of the gun buster itself is kind of like the pivot point, where it goes from, like, grounded technology to, like, we're going to start taking some liberties here.

253
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And from then on, it's kind of like, all right, we're just going all out.

254
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yeah, it's powered by this so-called degeneracy generator.

255
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So it basically just can do whatever.

256
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It can shoot giant laser beams and whatever.

257
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It doesn't matter.

258
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Um, there's, um, hey, maybe you can explain this to me.

259
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So, there's, like, three so-called buster machines.

260
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And the third one is the black hole bomb that they end up, like, blowing up the center of the galaxy with.

261
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I guess the gun buster itself is number two.

262
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But also, there's a number one.

263
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I guess by the end, there's just, like, two gun busters, and they, like, merge.

264
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Is that right? Did I have that right?

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I think so.

266
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Cause I'm pretty sure Amino and Noriko both just have their own gun buster.

267
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
They both have a gun buster. That's implied, you know, by the end of Die Buster that they both have.

268
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I mean, you see, you see, I think you see them piloting two different robots, and I think they combine at some point.

269
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah.

270
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The ending just kind of go, the ending, like, the details of the ending just kind of, like, go by pretty fast.

271
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Like.

272
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There's a lot packed into the last episode, for sure.

273
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah. Like, the last scene, the big last scene of the last episode is when Noriko, like, pulls, in her cockpit, she, like, pulls the clothes off her chest.

274
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
She, like, rips her shirt open.

275
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But outside, this action, like, the gun buster, like, pulls its chest plating off or whatever, and it pulls out, like, degeneracy generator heart.

276
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I guess this is the thing that's going to, like, create the additional mass that lets the black hole bomb go off, or whatever.

277
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's iconic. It's an iconic moment.

278
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, do we mention the Inazuma kick, the Thunder kick?

279
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's, I think that's from this series. I think this was where that started.

280
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Just, I could be wrong. It might have been from somewhere else.

281
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But characters all do Inazuma kicks in this fucking Google that if you don't know what that is.

282
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's pretty sick.

283
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah.

284
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It just reminds me of Common Rider, because that's, like, Common Rider's signature move is, like, the Rider kick with a similar angle of just fucking destroying.

285
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Really?

286
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Fucking monsters and stuff. Yeah. I have no idea if it was a reference or not.

287
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Hmm. I don't know either.

288
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's probably just fucking cool.

289
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Which is absolutely true.

290
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So, like, the point, the long story short, this, like, weird gambit with the degeneracy generator and, like, going inside the black hole bomb,

291
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
time dilation occurs and basically they end up getting time dilated 12,000 years into the future.

292
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And then they come back to Earth and they're like, oh, Earth looks different.

293
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh, what the fuck is up with Earth?

294
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, no. Did humanity die?

295
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Are we in, like, a post-apocalyptic world and all of humanity is dead and there's nothing forward to?

296
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And then, and then, and then the lights come on and the planet says welcome home.

297
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They were waiting for him in the far future.

298
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
They didn't forget.

299
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They knew.

300
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's beautiful.

301
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It was a super time for that.

302
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's a beautiful fucking ending.

303
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Because, like, the interesting thing about that and the reason why I think it's so impactful, obviously in addition to just, like, the character motivations of being invested in the arc,

304
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
is that, like, time travel throughout the entire series is shown as, like, this is pretty bad.

305
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Dilation is, like, negative consequences and stuff.

306
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Every time there's a time dilation from their travel, like, it's a negative or, like, somber kind of thing as, like, ages and stuff are being desynced and all that kind of stuff.

307
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah.

308
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So you're expecting, like, kind of, like, a downer of this huge fucking jump.

309
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah.

310
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But when that welcome home pops up, it's like, oh, yes, everything's okay.

311
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's like, it's not all bad at the end of the day.

312
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah.

313
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh, man.

314
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That's super hype.

315
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What a, it's so good, because, like, you don't, you don't, I don't know.

316
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I didn't, I didn't expect it, but it's very, like, like, say you're the world government in, like, the far future and, like, this, I don't know.

317
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's just, it makes sense that it would work, that they would, it would work that way.

318
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And this is how they would, like, welcome home these two, like, at this point, they're basically, like, far distant past, like, folk heroes who have just, like, time traveled to the future.

319
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And now you've got to fucking do something about it.

320
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Myths coming to life.

321
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah.

322
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You know, because, like, in Die Buster, they call this time period the Age of Myths.

323
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
They do.

324
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah.

325
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
This is, um, I mean, like, it's a, it's a spoiler.

326
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't know.

327
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Do we want to start with spoilers for Die Buster?

328
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I mean, we said right at the top that you should have watched both of these before we talked about it.

329
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah.

330
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Like, yeah.

331
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The end, the end of Die Buster is the end of Gun Buster.

332
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's that same moment of, like,

333
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Dude, that hit me like a fucking gut punch.

334
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It was so fucking cool.

335
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Dude, like, okay, I get, like, when you realize that, um, Nono Riri is Noriko, that the girl

336
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
that, uh, Nono's been talking about the whole time is Noriko.

337
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's like, oh, oh, okay, I get it.

338
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's a reference to the first, oh, this is like the, this is like the future of Gun Buster.

339
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I get it.

340
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But then, the ending, you realize it's not just the future.

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's that exact moment in the future.

342
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like, now is the time.

343
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We saw it before, but now we get to see it from the ground.

344
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Oh, dude.

345
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Because, like, the whole, the whole, something that needs to be mentioned about Die Buster is that, like,

346
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
up until, like, that last kind of point, the last, like, 45 or so seconds of the entire show,

347
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
it's very loosely connected to Gun Buster because there's this huge time skip.

348
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And it doesn't specifically tell you, in the beginning, how it's related.

349
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You only, we only know that, like, oh, it's that future from Gun Buster from the ending.

350
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
In the beginning, you're just like, I guess they're space monsters still?

351
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If you, if you just, like, watched, if you just, like, watched Die Buster, like, the first episode,

352
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
you might not even think it's an actually a sequel.

353
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I would not.

354
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Not at all.

355
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You would just think maybe it was, like, a spiritual successor or, like, a similar anime by the same studio.

356
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's not even necessarily in the same world.

357
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Because, like, there are giant robots.

358
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
There are space monsters, but the space monsters don't look the same.

359
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Right.

360
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And, like,

361
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I mean, you can name, like, 50 shows that have giant robots as space monsters.

362
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So that doesn't really mean anything.

363
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah.

364
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

365
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And, like, the main character, you find out really early that Nono is a robot.

366
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And, like, nobody thinks that's that weird.

367
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
They're like, oh, yeah, they're really rare around here.

368
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But, like, you know, they're pretty common around Pluto.

369
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You know, it's fine.

370
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm a fucking idiot, because I totally missed that she was a robot.

371
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Somehow I didn't...

372
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I missed that line.

373
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Maybe I looked away at the wrong time to grab, like, some chips or some shit.

374
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But, like, I didn't realize she was a robot for a while,

375
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and it took me by surprise when she's on Pluto.

376
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, you must have been confused when she goes to Pluto

377
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
when she doesn't need a space suit.

378
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, I was like, what the fuck is happening?

379
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah, there's, like...

380
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm an idiot, I guess.

381
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I mean, in the first episode, there's, like, a pretty gruesome shot of after the space monster takes off

382
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and, like, she gets, like...

383
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I mean, you want to assume she's, like, burnt up in orbit

384
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
by, like, the act of this thing, like, literally taking off into space with her just on it.

385
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But then it ends up, you know, she, like, moves, turns out she's not dead,

386
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and it's like, oh, okay, she's a robot, so...

387
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I just, I think I just figured the atmosphere burns hot,

388
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
but her heart burns hotter, you know, from fucking odorship.

389
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
How did you think she was able to, like, stand up on its body in space,

390
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
like, run along its thing and, like...

391
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
This is a Gainek show!

392
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Deliver the Inazuma kick.

393
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
This is a Gainek show!

394
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Shit just happens sometimes.

395
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You just thought, oh, no.

396
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I go into anime and just spending all of my disbelief.

397
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
She's just a regular girl, but she's just, like, got a lot of determination.

398
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
She's a main character in an anime.

399
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
She obviously has the deck stacked in her favor.

400
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So she can just, like, kick the fucking exoskeleton off of, like, a space demon.

401
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah, sure.

402
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Maybe. I mean, I don't know.

403
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
No, that's pretty funny.

404
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I mean, I knew, obviously, she was, like, super human.

405
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I just don't think I made the connection that she was a robot,

406
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
because I'm an idiot, and I must have missed a very personal line.

407
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They say it? I mean, they say it sort of casually,

408
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
because, like, it's not that big a deal.

409
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Because, like, yeah, they say, like...

410
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Maybe it was the lack of big deal that made me just gloss over and forget about it.

411
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
They say, like, oh, yeah, rogue robots like this are, you know, unpluto.

412
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
They're not that rare.

413
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
They're like, oh, okay, cool.

414
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Gotcha.

415
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And then, like, they talk about how, like, can Nono pilot a Buster?

416
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Like, well, you know, an AI has never piloted one before,

417
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
but it's theoretically possible.

418
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah, I feel like I fucked up,

419
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
because, like, that seems like such a huge part of the show.

420
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And, like, it would have done two things.

421
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It would have recontextualized my appreciation for Nono as a character,

422
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
because that's kind of important to her angle,

423
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and her relationships with the other characters,

424
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and the world building, because, obviously, machines are just a thing.

425
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And I probably would have seen coming that she was a Buster machine

426
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
if I didn't know that she was a robot the whole time.

427
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So, like, my one casual glance away

428
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
clearly fucked me for this entire show.

429
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm not, I mean, like, I'm generally not someone who's good at, like,

430
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
predicting, like, where a show's gonna go,

431
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
or, like, predicting twists.

432
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So I did not, like, even though I knew she was a robot,

433
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I didn't think, like, maybe she's a Buster machine.

434
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
That was just like...

435
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Because, like, what is a Buster machine?

436
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Can just any fucking thing be a Buster machine?

437
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The black hole bomb was a Buster machine,

438
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
so, yeah, I guess...

439
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Well, that's kind of...

440
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I guess a Buster machine is just any machine

441
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that is powered by degeneracy generators

442
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and is designed to defeat space monsters, maybe?

443
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I mean, it sounds, it seems like, like...

444
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Because that's the whole thing, like,

445
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I was trying to figure out, like, what the Buster machines were.

446
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Because we have this huge, like, 12,000-year gap

447
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
between a Gun Buster and a Die Buster.

448
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So, like, I guess the point is that even in the context of Die Buster,

449
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
they don't really know what Buster machines are,

450
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
because they're just kind of relics from the Age of Myths

451
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
that they're kind of, like, inherited, and they don't even...

452
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
They don't have to make more, they don't understand really how they work.

453
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Wait, no, no, no, don't they make more?

454
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Like, don't...

455
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Okay, the one that the white-haired girl ends up piloting,

456
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
wasn't that, like, a new one that they just made?

457
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Did they make it, or did they, like, restore it?

458
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Because, like...

459
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I thought they made it, but I don't know.

460
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, they do say...

461
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
They talk about how they don't understand how this technology works

462
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
or anything a lot of the times, and how, like...

463
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah.

464
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And in the end, they're talking about how, oh, well,

465
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Gunbuster, you know, number seven has abandoned us,

466
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
so we have to...

467
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
This is Earth's, you know, trial by fire.

468
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
We have to defend ourselves against the space monsters

469
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
under our own power and stuff.

470
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So it kind of seemed to imply that they didn't have a complete 100%

471
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
grasp on Buster machines as a technology.

472
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It seemed like it was talking about those as, like,

473
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
old tech that was lost to time.

474
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Because when they find out that the space monsters

475
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
that they've been fighting in Die Buster are part of number seven,

476
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and that's a whole, like...

477
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
They were supposed to be defending Earth against the real space monsters.

478
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They don't understand that.

479
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And so, like, they're gone and they can't control them,

480
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
so it's like they didn't see that coming, so, like...

481
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't know.

482
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The one...

483
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Okay, the pink robot in the episode where, like,

484
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
there's the new one and Noriko...

485
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Not Noriko.

486
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Anono, like, wants to pilot it.

487
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
They say, like...

488
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Or, like, the old guy.

489
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The old guy who used to pilot...

490
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I don't remember any of the robot's names, by the way.

491
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
They're all, like, really hard to remember.

492
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah.

493
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The one that used to pilot, like, the main one.

494
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Lalk's, or Princess Lalk's or whatever.

495
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Onesama's robot.

496
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
They say that, like, these things...

497
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Sometimes they just don't wake up.

498
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I thought that what he was saying was that,

499
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
yeah, this is a new one.

500
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We made a new one, but, like, sometimes they just don't work

501
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and we don't know why.

502
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So I thought that, yeah, they had made this one,

503
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but, like, they didn't really understand the technology

504
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
because, like, sometimes it just fails

505
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and they don't have an explanation for it.

506
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But, um...

507
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah, they do...

508
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
They do send her to Pluto to go find one,

509
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and they, like, they say that they uncover that one on the planet,

510
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
but it turns out to be the old space monster.

511
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And turn... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Go on.

513
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Um, no, I was just gonna say, regardless of whether

514
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
they're making new ones and bad at it,

515
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
or retrofitting old ones, I guess the point still stands,

516
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
that they don't have full mastery of this technology.

517
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Definitely.

518
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah, like, definitely they don't make them like they used to.

519
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Because, like...

520
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Indeed.

521
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
No, Noriko is, like, obviously better.

522
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Sorry, Nono is obviously better.

523
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Um, and, like, once it pulls the horn out of its head,

524
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
um, um, you know, number 19 or whatever,

525
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
is obviously better than all the other ones.

526
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I forgot.

527
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I had forgotten about, like, the twist with, like, the horn

528
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and the... that one guy.

529
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You know?

530
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah.

531
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That one guy.

532
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That one guy.

533
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Uh, which guy?

534
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I know, I know what you're talking about with the horn,

535
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and, like, the buster, the...

536
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah, when he pulls it out and reveals his true...

537
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
The dicks, no, for whatever the fuck it was called.

538
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And he becomes cool.

539
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And he becomes cool.

540
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
He strikes the gynex pose of, like, having his arms crossed

541
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and, like, some sort of cape billowing behind him.

542
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
His...

543
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah.

544
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
His robot face looks a little too human, if you ask me.

545
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
They all kind of looked pretty human,

546
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
with, like, the human-esque kind of eyes and stuff.

547
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Um, but, like, that's kind of like a throwback to, like,

548
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
old, giant robo-shows, where they did that a lot, too.

549
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That guy looks very much, like...

550
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That guy looks very much, um, like, um...

551
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Gigantor, kind of, style.

552
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You know?

553
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That guy really looks like an old, old-school,

554
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
giant robot, to me.

555
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Which I suppose is maybe intentional, because he's supposed to be old.

556
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Old, by even, like, the standards of that technology,

557
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
because it's from back in the day.

558
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Absolutely.

559
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Uh, it was fucking sick, though.

560
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I didn't understand why, uh, Lulk was still able to pilot it

561
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
after she lost her topless powers.

562
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I didn't really understand what topless powers were.

563
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It's, uh...

564
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah.

565
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
In, in, like, okay.

566
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So in, like, the future, in this future time,

567
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
there are still giant robots,

568
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
but only certain people can power them.

569
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And it's only, like, young people who have access to, like,

570
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
heightened emotional states,

571
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
cause, like, super brainwave events or something.

572
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
That's pretty fully-cool-y, when you think about it.

573
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's, okay, everything with, everything with the topless powers

574
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
is so fully-cool-y, how, like, you seal it,

575
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
you seal the power away with, like, a, like,

576
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
a sticker on your forehead.

577
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Right.

578
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And, like, when you, when you use it, like,

579
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
you're fucking the, the glow, like, emanates from your forehead

580
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and shit.

581
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Um, yeah.

582
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Like, the whole, the whole scene at the beginning of her,

583
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
like, slap, of, of Lalk, like, slapping the,

584
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
the, the tag on Noriko, or Nono's head,

585
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and it splits, is so, like, um,

586
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
it's so fully-cool-y.

587
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Episode one is, like, so fucking fully-cool-y at her.

588
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It really is.

589
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Like, the whole battle with the first monster on, uh,

590
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
on Mars.

591
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It's Mars or a moon of Mars.

592
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah, it was Mars.

593
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah.

594
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And, like, very much felt like, you know,

595
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
uh, the, the, kind of the, the stuff at the end of fully-cool-y

596
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
or, like, some of the fights with Kanzi.

597
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah.

598
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Very much just in terms of choreography and cinematography

599
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and stuff.

600
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah.

601
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's, it's, there's the, the part where, um,

602
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
yeah, the part where, like, Noriko gets, like,

603
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
stuck on the, um, the leg of the monster.

604
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It kind of feels like the part where now to get stuck

605
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
to the Medica Mechanica robot that has to fight Kanzi

606
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
in episode one, it also kind of feels like the part where,

607
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
um, um, Commander Amaro is, like,

608
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
hanging from, like, the wrinkles of the hand

609
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
as it's going down to grab the, the Medica Mechanica

610
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
building.

611
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Um, there's just so, especially early on,

612
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
there's, like, so many little moments.

613
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's, like, this looks exactly like that other thing

614
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
that happened in fully-cool-y.

615
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Like.

616
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I wonder if they were using, like, the same kind of, like,

617
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
base two frames and stuff.

618
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Honestly, I think they might have just traced some

619
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
of their scenes.

620
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Like, I, I think that probably had.

621
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I think they might have just done that.

622
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Which is.

623
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Which is fine.

624
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah.

625
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It looks amazing and better than, like, almost all anime.

626
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I guess.

627
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's just funny.

628
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
What I want to know.

629
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Um, do you think that fully-cool-y takes place

630
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
in the same universe?

631
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I think you could probably make the case that it might.

632
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You could.

633
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah.

634
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
There's definitely, there's nothing really in,

635
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
in fully-cool-y that, that disproves it,

636
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
that I can recall.

637
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I mean, I guess, you know, I guess we assume that

638
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
fully-cool-y takes place on Earth.

639
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But, like, we see Earth in this world,

640
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
and it doesn't really look like fully-cool-y.

641
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So, maybe not.

642
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Or maybe, like, maybe it takes place in, like,

643
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
before.

644
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Maybe it takes place either, like, before Noriko

645
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
or else, like, after, maybe sometime during,

646
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
like, the interregnum, like, when, like, after the Earth,

647
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
like, sealed away warp technology and, like, and stuff.

648
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And, like, maybe Medica Mechanica is just from some other,

649
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
like, it's unrelated to the space aliens or anything.

650
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's just some, like, other entity somewhere out there

651
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
in space that is, like, kind of pursuing its own agenda.

652
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Haruko's Vespa, the most powerful Buster machine ever created.

653
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh, man, yeah, there's Vespa writing in this show as well.

654
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's, again, in the first episode.

655
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah.

656
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I don't know.

657
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's where Lalk gets her headgear and she's trying to get the Vespa started

658
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and, like, freaks out and kicks it.

659
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm like, yeah, that's an FLCL scene right there.

660
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah.

661
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The part where Noriko, when Noriko becomes number seven,

662
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
like, is just, like, the part where Nauta gets the powers of Atomisk.

663
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah.

664
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And, I mean, it just feels the same.

665
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It has the same energy, too.

666
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, I mean, it also has the same energy as when, like,

667
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Simon finally becomes a man.

668
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like, it's the same kind of pose and the same angle

669
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and the same kind of, like, you know, gutsy speech.

670
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's fucking hype.

671
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That's what Gainex is fucking great at.

672
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's just, like, getting your dick rock hard

673
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and just getting your hype dialed up to 12.

674
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
The end of Die Buster is basically, like, a smaller-scale version

675
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
of the end of Gurren Lagann.

676
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
She makes the big, like, planet-sized version of herself

677
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
by, like, combining all of the, like, mini-robots

678
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
or the mini-aliens or whatever.

679
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh.

680
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
The red Milky Way.

681
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
The part where she, where Lalk fucking, like,

682
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
uses her, like, dimension powers

683
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and, like, grabs the core of Jupiter

684
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and just, like, throws it into the air.

685
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So fucking good.

686
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So fucking cool.

687
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Oh, yeah.

688
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Okay, so it's really interesting that, like,

689
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
okay, when the show started, I see the space aliens

690
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and I'm like, those aliens look different,

691
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
but, like, maybe it's just an art-style change?

692
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, because the aesthetic is so fucking different from the original.

693
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's like, okay, I think they're supposed to be the aliens

694
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
from Gunbuster, but they don't quite look the same,

695
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
but, like, they call them the same thing,

696
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
so I think it's just an art-style thing.

697
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But then later on, no.

698
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
These space monsters are, they, like,

699
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
God, it's like, yeah, they're the defense system.

700
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Yeah, they're part of Buster Machine Number 7

701
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
or, you know, no.

702
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah, they're a defense system for the solar system.

703
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Again, it was designed to defend against the space monsters,

704
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
but it, like, was, like, an evolving organism,

705
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and so it just kind of naturally evolved

706
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
to look more like the space monsters,

707
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
because I guess they're, like, well-evolved

708
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
to, like, survive in space or whatever.

709
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yeah, and then they started attacking humans

710
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
because the topless powers is the same, like,

711
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I guess, like, the energy that the topless harness

712
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
is the same kind of fluctuating gravity field

713
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
that the space monsters are.

714
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah.

715
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It was kind of unclear.

716
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It was very unclear.

717
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I want to talk about that.

718
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
They find one of the original space monsters.

719
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
They, they call it, they go, yeah,

720
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
henceforth they call them fluctuating gravity fields,

721
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
which is a really fucking weird name for these things,

722
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
which they don't look like a gravity field.

723
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
They just look like a big, like, weird, like, space amoeba.

724
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So I don't understand that naming convention at all.

725
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But, yeah, it's, the twins say, like,

726
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
oh, this is a, this is a comrade.

727
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Like, this is an eternal topless.

728
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Right.

729
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So, yeah, I guess there's some kind of connection

730
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
between the topless power and the original space monsters

731
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
from Gunbuster.

732
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
They, yeah, they, they are the same in some way

733
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
tap into the same power, I guess.

734
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

735
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I don't know.

736
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It's very unclear.

737
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
They're implying that, like, the twins were, like,

738
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
eating the fucking space monster or something,

739
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
because, like, the guy, like, pukes in his mouth.

740
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
He's like, oh, God, that weird crab meat they fed me

741
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
that I didn't want to eat, that smelled bad,

742
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
was actually this thing.

743
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And, yeah, like, were they, were the twins good or bad?

744
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
They kind of seem like they were just out for their own thing,

745
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and this entire operation was just an excuse

746
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
for them to commune with the eternal topless,

747
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
which happened to be a space alien,

748
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
because they send, they, they tell Nono

749
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
about the buster on Pluto,

750
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
specifically because I guess they already know

751
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
she's a buster, and they send her away

752
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
to have half of the space monster fleet chase her

753
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
so their fight can be easier,

754
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
so their forces can keep the monsters at bay

755
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
while they exhume the rest of the eternal topless.

756
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I don't think they knew that Nono was a buster.

757
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I think they just knew that the space monsters follow her,

758
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and we're like, if we send her away,

759
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
the space monsters will go where she goes.

760
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That's fair.

761
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
But, like, okay, I don't understand what's up with the twins,

762
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
because it's basically just outright said

763
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
that, like, they're actually really old,

764
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
so one presumes that they have some sort of, like,

765
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
unnatural way of extending their ability to remain topless,

766
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
because, like, everyone else that gets old

767
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
stops being topless.

768
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You lose your topless ability.

769
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah.

770
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And, um, but they, I don't know,

771
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and I guess it's, maybe it's connected to them

772
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
eating the meat of this fucking thing?

773
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Possibly.

774
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's the only explanation I can even think of.

775
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The twins are introduced and discarded pretty quickly.

776
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
They serve mostly as just kind of a plot device

777
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
to get the real space monsters into the fray.

778
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah.

779
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Well, I mean, um, what's his name?

780
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
The guy.

781
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The sort, like, lalk sort of, like, boyfriend or whatever.

782
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
He, like, talks to them over the intercom in, like, the first episode.

783
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But then, I don't know, they're just kind of in the back.

784
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
They just talk about them in the background until they show up,

785
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
turn out to be evil, turn out to be, like,

786
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
willing to sacrifice all the other topless pilots

787
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
in order to, yeah, commune or do something with this thing,

788
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
with this space monster that they seem to think is, like,

789
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
the key to them, like, never losing their topless abilities,

790
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
because, like, that's their worst nightmare.

791
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Um, and it kills them because, I don't know, they're bad.

792
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And it's a, and it's a fucking freak monster demon.

793
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Um, and I guess these space monsters are just really fucking powerful.

794
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Like, way more powerful than these, like, fake ones

795
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
in fighting than, like, the defense, the defense droid, drones or whatever.

796
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Um, I guess, you know, I guess, yeah, they must really not make them like they used to,

797
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
because these, like, newer, uh, busters,

798
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
like, the old buster could take out a space, a space monster,

799
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
but these new ones are just shit, and just can't fucking do it.

800
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
The buster machines that they've been using are not nearly as powerful

801
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
as the original gun buster, because, like,

802
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
that was, I think, one of the really interesting things

803
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
of introducing, quote, unquote, real space monsters halfway through

804
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
is that it just really changes the power dynamic

805
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
of everything you've seen in the show so far.

806
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You think that these monsters are, these busters are as strong as the original gun buster,

807
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
but no, the original gun buster was on a league in comparison.

808
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
They're shit.

809
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
These, everything you've been so impressed by so far.

810
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Dog shit.

811
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Total fucking garbage.

812
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's like, oh, okay.

813
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Like, they've been, like, struggling fighting against, like,

814
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
one, one-millionth of Number 7's buster machine,

815
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and, like, even that is giving them a hard time,

816
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
so it's just like, well, that's unfortunate.

817
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Although, yeah, I guess, um, I guess the only reason why Laux can end up helping out

818
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
is because it turns out that hers is, like, even older than they all thought.

819
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It does seem to imply that, like, the closer you are to Number 1,

820
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
the more powerful the buster machine itself is,

821
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
because, like, Dick's Newf, whatever the fuck it is,

822
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm looking at the wiki right now.

823
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah.

824
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That's Number 9, I believe, they say.

825
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It's either 9 or 17?

826
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Which one was it?

827
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I think it was 19.

828
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It might have, I might be getting confused.

829
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It might be 19.

830
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I don't know.

831
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But it's like, it's in the teens.

832
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Like, it's pretty low.

833
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It's significantly lower numbered than, uh, than the other ones.

834
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Like, was, was probably made within, like, a lifetime

835
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
of the original gun buster having been made.

836
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I don't understand why Laux can still pilot it

837
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
after she loses her topless abilities,

838
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
other than just, like, you know, your, your guts burn hotter

839
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
than the restrictions.

840
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah.

841
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Well, like, yeah, I don't know,

842
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
because, like, the original, the original gun buster,

843
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and I guess gun buster 2,

844
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
the gun buster machines Number 1 and Number 2

845
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
that were piloted by Noriko and Amino,

846
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
they don't have, uh, you know, a topless.

847
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Topless.

848
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You don't need to be a topless.

849
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Like, they don't even know what that is at the time.

850
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Right.

851
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Just, just, just, just any,

852
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
presumably just anyone could fucking pilot those things.

853
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Well, I guess maybe it's because when he pulls the horn out,

854
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
that lets her get to the original cockpit.

855
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And maybe if you're using the original cockpit,

856
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
you don't need to be a topless.

857
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Yeah.

858
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Like, I assume that that one, since it's that old,

859
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
must have been designed, you know,

860
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
similarly to the original one,

861
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
which, yeah, anybody could pilot it.

862
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Um, I, I don't, I don't know if the show ever, like,

863
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
even hints at us, like,

864
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I feel like there's something I'm missing here.

865
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Like, what is, like, what exactly is the topless power?

866
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Why are the robots designed to,

867
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I guess the robots are, like, powered by the topless energy.

868
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It says, like, when you do, like, a fucking super attack

869
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
with your super buster robot,

870
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
it's your topless, like, emotion power

871
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
that is, like, powering the beam or whatever.

872
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Um, so I guess they're designed to, like, work with that.

873
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But, yeah, the old, better ones just don't require it.

874
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I, I, I don't know why.

875
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It's, that's just how it is.

876
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's not made, I mean, both gun buster and die buster

877
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
both have narrative that don't go out of their way to spoon feed you.

878
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You know?

879
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
No.

880
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And that's, that's kind of cool.

881
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I do like, I do like that to a degree,

882
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
but there are certain, like, key concepts, like the topless.

883
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And, like, why does it even call the topless?

884
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That's weird.

885
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Like, I mean, that's a very kind of guy next thing to do.

886
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I mean, they do find a, a chance in both the first and last episode

887
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
to have their main characters be topless momentarily.

888
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So, I mean.

889
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yeah, cause no, no, it's like, oh, haha.

890
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I'll just rip my shirt off.

891
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Hey, look, you said you had to be topless to be a space pilot.

892
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Now I am.

893
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Haha.

894
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Also tits now.

895
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Yeah.

896
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Based.

897
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Um, um, I don't know.

898
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's maybe, I feel like the word might sound cool in Japanese.

899
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That's very possible.

900
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Like, cause they say it, I feel like maybe it's like kind of a cool,

901
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
like foreign sounding word that's like, oh, that's neat.

902
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But like in English, it's like topless.

903
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Like, what is that?

904
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
What, why?

905
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Doesn't, doesn't matter.

906
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Um, I was going to say something else about, um, oh, yeah.

907
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Did I mention the thing about Nono, Nono Riri?

908
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And how, um, the whole time she's talking about this Nono Riri,

909
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
and it turns out it's like her like corrupted memory,

910
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
just like misremembered, no Riko.

911
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah.

912
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And like the first, the first thing she said when she came,

913
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
the, the scientists like broke her out of the comment was,

914
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
no, no, Riko.

915
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And I, you know, I was like, uh, ooh, ah, ooh, neat.

916
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Ah, connection, the connection is made.

917
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's pretty cool.

918
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Got it.

919
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Very, very cool.

920
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Um, and I guess, I guess that whatever, I guess at the time that Nono was made,

921
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Noriko was like a national hero or whatever.

922
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And, um, they like, either they programmed into her,

923
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
or maybe she just like learned it from like being around in a world

924
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
where everyone loved her and like celebrated her as like the savior of humanity.

925
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
That like, oh yeah, Noriko, she was a real cool hero.

926
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Be like her.

927
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I mean, I would assume if you're making a Buster machine with a humanoid shape,

928
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
you'd want to like imbue them with some understanding of the history of the conflict

929
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
that led to its creation, and Noriko is a central figure to that.

930
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Yeah, but I mean, since Nono is basically just like a person,

931
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
they might have just like, you know, told her.

932
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Like, they might have just like educated her about it.

933
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I guess, I guess my assumption was that before she got trapped in the comet,

934
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
uh, Nono was like, not as much of a dits and more of just like kind of like the badass,

935
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
uh, just destroyer that she eventually becomes by the end with less, less of the dits.

936
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I always assumed that the kind of like, personality that we know of Nono

937
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
came from her upbringing on Mars and her interactions with people

938
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
as like a lower, just normal kind of person as opposed to that was how she was the whole time.

939
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
But that's complete conjecture.

940
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's, maybe, it's, I think it's the like kind of gruff like captain looking, the captain guy.

941
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I think he speculates that like, the reason why Nono,

942
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
what, like, what would have been made with like a human form and a human heart

943
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
is because she was designed to like, guard humans.

944
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yeah, he does say that.

945
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So, to me, that suggests that like, Nono basically just is like a Pinocchio.

946
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah.

947
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Just is like a, just is a human, just has like a human's like, personality.

948
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
To give her that personal investment in keeping Earth safe.

949
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Yeah.

950
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
She's like, she's just, so maybe she was just as ditzy before.

951
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Uh, or not.

952
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I don't know.

953
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I never know.

954
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
We'll never know.

955
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Ah, man, what a great fucking show.

956
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
That whole, they dedicate like basically an entire episode to after

957
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Nono becomes, you know, Buster number seven.

958
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm just like the topless who have been like this pinnacle of like human,

959
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
like ingenuity, like this is what we need.

960
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
There's just a whole episode where it's like, you just have a disease now.

961
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
You're, you're like the scum of the earth.

962
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
We hate you.

963
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And like how all the pilots are kind of reacting to just like having their badge

964
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
of honor taken from becoming a blight literally overnight.

965
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
This was, this was like, they say a bunch of times in the series that like,

966
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
when you're a Buster pilot, like that's all you are.

967
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Like your whole identity is wrapped up in your ability to pile this Buster.

968
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And if you lose that, you're, you got nothing.

969
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And that's why like when they go, when they go to Pluto to supposedly find that,

970
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
that like buried Buster, the old guys like, no, I could still do it.

971
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I want it.

972
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Like, I bet I can still be topless if I, if I really tried, but he can't.

973
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It's too late.

974
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
His whole life is kind of just falling apart when he lost his topless power.

975
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That's why it's basically like a space janitor essentially.

976
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But he, he like, he gave it up on purpose.

977
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
He says later he, um, he just, he decided to retire early because he was like

978
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
afraid of like hitting the point when it, his power wouldn't work anymore.

979
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And so he like quit before that happened.

980
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So he would like never have to face the reality of, oh, I'm not like my topless days are over.

981
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Right.

982
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I can never pilot it again.

983
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Worked out well for him as we can clearly see.

984
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It was great.

985
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah.

986
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Um, there's a message in there somewhere.

987
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Fuck.

988
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
What was I talking about?

989
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Um, how they were based and then they weren't based.

990
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah.

991
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
When once, once no, once no, no shows up and it's like, oh, oh, you're, you're Buster

992
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
number seven, you're like more powerful than all of our fucking giant robots combined

993
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
and like times a hundred.

994
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Oh, bummer.

995
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I like, we're all completely irrelevant now.

996
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So like, it's not only that they're irrelevant, it's that they realize that the topless power

997
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
is what's attracting like the, the space monsters and stuff and like having no nose

998
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
drones being attacking humans in the first place.

999
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So they have to stop using it because it's like putting humanity in danger.

1000
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah.

1001
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
But then I guess the reason why they end up piling them again is because like, I guess,

1002
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I guess once no nose in control of the fleet, she can like make them not attack the topless

1003
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
anymore.

1004
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So it's fine now.

1005
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Well, it's because the reason they start using the Buster machines again is because no, no

1006
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
leaves and she takes the red Milky Way with them, which is what was keeping the actual

1007
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
space aliens out of the solar system in the first place.

1008
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So they really have no choice.

1009
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That's the best, the biggest guns they have.

1010
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Why did that?

1011
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Why did the, the, um, the space monsters show up again?

1012
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I know the one like hatches out of the black hole.

1013
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Was that just like random?

1014
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I guess.

1015
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I mean, like there's, there's the part where, um, they're, they're breaking out of the black

1016
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
hole and no, no is supposed to stop them, but she doesn't.

1017
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
She just like bombs out and then they just warp away.

1018
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So I guess like the space monsters are just back and that's bad.

1019
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Not, not super clear.

1020
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Does she leave?

1021
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
She leaves because she's like, okay, I can't deal with this.

1022
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I have to like spend several weeks combining my red Milky Way galaxy into the giant robot

1023
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
version of myself.

1024
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I guess.

1025
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That'll fucking tang on top of Gurren Lag in its ass.

1026
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah.

1027
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Or whatever.

1028
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Uh, and then she just ends up like not using it.

1029
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Like.

1030
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah.

1031
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It just kind of, it just, it's just there to get destroyed pretty much.

1032
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's, it's just there so that like, it's just there so that like it and the like giant

1033
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
like space projection version of lelks can have like a planetary scale like fistfight.

1034
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Yeah.

1035
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Like one micro comes out of nowhere like the Gurren Lag in battle.

1036
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Right.

1037
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And it's like, man, if you had, if you had that giant fucking robot that could take on

1038
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
number seven, like why not use that against the fucking monster instead of throwing the

1039
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
earth into it?

1040
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And another thing is like there's, they say that there's like 13 planets in the solar

1041
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
system now.

1042
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
We have options.

1043
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Why are we hugging the earth at him?

1044
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
We got bigger guns we can use.

1045
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Come on.

1046
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Who needs mercury?

1047
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Fuck mercury.

1048
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I wonder if it's just because it's like the other ones are too far away or something.

1049
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Maybe, I guess.

1050
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Like, I mean, we clearly have sub light travel and like we can go pretty, I don't know.

1051
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's very, I mean, I would assume the point is that a earth is the closest and that's the

1052
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
target that this monster is going to anyways, and be the emotional impact of like, we're

1053
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
going to have to destroy our homes so we can live.

1054
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
They do.

1055
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
When like, when she, when Lalk is talking to like the council of elders or whatever,

1056
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I remember she says like, they're like, oh, do we have to destroy the earth to save humanity?

1057
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Like, like, do we really have to go so far just to survive?

1058
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And Lalk is like, we'll let, we'll let whoever ends up surviving judge us.

1059
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Like, whoever, whoever does survive, we'll get to judge.

1060
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And then there's like, in, when Amano is going back to like her final mission with Noriko,

1061
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
she's on like the elevator car or whatever.

1062
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And the cadet that's talking to her says like, she says something similar.

1063
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
He says like, maybe we should, like, we don't have a right to kill the galaxy, to like black hole

1064
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
the center of the galaxy to stop these, these space parasite or these space, these space

1065
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
monsters.

1066
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Like, what right do we have to do it?

1067
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And she says like, you know, who like, like, we'll let like the history will judge us.

1068
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
For now, we just have to make sure we're the ones that survive or whatever.

1069
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Right, right.

1070
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It's like the same kind of.

1071
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Both, both of the gun buster and die buster have tons of like parallels like that throughout

1072
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
the entire plot.

1073
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
That's what that my favorite part about them is just how they connect to each other.

1074
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Like, each one makes the other so good.

1075
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You'd be missing so much of either if you didn't watch both.

1076
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah.

1077
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You know what I mean?

1078
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Yeah, for sure.

1079
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Yeah.

1080
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I mean, even just for the endings, having the context of the endings alone is worth watching

1081
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
both.

1082
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
They have the same ending.

1083
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
They have the same ending from two different perspective.

1084
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It's like even down to the shot of like, you know, Lulk looking up at the two glimmering

1085
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
busters in the sky and then them looking down on the welcome home.

1086
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And like, you can tell like the whole city lights up around Lulk because you know that's

1087
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
where the lights are saying, well, it's so fucking good.

1088
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It's a 10 out of 10.

1089
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Perfect.

1090
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I know it is 10 out of fucking 10.

1091
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Okay.

1092
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
May I ask a if you're if you're if there's nothing else you want to bring up, I want to ask the

1093
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
question on everyone's mind.

1094
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I want to address the elephant in the room.

1095
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You ready?

1096
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
All right, go.

1097
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
All right, gun to your head.

1098
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Which one's better?

1099
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh, yeah, I'm pulling the trigger.

1100
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You got two seconds.

1101
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I guess gunbuster.

1102
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I'll go gunbuster.

1103
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Really?

1104
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Gunbuster.

1105
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah.

1106
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Okay.

1107
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I really like you by yourself.

1108
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I like the aesthetic and I like the animation and the choreography and all that stuff of

1109
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
gunbuster better.

1110
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
But the concept of like the time dilation and how so much of the conflict was focused

1111
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
around that really I really got me invested in gunbuster and I almost wished it was more

1112
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
of that in diebuster because it was so fucking cool of an idea.

1113
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I feel like diebuster is like the one that like you if you just want to like sit back

1114
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and relax and like watch something really fucking cool you throw on diebuster again.

1115
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I feel like gunbuster has like a lot of really heavy impact and like there's things to like

1116
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
really I mean there's things to think about in both but like that one just like the science

1117
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,000
and like the kind of like very controlled start versus the wacky ending and the escalation

1118
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:32,000
like it's I don't know it's just the one that I remember not that more but like I just remember

1119
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
that hard turn of like we're talking about time dilation really like got me to strap in

1120
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
so yeah I'll narrowly give it to gunbuster even though I probably rewatched diebuster

1121
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
first.

1122
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Yeah I think that's the that's the big strength the big strength that gunbuster has well I

1123
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,000
mean the like initial sort of like rocky style like training sequence I think do add a lot

1124
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
to um gunbuster like Noriko doesn't or no no no no I keep mixing them up no no doesn't

1125
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,000
really have to do any of that because she's just like a fucking badass robot even before

1126
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
she realizes she's a buster she's still like basically a superhuman robot right from the

1127
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,000
beginning she can survive in space and do the Inazuma kick and all that um and um and

1128
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
so yeah gunbuster is good for that and yeah the hard like the like the real the real science

1129
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
that's like real taken really seriously but used to achieve like sci-fi like weird like

1130
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
crazy shit that is like played for drama in gunbuster is super good and diebuster doesn't

1131
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
really have that there's like the they they like a point is made in diebuster that like

1132
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
okay after yeah we sealed off the um we sealed off warp technology we sealed off like faster

1133
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
than light travel and so there's not really an opportunity for that kind of stuff like

1134
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:58,000
nobody does that stuff anymore in in the future of of diebuster um much to their probably to

1135
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:06,000
their benefit um but they uh so that a lot of like a lot of the quote unquote science

1136
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
in um diebuster is just mumbo jumbo that I do appreciate that like um they talk about

1137
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
ether like um in in diebuster or gunbuster they say that like space is not a vacuum it's

1138
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
filled of like an ether field you know it's the ether theory of like of like light whatever

1139
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
um they they talk about ether like when the when the busters like do this weird like sparkling

1140
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
thing because they're like powered up they say oh the ether is sparking it's like yeah okay they

1141
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
occasionally reference like but like this yeah they don't have the same focus on like hard

1142
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
science concepts and diebuster and it's too bad it's very like diebuster is very like um it's

1143
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
very like ooh kind of like you know don't worry too much about it it's exactly what you would

1144
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
expect from gynecs at the time it is and I think it's you know I part of me wants to roll my eyes

1145
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,000
at a little bit but I do think that the hype moments in gunbuster are like more effective at

1146
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:12,000
being hype than than than gunbuster are it's got more that like raw emotional stuff even if

1147
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:19,000
it's cheesier at times yeah I mean you watch diebuster for hype watch gunbuster for think

1148
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:26,000
yeah yeah I think so and then you know I mean the the ending was the ending was good the first

1149
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:36,000
time when gunbuster did it but then when diebuster does it again you go oh like really

1150
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
the ending of diebuster wouldn't be anything without gunbuster so like it's mandatory that you

1151
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
like don't skip gunbuster oh no you'll fuck yourself you have to watch gunbuster first

1152
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:54,000
definitely don't skip gunbuster do not do not do it I would I hope that nobody went I hope that

1153
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
nobody went and listened to this and got the ending spoiled but if you did but if you did you were

1154
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
warned yeah leave leave a comment if you fucked up so we can viciously mock you let me one of

1155
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
my favorite things about fully cooly yeah tell us let us know if you fucked up you idiot I love

1156
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
fully cooly because it's really good and it's really short and gunbuster and diebuster are also

1157
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
really short I love that that's so good more more shows should just be like six episodes

1158
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:31,000
the lost art of the six episode OVA it is real shame when when was there ever an anime that needed

1159
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:39,000
to be longer than six episodes never there's never been one there never will be it's don't you find it

1160
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
weird that they fucking compressed diebuster down to like what two movies or something one or two

1161
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
movies I haven't have you seen the movies I haven't seen them I've not but I just seems like this is

1162
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:56,000
already so compressed like wouldn't two movies be the same length if not longer than yeah this like

1163
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:07,000
yeah they basically basically be the same like what what's the point huh I don't know man maybe they

1164
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:13,000
like they might actually be longer maybe they just like added additional content according to the

1165
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Wikipedia article says it condenses oh no it's gunbuster and diebuster into two movies it's not just

1166
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:27,000
that would be weird that sounds shitty honestly yeah like they're not meant that they have to cut

1167
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,000
out a lot I'm sure they could do it and it would be okay but like imagine watching that movie and it's

1168
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:41,000
just and it's just clearly to like completely different shows you know be really weird yeah if they

1169
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:47,000
if they read if they did gunbuster as a movie and it was in like modern anime style I feel like so much

1170
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
of the tone of gunbuster is in that like late 80s aesthetic oh yeah for sure no you couldn't watch

1171
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
gunbuster in modern Gainax it would be kind of weird it would be I think it would be a totally

1172
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:08,000
different show yeah it would you I mean hmm hmm like those fucking matte painted space aliens like

1173
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
that really like that aesthetic is like so essential to a lot of the shots in that I don't know I wouldn't

1174
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,000
want to see that like as a CG thing or something or whatever they were doing I'm trying to imagine

1175
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
yeah if they just like read if they just did a like a remake of gunbuster but it looked like

1176
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:35,000
diebuster oh I don't know that would just be like that would be dumb it would be it wouldn't be the same

1177
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I wouldn't even although it might be interesting I guess I would be interested to see it but it could

1178
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:49,000
never replace the original because the original is so steeped in that like early in that 80s anime

1179
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:59,000
look and like the whole like rocky vibes and and shit I don't know you just couldn't do it and yet

1180
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:08,000
they did they didn't remake it what what I don't know if they did or not do they reanimated or there's

1181
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:16,000
just a cut version oh god I hope I fucking hope not I think it looks like they edited it together

1182
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:25,000
okay just like smashed two completely different art styles into one movie oh boy very weird well yeah

1183
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
the uneducated because I haven't seen them but I would still recommend watching the OVA because

1184
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:37,000
that's how it was originally intended to be I mean it's only six episodes it's not like it's not like

1185
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:45,000
not a huge ask just unlike you like digi and Nate fucking idiot like all of my everyone else on the

1186
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
podcast who didn't show up to this because they didn't have time to watch a six episode OVA I promise

1187
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:58,000
you you have time to watch a six episode OVA and then watch another one I would argue the OVA is

1188
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
easier to watch because you can watch it in half an hour chunks after work over the course of a week if

1189
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:09,000
you need to yeah who pauses a movie halfway through nobody nobody no fucking buddy yeah it's it's it's

1190
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:16,000
flexible you can watch it on your own terms you can have you truly you can have it your way yeah I

1191
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,000
mean it's six episodes 27 minutes each that's what like just over two hours I watched all of

1192
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:32,000
this morning before before instead of watching Avengers Endgame for the 15th time expand your

1193
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
palette watch Gun Buster you'll be happy well and hopefully you already did or else you fuck yeah please

1194
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
but if you didn't it's still worth it this is how you pitch it to your friends your smooth brain friends

1195
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
if you if you did listen to this and you spoiled it for yourself now you can never experience the joy of

1196
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:57,000
a first time seeing Die Buster but you can tell your you you you will have to experience it vicariously

1197
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:03,000
by a strong arming people you know into watching them and you're just gonna have to watch and see their

1198
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,000
reaction so you can thank God I God I wish that were me you'll be like the twins chasing the eternal

1199
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:20,000
topless will be chasing the eternal rush of experiencing that ending the time yes yes there's

1200
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,000
um there's a lot of there's a lot of there's there's Eva there's a lot of Eva in Die Buster there's

1201
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:34,000
like especially in the part with the the eternal topless the fucking the gravity field or whatever

1202
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
like when all the pilots start dying is like and then the old the old like ex pilot is like yeah you

1203
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
know actually piloting a buster is like really fucking scary but he doesn't mean he means it's scary

1204
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and that like once it has its claws into you like you never want to stop doing it and like if you and

1205
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
like eventually you will have to stop and it will devastate you and you will be a shell of a person

1206
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:11,000
you know like me he says tragic tragic but I don't know we got anything else to say about these these

1207
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:19,000
masterpieces um I'm pretty tapped I think I've said what what I wanted to say it's just fucking great

1208
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,000
yeah it's aesthetic as fuck yeah it's good storytelling it'll keep you asking questions and those questions

1209
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
will prompt rewatches which is always nice I'm sure I'll be watching these again at some point

1210
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:36,000
uh yeah highly recommend it my like second or third time seeing them I mean we've been talking

1211
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:43,000
now for what like a quarter of the entire runtime of the whole series so yeah if you couldn't justify

1212
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
spending the time watching them but you listen to this entire podcast question your time management

1213
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:57,000
oh you fucked up my friend no no no uh yeah all right like this has been this has been the first

1214
