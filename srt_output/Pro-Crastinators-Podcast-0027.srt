1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Now, since the last time I've rolled through these parts, and I do roll through with some frequency,

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
I'm a little bit like herpes, I keep coming back.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,500
But since the last time I might have seen some of you folks, I have had my 70th birthday.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Thank you.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, I'm now 70 years old, and I like 70.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Not as much as I like 69.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, 69 was always my favorite number.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now I figure I'm 69 with one finger up my ass.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But now that I'm an old fuck, and that's what I consider myself to be, an old fuck.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Old fuck is a very special term. It's not like old man. Old man is different.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Old man isn't really a time in your life or a period of years. It's an attitude.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Old man is a point of view. It's a way of looking at things.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,500
Some guys are old men when they're in their 20s. You've met guys like that.

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,000
They're just wired like old men. Not me, not an old man, and not an old fart.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because an old fart is kind of...

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What I am is an old fuck. It's kind of like a fat fuck.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Fat fuck, tall fuck, skinny fuck, short fuck.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Old fuck. Who's the old fuck? That's Georgie. Georgie's the old fuck.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In this respect, fuck is actually a synonym for the word fellow.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But now that I'm an old fuck, I'm beginning to notice there are some advantages to putting on a few extra years.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The first one is, you never have to carry anything heavy ever again.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Everybody wants to help an old fuck. If you've got a big suitcase or something like that,

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
you know, you just kind of go like this a little bit.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You say, yeah, could you help me with this?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, hey, how far are you going? Indianapolis.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He wants to help. Fuck him, put him to work.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Take advantage of people.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Another nice thing about getting old is you can leave any social event early just by saying you're tired.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Works great with family members. Just turn to the person next to you and say, jeez, I'm getting tired, you know.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, you're tired? Come on, grandpa's tired. Grandpa's going to bed.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Someone else is, but it's 7.30 in the morning.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There's always one asshole in the family.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But the best thing about getting old is you're not responsible for remembering things anymore.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Even important things. But it was your daughter's funeral.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I forgot. You can even make believe you have Alzheimer's disease. That's a lot of fun.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You look around the dining room table and you say, who are you, people, and where is my horse?

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Then you stare at your oldest son and say, Agnes, I haven't seen you since First Communion.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Fucks them up. They don't know how to handle it.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It takes them a week to get over that shit.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And they start listening to you a lot more carefully from their own.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So don't be afraid to get old. It's a great time of life.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You get to take advantage of people and you're not responsible for anything.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can even shit in your pants.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
They expect it. I haven't tried that yet, but I don't rule it out.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm keeping my options open. Everything is on the table.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Perhaps that's not the figure of speech I wanted.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Welcome, one and all, to the Procrastinator's podcast episode I don't know.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Today with me is, I'm Hippocrite by the way. Today with me is Nate.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hey guys, I'm the best guy ever. What's going on at your house?

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And Ben.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My house is pretty good, Nate. How about yours?

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's okay. I have to move in like three weeks though, so that's kind of stressing me out.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh no. Oh no.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I kind of forgot shit out. Oh no.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Meanwhile, on the Procrastinator's podcast, we're talking about...

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That sure is an adult problem you have, Nate.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It is. It is.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Meanwhile, on the Procrastinator's podcast, we're talking about people complaining about getting old and how they're stupid for doing so.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was trying to segue there.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, well, I'm the guy saying the intro, so I got offended.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I respect that authority.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's the old cast today.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, and how everyone's always, a lot of people are like, oh no, I'm getting old, I'm fucked.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Or like people that really dread getting old.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Here's what's interesting about the thing about dreading getting older, is that it happens at every age.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's true. Every single age.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I mean, some kids can't wait to grow up. I was not a kid like that.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I was a kid who was like, man, I sure don't want to be an adult.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And you know, once you're an adult, you're like, oh man, I don't want to be an old adult.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That sounds bad.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But to me, it's like, it's like, my experience has been, whatever age I am, that's like the right age, the normal age, and I'm scared to get older.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But like, I don't, I don't know.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's like, you're old to any, you don't want to be old, right?

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But whatever age you are, you're not old to yourself, because you yourself are the reference point, right?

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like, no matter what age you are, you're old compared to the people younger than you, and you're young compared to the people older than you.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's always true. That's always really what it boils down to, right?

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, I mean, a lot of the time I think the fear of getting older is fear of the unknown.

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're like, yeah, I don't know what's going to happen soon. I'm scared about it.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Which is a pretty reasonable thing to be afraid of.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, I guess. But I don't know. I don't feel like that.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm not scared of getting old and dying as much as other people seem to be.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Like the whole like, oh no, one day I won't be around.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh man, I'm pretty scared of that.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Whatever. I'm pretty scared of death.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I've already got more, like, recorded stuff of me, more than most people.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So people will remember me more than the average person.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Right, but I think about how like, you know, I mean, what if, you know, Google or whatever goes out of business

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and like all the YouTube servers go away and like all our videos are going to go away at some point

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and that will be forgotten. So I think about how long this legacy will really last.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What I'm thinking more on that is people, like there's a guy 500 years ago thinking about the same thing

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and nobody knows his name and nobody cares and all of his family is dead

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and that's just how it is.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I just feel like eventually I'm going to be that guy 500 years in the past.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're going to be that guy.

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're going back to the past, baby.

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, you know what I mean.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I know exactly what you mean.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I feel like worrying about it is just a waste of time because it's not really, I mean,

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
there's all that talk about plugging your brain into a thing and living forever.

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't care. It's a hassle.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What the fuck is a hassle?

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't care.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I probably get annoyed with the instruction booklet and technology sucks by the time.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's like a VCR programming thing you're talking about.

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But what a hell of a fuck this. I'm not dealing with this today.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll just die in my chair.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He's getting up and plugging your brain into the machine.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll be like 90 years old and I'll already hate new technology and all the kids and everything.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll be like, why would I want to sit around with all these weirdos?

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, God, I mean, you don't want to be that technology, right?

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That would be suck. That would be the worst.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Technology's gay, so being it would make you be gay.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's like all those kids with polio who refuse to use the iron lung because they just hate a technology.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Man, fuck it. I'm not getting in that man's machine.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm going to live my own life.

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I admire those kids resolve.

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They lived and died according to their principles and I really respect that.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I got to respect that.

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They died the way they lived, not in an iron lung.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's true.

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So yeah, there's that side of the whole thing, like I'm scared of dying.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But then there's also the more annoying aspect of complaining about getting old is that there's people younger than you saying,

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
oh my God, Pokemon's 20, well, you know, Pokemon's not a good example,

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
but like something like Pokemon like, oh my God, it's 20 years old.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I feel really old.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm going to post on Facebook and get loads of sad clicks from people my age.

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's just, I hate it.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's one of those things where I only think that you should,

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
okay, like everyone has that experience.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Everyone gets old and there's no avoiding it.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There is one way to avoid it.

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, to put both in the brain.

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But the only way that you should be allowed to complain

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
is if you're actively working to combat it by researching like genetic aging

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and like, you know, if you're one of the people on the forefront trying to fix this shit.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Not everyone can do that.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, exactly.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So you should shut the fuck up about it, you know, because we all get it.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We all understand we're dying slowly.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We got both feet in the grave.

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think there's half the people that are just sort of saying it for frivolous reasons.

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
They're not thinking about death.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They're just, yeah, they just want to get...

145
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, it's relatable.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a relatable thing to say.

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's like nostalgia and all that.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I mean, it's old now.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, these sorts of things look really good on a Facebook image macro.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, if you're an idiot looking at the macro, then sure.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Have you seen that vine of like, it's like some shitty comic of a guy like tucking the sheets under his feet

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and then it's like, I sleep this way and then it cuts to the guy reading the comic

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and he's like, I do that.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And that's the funny thing.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have it, but that sounds amusing.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I've seen that a lot. I like it.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Sorry, I interrupted with my shitty anecdote.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Go on, Gib.

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know.

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Let me say, all right, I think it's Harry Potter 6 at some point.

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I think it's when it's like the attack on Hogwarts like that,

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
that shitty, that werewolf guy gray,

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
gray wind, lol, cross-reference.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Grimjaw, yeah.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, sure.

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And those two, like the Allister siblings, I think?

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know, they're there and they're attacking Dumbledore.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And I think one of them calls them old.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They're like, ah, fuck you, old man.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And they rebate him a quote from the series.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And Dumbledore is like, I forget his words,

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
but he's like, yeah, I'm old.

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You will be two one day if you're lucky.

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And it's like, shit, man, you're so right.

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And that's what it's like.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like you said, there's no getting around it.

177
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And in fact, it's way better than the alternative.

178
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So looked at through that lens, it's nothing to fear exactly.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I definitely look forward to the position of being an old man

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
who specifically can sit on his porch and yell at people.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But even aside from that, being distinguished,

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
being able to grow a beard is something I dream of doing one day.

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I assume that'll happen as I become an old man.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There's perks to being an old ass man.

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
As you get older, you look more distinguished.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Men get pretty sexy when they get old.

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So I look forward to that.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There's ancillary benefits, they do.

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Gay right now.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I have a keenly honed appreciation for the male form.

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Like no other.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I do agree though.

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Old guys, they're cool.

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Even Dumbledore looks badass.

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, because he's like in a movie, right?

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Like they made them up to look real.

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know, I don't agree with...

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay, senility is not cool, but like...

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I mean, some people, I mean...

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Alright.

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's the only thing I'm actually afraid of is like...

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What?

203
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Going senile and not being able to tell people to just kill me.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Fair.

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't want to be in a position where I'm just shitting my pants all the time.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And that's it.

207
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think a lot of people share that.

208
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When they say they don't want to, you know, they fear getting old,

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think that's probably a lot of what people are talking about.

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I wouldn't be so bad, like if I was just old and I don't know,

211
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I couldn't walk very well, that's fine.

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know, I can get over that.

213
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's just having my brain become mush.

214
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's the worst.

215
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But you know, people aren't talking about that when they post like...

216
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, I still like Pokemon, I'm so old.

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Of course, Pokemon Go has made Pokemon like hugely popular once again.

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But before that, it was like, I still like Pokemon.

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I played Pokemon Red, I feel so old, I don't know these new Pokemon.

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's, shut up.

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Shut up.

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, fuck you and appreciate the new gens,

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
or I'll come to your house and kick you in the knees.

224
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, especially...

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I really appreciate when, like, all the guys get into, like, young things.

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Like, um...

227
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Like young women? Like children?

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Is that what you're talking about?

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

230
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I got you.

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I got you.

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Little children.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What I'm talking about is, like, when they can get into technology,

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
like Steven Fry, he adopted Twitter,

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
like, really early on, and he's like a big advocate for new things.

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But then he quit it because he got mad.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, yeah, but...

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's a separate issue, yeah.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, I'm just...

240
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I want to be an old guy that's cool with new stuff,

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
but at the moment, I'm not actually cool with new stuff.

242
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So what you're telling me is...

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, I've been behind the technological curve my entire life.

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I only started using Twitter, like, this year.

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, me too.

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So, Gabe, you want to be a sexy grandpa?

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I do.

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And you want to, you get the t-shirt now,

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and you'll be ready in a hundred years.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
A hundred years.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Or whatever.

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, maybe.

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hey, yeah.

254
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm pretty good, you know?

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, I guess.

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Good medical technology is getting.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm pretty excited about...

258
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
All right, here's a tangential thing.

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
With all the...

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You know, you get in old parts of your body, stop working.

261
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
People are getting replacements.

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They've been getting hip replacements for years.

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What if, when we're old,

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
we can have the opportunity to just become a cyborg?

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Would you do it?

266
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's the Ghost in the Shell dream, man.

267
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I wouldn't put my brain into a computer,

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
but I would get an iron leg.

269
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That would be cool.

270
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, like, as opposed to dying?

271
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Would you go full ride in

272
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and just be like a brain in a fucking robot suit?

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
As opposed to death?

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Absolutely.

275
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
All right.

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Just think of the adventure.

277
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Think of the extended adventure your life becomes.

278
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Would you become a cyborg ninja with your bare ninja?

279
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There is a song by Jonathan Colton.

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It is covered by Imagine Dragons.

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's called The Future Soon, and it's a great song.

282
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I fucking love it.

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But the chorus has this line

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
that brings me to tears.

285
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's about this angry nerd,

286
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and the whole song is him fantasizing about his ideal future.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And he says,

288
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's gonna be the future soon.

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I won't always be this way

290
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
when the things that make me weak and strange

291
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
get engineered away.

292
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's a good line.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, like, holy shit.

294
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's what I want.

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Man, I could feel his insecurities

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and he's like,

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The robots are gonna fix me.

298
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
They'll improve me and make me a strong handsome boy.

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He's like hurting inside.

300
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He's putting his only escape

301
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
from his self-imposed hell that is his life

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
is this thought that maybe one day

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
science fiction will come true

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and everything will change

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and he'll be at the forefront of it.

306
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh my god.

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm quivering.

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm quivering just thinking about it.

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I like the idea of being a physical being

310
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
with a brain with robotic eyes,

311
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
robotic body, the whole thing.

312
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't like the idea of being a brain in a jar

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
hooked up to a simulation world or whatever.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, let me just play devil's advocate for it.

315
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, I'm just gonna explain my reasoning

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is because as a physical being

317
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
you can still decide to end your life

318
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
whenever you want by jumping off a cliff or whatever.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You can take your brain out and kick it.

320
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't know.

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, so you mean like being kind of like in the matrix?

322
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, I don't want to be stuck in a matrix.

323
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The year is 2167.

324
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
A renowned internet hero and cyborg,

325
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hippocrite, ends own life

326
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
by drop kicking own brain out.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's the headline.

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I've seen it writ large.

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah, on all the banners and all the top of Twitter

330
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
turning on Neo Twitter.

331
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Brain lands in nearby baby carriage

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
leading to hilarious mix up.

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a hilarious British antics.

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What's that song?

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yakety Sax.

336
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah, that's the one.

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
People just hot potatoing the brain around.

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh man, and like it would be like

339
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
the brain would be like all cute,

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
like looking around like, oh no.

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm still a brain flying around.

342
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Alright, I was gonna say though,

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
because if you think about it,

344
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
our entire existence, you know, there is a distinction,

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
but our entire existence is basically the brain in the jar.

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Because all we are is a brain hooked up to a robot

347
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
that is just our shitty human body

348
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that perceives stuff, however.

349
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And you could argue whether it's real or not.

350
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let's just assume it is and that you can end your own life.

351
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But like even in the matrix,

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
you can kill yourself and you can still end it if you want to.

353
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So I guess you're saying,

354
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
what's the issue?

355
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like if you killed yourself in a matrix,

356
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
you'd be a responder?

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Well, I don't think I remember the matrix very well,

358
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
but if there's like a thing where you're hooked up

359
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
to a computer that you know is built by people,

360
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
like I know that people built this,

361
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
that they could do stuff to me.

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Like I'd be paranoid that I know that they made something

363
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and they have complete control over my consciousness.

364
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And I don't like that.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They wanted to torture me, they could.

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How do you know you're not right now?

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We have no way of knowing.

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well, I'm not going to torture you right now.

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
My point is why worry about it.

370
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There's no way to know anyway.

371
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Fuck it.

372
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah, but the thing is, I don't know now,

373
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but like in the future,

374
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
if there is a big computer that I could hook myself into,

375
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I would know that there is a chance that they can do stuff to me.

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Right now I have no idea.

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But if I had the choice,

378
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'd rather be a robot than in a machine,

379
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
in a matrix.

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, I got you.

381
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You'd rather be a cyborg than a matrix, man.

382
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay, that's cool.

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I agree.

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Ghost Michelle, make it happen.

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think we're a little bit off topic now.

386
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We're talking about the trans symbolism and post...

387
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's not related.

388
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's the word? Post-singularity?

389
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Post-singularity was the word I was looking for.

390
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, post-cyberpocalypse is a way better word for it, though.

391
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let me...

392
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Okay, okay.

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Going back to what you said about

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
old men being sexy,

395
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
or men being sexy when they get older.

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Now, I think there are men

397
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that look good at most ages.

398
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't...

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't know.

400
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That is one of the things that does bother me

401
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
about aging is that, like,

402
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you get ugly.

403
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Not everyone, but most people get ugly.

404
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I mean, I'm...

405
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't think I'm a great look.

406
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I think I'm pretty average-looking,

407
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
so, like, I don't know.

408
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I certainly don't want to get any uglier, right?

409
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That would just be rough.

410
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That would be a death sentence, for sure.

411
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah, it would. Once I dip below,

412
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
once I dip down to the other side of the bell curve,

413
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm just done.

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And I'm right in the brink.

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't feel like young people,

416
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
because you don't look ugly now.

417
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You wouldn't become more ugly when you get wrinkles,

418
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
but people who like old people

419
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
don't mind the wrinkles.

420
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But you guys know, like,

421
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
it's not weird to people who...

422
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't know.

423
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Some people look really weird when they get old.

424
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Maybe those people were generally weird looking

425
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
all along. I don't know.

426
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Okay, but the thing is...

427
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Do you mean, like, celebrities where it's like,

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
oh, I know them as a young person,

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and now they're old and it looks weird?

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, I mean, like, people that I see on the street.

431
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I mean, like, normal people.

432
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay, all right, that's true, Ben.

433
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I see them and, you know, they look ugly or whatever.

434
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And that's fine, but, like,

435
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
it's not like that gives you an understanding

436
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
into what their life is like, because really, as you get older,

437
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
like, your appearance, honestly,

438
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
appearance really doesn't matter that much

439
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
on the grander scale things.

440
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
If you can, like, do the things you want,

441
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
you know, like, nobody's going to say,

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
like, oh, you're an ugly man,

443
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
you're an ugly old man, so, like,

444
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
your life must be shit.

445
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Well, it's not about inferior.

446
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's own...

447
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, like, two of these ugly people,

448
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
like, we're talking about older men, right?

449
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So, like, two ugly older men,

450
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I really doubt that it's that big a deal.

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Like, Rupert Murdoch.

452
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It might. It might.

453
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And he's the ugliest motherfucker in the world.

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Well, like, if you're that rich,

455
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
then probably it doesn't matter.

456
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay, maybe that's a bad example, because he is super rich,

457
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
but I just don't think it's really, it really matters that much

458
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
past certain points.

459
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't think it matters too much, either,

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
but I have a slightly different perception,

461
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
in English, and there's a thing that I've noticed.

462
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And you want to talk about ugly, the English.

463
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah.

464
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
No, no, really, it's true.

465
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The English, there's,

466
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
we have more of a tolerance for ugliness,

467
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
which is why ugly people

468
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
appear on British TV more than

469
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
they would otherwise in America.

470
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Which is why there's that stereotype

471
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
of British people having bad teeth,

472
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
because if we have bad teeth,

473
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
you know, if you're like,

474
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
you got bad teeth, but you're a good news reporter,

475
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
you still get on the news,

476
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and then Americans come over and say,

477
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
oh god, everyone in Britain's got fucked up teeth,

478
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and that's why there's that whole thing.

479
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's just because we don't care so much.

480
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I respect that.

481
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I wish everyone were like that.

482
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I wish I were more like that.

483
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I mean, yeah,

484
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I guess I'm pretty shallow.

485
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like, I don't like ugly people,

486
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
but I also hate beautiful,

487
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I also hate beautiful people.

488
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I hate everyone.

489
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, I do. Anyone who's more attractive

490
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
or less attractive than me

491
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
is just always done.

492
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
They just get out of my fucking sight.

493
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And you know, I don't want to exaggerate.

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Like, there's a point where you're beyond

495
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
what's a comfortable level of ugliness for sure.

496
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's what I mean, right?

497
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Like, if you get old,

498
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
well, I'm not even that far.

499
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't know. If you get old,

500
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and I get ugly,

501
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and I become,

502
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
you know, unlovable,

503
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't want that.

504
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I don't even think there is a level of unlovable.

505
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You can always find somebody,

506
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
even if you're like a freak.

507
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Like, it's just a marathon

508
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
of looking past. I'm talking about, Nate,

509
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm talking about bitches, Nate.

510
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm talking about hot, young sluts.

511
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I don't think

512
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
being...

513
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I mean, some girls like older guys,

514
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
but not all of them.

515
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So what I'm saying is, when you get older,

516
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I think it does limit,

517
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I think fewer...

518
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Like, not none,

519
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
but fewer girls are going to be interested in you.

520
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Like, the older you get.

521
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Wouldn't those girls also not have been interested you

522
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
when you were young because they're into older guys,

523
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
so it kind of equals out?

524
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Maybe. Maybe. I don't know.

525
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But I still think the pool gets smaller.

526
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Um...

527
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I think it'll...

528
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I've noticed this about myself.

529
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You can overpower women.

530
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You don't need to look...

531
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You can just physically overpower them.

532
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That's a good point.

533
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I just mean that,

534
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
as you get older,

535
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I felt this about myself.

536
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I just feel way more...

537
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't give a shit, because I think

538
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
that I'm a cooler guy just

539
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
by having done more stuff in my life.

540
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So I'm not really as concerned about

541
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
being able to physically impress people.

542
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I just think, I know that I can...

543
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm way cooler than these people.

544
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They are going to be interested in me.

545
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So I'm not...

546
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You're already quite physically handsome, though.

547
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I guess.

548
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Not in a gay way.

549
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You are a handsome boy, Nate.

550
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You know those things?

551
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah. Well, that's good and all.

552
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He kind of shrugs, no?

553
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, you know.

554
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's hard to respond to something like that.

555
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Because you're already attractive,

556
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
it's easy for you to say,

557
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
yeah, I don't really mind about my attractiveness.

558
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Okay, let me flip that around.

559
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
People say that to me sometimes,

560
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and it really does not

561
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
make a difference when you're out there

562
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
trying to get coups.

563
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
When you're in a club,

564
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
it does not matter

565
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
if you're in the top 10%

566
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
of attractive people in there, or whatever.

567
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
All that matters is if you get in there

568
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and do what older guys

569
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
are better at of getting

570
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
attention, lording the club.

571
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Lording the club.

572
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And whatnot.

573
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's what it's about.

574
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think being attractive

575
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
does increase your chances,

576
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
but it's not the most important thing.

577
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's a small thing.

578
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
No, there are definitely girls

579
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
who will go for you

580
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
if you are handsome

581
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
that wouldn't if you weren't good looking.

582
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
There are definitely girls like that.

583
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I would just argue that's a small number

584
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
by comparison to the people

585
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
who are just interested in meeting

586
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
an interesting individual who's fun

587
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and exciting, whatever.

588
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So my point, and the larger scale here

589
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
is just that there are benefits

590
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
to getting older that I think

591
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
kind of outweigh being younger.

592
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I do completely agree with you

593
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
that the older I get, the less of a shit I give.

594
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

595
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And that does kind of trump.

596
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That's a big one.

597
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
That does kind of trump everything else.

598
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Getting older gives you

599
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
perspective.

600
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Ironically, I worried about

601
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
getting old way more when I was young.

602
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

603
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Because back then, you thought all these...

604
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You had less perspective, so these things seemed

605
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
like a bigger deal back then, probably.

606
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Right. His part of

607
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the whole getting old thing

608
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
is a...

609
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
is a...

610
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
believing that you...

611
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
This is what I did. I didn't worry about getting old

612
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
because of death.

613
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I worried about getting old because

614
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I was not skilled enough

615
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
for my current age, and I should have been doing stuff

616
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
earlier. Oh, yeah.

617
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That's why.

618
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
If only I had... I was like this kid on YouTube

619
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
who's like five years old, and he's a really

620
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
really good guitarist.

621
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
He's like, holy shit, I'm not as good

622
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
as him. I should have been doing it from

623
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
earlier age, and now I'm fucked for the rest of my life.

624
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That's a tough one. That's a tough one.

625
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That really gets me a lot, but I tried

626
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
over the years to forget about it.

627
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Here's the thing.

628
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I have thought... I have thought

629
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
that I should be better than I am now

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
my entire life.

631
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah.

632
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
There was never a point where I was young enough

633
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
that I was like, you know,

634
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
at this age,

635
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
it's okay to be bad.

636
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
There's no... there's no being

637
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
young enough for that.

638
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You should always be better

639
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
than what you are, right?

640
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I mean, you always can be,

641
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
obviously, and there's always going to be somebody

642
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
better than you, so I guess I'm just saying

643
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
don't worry about it too much.

644
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Just do what you can do right now.

645
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I don't worry about it all that much,

646
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
but I still see people worrying about it

647
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
or just feeling like I'm not progressing

648
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
or I've waited too long and it's too late to start.

649
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's never too late to start.

650
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm not saying that because it's like it's a big old

651
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
you can do it sort of message.

652
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's just literally not... it's never too late

653
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
to start. You can learn something

654
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
like a skill at 40 years old

655
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and you can be really good at it

656
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
after 10 years.

657
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
There's another post I see that goes around

658
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
that lists like famous pieces

659
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
that were accomplished.

660
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Harrison Ford's first acting gig

661
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
was when he was in his 30s

662
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I think it wasn't Hansel.

663
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, it was Hansel.

664
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It was his first big thing.

665
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Alan Rickman's first role.

666
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
He was like

667
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
an artist

668
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
or a programmer. I don't know.

669
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
He was some totally unrelated thing.

670
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
He just totally switched careers and became an actor

671
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Wow, awesome.

672
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oprah Winfrey got fired from some

673
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
TV correspondent job

674
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
when she was like 30 something.

675
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You know, there's a whole list

676
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
of...

677
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I like that.

678
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I just turned 26

679
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and that's on the latter half of 20

680
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
so Doom begins to set in.

681
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Sure.

682
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
People comment

683
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
sometimes that I sound younger than I am

684
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
or when I say that I'm 25

685
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
or 26 now.

686
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
They'll be like, wow, you're old, dude.

687
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I did not expect her to be that old.

688
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's like, okay.

689
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Some people

690
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
thought we were teens

691
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
when they heard T-Bab.

692
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I remember when we did our Q&A

693
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
people were like, you guys are like

694
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
in your 20s, what the fuck?

695
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Well, our audience

696
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
was pretty young.

697
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
On the net balance it was pretty young

698
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
so they probably assumed we were close to their age

699
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
because we shared their shitty...

700
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
No, not because we shared their interests.

701
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Man, you know, even back then

702
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I remember never saying that I was a brony.

703
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And I, you know,

704
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I was never one of you people.

705
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Just letting you know.

706
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Just putting that out there.

707
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Anyway, let's move on.

708
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
God damn it's phone.

709
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Just destroy the phone.

710
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Ben, are you getting messages?

711
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Are those threatening messages you're receiving?

712
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
No, there's updates for his age.

713
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
He's getting older by the minute.

714
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Because, you know, guys,

715
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
we've been getting some weird messages lately

716
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
from these guys calling themselves the CMC.

717
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The Crow...

718
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The Crow Masticators, you know.

719
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
They've been...

720
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Wait, wait, the CMC?

721
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Dark Reflection.

722
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

723
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Are you sure you don't mean the Cutie Mark Crusaders?

724
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh, no.

725
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Cutie Mark Crusaders have teamed up

726
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
with a murder of crows

727
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
to undermine our whole operation.

728
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The CMC, the Crow Masticators

729
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
are a flock of vicious,

730
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
carnivorous birds.

731
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah, a murder, you might say.

732
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
A murder of crows.

733
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
They've set out to devour

734
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
our YouTube subs

735
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and our flesh.

736
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yes.

737
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And right now,

738
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
their current attempt is to just...

739
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Both of which we are rich in.

740
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, that's right.

741
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's just to ping Ben's phone mercilessly

742
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
to undermine our brilliant...

743
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me check my text.

744
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Come outside, Ben, we're hungry.

745
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
All day and all night,

746
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
this keeps up.

747
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The Crow Masticators, yeah.

748
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
One day I'll...

749
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
One day I'll get old

750
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and decrepit and slow enough

751
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
and they'll catch me and they'll be able to catch me

752
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
on the street, but for now, I'm safe.

753
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You see, that's why it's all related.

754
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
We can't get old because then the fucking crows

755
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
will devour our bodies.

756
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
All it takes is one slip up.

757
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Let your guard down for an instant.

758
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
This is PCP cannon, people.

759
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Put it on the books.

760
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Put it in the wiki.

761
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
We've got an evil...

762
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Evil alter enemy

763
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
guy, Crows.

764
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
A murder of crows, yeah.

765
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah, they are a murder of crows.

766
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That wacky CMC.

767
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Oh, and also, they're forever young.

768
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's terrible.

769
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
They found the fountain of youth.

770
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
As one crow dies,

771
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
it's simply replaced by a new crow.

772
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's a constantly...

773
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
ebbing and flowing cycle

774
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
of death that's

775
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
trying to devour us.

776
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I totally forget where we were.

777
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Goddamn it, me too.

778
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Because your goddamn poem was interrupting us.

779
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Fuck.

780
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Let me completely segue.

781
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I watched this...

782
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
show. It was a Japanese...

783
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I guess you could call it a documentary.

784
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Where this one mangaka

785
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
he, like,

786
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
puts cameras in other mangaka's

787
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
studios

788
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and films them working

789
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and then, like, a month later,

790
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
him and the other guy watch it together

791
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and, like, talk about their workflow

792
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and process and stuff. Oh, that's cool.

793
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It was very cool, but I was shocked

794
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
at how fucking old they all were.

795
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
All these... they were all...

796
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Like, the youngest guy

797
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
that I saw on there

798
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
was the guy who did

799
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
motherfucking...

800
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
or, I assume, a poon-poon.

801
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And he's, like, phone

802
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and he's...

803
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And he's, like,

804
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
35.

805
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
He's been at it for a while, though.

806
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And, like,

807
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
the guy doing the show is, like,

808
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
in his 50s and, like,

809
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
the...

810
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And he's still going at it.

811
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
They all looked really youthful.

812
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
They all looked really vigorous.

813
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, they're Asians, you know.

814
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah, maybe. But there was one guy

815
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
one episode of it

816
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
was this one, like, older guy

817
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
who did this famous thing.

818
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Gogo9?

819
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't know it.

820
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's about this assassin.

821
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
This, like, really tough assassin guy.

822
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And, all right, this guy was, like,

823
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
78, right?

824
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And he got on the show

825
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and one of the things that they talked about

826
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
were, like,

827
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
yeah, people say I don't even draw anymore

828
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
but that's totally not true.

829
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
People say,

830
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
sorry, that I only draw the eyes or whatever.

831
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And everyone's, like,

832
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
well, we'll prove them wrong with this footage.

833
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And then, okay,

834
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
all the other footage of the guy

835
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
showed them, like, working, like, you know, all day

836
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
drawing, like, page after page, right?

837
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
This guy, this 78-year-old guy,

838
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
he goes into his desk, he sits down,

839
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
he draws, like, two pictures, right?

840
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He does, like, he draws, like,

841
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
one portrait

842
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
of the main character from one of his series

843
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and one portrait of the main character from another.

844
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And that's it.

845
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And then he draws, like, a storyboard,

846
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
but it's super bare bones. It's all text, right?

847
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Like, this guy is not working

848
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
at the same rate as the other guys.

849
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And he takes these super bare bones

850
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
storyboards and he hands them off to his assistants

851
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and they give him back, like,

852
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
fully finished pages. And all he does

853
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
is he doesn't even

854
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
just draw the eyes, like the rumors say.

855
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
He just goes in and he just draws in, like, the sound effects

856
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
over the fully finished, that's, like, all he did

857
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
on the fully finished pages.

858
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So, alright.

859
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The start off being, like,

860
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
people say, I don't still draw,

861
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
but I do. And then he kind of goes in,

862
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
draws these two pictures, sort of makes a show

863
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
that he can still draw. Like, obviously, he can still do it.

864
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But then they show him actually working

865
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and he doesn't. He isn't.

866
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The rumors are completely true.

867
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
He doesn't, in fact, draw his shit, but...

868
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So what you're saying is

869
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
old people don't... In the end,

870
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
in the end, I think what the impression

871
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I came away with is that, like,

872
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
these rumors that he doesn't draw

873
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
seem to be completely true

874
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and founded, but it's

875
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
cruel to, like,

876
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
hold that against him because the guy

877
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
was, like, 78 years old.

878
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The guy had to, like,

879
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
really slow walking around.

880
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
He had to, like, take naps in the middle of drawing.

881
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Like, you know, yeah,

882
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
this guy isn't putting out work

883
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
at the same rate as these younger people.

884
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But, like, seeing him in action,

885
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
why would you expect him to, right?

886
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And, like, the guy is still

887
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
putting in... The guy is still working

888
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
to the top of his ability. I don't know.

889
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I guess... It was interesting.

890
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And I guess that brings me to,

891
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
yeah, one thing that I do worry about

892
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
with getting old is that, you know,

893
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
you're less capable and you can't do the things

894
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
that you want to do anymore.

895
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
As I recall, there's a great line that I...

896
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
This guy was definitely slowing down.

897
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Did you watch Shirobako, Ben?

898
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah. Well, yeah, yeah, I did. I did.

899
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So there's the... I didn't finish it,

900
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
but Digi has just told me this line

901
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and really made an impression on me of this old dude

902
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
who insists, and I think you talked about this a bunch, too,

903
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
who insists that you have to get fast

904
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
at drawing when you're young, because as you get older

905
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
you only get slower. So it's important

906
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
to turn that skill up.

907
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
That's the kind of line

908
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
that really gives me fucking

909
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
nightmare triggers.

910
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That's the kind of thing that someone can say

911
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
that really fucking shakes me to my very core.

912
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah.

913
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That is, like, the big thing that's, like,

914
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the antithesis to the idea that you can start

915
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
a skill whenever.

916
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Like, some things you literally can't

917
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
because of, I don't know, your hands

918
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
gets too shaky that you can't draw.

919
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But I like

920
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
to think that

921
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
as long as you, you know, try

922
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
you can be decent

923
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
enough from any age.

924
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Like, if you do start

925
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
when you're, like, a teenager,

926
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
you start doing a skill and you do it forever,

927
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
you're gonna be one of the best in the world.

928
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You're gonna be, like, one of the Beatles

929
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
or something.

930
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Even if you

931
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
say you start really late

932
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and you're slow and you never get fast,

933
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
right?

934
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That's not a death sentence.

935
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Like, some people can be slow,

936
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
but good, right?

937
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Like, some people can be successful

938
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
despite being, like, George R. R. Martin

939
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
is not a fast guy.

940
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah, right, right.

941
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Though it did take him, like, 30 years for anyone to give a shit.

942
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I mean, on a large scale.

943
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, but still.

944
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I mean, he was making a living off of it,

945
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
like, his whole life.

946
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That's true. So, I mean, really, that's, I'm sure,

947
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
his larger goal, just to be able to do it.

948
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And he did it, so, you know.

949
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
He's fake. Like, I just remember

950
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
really liking that he struggled with his speed

951
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
for a long time, and it took him

952
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
years to achieve

953
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
a speed he was comfortable with. And even then,

954
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
he didn't get as fast, ever,

955
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
as A.G., as the, like, the genius did.

956
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

957
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Crowman. Oh, my God.

958
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
The head of the CMC, the head of the

959
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Crowmasters, A.G.

960
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
from Bakuman. Oh, my God!

961
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That fucking

962
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
bitch killed that guy.

963
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, I just,

964
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm glad that the series

965
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
touched on that. It didn't really

966
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
to my satisfaction address

967
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
how he got good, other than he just kept

968
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
doing it. He just kept doing it,

969
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
which is good, and I guess probably

970
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
is all it takes. You just keep doing it.

971
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You're gonna figure out tips and tricks

972
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
to one weird old tip to draw

973
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
fast. Yeah, like,

974
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
you don't get to,

975
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
this isn't really an age thing,

976
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
but just in general, you don't get to choose

977
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
what you're good at and

978
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
what your strengths are and what capabilities

979
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
you have. Like, by doing

980
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
the work and starting things

981
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and doing things, you have to discover

982
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
them and then work around them.

983
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah, definitely true.

984
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I think one thing,

985
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
yeah, go on, go on.

986
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
One thing I've, with regards

987
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
to being slow

988
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
if you start late

989
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
or never being quite

990
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
the best ever is something

991
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
that I've always, like, I don't like

992
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
the idea of not being the best, because I'm very

993
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
competitive. I always want to be

994
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the best at everything I do, but I'm obviously

995
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
not, you know, because I don't,

996
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I try lots of different things.

997
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Well, I don't necessarily agree with that.

998
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I mean, I think you're,

999
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
at what you specifically do, I think you

1000
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
are the best, because

1001
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
only you can do exactly

1002
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
what it is you do. That's too

1003
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
your narrow definition.

1004
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
What I mean is,

1005
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
like,

1006
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I forgot.

1007
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Sorry. What I mean is

1008
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
something about

1009
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
being not good

1010
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
at all. You're saying you want to be the best.

1011
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah. Like no one ever was.

1012
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Right. No, well, okay,

1013
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
sure.

1014
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I want to be really good. I want to be the,

1015
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
jack of all trades, that's what I was going to say. I'm more

1016
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
of a jack of all trades. I do, I dip

1017
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
my fingers into a lot of different

1018
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
pots. And a lot of

1019
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
pussies.

1020
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Wow.

1021
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yes, great.

1022
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Draw that fan artist.

1023
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yeah, yeah, draw it.

1024
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So I'm good at lots of things,

1025
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
but I'm not, like, really, really good

1026
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
at one thing, which is what I want,

1027
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
because I feel like I want

1028
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
to be better than everyone in one field.

1029
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah. And there's always somebody better

1030
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
than me, and it didn't always be me.

1031
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You know, I get that.

1032
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I get, you know, people say you got to pick one thing

1033
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and be the best at it. And that's,

1034
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I understand that.

1035
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I,

1036
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I mean, I think, I think that my

1037
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
specialty was probably

1038
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
is like, you know, would be art,

1039
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and like actually like, like actual drawing

1040
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
part of the art is like the thing that I'm

1041
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
best at. But I'm not the best at it.

1042
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But I am comfortable

1043
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
with not being the best at that.

1044
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I am, I'm, what I was saying before,

1045
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I am comfortable with being

1046
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
the best at, you know,

1047
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
my own particular blend

1048
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
of, you know,

1049
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
writing

1050
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
slash drawing, slash storytelling,

1051
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
slash directing, slash humor,

1052
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
slash, you know, whatever.

1053
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I'm, I think that's all,

1054
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
that's all I want to be is just,

1055
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
you know, it's like, it's like Jesse,

1056
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
it's like Jesse always says, I'm the best

1057
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
at what I do, even if what I do isn't very cool.

1058
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I, I'm totally cool

1059
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
with being that. Yeah.

1060
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I mean, I'm not cool with that,

1061
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
because that's a boring, dumb definition

1062
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
that is useless because

1063
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
it's too specific. Well, but that's the only definition that you'll ever get

1064
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
to be the best at, so.

1065
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah, but that's dumb. You should aspire

1066
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
to greater heights to be the best.

1067
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But you're always competing with yourself.

1068
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
When I'm watching like your, your draw vlogs

1069
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Ben, I see yourself,

1070
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I see you drawing and like, and you're like,

1071
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I don't know about this, this, this

1072
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
doesn't look good. And I'm like, hmm,

1073
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I want to be a drawer guy. I want to make

1074
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
a comic just so I can say I'm better

1075
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
than you. Not because I have,

1076
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
not because I'm being

1077
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That's a fine motivation. I just, I,

1078
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
watching you work makes me want to be

1079
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
better. I don't know.

1080
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Watching anybody do anything wants me,

1081
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
wants me to feel like I,

1082
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
because I'm really competitive. I really want

1083
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
to just beat everyone all the time.

1084
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's good to watch people working hard

1085
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
at things that they want to do.

1086
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So it's, it's not like, um,

1087
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I feel like you suck

1088
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
because you don't. You're really good.

1089
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It's just, I want to

1090
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I want, I want to make a comic

1091
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
god damn it. And I know

1092
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I need a lot of practice before I can really

1093
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
do that. Back when I, no, you don't.

1094
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I don't, you don't. Just do it.

1095
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Just, I'm sorry.

1096
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'll do it. Sorry if that was

1097
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
patronizing. No, no, it wasn't.

1098
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Okay. Um, back

1099
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Speaking of patronizing, everybody

1100
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
head on over to patreon.com

1101
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
slash best guy ever. The only place

1102
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
to give me all your money.

1103
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
No, it's mine. You failed the meme.

1104
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm modifying the meme to give me the money now.

1105
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You know, you know, Nate, I heard that if you pledge

1106
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
now on best guy ever, you get

1107
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
50% off on plates and silverware at Target.

1108
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Is that true? That's, that's, I can confirm

1109
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
that that is indeed not true, but

1110
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
you can do it anyway. Oh well.

1111
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
If you go and tell them that, maybe they'll fall

1112
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
for it. Yeah, sure.

1113
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You can't afford

1114
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
me.

1115
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Viewers, you can't afford

1116
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
not to pledge or can

1117
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
you?

1118
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
A brilliant marketing strategy.

1119
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Hey, you know, I was going to

1120
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
say before, I just wanted to clarify

1121
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
that I don't think it's

1122
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
like bad or anything to

1123
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
to be the best at what you do. It's just

1124
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I also see myself as the

1125
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
best at what I do and I just

1126
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
don't find a lot of usefulness

1127
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
from that mentality just because

1128
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
like, yeah, people generally

1129
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
seem to like what I do, but I

1130
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
looking at myself, I see all the ways

1131
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
that I'm inadequate in other things

1132
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
that I need to improve on. We all do that.

1133
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
We're all thinking like, I'm great

1134
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
but I could be better than me.

1135
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I have to set my own bar

1136
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
higher. Well, I like to compare myself to

1137
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
other people in the ways that they are good

1138
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
that I want to, you know, do

1139
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
like Digi's work ethic and just his

1140
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
his rate of output is

1141
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
something that I want to achieve or, you know,

1142
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
get closer to because that's really

1143
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
important on the market of YouTube and, you know,

1144
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
just things like that are what I

1145
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
think about when I think about this stuff.

1146
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Was this on topic?

1147
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm with you. Actually, no.

1148
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Kind of. Okay.

1149
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Who cares? Well, okay, let me

1150
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
kind of segue into something that is a little

1151
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
related. I

1152
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
used to watch, like a couple years ago,

1153
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I was watching a lot of like

1154
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
drawing tutorials or like, you know,

1155
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
draw

1156
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
vlogs or things, kind of like what I'm

1157
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
making now. And

1158
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I watched this. There was one guy in particular

1159
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
named Sycra that I watched a lot

1160
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and, alright, Hippo, you said

1161
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
like when you watch my draw vlog, you feel

1162
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
like, oh, I want to be as good as

1163
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
that guy. When I watched Sycra,

1164
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
there was a bit of that, like, oh, I want

1165
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
to be this good, but it also gave me

1166
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
a sensation that was like

1167
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I am

1168
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
this good, like when I

1169
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
and at the time he was way better than me, like when I

1170
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
watched Sycra draw,

1171
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I would feel as though I was

1172
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
drawing it and I would be like, oh,

1173
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I've seen how he does it. Well,

1174
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I could do it too now. Like there's

1175
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
now like now that I've seen it, there's nothing

1176
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
to it. Yeah, that's a lot.

1177
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
A lot of it is just knowledge base and under

1178
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
when you can break down something like what's somebody

1179
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
like like Brian Leo Malley or something

1180
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and like watch him draw something and you see, oh,

1181
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
there's nothing magical about this.

1182
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
He just went through the steps like everybody else. That's

1183
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
a useful thing, I think. On the one hand,

1184
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
it's true. Like there's no trick to it.

1185
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You just do it. On the other

1186
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
hand, I was totally wrong because

1187
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
like I felt like I could go

1188
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and draw this thing because I just seem, but like

1189
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
it wasn't true. I definitely could not

1190
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
have done what he was doing

1191
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
then and probably still not now because

1192
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
that guy is really great.

1193
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But anyway,

1194
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
yeah, Sycra, now there's a guy listening to

1195
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
his life story. They told

1196
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
him he

1197
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
he's kind of like me.

1198
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
He was, I mean, he drew a little as a kid

1199
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
but then he was like, he was in, I think

1200
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
he was like 21 or 22

1201
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
when he like decided to

1202
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
he went and found like a tutor

1203
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
or like a personal art like mentor

1204
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and was like

1205
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I want to learn how to draw and be really good at

1206
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
drawing and they told him at the age

1207
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
of like 22, like you're too old.

1208
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
What a fucking bitch.

1209
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Like you've passed the prime

1210
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
time in your life to like become

1211
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
good or fast or whatever, like

1212
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
if you really want to do it, you can

1213
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
do it, but like, yeah, and he was like

1214
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I don't care.

1215
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Good friend. I think he's like

1216
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
he's probably maybe like 31 or 32

1217
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
or something like that now.

1218
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's not even old at all.

1219
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yeah, and that was earlier than me.

1220
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I mean, I drew a little bit, but I didn't really

1221
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
start taking it seriously until I was

1222
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
like 25, but I don't know.

1223
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm happy with the progress I've made

1224
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
since then. Yeah.

1225
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Getting

1226
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
never too late people, you know, like

1227
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I said, like, like

1228
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and my whole life, like even in like

1229
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
high school, I would sit down and

1230
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
sometimes I would I didn't draw that much back then

1231
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
but I would often like want to

1232
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I would like think about doing it or maybe I would

1233
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
start and then I would be like, oh, this isn't

1234
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
coming out good immediately. I give up

1235
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
you know, like in a second

1236
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and even back then

1237
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
when I was like 16, 17, I was like, man,

1238
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I could have been drawing my

1239
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
entire life. I could have been drawing since I was

1240
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
10 years old. I could be like good right now

1241
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
but I'm not. Yeah.

1242
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So, you know, I've fucked it up. I've wasted my

1243
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
time. I've wasted my potential.

1244
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Fuck it. I give up.

1245
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah, I think everybody has those feelings.

1246
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, yeah, but it ain't good.

1247
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And moreover, it's not

1248
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
true.

1249
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's not true. I don't believe that anymore.

1250
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You know, I remember when we were young and

1251
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
we were both in high school, I think, at the time

1252
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and you drew like everyone's

1253
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
D characters in this like

1254
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
particular like RPG based

1255
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
style as I call it. Yeah, on like graph

1256
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
paper. Like you're a little tiny

1257
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
like RPG maker sprite looking

1258
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
dudes. Yep. That was awesome.

1259
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And I gave them all, you know, they were

1260
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I gave them all little

1261
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
color scheme, little

1262
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
individual color schemes, like elemental themes. They were really

1263
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
simple. And then someone like

1264
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
at school, someone like

1265
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
accidentally like ripped it, like

1266
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
like it got like a rip in it because like

1267
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
someone like was being careless with it.

1268
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And I was like, and I was like,

1269
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
dude, you just rip my drawing

1270
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and he and he looked at it.

1271
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah, this was not a guy I respected,

1272
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
by the way, his opinion did not did not

1273
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
hold much weight for me, but he he

1274
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
he got defensive about it. He tried

1275
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
to like play it off like, oh, it's not a big deal.

1276
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Why are you mad? I didn't do anything wrong. And he was like,

1277
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
dude, do you know how easy that would be to

1278
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
draw? Well, I wasn't

1279
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
even mad. I was just like

1280
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I didn't say this at the time because

1281
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I had no idea how to respond to this, but like,

1282
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
yeah, I do because

1283
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I drew it and like, sure

1284
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
it's simple, but like I spent time on

1285
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
it. You ding it. There was

1286
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
like 12 characters on there, like 10 of them

1287
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
or something. I wasn't it was

1288
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
so stupid. It was such a stupid thing

1289
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
to say that it didn't even make me mad. I

1290
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
was just like, how can he

1291
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
that there's how that's a guy

1292
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
right there without a creative bone

1293
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
in his body or at least not thinking about it

1294
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
in those ways. I don't know. He was

1295
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
thinking back. He was deaf. He was definitely

1296
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
like making sort of a knee jerk

1297
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
reflexive defensive thing, like

1298
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
trying to deflect.

1299
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
At that moment, he wasn't thinking about

1300
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
what it means to be a creator. So fuck that guy.

1301
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Oh, definitely not.

1302
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Do you know

1303
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
how easy that would be to draw? Yes, I do

1304
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
actually.

1305
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
There's a sort of

1306
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
a related thing

1307
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
in that

1308
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
the not not finishing

1309
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
projects is something that I've struggled

1310
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
with a lot. Oh, man.

1311
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Not finishing projects.

1312
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
But I feel like a lot

1313
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
of the time, the projects that

1314
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I wouldn't have done much with anyway, like

1315
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
when I did that homestuck

1316
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
fan comic. Yeah.

1317
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I was going to have the whole of the horseshoe

1318
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
crew as characters and do a whole

1319
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
thing. But then I realized

1320
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
why would I spend so much time doing a homestuck

1321
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
comic when I could just make a real

1322
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
comic. Yeah, fair point.

1323
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Agreed. As much as I hate

1324
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
unfinished shit,

1325
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
there's probably better things

1326
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
you could be doing. Though not to discourage

1327
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
people from, like, if you're starting from zero,

1328
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
go for it. Like, take your time

1329
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and go ahead and do that shit. Like, I mean, I

1330
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
did, like, that illustrated homestuck

1331
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
RP, Spurg, and

1332
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I spent, like, it went on for like

1333
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
two years. But I stuck

1334
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
with it and I fucking, because

1335
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I had put so much effort into it

1336
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
by the, by the end

1337
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I was like, I can't give up.

1338
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I have to finish it. And it was

1339
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
wicked hard. I really had to fucking

1340
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
kick myself to do it, but I finally did.

1341
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And, and it's good.

1342
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Um, Jeff.

1343
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Finishing things is so important.

1344
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Finishing things is, is, it

1345
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
makes you feel good, you know, even if it's not

1346
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
very, like a, like, I've,

1347
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I've had multimedia fusion too, which is

1348
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
like a video game creation

1349
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
application thing. And I've

1350
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
made tons of games.

1351
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
One or two that I actually finished

1352
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and hundreds that are just like,

1353
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
we've never seen any of those, man. I want to see

1354
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
them. Yeah. If I, if there was a good way

1355
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
to record them and if I could find them

1356
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
then yes, I'll try and do, I kind

1357
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
of want to make a, a hypocrite video about

1358
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
them. Yeah. Great. I'd love that.

1359
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yeah. But yeah, I've, I've

1360
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
done loads of things. I've tried writing

1361
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
songs. I've recorded like hundreds, well

1362
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
not hundreds, but like lots of songs,

1363
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
lots of different guitarists, never any

1364
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
lyrics. But the things

1365
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I have completed, like that one album I

1366
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
did when I was sick, I, I stuck with it.

1367
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I made a song every day

1368
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
for seven days until I got better,

1369
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
which just so happened to be an exact

1370
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
week and, and ended on this day

1371
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Homestuck ended, which was weird. Oh yeah.

1372
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And I liked that album and I went and fucking bought

1373
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
it. I bought your album. Something I

1374
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
have never done is buy an

1375
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
album, but I bought your fucking album

1376
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
hippo. And it was worth it.

1377
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
On bandcamp.com

1378
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
slash Hippocrite or something. Yes.

1379
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Yeah, but

1380
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
that, that album, because it was finished,

1381
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
it's like, I like it, even

1382
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
though some of the songs are kind of whatever.

1383
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Yeah. It's cool. Yeah, it's great.

1384
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I mean, like,

1385
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
you're never going to, you're never going to be totally

1386
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
happy with the work of art, but

1387
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
it's fine, right?

1388
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Like, you still, you still got to finish it.

1389
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I think the first real creative

1390
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
endeavor I did was in college

1391
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
when me and my buddy Rich, just

1392
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
you know, we, we both wanted to make video games.

1393
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
We were programming guys. We just decided

1394
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
to make one. And we

1395
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
just spent the next year slowly chipping

1396
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
away at this RPG maker

1397
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
like puzzle drama

1398
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
kind of game. And we finished it.

1399
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It's called Bell. Man, I bet I have

1400
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
a download link. I could probably put it in the fucking

1401
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
description of this if I can get that shit. You know, I never

1402
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
actually finished it. It's really

1403
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
hard. It's really hard and like

1404
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
not super clear. But we made

1405
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
it that way on purpose. I would have played that game again though.

1406
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Oh yeah, I did some sprites for that, didn't I?

1407
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You sure did. You made like a blanket that was

1408
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
folded on itself and like I think like a paper

1409
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
plane or something. Yeah, you made stuff. And Grace

1410
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
our sister made some shit for that

1411
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
and me and Rich worked on it for a million fucking years.

1412
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
She like painted the backgrounds, right?

1413
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
She made some art

1414
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
that there was like cut scene art that's

1415
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
not so great. But I remember

1416
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
thinking it was not that good. No offense to you, Grace.

1417
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's not very good. It's not

1418
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
She's done, she's drawn way better

1419
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
stuff. She's much better now. Yeah, this is

1420
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
this was years ago. But yeah, like

1421
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
just the fact that it's done, I've got a finished

1422
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
game that's just out there that people

1423
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
have played, you know, not many of them and it's not

1424
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
great, but it's constantly

1425
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
giving me a source of joy from like ever since

1426
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
it's been done for the last like eight years. So

1427
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
you know, it's not eight years.

1428
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Oh, maybe like six.

1429
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
We did that sophomore year

1430
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
of college and it's been like, that's

1431
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
like six, probably six years, maybe five.

1432
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That does not feel

1433
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
like it was six years ago that I drew this.

1434
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah, I know. Well, oh,

1435
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I feel so old now.

1436
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
There it is.

1437
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Yeah, we're way off topic, but

1438
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
while we're on this on subject of finishing

1439
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
things, I have two things to say. One,

1440
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I think that finishing things,

1441
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
just the act of finishing things

1442
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
is a skill in and of itself

1443
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
and you need to practice it

1444
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
by finishing things, even if they're bad.

1445
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Finishing them is important just

1446
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
to fucking get

1447
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
just to, you know, get experience points

1448
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
to put into your finishing things skill

1449
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
because finishing things is the most

1450
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
important thing. Because if the experience points don't go

1451
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
to that, they go to the giving up on

1452
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
shit skill and you don't want to train that

1453
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
too much. Yeah.

1454
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
They're learned. They're both learned. Giving up

1455
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and finishing things are both learned behaviors

1456
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and you need to practice.

1457
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You got to like, like your brain is plastic,

1458
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
right? Like the more you do a thing,

1459
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
the more your brain synapses reroute

1460
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
themselves to like more easily

1461
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
like route you towards doing

1462
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
that same thing. Yep. So like the more

1463
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
you do a thing, the more you're

1464
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
going to be inclined to do that

1465
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
same thing. So you need to not give up.

1466
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You know what it's like? You need to finish a thing

1467
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
in order to change your brain.

1468
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Life is an RPG

1469
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
and like most RPGs, it's hard

1470
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
to reallocate your stats.

1471
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Specifically, it's like Final Fantasy 6

1472
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
where you've got the chicken knife

1473
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
and the brave sword and when you run

1474
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
from battle, when you run from battles

1475
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
your chicken knife gets way more powerful

1476
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and that's giving up. But if you stay

1477
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and fight every battle, your brave sword

1478
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
never gets less powerful and it stays

1479
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
one of the best weapons in the game

1480
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and that's finishing stuff. So don't run

1481
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
away from battles, people. Don't raise that

1482
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
chicken knife, even though in the game the chicken knife

1483
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
is way more powerful potentially. Keep your

1484
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
brave sword strong. It's not a perfect

1485
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
metaphor. It's not a perfect metaphor.

1486
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's a terrible one. It's in fact the worst

1487
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
metaphor. It's the exact opposite.

1488
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Alright. Wait, wait, there's one more thing

1489
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I want to say about that. The reason why

1490
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
you've got to learn to finish things is

1491
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
because finishing things is the most important

1492
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
because as Brian Leo Malley, creator

1493
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
of Scott Pilgrim once said on his

1494
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Tumblr or something

1495
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
or something, he said

1496
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
anything finished

1497
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
is better than anything unfinished.

1498
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Like no matter how bad a

1499
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
thing is, if you finish it

1500
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
it's something. If you don't

1501
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
finish it, no matter how good it could

1502
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
have been, it's only potential.

1503
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's nothing. It's garbage. I like that

1504
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
message. Yeah. If you don't

1505
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
finish a thing, it's garbage.

1506
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
If you do finish it, it's

1507
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
at least a non-zero value.

1508
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
You've at least created something.

1509
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So that's the most important thing.

1510
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Thanks, Brian Leo Malley.

1511
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
That quote is really stuck

1512
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
with me ever since I read it. I don't

1513
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
know, however many years ago.

1514
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's so important. I'm going to go make a comic

1515
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
after this. I'm going to make it. It's going to be

1516
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
10 page comic. That's my goal.

1517
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
That's your goal. That's a good goal.

1518
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
We could probably do that in a week.

1519
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The page is going to be one pixel

1520
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
wide.

1521
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You could do that in one minute.

1522
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
You broke the system.

1523
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Well, that's good, Gib. Yes.

1524
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Do that.

1525
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
After you both finish the project

1526
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
that we're working on aside from this shit.

1527
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Do that first. Actually, we can't do it

1528
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
until Ben does this shit, but whatever.

1529
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I will do my shit. We're so

1530
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
off topic. We haven't

1531
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
even been talking about it. It's sort of an inevitable

1532
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
sort of thing from

1533
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
complaining about getting old.

1534
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
In itself,

1535
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
people who complain about getting old, that

1536
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
is not really much of a topic.

1537
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I don't like when they do that.

1538
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's silly. I've got so much more to look

1539
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
forward to. You shouldn't be sad.

1540
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yeah.

1541
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
When I was

1542
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
where you were

1543
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
saying before, Hippo, about

1544
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
comparing yourself to people's

1545
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
ages and being, oh, this person

1546
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
was this far along when they did this.

1547
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I should be doing that at that age too.

1548
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Like Brian Leomali,

1549
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I think he was like 22

1550
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
when he did

1551
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Lost at Sea, his

1552
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
first full paperback that nobody fucking remembers.

1553
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And then I think he was

1554
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
doing Scott Pilgrim between the ages of

1555
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
like 23 and 27

1556
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
or 8

1557
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
or 29 or something like that.

1558
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So, I don't know. Think about that guy.

1559
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I mean, that guy had been drawing comics

1560
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
since he was a little kid, but not anything

1561
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
like publishable. And he'd only

1562
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
really been working in the field.

1563
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I don't know, maybe when he was like 20 or something.

1564
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
He was doing a little bit for some website or something.

1565
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So, I don't know.

1566
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I mean, Andrew Hussey. Andrew Hussey had been

1567
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
drawing for years

1568
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
and years. I mean, I think all of his old

1569
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
black and white comics, like I think he did

1570
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
whistles in his late 20s and I think

1571
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
maybe he was doing things like

1572
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
a steep price for

1573
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
pie and like humanimals he was doing

1574
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
maybe his early 20s and I think

1575
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I think he was maybe late 20s

1576
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
when he did problem sleuth and I think

1577
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
he was, I think he's maybe like 34

1578
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
now. So, oh my god, I guess

1579
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
he was, wait, maybe I have this all shifted

1580
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
because I guess maybe he started

1581
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
home stuck when he was like late 20s

1582
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
or something. Well, do you know how old he is?

1583
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah, the guy. He's like 7 years old.

1584
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah, so I guess

1585
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I mean, I think he's like 33 or 35

1586
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
right now. So, I don't know. So, he probably started

1587
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
home stuck when he was about my age.

1588
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Although, I mean, he had been doing a lot of other stuff

1589
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
before. Oh my god, jeez, that's

1590
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
shit. He's, shit, he's younger than I thought.

1591
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
God damn it.

1592
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah, but we can't, you know,

1593
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
we can't let everybody else who's older than

1594
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
you when they started. So, you know, I'll just

1595
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
think about that like, I'll just think about

1596
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
that the 50 year old guy who was doing

1597
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
that manga documentary.

1598
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
By the way, that documentary about the

1599
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
mangaka is called, it's called

1600
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
manben, M-A-N-B-E-N

1601
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
and you can find it on Dailymotion.

1602
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
There's like 7 episodes, I think.

1603
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
That's cool.

1604
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The best one is about the Oyasumi

1605
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Poon Poon guy. And it's like,

1606
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I don't know, the guy

1607
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
the 50 year old guy who's

1608
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
a host who's like, he's still totally

1609
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
active in the field. He's totally, you know,

1610
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
vibrant and vigorous and working away.

1611
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
He like talks to this like 35 year old

1612
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
guy like, oh, you know, you're a young guy.

1613
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
You're like part of the new guard. I'm like, that guy's

1614
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
like 10 years older than me. Awesome.

1615
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I can still be, I can

1616
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
still be like a, I can still be

1617
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
like a young, like, you know,

1618
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
part of the new guard

1619
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
when I'm like 35.

1620
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Like that's normal. Cause like I'm saying,

1621
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
no matter what age you are, you're young

1622
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
compared to those older than you. You know what I always thought was weird?

1623
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You know how Blackbeard

1624
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
in One Piece is like an old ass bitch

1625
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
and yet he's part of the worst

1626
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
he's like a new hot pirate

1627
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
despite being an old ass man.

1628
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That's inspiring to me. He's like the most

1629
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
powerful man in the world and he's an old ass bitch.

1630
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
He's, he's, he's older.

1631
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Well, no, I think some of the other

1632
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
supernovas are kind of old.

1633
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Like Uruj, he's kind of, you know,

1634
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
30s. Yeah, like, like

1635
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
what's, what's the gang beach

1636
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
is like. Capone gay. Oh, that's true.

1637
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Capone gang is pretty old. I think Drake

1638
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
is probably in his 30s or something, whatever.

1639
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah. Um, yeah.

1640
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Like it doesn't matter what age

1641
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
you are really. Yeah. Like their age doesn't

1642
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
matter. It's the fact that they became relevant

1643
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
at that time.

1644
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And like, you know, like, we're saying before, with like Harrison

1645
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Ford and, and the guy from

1646
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Die Hard, Alan Rickman.

1647
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Bruce Willis. Oh, no, yeah.

1648
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
No, and Alan Rickman. But he started kind of late, too.

1649
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But whatever. He did, yeah.

1650
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You can, you can,

1651
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
it's never too late

1652
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
and people can become relevant

1653
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
at any stage of life. It happens,

1654
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
you know. Like sometimes

1655
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
you might think, you might think

1656
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
that just because you're not where you want to be,

1657
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
you know, creatively

1658
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,800
financially or you know relationship wise or in any aspect of life you might

1659
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,600
think you're not where you want to be at whatever age you're at but like you know

1660
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,440
I'd say it's pretty safe no matter what age you are it's pretty safe bet that

1661
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,520
someone has succeeded later then yeah say once you pass age a hundred you can

1662
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,640
probably say well then you can get some yeah then you can give up but at least

1663
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,280
you're gonna agree news and you're gonna get a letter from the Queen and it's

1664
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,960
gonna be interesting do you get a letter from the Queen when you turn a hundred

1665
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:50,160
yeah whoa you got right why doesn't Obama send send me a letter from the

1666
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:58,160
queen yeah yeah I know I don't want Obama I want Obama to just ask the

1667
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:04,480
Queen for one yeah that'd be nice yeah all right I think we've wrapped it up in

1668
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,000
a nice little Queenly bow here but do we have any does that do we have anything

1669
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,080
else to say on the subject of being an old-ass bitch I think I said my piece I

1670
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:19,080
don't think I'm gonna be old like and I don't think I'm gonna consider myself

1671
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:25,600
old until I'm 60 until then I'm just a guy yeah I mean you know you could start

1672
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,920
I'd start worrying about it at like 50 then you can start to think about it but

1673
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,920
don't really worry about to your 70 70 is the bridge to real you know you can

1674
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,520
worry about shit that that older mangaka who was getting slow and who was

1675
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,840
like past his prime he was like 78 whereas like these guys in like their

1676
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,880
50s and even like this other lady who was 60 something they were still chugging

1677
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,320
away yeah they're fine exact doing exactly what they wanted to do with their

1678
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,520
life and like you're doing what you want to do you're you're as young as you

1679
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,920
need to be mm-hmm there's one thing from the movie up that sort of struck a cord

1680
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,600
with me is that the the kid watching that guy the pilot guy or the explorer

1681
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:09,040
the explorer guy was like in his 20s or something and the kid you know I forget

1682
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:14,400
his name oh yeah and then it cut at the beginning forward yeah and he's like

1683
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,960
he's 60 or something and the guy the explorer is still out there he's like

1684
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,080
he's in his 80s yeah but they're both considered old but like that's like a

1685
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,720
20 year difference that's a lot of years yeah the guy still be doing things yeah

1686
