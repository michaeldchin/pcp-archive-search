00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello, and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,320
Happy to have you with us once again, I'm GuyTheBestGuyEver, your anime dude, and I'm

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,360
here with a bunch of internet people that I know.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
First up, Digibro.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,400
Hey, what's up buddy?

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,920
Jesse Wood.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,920
Hello.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Hippocrit.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
That's what I was gonna do.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,800
That's gonna just say hello.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,720
Well you goofed it up, and Geoff from Mother's Basement.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,000
Money, money, money, money, money, motherfucker.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,720
Booty rocking everywhere, yeah, all right, excellent, okay everybody, so this week's

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:43,560
topic is something that has been an incredibly contentious issue amongst us, and probably

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,200
the rest of the world, since the dawn of time, to be honest.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,600
I got my switchblade ready.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
It really has.

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
Since the dawn of theater, we'll say.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
That fair.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,200
And to cut straight to it, it is remakes, re-fucking-makes.

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Do you like them?

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Are they useful?

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Do they help?

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,760
Do they expose people to a thing that they wouldn't have seen otherwise?

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,680
Do they pollute the original identity of that work?

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,160
That's the stuff we're gonna talk about, and to start us off, I'm just gonna read the

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,640
Urban Dictionary definition of a remake, as I do so often.

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Okay, there's, what is this?

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
This is shit.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
You didn't read it first.

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
It just has lists of what it remakes.

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
I did not read it first.

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,360
He's just like, oh this'll be fine.

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,360
I did read the Remakeful one, which is something else that'll be relevant here.

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
You know what?

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,920
We need to define remakes anyways in extensive terms without using this, because we talked

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,480
about this a little bit pre-game the other day, and I was saying we need to really clearly

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,480
get to the heart of what we mean, because you seem to think that re-imaginings don't

39
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,520
count as remakes.

40
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,600
Like there's remakes, there's re-imaginings, and there's also adaptations of things, like

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,680
different adaptations of the same source material.

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,680
There's so many different, yeah, and there's these remakes things, like Crisis Core that

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,920
like adds extra shit, and kind of, you know, whatever.

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,040
But yeah, there's a bunch of different things.

45
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,920
So we really, like this discussion is about what each of those things are, if they're

46
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,320
good or bad, and then I'm sure there'll be disagreement in there, so let's, you know.

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,920
But they're not, this is important, is remasters, which is something else.

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,800
Sure, right, like the wonderful Final Fantasy IX remaster that's coming out soon.

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,680
Have you seen those fucking backgrounds?

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
Who has seen them?

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,520
Holy shit, is there a worse piece of garbage I've ever seen in my entire life?

52
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,080
Is it a worse piece of garbage than the Final Fantasy VI remaster?

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
I can't imagine, yes, it literally is, because it's the old looking, actually the models

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,520
look good in the Final Fantasy IX, but the backgrounds are these disgusting, J-pegged

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,240
pieces of shit that not only look bad, but they make the characters on top look like

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,760
fucking 3D models walking on top of a board, in a board game.

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,280
It is the most, oh, it's horrible.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,040
It looks like a 144p image that's just been blown up to 1080p, which I'm sure is what

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
they did.

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,920
Why would they not like do what the Resident Evil remake, or the Resident Evil HD thing

61
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,320
did, and upscale the fucking 3D models?

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I guess they lost them out.

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,360
They have, even on the original PlayStation 1, I guess the backgrounds were downscaled

64
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,480
a bit to fit onto it, and I found out that they have the original high res versions before

65
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
they were ever downscaled.

66
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Yeah, because they're posting them around.

67
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
We've seen them.

68
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
But they're not using them.

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
It doesn't make any sense.

70
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
They took the laziest part.

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay, but you know what?

72
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,640
We didn't even really need to go into that too much, because that's like a remaster,

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,960
or just a re-release, which I'm generally okay with.

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120
HD re-releases.

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
We are not counting as remakes.

76
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,160
We are not counting re-adaptations of the same source material.

77
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:57,520
So if you say, for instance, Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid, we're not counting

78
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,440
that it's been made into a thousand different movies, because they're all adaptations of

79
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,200
the book, but they're not remakes of each other.

80
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,440
Anything that's public domain can necessarily be called a remake.

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Well, okay.

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
That's sort of my go-to rule.

83
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,520
And this falls under that, so that's fine.

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,560
So we're not counting King Kong by Peter Jackson?

85
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
No, definitely not.

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
Well, I think we could, because I think it's a remake within this.

87
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,760
I think a remake should be anything that's within the same medium telling the same story,

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
right?

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,320
Like, King Kong was originally a film, and it was remade to be an updated version of

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
that film.

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,040
It's the same exact story.

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,520
You know, I mean, they added some shit to it and modernized it, but it is deliberately

93
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,360
a remake of that film, but for an audience of 90 years later.

94
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,320
It is entirely a case-by-case issue, and you kind of have to study each one to know whether

95
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
or not it counts.

96
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,520
I've never seen the new, I haven't seen any King Kong movie ever, actually, so I'll defer

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,080
to you where that one's concerned.

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,720
But I think it'll be pretty obvious, and we all have examples of things that we think

99
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,120
are okay or aren't okay, and then are remakes or they're not.

100
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,560
Well, I want to say, like, okay, because with Little Mermaid or something, you know, there's

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,640
been a bunch of different adaptations, but I think it's pretty clear they all are there.

102
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,920
Like, Ponyo is an adaptation of The Little Mermaid.

103
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,400
It is not an adaptation, it's not a remake of the Disney movie, it's an adaptation of

104
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
the book.

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,960
But if you took, like, Dracula, where the original book was made into a film, and then

106
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,800
there's like a remake of that exact film, I think that would count as a remake.

107
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Or the new Wolfman movie, which is just the horror, the Hammer Horror movie.

108
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,640
They made a lot of Hammer Horror movies.

109
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,920
It's when you take something that's like a classic movie, and you say something, this

110
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,000
is like the heart of the issue, and you say, you know what, modern day audiences cannot

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
appreciate this.

112
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,600
We need to update it so that people will be able to watch it, because that's what's

113
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
necessary.

114
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:01,000
I think the defining characteristic of a remake is that it is something that is specifically

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,200
using the original as a basis for advertising or marketing itself.

116
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,760
Yeah, yeah, I think so, a lot of the times.

117
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,440
Watch the new Friday the 13th, because everyone loves the old Friday the 13th.

118
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,680
And you know what kind of is related to it, is like continuing a series that's been dead

119
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,600
for a long time, and deciding to resurrect it, and just like pick up from where, the

120
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,120
reboots are related, but not exactly the same, so pro reboot.

121
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,400
Re reboot is the greatest CG TV show of all time, but I do think you're making some uncharitable

122
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,280
assumptions about why remakes are sometimes made, because you're saying like they're made

123
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,080
because they think that people can't appreciate the original, which is certainly true in a

124
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,040
lot of cases, like the shot by shot remake of Psycho, which basically is just done.

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Psycho and Schuller.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,520
Like I watch Psycho, that movie is fucking great.

127
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
There's no need.

128
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,560
There is no need to do it for that reason, but for the reason of like reinterpreting

129
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,680
it through a new lens, or giving it to a new director to try their own interpretation of

130
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,600
that style, or that storyline.

131
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,700
I want to ask though, what exactly are they reinterpreting?

132
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,800
Is it the movie, or is it like the script?

133
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,360
Because I think that's an important distinction.

134
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,960
Sometimes it's the script, and sometimes it's like the movie itself, or the plot beats.

135
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,320
Is it even possible for someone else to redo a movie that was like the product of multiple

136
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,720
people's creativity working together?

137
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,520
Can you ever really call something like that a remake?

138
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,160
Is that even...

139
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,200
I think that in certain cases you definitely can.

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,080
My go-to example from like recent times, because I think we can agree that most horror

141
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,920
movie remakes are terrible.

142
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm not a horror movie expert, but that seems to be the consensus.

143
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,600
Yeah, so like the new remake of Poltergeist, shit, the new remakes, like the new Friday

144
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,720
the 13 remake, shit, the new Halloween remake, shit.

145
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,760
Most horror movie remakes are shit, but the Evil Dead remake is fucking great.

146
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,520
I was gonna say how great that movie is.

147
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,440
And like the thing is that it takes the same plot beats as the original Evil Dead movie,

148
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,200
and remixes them with some interesting new ideas as to who these characters are and sort

149
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,560
of what they're doing.

150
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,320
It adds a few modern things, like the reason that they're not leaving the cabin initially

151
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,120
isn't because they're idiots, it's because the only character who actually knows what's

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,980
going on happens to be detoxing from a meth addiction, and nobody believes her when she

153
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,640
says demons are coming out of the walls because, I mean of course you think demons are coming

154
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,240
out of the walls, you're coming not off of meth.

155
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,480
But the thing about the Evil Dead remake, I think a huge part of why it was good, is

156
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,760
because Sam Raimi was like heavily involved with it, as a producer for sure.

157
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,560
I want to bring up that subject, okay, like the, I think that the best way for a remake

158
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,800
to happen, because like with remakes I think a lot of the times it is like you know a cash

159
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,000
grab on something that was popular, but I think that if the original had something to

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,400
be improved upon, like even, like it's consensus that at the time it was already needed, like

161
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,680
I think with something like Final Fantasy 7, which I know is, okay because this is the

162
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,560
big one, that's the big one, that's what we're ultimately getting to, but I'm not going to

163
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,360
talk about it too much at this point, because I know we're going to get to Final Fantasy

164
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,360
7, but let's build it up at that point.

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,800
But the thing about Final Fantasy 7 is when it came out, it was not perceived as flawed,

166
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
right?

167
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,600
It only became that after trends in games became something different, where now people

168
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,720
took a while to parse it, I think.

169
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,040
I don't think people play turn-based RPGs anymore, and that's why they think they need

170
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,400
to remake it, right, because they think it's old, it's an old-fashioned style, but when

171
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
it came out-

172
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Which if you ask me is an entirely forced upon opinion, is that real?

173
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Stop, let me finish, guys.

174
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,960
Let me finish my fucking point.

175
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,480
My point is simply that at the time that Final Fantasy 7 came out, those were not flaws.

176
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,560
The turn-based battle system was not a flaw, people didn't perceive it that way, but when

177
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,520
something like Evil Dead came out, it had obvious flaws for the medium even at the time,

178
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,760
where it was a low-budget movie with cheesy effects, with a story that didn't necessarily

179
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
make sense.

180
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,840
That was the charm of the movie, and some people like it for those reasons, but I think

181
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,920
that the idea of remaking Evil Dead is like, well, yeah, it wasn't perfect, so why not

182
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
try to make another version?

183
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,920
And so they did that specifically with Evil Dead, the Evil Dead 2 or whatever is basically

184
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,240
a remake, but I'd call that a reimagining, and here's the thing with all this stuff.

185
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,040
My big issue at the end of the day, if there was infinite time, infinite money, infinite

186
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,360
resources, I'd say make all the remakes you want to an extent, I've got some issues with

187
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,800
it, but if that's how it is, then fine.

188
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,520
My real issue is if it's worth taking the time to specifically invest your resources

189
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,360
in remaking something when you could just be making something new.

190
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,400
But let's not even get too much into that, because with the Evil Dead example, the first

191
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,480
one and the second one are similar, it's the same story, but it's a reimagining at

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
its core.

193
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,440
It's a totally different movie, and I think that does justify it.

194
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,840
I don't think that that's something that isn't worth making, because there was definitely

195
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,520
something creative going on there, and that's really why it's a case-by-case thing, whether

196
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
or not it's okay.

197
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,680
Yeah, yeah, because the original Evil Dead and moreover Evil Dead 2, the original Evil

198
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,280
Dead definitely not a flawless movie, but at the same time, it's one of the few movies

199
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:08,280
that has 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is kind of crazy.

200
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Everybody loved the movie, even though it was iffy in a lot of spots.

201
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,480
And you're talking about Evil Dead 1?

202
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:24,840
Evil Dead 2 has like a 97%, it was more contentious, because Evil Dead 2 goes for a lot of balls

203
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
of your stuff.

204
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,200
Evil Dead 2 is one of my favorite movies of all time.

205
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,960
I'd say that's vastly superior to Evil Dead 1 personally.

206
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,280
It's much funnier.

207
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,840
Evil Dead 1 is more enjoyable in that campy way, and the Evil Dead remake is a more straight

208
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:47,400
horror movie that is not going for the campiness, and then if you want more of that campiness,

209
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,720
you can actually get it from Ash vs Evil Dead, the new TV show that they made, which I will

210
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,720
not stop championing, because that TV show, it's got Bruce Campbell in it, it's directed

211
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:06,440
and produced by Sam Raimi, so it's actually like a legit sequel to the Evil Dead 2, and

212
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,520
it's fucking amazing, but I'm getting off the topic here.

213
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:19,600
I think to bring it back a little bit, the whole reimagining thing, and to answer Nate's

214
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,960
question about why it's worth it to remake something, I get, yeah, we want to have more

215
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,440
original ideas, but I think there's also some value in trying to make the best possible

216
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:40,920
version, and the problem is that it's really debatable if you can, because Avangelion is

217
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,680
a great example, where it came out in the 90s, and it was this huge cultural touchstone,

218
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,720
which pretty much created the idea of original TV anime, had this unbelievably deep and

219
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,080
involving story with this great directing, but no matter how you look at it, the production

220
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,520
falls apart in the second half, and the impetus to remake it, now that it made a lot of money,

221
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,880
to me seems obvious, like yeah, the show is already a huge success, and it's already

222
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
something that everyone...

223
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,240
Look at the consequences of that urge, Ana's like, what is going on over there?

224
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000
It's a nightmare, it's taken like what, 10 years to make these movies, and they're

225
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,400
not even close to done?

226
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
What the hell?

227
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,600
What a waste, what a fucking waste.

228
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,800
They still haven't gotten to the part that actually needed fixing, which was the last

229
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
half.

230
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,120
The funny thing about it is that it's so different now, that it's more of a sequel anyways.

231
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,560
Yeah, there's another huge issue in there, which is like everything is different in

232
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,840
a shitty way, like every change they make I think is vastly worse than the original,

233
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,960
and like, if they just hadn't done it, I'd be happy as a clam, I would've been fucking

234
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
over the moon.

235
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,400
It's definitely a weird case, because again, the impetus is obvious, just do the same thing,

236
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,240
make it look better, but then obviously they didn't want to do the same thing because they

237
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,440
wanted to make something different, but the same, it's odd to try to parse, and you could

238
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,980
say that it's worth it to have both versions, and maybe the new one has different meanings

239
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,480
that you could also get out of it, but then it just becomes a question of like, why did

240
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,240
it have to be Ava, you know, why, right, exactly.

241
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,880
I think the iffy thing with that is that it's the same director trying to make the same,

242
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,880
like the same thing twice, and improve upon his own previous work, and I think that that's

243
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:45,200
a less valuable type of remake than a new director approaching something that they love

244
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
and trying to turn that into-

245
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll say, I actually honestly, and I couldn't prove this without doing more research into

246
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,840
it, I don't think Anno is as much the director of those movies as people think, Anno's always

247
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
listed as like-

248
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
It doesn't seem that way.

249
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,880
He's always listed as chief director and stuff, but like, Kazuyo Tsurumaki, his understudy,

250
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,320
he's always listed as director, he hasn't done anything else in the time they've been

251
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,680
working on Rebuild, and his style, he's the one who directed, you know, FLCL and Gunbuster,

252
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,840
I mean, Diebuster rather, and like, the new Ava movies feel more like him, and they're

253
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
also-

254
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Right, they feel totally Diebuster-y.

255
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,760
Yeah, and the guy who directed Gankutsuo is also Mahiro Maeda, it's like a big part

256
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,480
of directing the newer ones, like especially part three, so like, I think there's a lot,

257
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,680
I think there's like an understated amount of Kazuyo Tsurumaki and Mahiro Maeda like,

258
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,400
really pulling the unique voice of these movies out, and that's why it doesn't quite feel-

259
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,040
Cause like, Anno's directing, if you watch anything he's made, it's all very slow, very

260
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,000
like, methodical, you know, like there's big moments, but they're always like scary,

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,920
and there's none of the like, big, bombastic, crazy thing that happens in the second movie,

262
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,360
you know, when like, the Ava transforms into this other thing, and like, Shinji's a badass,

263
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,080
and it's like, this feels very uh, like, Tsurumaki-y, those things were cool, those things were

264
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,560
definitely super badass, but at the Ava, is it, is it the point, is this what we're supposed

265
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,880
to learn from Ava, Shinji becomes a total fucking ass-kicking monster man?

266
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,480
Well, you say it's not Ava, but now it is Ava, so that's-

267
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,480
I know it is Ava, but it's not like, it's not Anno's Ava, and that's-

268
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,840
And that's exactly the problem with Final Fantasy VII, because when it comes out and

269
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,120
sucks, people are gonna say, well, this is Final Fantasy VII.

270
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,560
Yeah, okay, we need to, we need to, on that issue, we need to bring up how, because we're

271
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,840
talking about this already, uh, the people making the remake, okay, the guy who directed

272
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,200
it was Kitase, he is now producer, Nomura was character designer, he is now director,

273
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,760
and people already throw around the argument, this legitimizes it, this makes it, you know,

274
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,320
like, it's reasonable, the answer is, no it doesn't, because it's been 20 fucking years

275
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,080
since the game came out, Nomura, I mean, and first of all, Nomura was a fucking character

276
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,480
designer, and now he's a director, that's not the same shit, Kitase is a fucking producer,

277
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
yeah, go on.

278
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,240
I just want to talk some shit about Nomura, please, uh, Nomura, I blame him for everything

279
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,600
that has fucking happened to Final Fantasy, all the fucking belts, all the fucking leather,

280
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,720
well, all those zippers, I mean, the Final Fantasy VII character designs are all great,

281
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,080
I mean, even Vincent, who's a goofball, is still lovable in his own way.

282
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,640
No, I agree that the character, I'm not actually like, mad about that, I'm mad about the fact

283
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,760
that Nomura does not really know how to design video games, he knows how to-

284
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,680
That's entirely true, look at the fucking compilation, which is his baby, look, he directed

285
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,920
Advent Children, completely got everything wrong, he directed everything in the compilation,

286
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,700
Crisis Core, what people say, it's a fucking piece of garbage, everything new that it introduced

287
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,980
was shit and just had the need to over, the ending with Zack was really impressive, but

288
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:02,100
completely ruined everything about his death scene from the original that made it so special.

289
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,180
So here, you know, and we don't even need to talk about Durga Cerberus, it's a fucking

290
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,580
stookie, it's poop.

291
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:15,560
I mean, none of that ruins Final Fantasy VII as much as Final Fantasy XII ruins Final

292
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Fantasy VII.

293
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Because of Shinra.

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,440
Because Shinra makes it canon that Final Fantasy X is a prequel to Final Fantasy VII.

295
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,480
Okay, I'll kill every motherfucker on this planet.

296
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,160
Dude, the actual explanation for that is Shinra, right, found the Shinra company, or stays

297
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,600
alive somehow, and then they literally travel from that planet to a different planet.

298
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,600
This is the canon explanation, found that entire civilization, and then eventually Final

299
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Fantasy VII happens.

300
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
How the fuck does that make sense?

301
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
It doesn't.

302
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
It's ridiculous.

303
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
So you can ignore it.

304
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Just ignore it.

305
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,240
According to that canon definition, that would mean that the Shinra corporation existed

306
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,360
with the Cetra like a thousand years ago.

307
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
That's right.

308
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
That's right.

309
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Yep.

310
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
I hate them.

311
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
I hate them all so much.

312
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,040
Well, actually, okay, it's possible because humans and Cetra were the same thing, right?

313
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,960
Until the media, until Jenova hit or something, right, and then the, whatever, okay.

314
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,320
I think the Cetra have like sin particles in them or some shit now or something like

315
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
that.

316
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Yeah, who fucking knows.

317
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,960
Also, why would the Elbed who worship technology become the Cetra who worship the Earth?

318
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
No.

319
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
I don't even know.

320
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,160
A lot can happen in a billion years, which I assume is the timeline between the two.

321
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
So you know.

322
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
You know what?

323
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,800
This is just not one single thing about it makes any coherent sense at all.

324
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,840
Okay, the point is, the point is all this shit happened on Nomura and Square Enix's

325
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,320
watch, and these are the people remaking Final Fantasy VII.

326
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,920
That's the issue here.

327
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,480
And what does that tell us about what the remake is going to be?

328
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,800
I think it's quite clear that it is no longer the original vision of the people who made

329
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
that game.

330
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,520
And for that reason alone, it, it, I think it's going to pollute the legacy of the original

331
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,880
with whatever, even if there's one tiny change to the story, like, it doesn't even matter.

332
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,080
Whatever it is will be, the series will be worse off because it exists.

333
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,340
I am not interested in how many people are brought into the series by playing this game

334
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,840
and then even decide to go play Final Fantasy VII because I think that they will have a tainted

335
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,080
view of the game.

336
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,240
I would rather have more people with a, with a pure view than a vast number of people with

337
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,600
a corrupted view of what the game was.

338
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm not interested in that.

339
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,520
So, I, there's a lot of, yeah, sorry.

340
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,040
You can go ahead because I'm going to change the subject.

341
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:40,120
Yeah, there's a lot of, there's a lot of shit to unpack in what Nomura has kind of done

342
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,760
to Final Fantasy and like, I think the thing is that Nomura came into Final Fantasy as

343
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,480
a fan of what Sakaguchi has had done and a lot of, a lot of what he makes seems like

344
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,800
Final Fantasy fan fiction, which is why Kingdom Hearts in his hands is so fucking great.

345
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Yeah.

346
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
That's fine.

347
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Totally fine.

348
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,320
Because Kingdom Hearts is just Final Fantasy and Disney fan fiction.

349
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
It's meant to be.

350
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,160
Well, I say, I say it's fine, but the story has literally gone to absolute garbage in the

351
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
last couple of games.

352
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
It doesn't matter.

353
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
But ignoring that, ignoring that.

354
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
It doesn't matter.

355
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
The game, the game plays fine.

356
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
The first one was great.

357
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Second one was great.

358
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Yeah.

359
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,800
And, and like when Nomura makes his own thing, like, or not necessarily his own thing,

360
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,480
but when they make their own thing and like the world ends with you, that can be really

361
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
great too.

362
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Oh, that rule dude.

363
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
That game rules.

364
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:33,400
Like, I do agree with you that Nomura's direction on Final Fantasy has made the series worse.

365
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,120
And the last guy who knew anything about how to make a Final Fantasy game left halfway

366
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,840
through the production of Final Fantasy 12, the director of Tactics.

367
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Right.

368
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
The evilese guy.

369
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Yeah.

370
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
That man knew how to make a fucking game and now he's gone.

371
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
And he's gone.

372
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,760
He's been fucking depressing for me, man.

373
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
This is all just.

374
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
All right.

375
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Yeah.

376
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Okay, guys, guys.

377
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,240
We're kind of off topic.

378
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,840
I mean, we're on topic because I know we're off topic.

379
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,160
I mean, I think this is more or less proven that remakes cause nothing but sadness and

380
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
misery.

381
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Okay.

382
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Let Jeff finish this point.

383
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,400
Then Digi, you can take it.

384
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm bringing it back.

385
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,440
What I don't think is I don't think that the point that it's not the creator's original

386
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:24,720
vision is necessarily a valid reason to say this, this remake will not be good because

387
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:33,000
if they were trying to do something good with it, if they were trying to do something new

388
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,120
and different that takes the ideas of Final Fantasy 7 and interprets them in new and interesting

389
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
ways, that would be fucking awesome.

390
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
But what they.

391
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,000
As much as that idea disgusts me, you might that could theoretically be true possibly.

392
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,200
But what it seems like they want to do, and I'm saying this based on, you know, Crisis

393
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,280
Core and all of those things that you mentioned.

394
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:01,760
What it seems like they want to do is Nomura wants to take his Final Fantasy 7 live journal

395
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,080
fan fiction that he's working on for fucking ever that is just his head cannon.

396
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,880
This is, he's on Tumblr, he's made, he's talking about how, you know, Tifa and Cloud

397
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,800
have to end up together and all of this shit.

398
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,920
And he's, he's making a very much as objective as true as Zach has to be a Super Saiyan or

399
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,480
whatever the fuck was going on.

400
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,680
Not necessarily, Jesse, because humanity may have all died at the end of the, at the

401
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
game.

402
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
We don't know.

403
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
That is true.

404
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
That is true.

405
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
That is true.

406
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
It's ambiguous.

407
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
And his fucking compilation ruins that.

408
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
It's the most important thing in the entire game.

409
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
I hate you, Nomura.

410
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
I hate you.

411
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
I wish you were dead.

412
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
You ruined my favorite series.

413
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Fuck you, Nomura.

414
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Also, Toriyama sucks too.

415
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Lightning's garbage.

416
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
But anyway.

417
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Yeah.

418
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I like lightning returns.

419
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Like, I mean.

420
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,440
Maybe that game's okay.

421
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,160
Final Fantasy 13 has at least gotten better since they stopped giving a fuck about the

422
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
story and just started making gameplay.

423
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
That seems to be true.

424
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
You just tested to that.

425
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
But yeah.

426
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:07,480
So, like, the problem, as I see it with this, isn't that they are not making the creator's

427
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,800
original vision.

428
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,880
It's that they're trying to bite Sakaguchi's original vision in trying to make it.

429
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,080
And that, like, I think that if they were trying to make something that was totally

430
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,400
different, that would be fine.

431
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Yeah.

432
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,320
But look at all the advertising remake.

433
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,040
This is it done correctly.

434
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,920
Done as it was always intended.

435
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
That really seems to me.

436
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Right.

437
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
All right.

438
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Like, let's move on.

439
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I gotta get into this now.

440
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
Okay.

441
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
I gotta cut a promo here.

442
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
All right.

443
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Please.

444
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Look.

445
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,240
We've done a lot of talk about, like, the creators of these games, right?

446
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,120
And a lot of this, you know, you can blame them for making these remakes and trying to

447
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,200
obviously just repackage something that's popular so that more people will buy it.

448
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Right?

449
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,320
I mean, Final Fantasy VII remake, on the sheer idea in most people's minds that this game

450
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,480
is supposed to be the greatest game ever, but they haven't played it because it's old,

451
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,600
and then it comes out and it's new, it will make it sell like crazy, right?

452
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,080
That is true, though I don't like it.

453
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,560
Now, here's the thing.

454
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:19,760
The problem to me is not necessarily the creators, it's the gamers, and I think in

455
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,200
general the product of all these remakes is that people don't give a fuck about art.

456
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
That's true.

457
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,120
People don't care about art.

458
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,520
They care about just being entertained.

459
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
They just want to consume shit, right?

460
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,240
You put it in front of them, they watch it.

461
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,080
The reason Psycho gets a remake is everyone knows about Psycho.

462
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Everyone's heard of it.

463
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,800
A lot of people have probably seen it.

464
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Nobody wants to see a black and white movie.

465
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Right.

466
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,640
No one's going to go out of their way to download a black and white movie and watch it, even

467
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,400
if they would probably like it, and there is some level of understandableness to this.

468
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,960
Maybe people don't really have the language to communicate with older art.

469
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,680
If you've never seen a black and white movie, it might be hard for you to sort of process,

470
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,680
and most people don't want to put the effort into watching old shit.

471
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,120
They just say, I don't like it.

472
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,880
This is a very intricate topic that's going to be difficult to parse.

473
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:24,520
The thing is, because I'm going to bring this back to Final Fantasy VII, I grew up without

474
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
a PS1.

475
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,760
My first console was the N64.

476
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,640
I didn't have a Sony until 2003 with the PS2.

477
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,000
I went back and I got really into JRPG, so I went back and tried to play all the old

478
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,200
Final Fantasies.

479
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,440
I played most of the first discs of Final Fantasy VII, which is as much as I've played

480
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,320
of it to this day, but I did love it at the time, like 2005.

481
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,320
I loved the art.

482
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
I loved everything about it.

483
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:58,600
My little brother, Victor, is a very modern spoiled gamer because he's been playing games

484
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,640
for as long as I have, but he's never gone back and played old games.

485
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
I go back.

486
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,480
I try to play NES games, Super Nintendo games, all the stuff I missed out on.

487
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
He's never done that.

488
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,560
So Final Fantasy VII is getting a remake and immediately he's like, oh yeah, now I get

489
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,440
to play the new one instead of the old one, right?

490
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,600
And so I told him how everyone was, you know, I told you guys, you guys all jumped down

491
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,400
his throat immediately, and then I told him how you guys all jumped down his throat and

492
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,360
he's like, man, whatever, I don't think I can get into an old turn-based game.

493
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,040
And then Nintendo, you know, made cloud in Smash and he got all excited because they

494
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,320
were showing all the aons and shit and playing the old battle music.

495
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Those are summons?

496
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
Aons are Final Fantasy X?

497
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Whatever.

498
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,880
He saw all the summons and he was like, oh man, I forgot, Final Fantasy is pretty cool.

499
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,360
I now want to play VII, so I get him, you know, I have it on Steam, so I put it on his computer.

500
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,320
He plays like the first hour and he says, man, this is already the coolest game ever.

501
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,240
And he plays it for one more hour, gets tired and decides not to play it anymore because

502
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,600
he got tired with the battle system.

503
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,160
And like, but I, you know, on the one hand, I can say I get it, right?

504
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,000
Because he doesn't care about video games as art.

505
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,880
He cares about it as something he plays, you know, he doesn't really think deep about video

506
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
games.

507
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,720
It's something that a game comes out, he gets hype for a new game that's about to come

508
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,160
out, you know, he's always riding the hype cycle, watching all the previews, the game

509
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,480
comes out, he plays it, and then it's gone.

510
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
It's, that's it.

511
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,560
That's, you know, maybe it comes back later when he plays it again, if he plays it again.

512
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,320
But it's not something that like, he's got this grand cultural idea of what games are.

513
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,600
Yeah, let me bring up a point about this real quick.

514
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,680
Because I think an important touchstone for this whole discussion is Red Letter Media's

515
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,880
Jack and Jill video, in which they say specifically how, like, that movie is a corporate, disgusting

516
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,760
piece of garbage that only exists to make money and has no artistic value whatsoever.

517
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,360
But people don't care.

518
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,480
At the, like, the justification, or what they say is like, at the end of the day, who cares

519
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
about this movie?

520
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,600
Like, who is harmed by it?

521
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,920
The answer is only people who look at movies as art and are interested in it as an artistic

522
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
medium.

523
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Everyone else is fine.

524
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Doesn't matter.

525
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,640
My Asterisk War Part 9 video that's going to come out in a couple days is almost exactly

526
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,440
the same point now that I think about it.

527
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,040
Like, the thing is, with video games, there's this great article, I don't remember what

528
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,400
it's called, I need to track it down again so you can put it in the description.

529
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,120
But it was by this guy who was, like, a teacher of, like, game design or something like that.

530
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,400
And he had this class and he asked everyone in the class, raise your hand if you're a

531
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,040
fan of the Elder Scrolls series.

532
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,760
And like, 75% of the kids raised their hand, right?

533
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,520
And then he says, like, how many of you have played Skyfall and they also have their hands

534
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
up?

535
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,760
Then he says, how many of you have played Oblivion and then, like, more than half of

536
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
them lower their hands?

537
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,840
And then he says, how many of you have played Morrowind and there's only, like, two guys

538
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
left?

539
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,960
And then he says, how many of you have played Daggerfall?

540
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
No one.

541
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,240
So these people say, I'm a fan of the Elder Scrolls series, but they've only played the

542
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
latest one.

543
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,480
And it's because there's this sort of idea that's very prevalent among gamers because

544
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,120
gaming isn't really recognized as an art form in the greater cultural sense yet.

545
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,240
It's still sort of treated as, like, you know, obviously gamers think it's an art form and

546
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,080
they'll defend it like that.

547
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,480
But then at the same time, they don't treat it like one.

548
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,840
Because if you get into film, if you try to be a film major or something, you will go

549
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,160
back and watch stuff from the 20s and 30s and 40s and you will watch it as a chain.

550
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,840
That's the point that I raised in my Final Fantasy VII rant video back in last summer

551
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,000
where I said, you know, gamers always want to defend games as art, but then they also

552
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,240
turn around and go, well, we need it with better graphics though and we need a new version

553
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
of it and we need it.

554
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,480
It's just a prank, bro, argument.

555
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:10,120
So here's sort of my take on it because I come at this from, I think, a slightly different

556
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,840
perspective from you guys.

557
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,600
You're all a little bit older than me.

558
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Wait, how old are you?

559
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
You're young, really?

560
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,800
Get the fuck out of here, pal.

561
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,680
I'm only 23, so...

562
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,600
Well, I don't think any of us is over 25, so...

563
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,920
Yeah, but I mean, like, the thing is, Jesse's 26, I forget.

564
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,200
That difference of, like, two or three years is the difference between having been old

565
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,200
enough to play Final Fantasy VII when it came out and having to go back and play it.

566
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,720
Okay, sure.

567
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,480
And that's kind of...

568
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:51,800
So I was at a similar position to Digi's Brother, where I hadn't played it.

569
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,720
And the thing was, or the thing is that I went to school for game design.

570
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,680
I obviously am very interested in studying old games as an art form.

571
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:10,520
And for me, Final Fantasy VII, more than, say, Final Fantasy IX and more than Final Fantasy

572
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:18,480
VI, kind of came across as a chore to play, because it was in that dip in quality in terms

573
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,880
of, like, visual fidelity and a lot of other stuff where they were figuring not where they

574
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
were...

575
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Holy shit, okay.

576
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Man, I'm gonna fucking murder you when you're asleep.

577
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
It's good.

578
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
It's like somebody really revealed their immaturity.

579
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:38,800
Well, I think Jeff's point is, I think it's fair that he's actually played the game and

580
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,320
formed an opinion on it.

581
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,840
I'm not saying that everyone needs to recognize Final Fantasy VII as a great masterpiece.

582
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,920
I just think it's dangerous that we have this new game coming out and people won't go play

583
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
the original.

584
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
Yeah, and that's...

585
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Agreed.

586
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,440
I would rather someone hate Final Fantasy VII than like the remake.

587
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
I agree.

588
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:07,000
Well, I might feel that way about both, but the thing is that VII was harder for me to

589
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,960
play through than VI and was harder for me to play through than IX and was easier for

590
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,720
me to play through than VIII because VIII is fucking garbage, but let's not get into

591
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,200
that whole discussion.

592
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Nice.

593
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Yeah, okay.

594
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Fucking plan.

595
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:30,640
But so VII has that very awkward, we're trying to figure out how 3D graphics work aspect

596
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,880
to it, and in terms of old games with 3D graphics, it doesn't hold up to the same degree as,

597
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,000
Metal Gear Solid or Mega Man Legends 2 or...

598
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,680
Okay, you better get to your point quick because I'm going to destroy you on this point momentarily.

599
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
You're going to murder me.

600
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Yes.

601
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
No, no, no, I've got a good retort to this.

602
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,800
Is it the Hippo Crit retort because we could let him finally tell us?

603
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
That is exactly what it is.

604
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Magnificent.

605
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Yeah, so...

606
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Yeah.

607
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,920
Let's just finish this point, then I'll...

608
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:05,560
So, like, what I'm saying is I did actually make a concerted effort to play through and

609
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,240
enjoy Final Fantasy VII, despite that.

610
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:18,680
But something that I think gets lost is that Final Fantasy VII is, in some ways, harder

611
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:25,040
to enjoy than the SNES-era Final Fantasies and the late PS1-era Final Fantasies, because

612
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,680
it falls into that middle ground of they were still trying to figure out how to make it

613
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
work.

614
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,240
The combat is a little bit on the slow side compared to...

615
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
And quick and responsive.

616
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
I actually do agree.

617
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
It's fun.

618
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
It's a bit slow.

619
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,640
Things take a little longer in combat than I'd like.

620
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,000
And I love turn-based combat.

621
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,480
My favorite game right now is Legend of Heroes Trails in Cold Steel.

622
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
My favorite...

623
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,560
One of my favorite games of all time is Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky.

624
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,920
I love Skies of Arcadia, so it's not like a problem with what they're going for.

625
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,000
I love Final Fantasy's battle system in particular, because I think Bravely Default's one of the

626
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,280
most brilliant gameplay-wise games of the last decade.

627
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,120
In terms of battle systems, yes.

628
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,760
Yeah, story-wise, it's hit or miss.

629
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,080
I mean, the second half is kind of, but whatever.

630
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,560
In terms of game design, and I think about a lot of stuff in terms of game design, because

631
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,480
that's what I studied, 7 definitely has some stuff to it, but it's got those load times

632
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,560
or huge fucking pain in the ass.

633
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,000
The graphics in battle look a lot better than the graphics on the overworld, but it's still

634
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
like...

635
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Alright, let's stop you there.

636
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,360
I want Hippo to make his defense of the overworld graphics that I really love, and Nate does

637
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
too.

638
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Yeah.

639
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,200
I've seen Nate's video, but yeah.

640
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,200
I hate you.

641
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,800
Well, I haven't played the other Final Fantasy games, so I don't know how much, how good

642
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:05,280
I am of a retort I am, but I played Final Fantasy 7 quite recently to form an opinion

643
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,320
on it for the same sort of reason, so that I could compare it to the remake when it comes

644
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:18,320
out, and I like all the low-poly, the low-resolution stuff.

645
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,600
I forgot what my actual argument was.

646
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,960
Your argument was that the way that they animate the characters is very expressive.

647
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,840
But the way that all the dialogue is portrayed is like the characters move their bodies because

648
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,640
they couldn't animate faces to express this.

649
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:43,560
Right, so for someone to say that the animations, they did well with what they had.

650
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,160
Right, and so for someone to say that a remake will be better in every way is ignoring the

651
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,320
things that were the product that they were forced to do, which in this case is the incredibly

652
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,760
animated models, which I love, which is one of my favorite things about that game.

653
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,120
It gives us a very silly feel, that's super endearing, and the remake will not, will not

654
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,800
in even close, be able to capture that level of, you know, comfiness.

655
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't disagree, and I do appreciate- It's going to be grimdark as fuck, and I already

656
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
wish I was dead.

657
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,600
The voice acting alone is just going to kill it by itself.

658
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,400
Voice acting in games is a huge issue.

659
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
I wish it was gone.

660
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
It needs to go away forever.

661
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,960
We can talk about that specifically.

662
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,800
The Advent Children voice cast is- At the very least, every game that did not have

663
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,720
a voice cast should never ever, ever, ever, ever be given a voice because I've already

664
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,600
got the voice in my head, anything else to be parable.

665
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,760
I want to make that argument in a sec, but I actually do want to chime in on the graphics

666
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:50,680
thing that you guys were talking about, because I do appreciate that old school style of what

667
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,800
Final Fantasy VII's overworld characters are basically, is they are big blocky 3D sprite

668
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,040
equivalents.

669
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,920
So what they used to do in the old, old Final Fantasy games is they'd have like a few different

670
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:09,760
dance animations for the sprites that would like express what emotions they were feeling

671
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,520
in very simple and obvious ways.

672
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,160
And I, you know, obviously I like that because I like Final Fantasy VI, and-

673
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,960
Terra's like scared reaction, like, ugh, face, it's like, it was great.

674
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
I love that sprite.

675
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:31,040
And like, what, the problem that I have isn't that they try to do that in Final Fantasy VII

676
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:38,960
necessarily, because I can appreciate, like I can appreciate that in other games of the

677
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,920
era that have similar limitations and do similar things with their graphics.

678
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,640
What I don't necessarily like is A, the disconnect between how these characters are presented

679
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,040
in battle and out of battle.

680
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,640
I think it like creates a little bit too much of a dissonance in my mind for this is like

681
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,880
the same world that this is taking place in.

682
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:08,440
And the other thing that I'm not a particularly big fan of is that that was the point where

683
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,960
Final Fantasy started to try to go for that cinematic appeal.

684
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,560
And having that cinematic appeal with these very expressive or that like cinematic style

685
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,560
with these camera angles and all of these supposed supposed to be cool action sequences

686
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
with these-

687
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
Oh, supposed to be, he said.

688
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,560
Okay, go on.

689
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,280
With these adorable little stop motion muppets is jarring as fuck.

690
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,800
If I can nitpick your points, I gotta say that whenever I hear people bring up things

691
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,880
like disconnect or dissonance, those just sound like words to me that critics invented

692
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,720
that don't actually mean anything.

693
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,400
Like, where is this disconnect that I'm supposed to be feeling that everyone else always points

694
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
out in things?

695
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
I think Jesse and Jeff-

696
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Is it because the backgrounds are so pretty and the models?

697
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,520
I think it's totally fine for Jeff to have all those opinions about the game, but I'm

698
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
just nitpicking.

699
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,760
Well, I think it's something that like, you know, you can go back and play the game and

700
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
feel that.

701
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,360
And maybe you would have felt that when you played it the first time in 1997.

702
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,680
Like, maybe you would have played six and then played seven and felt that disconnect

703
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
and that could be totally normal.

704
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
But I think-

705
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,240
Like, the thing is, I think seven would have blown me away if I played it when it came

706
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
out.

707
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Well, none of that.

708
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,160
I mean, that might be true, but none of that is the issue.

709
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,120
The issue is, does this justify a modern day remake as we've seen it going to do?

710
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
I don't think so.

711
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:43,200
I want to actually bring up Final Fantasy VI, because really, Final Fantasy VII, the original

712
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,920
is to me an example of how to do a remake well, because it's kind of a remake of six.

713
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,920
Not in like the story, but they carry so much over from six.

714
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:59,160
It's got the same modern setting, Sephiroth is basically a less funny, more serious Kefka.

715
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,800
The final boss battle is exactly the same.

716
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,240
Essentially, they looked at six and said, well, we have a more powerful console now,

717
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,000
let's do this again.

718
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,080
But what makes it not a remake is obviously they made a whole new world and a whole new

719
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,120
story and a whole new characters to base it around.

720
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,840
So if you want to remake something or put a new spit on it, just take the elements that

721
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,560
you liked and make something new with it.

722
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,480
Making a remake entirely like to the point is entirely-

723
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
I want to raise-

724
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,200
So is it just not obvious to everyone why they're doing it?

725
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
There's only one reason.

726
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
They're trying to make money.

727
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:39,040
I want to raise a point about old games in general and advice to people who haven't played

728
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,600
a lot of old games, because I do think, while I think Jeff's points are valid about feeling

729
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,840
that disconnect and that that's a personal thing that some people might feel, to bring

730
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:57,120
back to the defense, because as valid as your feelings are, also valid is our defense that

731
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:02,560
we like I think all four of us on the other side of the discussion like those character

732
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,680
designs and the way they're used in the story.

733
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,520
And I think that people need to go in with an analytical slant towards the way that graphics

734
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,280
are used as opposed to what the graphics are.

735
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,040
Because I think that saying that new graphics are necessarily better than old ones is kind

736
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,680
of like saying that movies are inherently better than books because they can show you

737
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,640
things on screen as opposed to describing them.

738
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,640
Right.

739
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,280
When in reality a book, a great book can have a description in it that's way better than

740
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,880
a shitty movie's image.

741
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,640
And I think with old games there can be Super Nintendo games like say Chrono Trigger that

742
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:50,560
are so evocative of a time and feel and place that they still resonate with you more so

743
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,960
than a modern game that has really high-res graphics.

744
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,840
If you look at those Shakespeare re-envisionings, you know the ones that do it in messages

745
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:07,240
with ascii, fucking smileys and shit, that's an extreme example, but that's what it reminds

746
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
me of.

747
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,080
It's like trying to reinterpret the thing that already exists in a new way to make it

748
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,080
more immersive.

749
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:18,560
What you're ignoring in that situation is the incredibly important what that art piece

750
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,280
made at that time says about that period of time, which is a super important aspect

751
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,280
of it.

752
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,200
And I think that when you take the turn-based battles out of Final Fantasy 7, you really

753
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,680
make it a different game and you're not acknowledging it by calling it a remake.

754
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,000
And that's where, again, remakes, that's the issue.

755
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
That's a reimagining at that point, I agree.

756
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,440
My stance on remakes in general, which we should have probably gotten to this 40 minutes

757
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,440
ago.

758
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,960
My overall stance on remakes is like, as pieces of art that exist in a void, like if I didn't

759
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,800
take context into it, I don't think there'd be much to complain about because it's just

760
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,920
a different game and you have both.

761
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,640
But in the context of reality where I know people are going to play the new Final Fantasy

762
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,400
7 and take it as the Final Fantasy 7, it's worrisome, but at the same time, no one who

763
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,600
actually takes the game seriously as art is going to do that.

764
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,440
The people who give a fuck are us.

765
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,880
We are the ones who are going to write history books about what video games are, you know.

766
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,760
There's going to be people out there that just fall through the cracks and only get

767
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,080
the newest one no matter what.

768
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,080
I worry for that.

769
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:32,840
The crux of my position on remakes is, you know, I've seen and played enough good remakes

770
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,240
that I can't just throw the baby out the bathwater and say that remakes are all inherently bad

771
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,040
and they shouldn't exist.

772
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,560
But what it comes down to is just whether or not I trust the people in charge of the

773
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,080
game, specifically in the case of Final Fantasy 7, if you look at Square Enix's track record

774
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:54,080
for the last, oh, I don't know, 15 fucking years, you cannot trust these people to make

775
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,800
something of the same quality.

776
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,560
Wait, let's ask a question.

777
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,200
Let's look at other Square Enix remakes.

778
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,760
Jeff, you probably played this.

779
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,880
How was the remake of Final Fantasy 3 on the DS?

780
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,600
The remake of Final Fantasy 3 is actually something I was going to bring up as the original, did

781
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
you?

782
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,400
Nobody did, because it was Japan exclusive.

783
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,040
Can we really form a comparison?

784
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:22,160
The thing is, in terms of viewing it as its own property, it's definitely solid.

785
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,000
And I have played old school Final Fantasy, so I know how that looks.

786
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,720
And I have, I mean, the gameplay systems are exactly the same.

787
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:36,200
Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on the Game Boy Advance, much better than the original NES version.

788
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,480
Tweaked and improved in a lot of ways to avoid all that fucking grinding, yeah.

789
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:50,120
Or here's a slightly more contentious example, a Chrono Trigger on the DS, less of a remade.

790
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:55,520
It doesn't have very little cool cutscenes, I mean, that was from the PlayStation 1 version.

791
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,760
They put in the cutscenes for the PS1 version, but it has none of those load times that kind

792
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,400
of ruin the PS1 version.

793
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,720
And it also has a bunch of new endings, some of which are pretty interesting and help to

794
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,480
connect it to Chrono Cross, which some people might think is.

795
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,880
I do like those, but I have to ask myself, was this intended, is this the real story

796
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,960
of these characters that, I know they tie in Shala and Chrono Cross more, which is really

797
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,360
cool because I know in Chrono Cross, Shala exists, but we probably don't have the correct

798
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,320
answer to this, but was this intended, is this the real story of Chrono Trigger?

799
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,360
I think you care a lot more about authorial intent than I do personally.

800
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:42,680
I think that the writer on the guy who wrote the scenario for Chrono Trigger was the guy

801
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,920
who did most of the direction on Chrono Cross.

802
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,600
The reason why authorial intent is important is because I want to play the game that was

803
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,400
intended originally, and I know there's lots of issues that come up whenever you're making

804
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,400
a game.

805
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,040
Things get cut, things get changed, the corporate stuff has an influence on the artists.

806
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,120
But you know, I'm interested in playing this game that I can say, okay, this was made by

807
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:08,200
these people at this time, it has, I'm going to interpret it in these ways, and you know,

808
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,280
things are getting a lot more complicated, and maybe it's just me, you know, screaming

809
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,280
against the wind.

810
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,280
I mean, I never helped.

811
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,680
I think it's pretty easy to look at the Final Fantasy VII remake and say, this is clearly

812
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,240
not what Final Fantasy VII was intended to be, this is clearly not what anyone involved

813
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,680
with making the game would have made it, and they've just taken someone else's idea and

814
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,680
because they own the intellectual property, they are allowed to do whatever they want

815
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,680
with it.

816
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,040
And I think that there's so many signs that it's obviously going to be a problem game,

817
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:45,000
because it's obvious to me that with the whole thing where they have to split it into, you

818
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,800
know, an episodic release, and what that says to me is the game is way over budget,

819
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,160
and the reason the game is way over budget is because it has to appeal to everyone.

820
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,400
So they're not trying to make an art piece, they're trying to make a game that everyone

821
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
will buy.

822
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,120
Like Final Fantasy VII at no point had a part where you, after, you know, after you finish

823
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,280
the first disc, you have to wait months for the rest of the game to be released, and then

824
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,760
you have to do that again.

825
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,960
It's not art, it's not.

826
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,760
I do want to defend one thing on the budget perspective, which I think is one good sign

827
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,240
in relation to this game, which is that they're remaking a game that has pre-rendered backgrounds,

828
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,240
and I would say that the one thing about Final Fantasy VII that does absolutely still hold

829
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,000
up is the pre-rendered backgrounds.

830
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,720
And that's something that, you know, I wish we had more of, and my complaints about Final

831
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,160
Fantasy VII's graphics are not necessarily complaints about, I don't think that graphics

832
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:51,680
from that era can hold up, I just don't think that those ones particularly do.

833
00:49:51,680 --> 00:50:00,400
But the Final Fantasy VII remake is trying to remake a game with pre-rendered backgrounds,

834
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,280
which means that it wasn't, it's a game that never really reused any assets because it

835
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,160
didn't have to worry about storage space in the same way as other games, and it didn't

836
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,520
have to, so like every environment could feel completely fucking different and new and awesome

837
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,480
and not have to share the same fucking crates and barrels from every other area of the

838
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,800
game because they didn't have to reuse those assets over and over again.

839
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:33,480
And with Final Fantasy VII, the remake, if they're...

840
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,680
You know they're going to reuse shit everywhere.

841
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,280
Well they might reuse shit, but like the thing is that if they're trying to make Midgar feel

842
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,440
like the Midgar that people remember, they are going to have to create a lot of unique

843
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:53,800
environmental art assets for every single area of that game, which is going to require

844
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,600
a lot more dev time than you would typically get.

845
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,680
And you know what else is something that people like to bring up in regards to this game, is

846
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,960
they say, guys wouldn't it have been great if when we played VII you could explore more

847
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,680
of Midgar, like more sections, okay see the thing with that is guys, the people who could

848
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,320
have theoretically written cool things to happen in those places are all gone.

849
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:19,040
The thing that's going to fill in these spaces you want now is Nomura, Advent Children, uh

850
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,400
fucking Durgessurbership, that's what's going to be in those spaces.

851
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,800
It's going to be flying fucking motorcycle battles with them.

852
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,520
I just watched that episode of Futurama where Frye delves into his memories and like anything

853
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:35,560
that he didn't experience on his last day in 1999 was an empty white space.

854
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,960
That's exactly what this is, and it's going to be filled in by fucking Nomura and his

855
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,040
incompetent Kingdom Hearts writing.

856
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:49,640
So here, yeah, here's like the sort of problem with how they flavored the new version of Midgar

857
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:58,360
is the old version of Midgar had like a sort of fantasy and sci-fi crossover feel to it,

858
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:04,240
and the new version of Midgar feels a lot like a cyberpunk version of Tokyo, which is

859
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,360
Look, there was a there was a moment in the Final Fantasy 7 trailer that I saw in Nature

860
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:16,560
video that officially was the moment when I said this isn't going to be good, and it's

861
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:21,840
there's a part where you see Cloud running through a tunnel and there's some debris blocking

862
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:28,240
his path, and then he does that whole side scooch thing where like the character crawls

863
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,560
in between two pieces of debris and slowly moves forward every new game you know it was

864
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,680
it was really it was an uncharted a lot it's in the new Tomb Raiders it's in like all those

865
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,160
it's in the last of us all those games directly from Final Fantasy 15 so get excited for that

866
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,360
guys that's going to be a great game right well right and 15 might be good but do you

867
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,360
want load screens that's that's that's the load screen replacement I would take load

868
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:59,200
screens if the game was more fun I just think that those moments in in they're in like every

869
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:06,000
modern game yeah they feel like shit you you're you're controlling normally and then suddenly

870
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,880
you're controlling like not normally right and they'll always have a few of them back to back

871
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,040
just to sort of break up you know whatever you're doing and like I get it it's it's to change the

872
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,080
flow a little bit you know but I had to load screen that's the that's what it is they put

873
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,240
you in a tight area so that they can load everything I'd rather have like an okami load

874
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,800
screen which has a little minigame on it that you can play well you can't do that Namco you

875
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:35,120
can't do that Namco just lost that patent like this year hey there you go sweet so but like so

876
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:40,560
now we'll have load screen minigames again thank god I just handed that shit holy shit fuck them

877
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,400
yeah then go suck a dick I think you know well for one thing you probably wouldn't need those types

878
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,680
of load screens if you didn't make your games so overblown look look at Dark Souls right Dark Souls

879
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,160
is no load screens well fucking Dark Souls has the elevators but um well those are fine you know

880
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,000
they work they blend into the world seamlessly they're fine by me they don't make your control

881
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,400
scheme the point yeah the point is they crafted the world to avoid any kind of super no problem with

882
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,080
load screens that are integrated into the gameplay in a way that feels natural like an elevator or

883
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:17,040
or um I like I I think that how the uncharted games handle it in creating that feel of I'm watching

884
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:24,160
a movie is better for those games than right for those games sure I saw it those games but yeah

885
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:31,360
what what you know Final Fantasy 7 being this this RPG Final Fantasy 7 being this this RPG and I mean

886
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,920
it had cinematic moments where you know your controls change you do different stuff but it was

887
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,480
always for like in a mini game you can still control cloud though but right well there's always

888
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,080
like a mini game like you know you're riding your bike and you're slashing people or you're doing all

889
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,720
this other stuff it's always like a creative fun way to change to change the tension of the scene

890
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,840
well let's not let's not you know ignore the like 30 minute long cut scenes that happen sometimes I

891
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,760
mean there's only like one of those I'm not talking about that I'm talking what bothers me like one

892
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,200
of the biggest things that bothers me in games is where my controls change for no reason for sure

893
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,160
like when it when a character slows down to start talking on a calm or something and I have to now

894
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,600
walk weird and slow and it just feels like like like the like I might as well just have dropped

895
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,840
the controller you know like yeah yeah like at least for the cut scene you you have this

896
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,920
understanding that that something that it's pulled away to show you something you know like like it

897
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,440
doesn't bother me too much when the cut scene is like a straight up movie it does bother me when

898
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,000
you're playing like let's say a first person game like Metro and like there's a cut scene

899
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,880
in first person so you sit there and you keep hitting forward on the controller because you're

900
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,680
just waiting to get control of the character and you don't know when the cut scene stops or starts

901
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,320
so you're just sitting there hitting forward over and over again like why why am I not moving you

902
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:54,640
know but like in in a game like Final Fantasy 7 seeing something like that appear I'm just like

903
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,320
this like why would that happen in this game why would it take control away from me just like

904
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,720
like Mass Effect 3 and the answer is obviously because that's what games do these days you know

905
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,160
it really doesn't matter what we think because if the comment section of Nate's video proves anything

906
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,040
I was just gonna want crap I wanted to end this with a reading of several of my favorite comments

907
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:21,360
from that but yeah go on people crave mediocrity nowadays you know I'm of the opinion that that

908
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:29,360
AAA games development has terribly deteriorated and devolved in general or like games today at

909
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:35,360
least they're all the big budget AAA games are legitimately are legitimately worse in general

910
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:41,920
than older games and it's 1998 was like a golden time dude right around that I'm inclined to disagree

911
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:50,640
but that's that's because I have played almost every new game for like the last three years

912
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,480
would you say that more of the new would you say that more of the good new games were AAA games

913
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,320
or would you say that more of them were like more undertale you know I saw one guy well all the

914
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,600
good games that are coming out now the majority of the games that are really you know impressing

915
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:13,920
people are getting played a lot or successful or good are all you know modestly made indie games

916
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:21,040
with one or two guys in charge of it should be made by smaller teams I think and not be so bloated

917
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,880
I think yeah a with you know more restrictions it's like the art from adversity thing where like

918
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,160
if Final Fantasy 7 had come out with all the technology it has now back then it would have had

919
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,640
you know advent children cutscenes and it would have been impossible to take seriously I had a

920
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,440
point yeah I just I'm I hate everything I think I don't want it to be fair the way I'm with you

921
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,080
Jesse I think I don't think it's as strict a dichotomy as you're painting with the AAA versus

922
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:53,200
indie because I think I I strongly believe that we need to start using the terms AA and single a

923
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,400
like I would say AA games would be like Dark Souls what is AAA even you know come to think about

924
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:06,480
so actually we had discussions like this a lot in the in the chat room for the website I used to

925
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:15,360
work for because you know these divisions were kind of our bread and butter and the

926
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:24,240
yes the division between like Dark Souls is kind of in like a weird thing because Dark Souls 1

927
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:32,080
is probably I would say edging between AA and AAA but then Dark Souls 2 has more of a AAA

928
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:39,440
aspect to it and Bloodborne is 100% a AAA game to me the definition of AAA

929
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,880
should mean like the studio that made it right yeah like to me the the definition of AAA is not

930
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,160
necessarily what's in it or what like how good it is or how good it looks or whatever it's how

931
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:57,280
expensive was it no it's what it is um as I know well advertised it it's marketing budget marketing

932
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:04,160
is what defines something being AAA versus being like a single a and like this is how they think

933
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:10,000
about it at publishers when they say a AAA game that's their tentpole that's like their that's the

934
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:17,440
equivalent of a blockbuster movie right and and I I don't think that AAA games even are completely

935
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:27,120
bankrupt because two years ago we got Grand Theft Auto 5 which is a remarkable game on many many

936
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,880
levels and completely bankrupt I just think that there's an inherent loss of modesty that comes

937
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:38,880
with the new technology and these huge overblown budgets like you know but the last of us the last

938
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,080
of us felt like a very modest game a lot of the time except during the parts where you had to

939
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,840
load everything about the last of us it belongs I want to say I think what happened to games is

940
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:54,400
sort of similar to what's going on with the economy at large right that we've got a growing

941
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,360
upper class and a shrinking middle class that's very good I think with I think with video games

942
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:04,960
because the thing is when you look back at like a list of the top 100 super nintendo games or the

943
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:12,880
top 100 playstation 1 or games like it's it's always like all of them are pretty on par in terms

944
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:19,120
of like what they are we're like yeah look at the top 100 ps1 games and it'll be like you've got

945
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:24,400
Final Fantasy and stuff are like probably the more expensive ones but then you you can't really

946
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,440
tell there's not like a huge difference between like Final Fantasy and Ape Escape in terms of like

947
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,720
what kind of game they are how they kind of look you know or are going down the line you know there's

948
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,440
cheaper games there's the the the japanese rpgs that are like all 2d even though they're on the

949
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,960
ps1 you got like the legendary like no one can stop mr domino they all feel like they're on the same

950
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,800
sort of like plane of existence where like if you played like you know like a cheaper game versus

951
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:55,280
a more expensive game they all they all kind of feel the same whereas like now when you look at a

952
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,440
triple a game it's like this unlike impossible to comprehend production where you you look at it and

953
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:07,120
you go where how is this possible because for me personally uh like the overblown hd graphics

954
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,840
actually physically hurt my eyes so whenever i look at it i feel like i'm staring at like god and

955
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:17,120
it's just beaming into my eye i don't want to say like it's happening i don't like the idea of companies

956
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,120
striving for greater fidelity and i know there's going to be you know uncanny valley stuff along

957
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:26,240
the way i'm fine with that i just it's when your efforts like i think in final fantasy 15 this will

958
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:32,320
probably be the case when your efforts to make a game pretty adversely affect how fun it is to play

959
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,120
or your your resources are diverted to that that's when you got a fucking problem as a game and i

960
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:43,440
think we need i think what i'd like to see is for the middle class of games to come back

961
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,280
you know where i think i think they've been living strong in japan you know i think there's

962
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,520
so plenty of i want to see more like devil may cry and platinum games like platinum games where

963
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:59,360
it's like they have they have modern graphics but they're not like this is like battlefield

964
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:05,280
three ridiculous bullshit where it's like it has to be lifelike in order to step to be pushed you

965
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:12,000
know like just make games that look that look modern but are like fun arcade games that are

966
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
that are cool you know like i think i think if we had a lot more platinum games tier developers

967
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,760
then it wouldn't always either be oh this game's an indie darling that has all these amazing ideas

968
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,440
but it looks like fucking shit or oh it's this game that's got like that makes my computer explode

969
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,800
but it's fucking boring you know like i need more of that middle class that i feel like we really

970
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:42,160
had on the super nintendo and ps1 where like every game was on that same sort of tier you know aside

971
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:49,760
from like the tentpole games i see there i definitely don't think that every company should be going

972
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:55,920
for max fidelity i don't really think that any company should because it takes away from the

973
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,320
other stuff that you can be doing with the new technology in terms of building like where's the

974
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:05,120
emphasis on like the artistry as opposed to the where's like the designated like hundred man team

975
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:10,080
to be like we got to make this the best artistic piece prop like we possibly can no instead they're

976
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:15,760
all fucking working on like textures for like leaves on a tree it's like what what the fuck guys

977
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:21,760
that's not i so specifically when it comes to environmental details like that a lot of

978
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:27,760
procedurally generated these days like trees no triple a studio makes its own trees anymore

979
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:34,320
there is a dedicated there are like three dedicated tree populating algorithms that

980
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:41,440
are okay for for sale and for license to a bunch of play it's it's the same as like physics engines

981
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:49,120
like everybody uses havoc everybody uses unreal because those things take away from the amount

982
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:55,760
of time that you have to spend doing that nitty gritty shit yeah and like artists want to place

983
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:02,320
their own mark on stuff and they do in game companies like i know people who work in game

984
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:10,240
companies i've worked on games previously um and there is definitely like at every studio at every

985
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,040
level there are people doing something that they they feel proud of and that they want to put their

986
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:25,280
mark on um or you know obviously there are some people who just want to cash a paycheck but you

987
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:32,560
there is so much competition for jobs in the triple a industry that to just be capable of

988
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:38,560
cashing a paycheck you have to be among the best of the best and you have to be capable

989
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,920
you have to have that artistic drive and you have to be capable of there's an entire arc of

990
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:50,480
shiro bako about this one of the characters goes to uh work for a cg animation company

991
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:57,840
all it's they they basically do like the car cgs for like every show and video game like yeah

992
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:03,760
and the the director of the company is just really passionate about cars but if you work there all

993
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:11,040
you do is design cars forever you know and she's yeah she was like designing like just rims like she

994
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,080
was only allowed to design rims that she's talking to the other members of the company and they're

995
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,640
like yeah after two years i got to move on to tires you know and she's just like oh my god and

996
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:24,240
then she realizes i want to do artistic stuff i'm gonna go but like everyone who was working at

997
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,360
the company was working there because you will never need work you always will have work because

998
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:35,120
they always get hired to do cars and so she was like i'm gonna go work for some indie team and

999
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:40,320
just say fuck it because i need the artistic gratification you know so that exact thing happens

1000
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:49,600
quite frequently around me because uh i live in the same city as the big ea games campus so i know

1001
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:58,400
city is that uh vancouver oh yeah right yeah so i know people who literally all they do is try to

1002
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:06,880
get the details right on every single player in the entire football league or every single player

1003
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:14,880
in and when i say football i mean soccer football like inferior european football yes um yeah or try

1004
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:22,400
to get every single nba players jersey fucking down and the the environmental model uh modelers

1005
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:31,520
all they fucking work on is stadiums and basketball courts and there is a super high turnover at ea of

1006
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:38,080
people going indie like vancouver has a huge indie game scene because people do get tired of that

1007
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:50,080
over time but the thing is um a i i think that there there is some value in having these big

1008
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:59,600
triple a monstrosities because um uh a sometimes they offer really epic uh mind-blowing experiences

1009
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:06,240
like uh i would say grand theft out of five offered that um and b they act as a sort of training

1010
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:15,840
ground and a proving ground for people to uh practice get their 10 000 hours in of becoming

1011
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:21,520
like a true fucking master of what they do and then they can go and they can they can go into the

1012
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,720
indie space and make that middle class that you're talking about bro and that middle class is growing

1013
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:33,040
like if you look at steam the biggest games on steam these days are often uh yeah i think like

1014
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:38,400
something like rocket league feels sort of that that i mean it's sort of bare bones but like the

1015
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,840
way the graphics are and the the depth of the the engine and everything is like yeah this is more than

1016
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:49,440
just some indie game okay you know what this is all this witness the witness is a good example

1017
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,160
well didn't he spend like six years spending like a lot of money making uh making braid and then

1018
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:00,960
or and just reminding uh looking at the steam front page has reminded me this will bring us back

1019
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,000
to remakes and is one of the best examples of a sort of middle class level development

1020
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:15,200
and one of the best examples of a remake of all time xcom the new election about xcom uh so the old

1021
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:23,280
xcom uh was really ugly and really fucking hard and uh it's got a lot of i mean it's still a good

1022
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:28,400
game but it's also basically unplayable for a modern gamer and i'm not just saying that because of uh

1023
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:34,640
it's very inaccessible in how it's designed and the new xcom takes all of the ideas of the original

1024
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:42,960
xcom and just makes them palatable to a modern gamer but it so i think it's a it's a remake done right

1025
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,960
but then also the interesting thing about it is is that it was like wildly fucking successful

1026
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:55,520
meanwhile xcom the bureau or the bureau xcom declassified the shitty first person shooter that

1027
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:01,840
they made set in the xcom universe was supposed to be the triple a tent pole of uh xcom and it

1028
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:08,800
fucking flopped while uh everybody bought xcom one and now xcom two is the most hiked that's

1029
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:15,200
that's very interesting and i i my my position is and always has been i it's not like every single

1030
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:20,560
remake will always be a mistake but i do think that they are rare and in generally i think the

1031
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:29,120
practice uh isn't as valuable as pursuing new works but here's like here's the my why i think xcom

1032
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:35,360
kind of just i call the exception that proves the rule but maybe you'd say it but the thing is

1033
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:42,160
that xcom is that rare example of they put resources into making a new thing the bureau xcom

1034
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:48,400
declassified and they put less resources into making a remake because the game design was done

1035
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:52,880
and a lot of the world building was done and it was just a matter of like building the game and

1036
01:09:52,880 --> 01:10:02,560
yeah and the the remake was vastly fucking superior to the piece of fucking garbage new thing that they

1037
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,200
tried to write okay here's my question that's true i mean i always okay going back to my earlier

1038
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,960
point that i think a remake should like is is understandable if you're just trying to perfect

1039
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:17,360
the original do you think that the new xcom would have been better if they just hadn't called it xcom

1040
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:23,600
like if they just no no something else i i think it it perfects the original x i'm asking nape like

1041
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:29,360
do you think oh do you think we'd be better off if like if you took an idea you had that you that

1042
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:36,080
you released and it was pretty okay and then you made a much better version of it and said it's a

1043
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:42,400
remake would that be less valuable than if you said well i just reskinned it and now it's about

1044
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,840
different characters and it's a different ip well okay the the critical word there is reskin because

1045
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:53,280
like if it really is the same game only you just change like fluff then like what do you that's

1046
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:58,080
that's that's not a substance of what i'm saying is that they change the entire story of the game

1047
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:05,520
they it's it's a remake it's the same thing but they changed the the systems of it to make it better

1048
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:12,480
so it's a remake yeah but it's it's a much better game and i think like if you say that like what's

1049
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,760
the point of just remaking something that already existed it's like well they made a good game as

1050
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,880
opposed to the not so good one so like well i feel like your argument that they should have made

1051
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,760
something new it's like well they did make something new they just it's just that it's so

1052
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,520
similar to the old one that you know i changed the my argument is is really about the the use of

1053
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,360
resources it sounds like in this case they were because they were already making this other game

1054
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:43,680
they had the assets to use and like it didn't require a massive amount of work to do and it's

1055
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:49,360
like if it's what the artists like if it's better and pretty much objectively then you know there's

1056
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,640
really much to complain about but like really your complaints with remakes are one it should be the

1057
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,920
same people uh i'm not saying it should or it should it should be something that reflects

1058
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:05,760
the original artistic intent yeah um or otherwise be something totally different because why even

1059
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,320
call it the same thing yes and i can agree with that i think like you know i think there's plenty

1060
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,920
of great remakes out there and i think that they they could easily have just been called something

1061
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,640
else but they needed the brand recognition you know which is frustrating which which which hurts

1062
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,480
the art form that yes we take focus away from the original and we put it only on the new one

1063
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,760
although at the same time it can often drive attention to the original where there's probably

1064
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,800
a lot of people who will play final fantasy seven just to compare it to the remake you know

1065
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,800
so i think there's still a lot of potential that it's actually net positive for the original game

1066
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,840
okay but your but that's not counting my second argument which is the effort that was put into

1067
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,880
making this remake you could have spent yeah so i'll i'll definitely say that like i think in the

1068
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,800
end if the result was actually a better game and like it was something they were doing because

1069
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:04,320
they legitimately wanted to improve final fantasy seven and not just resell it to a new audience

1070
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:11,600
then i think it would possibly be justified to possibly use the resources but i i i think like i

1071
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:18,640
think there's a false assumption there in that if they weren't making if they didn't have this remake

1072
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:25,120
project going they would have a different project active at the studio because oftentimes um remakes

1073
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,760
square enix we're talking about final fantasy 16 just get working on it you know whatever they

1074
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:38,240
got to do so like in terms of resource distribution a lot of the time remakes like remasters particularly

1075
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:44,160
are like you need like four or five people to work on them that's that's their very small projects

1076
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,920
but remakes too can be much smaller projects not necessarily in the case of final fantasy seven

1077
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:56,320
because obviously they're giving it a full triple production yeah yeah but um in a lot of cases a

1078
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:01,920
remake will need to have like a smaller team than a full triple a thing and it's something that they

1079
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:10,560
can work on without necessarily having to have like a full a full staff of um you know a full

1080
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:15,040
staff of writers to i mean obviously this is an example that's helping my point but like like the

1081
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,960
final fantasy six remake that just came out like what was even the point of that just re-release

1082
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,920
it literally looks worse in every way well that's not a remake that's a port that's a bad port it's

1083
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,640
a port with completely replaced artwork which was well no not completely replaced they put a filter

1084
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:36,080
on it which is garbage um like final fantasy six like like what it is is it's just like they took

1085
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,880
all of the sprites and then they put them through a program that smooths out all of the edges which

1086
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,960
is the worst thing that you can do the sprite artwork so they just look like shit they vector

1087
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:53,280
they vectorize the sprites basically and it's terrible um whereas uh final like the so the

1088
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:58,720
assumption that you're making that uh they would be making or that they could be making

1089
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:06,800
something entirely new instead mm-hmm a i think is somewhat false because oftentimes like they

1090
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:13,200
they are putting less resources toward making the remake happen and they don't have to put as many

1091
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:23,680
resources and uh and be um i think you can go through yeah and be i i think that uh the remaking

1092
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:32,720
something with with a director or a team that has seen the original thing and thinks this was cool

1093
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:40,800
i want to do it my way and better is often super valuable like the example often often like the

1094
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,560
example i think it would be more valuable if they changed the name but i think here's some i think

1095
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:55,920
let let let me just i have a few examples beyond xcom going back to movies scarface is a uh remake

1096
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:05,360
of a like a silent film a silent era uh film and uh the thing which is in my opinion the single

1097
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:15,280
greatest horror movie ever made is basically a remake of a very shitty 60s sci-fi movie called

1098
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,280
the thing from another world okay you brought up the scarface in a discussion we had before and i

1099
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:25,120
think that's probably an example of something that skirts the line between a remake and a reimagining

1100
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:30,880
because there's there's no way that like that the silent movie has like the same script or or the

1101
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,760
same like direct like so much i'm assuming has changed that it really seems like a whole new

1102
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,240
thing it's not just like a i don't know what it's based on or anything i don't know if like the the

1103
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:44,800
movie was was the basis of that foundation but like you know that's one of those things that's not

1104
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,880
well i don't know and i want to make though nate yeah with your whole uh argument about like the

1105
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:59,760
resources is that like that is i will give you a very idealist viewpoint but i think that it's

1106
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:06,240
possible that they need remakes to make money so that they can make the other dude yeah bet on a

1107
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:11,840
sure thing to make the like because the thing is with square enix specifically like we all know

1108
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,920
that they've been bleeding money out of their games they keep saying that every game because they

1109
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,400
make such bad choices right i mean yeah they make terrible choices but they release tomb raider the

1110
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:25,520
same week as fallout four that's a brilliant idea or you know even just focusing on the final fantasy

1111
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,960
brand like they made three final fantasy thirteens after the first one was not even liked what what

1112
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,760
was that about that is not sure that the first one is not liked the first one is well beloved by a

1113
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:41,120
myriad of people who have you just have to look at the sales figures overall okay yes it did i think

1114
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,120
it actually might have sold better than any other final fantasy besides like seven i think that's not

1115
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,760
because it was good games have done pretty okay and a lot of people have done worse like even after

1116
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,760
the second one did much worse like why would you make a third one at that point doesn't make sense

1117
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,200
i don't know because they were probably because they had the assets and they could throw it together

1118
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,320
that's not a good excuse that's a bad excuse but anyway is that they they are bleeding money

1119
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:08,080
they made a bunch of games that they made over budget even though those games sold unbelievably

1120
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,280
well they didn't sell enough to make back the stupid budgets you know yeah we're like tomb raider

1121
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:18,640
sold like fucking five million copies and they still said it was the basis of my criticism is

1122
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:24,080
this is bad art and like okay it's probably a great financial decision but it's making shitty

1123
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:30,080
art but the thing is like if we're talking about this team like let's say i mean if you're if you

1124
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:35,200
were saying resources is like a nebulous thing where their resources could somehow get transplanted

1125
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:40,480
to another studio like well i'm not saying that but ultimate philanthropists and just give all

1126
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,640
their you know give all the talent that they have for Final Fantasy VII to a studio that can actually

1127
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,400
but like if that's not the case then the question is how are they gonna make up for all this loss

1128
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,600
they've had make Final Fantasy XVI just do but they haven't even finished Final Fantasy XV and

1129
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,800
they probably already sunk too much money into that game and it's gonna be a financial disaster

1130
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,320
well that's their fault dude that's not a thing to make their money back and they think Final Fantasy

1131
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:12,480
VII i'm not saying it's necessarily a good idea but like they clearly think dude i get it Final Fantasy VII

1132
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:19,760
even the original is still a top selling game if you go on to the ps4 and you go to the top sellers

1133
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:25,200
bracket it's Final Fantasy VII is always the top selling game on the ps4 it's it's true you know

1134
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:29,680
that's that's fine i i get it i know why they do it and if i were the if i were their executive i'd

1135
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:35,120
probably do it too but none of this changes the fact that it is going to pollute the legacy of the

1136
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:39,840
original by objectively being a worse thing i know it to be true i'm not arguing that point in the

1137
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:46,560
nothing about any of us say against any remake really matters because we're all just nostalgia

1138
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,680
fags that's that's right yep that's all that matters the only one here who's not a nostalgia

1139
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:59,760
fag as yeah you're superior no if you're a legend of zelda ocarina of time on the 3ds fixed uh the

1140
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:05,280
biggest problem to the game unfortunately i still think it's a worse game because it's on the 3ds

1141
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:11,520
and not on my television where i can actually see the entire world here's a difference of opinion

1142
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:20,160
that i have i think that um like i strongly prefer playing games on handhelds to playing them on a big

1143
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:26,080
tv these days well that's weird i like that all the wrong things to me especially especially big

1144
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:32,400
rpgs because with big rpgs i want to take it out of my pocket play a few battles i don't go

1145
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,800
anywhere i don't leave my house digi digi digi digi you gotta you gotta listen to him on this one

1146
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,920
because he's right playing uh some an rpg on your game boy in bed was how i spent most of my

1147
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:47,840
childhood and it was objectively the best you guys are animals i think that's it all handhelds games

1148
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:53,440
are objectively inherently trash advanced games in there i played it all they should never have

1149
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:59,680
been made they should do the game only sp every game has zero artistic merit if it's not on my

1150
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:04,320
fucking television set or on a screen big enough for me to sit in front of and fucking watch

1151
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:09,680
like a human being not like an animal in a dog house with a fucking game boy advanced a fucking

1152
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:16,400
pokemon made sense on a handheld console because it was like you had you had your your your fucking

1153
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:23,120
n64 that was doing all this crazy shit right but pokemon didn't need all that crazy shit so like

1154
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:28,640
it it was a fucking 2d game that doesn't give me this fire but now you do crazy shit in your pocket

1155
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:34,080
yeah like that's the big crazy shit should be on a big screen where i can fully appreciate it

1156
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:41,200
because of the scale of everything doesn't even that you look up in the distance and you see this

1157
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:46,640
huge mountain you see that mountain and you scale the mountain that's actually the one and only

1158
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:51,680
criteria for whether something is actually good or worthless whether or not it's a handheld or an

1159
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:56,400
actual game which is on a real screen was on game boy and it was the best game ever made and

1160
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:01,440
that's the end of it it's on a console because it didn't have huge scale but

1161
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,440
that's right mother three was originally going to be an that is irrelevant to my point you're

1162
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,080
saying that you can't make an epic story they adapted it no not the story i'm talking about the

1163
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:21,520
visuals you don't make a 3d game with epic scale graphics like a game like ocarina of time where

1164
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,640
part of the appeal is it is that you see big mountain and you go climb big mountain and it

1165
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:32,640
looks huge on your tv as opposed to your little picture why can't a picture be small and still

1166
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:39,520
good here's here's my here's my uh counterpoint to that do you play with 3d on digi no because it

1167
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,920
makes my eyes bleed so so here's the thing you play with 3d on that completely no i appreciate

1168
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:52,960
don't get me wrong i know that the 3d in that game looks really good but it makes my eyes bleed

1169
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,760
and i can't look at it and my argument here is so we're making the complaint that it's less epic

1170
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:03,200
because you're not doing the thing that makes it like i can't i literally can't it makes my eyes

1171
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,560
hurt too much well that sounds like a personal problem but like i'm making the complaint that

1172
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,600
it's objectively garbage because you gotta fucking bend your body over like a no you fucking jesse

1173
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,200
look at a time you gotta strain your eyes looking at a tiny fucking baby screen

1174
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,400
there's no fucking point but why would you not want to be sitting in a chair or a couch or

1175
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:25,280
something comfortable like a human being why do you want to live like an animal why do you want

1176
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,520
to be a fucking savage in the one everyone don't play fucking why don't you just go crawl outside

1177
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,360
your tp and take a shit in the dirt guys that's shabby as ever you're barely even human a film

1178
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:42,240
a film aficionado make the argument that oh yeah that movie that you saw in theaters and it was

1179
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:47,360
my like like fucking what's a mad max theory road yeah that's gonna look just as good on your

1180
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:53,120
fucking iphone as it does in theaters no talking about that that's the difference between like

1181
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:58,320
it may not look just as good on your iphone as it does in theaters but it will look almost as good

1182
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:03,840
on your tablet as it does on your tv because you're not in a fucking theater a theater experience

1183
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,440
is completely different i don't care how good it looks on my tablet i think that even something

1184
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,560
on my fucking tablet which it shouldn't be because my tablet is a crappy little handheld device

1185
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,040
that fits in my fucking whole pocket and i can't whatever you want why are you why are you gonna

1186
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:21,280
take that away from people who like to watch things on the tablet because nobody deserves to have

1187
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:25,760
anything that sucks i want the world to have things that are good and i want the world to have

1188
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:30,240
good hands and that is why and that's why they should not remake the final fantasy seven remake

1189
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:37,200
it does not deserve to exist you have to know what's good the buttons are too close to my fingers

1190
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:42,320
and they're all too tacky and they suck it's a shitty controller it's like it's like playing

1191
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:47,200
like like like putting your hands on a plank of wood with buttons and then holding it six inches

1192
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:52,480
from your face and you can't be comfortable with it when i could have a beautiful sleek controller

1193
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,920
in my hand that is built for hands because it doesn't need to account for screens or how small

1194
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:04,800
it has to be a physical controller so okay so you want to you want to talk about better versus

1195
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:11,840
worse uh so ocarina of time works i would say as well on a console as it does on a handheld i'm

1196
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,800
not going to argue that but if you want to talk about the best zelda game which is majora's mask

1197
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:23,600
majora's mask is so much fucking better on a handheld because you can do a bus ride and in that bus

1198
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:29,120
ride have i ever done a bike ride you what the fuck are you talking about what is this about a

1199
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:34,320
bus ride so if he's saying that you can play you can play through a mission by the end of a bus

1200
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:42,720
ride i know the mission a cycle or a side quest it compartmentalizes uh a game that is like it

1201
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:48,240
intended to be replayed a whole fucking bunch i do all of my gaming better on a handheld i do all

1202
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:54,400
of my gaming in 10 hour chunks i don't play 20 minutes of a game and then put it in my pocket

1203
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:59,280
i turn on the tv and i have to sit there all day because if it takes me more than three days to

1204
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:04,080
beat a game i will never beat that game i really where this argument is concerned i'm with matthew

1205
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:09,520
mitosis uh because i had a psp and a d i had every fucking handheld in the world and like matthew

1206
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:14,400
mitosis says in his peace walker a metal gear solid review that um like the game was designed to be

1207
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,640
in mission format so that you could play it like on a bus but like right on the bus and you're playing

1208
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,280
it and you finish a mission and you've still got five minutes like okay what do i do do i try another

1209
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:28,880
mission or do i turn it off now just wait either way it's not really doesn't really perfectly work

1210
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,400
that has happened to me every time i've tried to play every time i ever try to play a game

1211
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,920
like a real game on like a ds or something i love like for me the only kind of games i can actually

1212
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:44,320
play the way that mobile games are intended to be played is if it's like don't touch the

1213
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:49,520
white tiles and it's like i'm just touching tiles and then it's over when they the doctor says you're

1214
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:54,720
up and i i hit exit and it's done and the game is over forever you know like i kind of agree that's

1215
01:26:54,720 --> 01:27:00,640
the kind of game that i think is a good a good handheld game you know so yeah like for me the

1216
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:08,560
ones that i think are the best are weirdly the big sandboxy rpgs because that those are games

1217
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:14,560
that you can play for whatever period of time you feel like playing and get a good amount except

1218
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:19,760
for 10 hours because if you try to play for 10 hours then the strain on your eyes and hands

1219
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:25,280
will break you and yeah that's the length of time i want to play the game for okay guys guys

1220
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:31,200
so argument is like kind of related to remakes but kind of almost not at all so i think we should

1221
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:35,680
roll it back a little bit you know yeah i just wanted to get heated about that for yeah yeah

1222
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:40,160
we we thought we were going to stab each other over final fantasy seven but we

1223
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:45,680
turns out it was about each other over handheld jrpgs which is let me let me just say that like

1224
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:51,920
i want to be super clear to everybody watching that like when i see an old character like brought

1225
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,320
back to life like the first time this happened to me was when i first heard about kingdom hearts one

1226
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,960
and i saw cloud was in it that's what made me buy that game i thought that was the coolest thing

1227
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:06,560
that ever happened and because in no way that was celebrating the existence of cloud that was

1228
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,440
not something that in any way changed the interpretation of the character and when cloud

1229
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:17,760
got into smash it was the same thing and just today when i saw ramza lugria ramza bewulf the

1230
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:23,520
3d screenshots of him and the new decidia that is a celebration of the character that in no way detracts

1231
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:28,640
from their legacy things like that could not be more excited about them they're fucking fantastic

1232
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:36,000
it's when i have a problem when something comes along and is trying to one up uh someone who like

1233
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,960
like sakaguchi is the is the guy and the the writer whose name i forget uh who made final

1234
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,200
fantasy seven what it is they're the guys who did it and now we got these new guys i say they're

1235
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:51,040
gonna redo it and you know i i just don't think there's even a ghost of a chance of them really

1236
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:56,640
getting what that game was about and communicating it in a in a meaningful way and for that and i

1237
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:01,120
for that reason i think it will only pollute the legacy and i don't want that to happen

1238
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,120
and so that's the real reason at the end of the day i don't like remakes in addition to the other

1239
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:12,640
reasons that we talked about before anime is a japanese colloquial

1240
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:28,960
oh Jesus christ what a bombshell what a bombshell so so you know i just want to ask you know as

1241
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:34,000
our is our special guest of the day um uh jeff mother's basement i just want to ask you your

1242
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,920
thoughts on as the only one of us as the only one of us who's met sakaguchi how does it feel to know

1243
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,400
that you are advocating the pollution of his artistic vision how does that feel you feel good

1244
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:51,840
about that well okay so for one thing sakaguchi's artistic vision is that final fantasy six is the

1245
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,080
best final fantasy but he likes final 97 too it's not like he hates the game he doesn't want it

1246
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:01,680
raped he doesn't want to see it raped he doesn't want to see it raped and you know sakaguchi um

1247
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:09,200
man my my opinion is that you guys should all go play terra battle because uh sakaguchi is making

1248
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:14,960
new cool shit i would love to i should i should um and that's a mobile game by the way better on

1249
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:22,800
handheld mother fuckers um but um yeah i don't play the yeah go ahead go ahead it's it's actually

1250
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,680
okay so terra battle pretty cool game it's all about positioning tiles it's kind of like halfway

1251
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:32,960
between a puzzle game like a match three puzzle game and an rpg uh but not like puzzle quest

1252
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:38,240
anyway like yeah it's like puzzle dragon or something i am not strictly speaking advocating

1253
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:44,320
the final fantasy seven remake reaping the shit out of everything that's already been done they're

1254
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:48,960
just going back for another round yeah because i they they did already destroy it with advent

1255
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:58,080
children um and they they which i mean let's be real the only to to to quote uh to quote max

1256
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:04,160
from life is strange the only well not to quote but to paraphrase the only good final fantasy

1257
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:09,840
movie is the spirits within um interesting which because there's not a lot of competition

1258
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:15,040
there but okay because they didn't try to make something that was the same fucking thing wait

1259
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:20,640
wait how old is this girl who said that uh she's like 18 18 oh okay i thought she's like 13 i was

1260
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:25,840
gonna call her hipster that's not so bad no yeah like what she specifically says is she's like i

1261
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:30,800
don't care what anyone says this is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time and that game

1262
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:38,400
was published by square enix so um yeah so you know but anyway i am still sour over this whole

1263
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:46,560
i mean they fired sakaguchi over yeah he resigned he resigned to be fair he resigned but it was like

1264
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:53,120
you know that that whole japanese resiner will right tell you thank you coach him it did recently um

1265
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:59,360
and uh well actually i don't know that i can't speak for sakaguchi because he didn't tell me that

1266
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:07,120
anyway i am not advocating them destroying his vision of this game that in part he made for his

1267
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:11,760
dying mother and which obviously was very died she was already dead dude she was dead oh she was dead

1268
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,640
yeah yeah so which was obviously which is the most beautiful vision and i love this game so much and

1269
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:21,440
to learn something like that years after playing it my god people what are you doing what are you

1270
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:28,480
doing so so i am not necessarily advocating that i think that a final fantasy remake could

1271
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:33,760
potentially be good and i think that gameplay wise like the thing is this could fun to play this

1272
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:40,240
could rape or this i don't want to say rape over and over again this could fucking destroy every

1273
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:49,200
bit of artistic integrity that final fantasy seven has just like uh shin megami tensei four destroyed

1274
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,880
every bit of artistic integrity that the shin megami tensei series has but it's still it's

1275
01:32:54,880 --> 01:33:00,000
still a fucking fun game to play which means people still consider it to be a good shin megami

1276
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,600
tensei game and this could still be like a good final fantasy game but here's the here's what i would

1277
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:14,320
advocate um get uh what i would advocate playing final fantasy seven if you feel like you want to

1278
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:20,800
play final fantasy seven take out your psp or your ps vita get it on your psp or your ps vita

1279
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:25,200
and play it that way or on steam why do you want them to have the worst possible experience

1280
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:31,680
because it's much more palatable to play it on a handheld where uh the load screen or your ps4

1281
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:36,640
where you won't have to play it play it play it on a fucking place the sony playstation you know

1282
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:40,640
look fill the great thing is you've got options you're gonna love final fantasy seven you're not

1283
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:44,080
gonna want to play it for 20 minutes at a time before breaking your neck you're gonna want to

1284
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:50,720
wear crt television set and a sony playstation with a fucking memory card and one of the skinny

1285
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:55,680
original controllers and you fucking sit there and you take your fucking medicine until you

1286
01:33:55,680 --> 01:34:01,520
beat in the fucking game and then you could have an opinion you talk like an animal he's right

1287
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:06,560
it's objectively the best way to do it also you should do it in 1997 if possible or 1990 and be

1288
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:12,160
like eight times of twelve yeah yeah so the best the best way to do it just smack yourself in the

1289
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:17,200
head until you remember what computer graphics are capable of now and then go back and and play

1290
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:26,320
but yeah like so i i think that that game provides a better experience on handheld like all

1291
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:31,920
rpgs but okay i would advocate playing it that way he really wants he's cruising for a bruising

1292
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:37,440
i gotta let's let's let's move on past this point we're getting uh can we end this i i you know i

1293
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,960
think we've wrapped up you know what just just i wanted to do one thing before we ended which was

1294
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:47,280
just to read a couple of just to get an idea of what people in general think about remakes like the

1295
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:52,080
the slobbering masses i wanted to read three of my favorite comments on my final fantasy seven

1296
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:57,920
remake video all right here we go uh oh where where they go hang on okay here's here's the first one

1297
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:02,560
that's kind of reasonable uh why do people focus more on the negative side of the remake than on

1298
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:07,680
the positive side i know square enix completely screwed the company in the seventh gen but come on

1299
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:14,560
they can't make another mistake after 13 and 14 love that one okay i've got two more um what is it

1300
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:21,120
i hope you don't get this game after you just made this video this video is pointless and cancerous

1301
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:28,640
and finally my favorite one of all to cap it off by calypso handjack my hero stopped watching after

1302
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:36,720
30 seconds cloud did not wear purple guys a fucking retard stop making videos thank you calypso

1304
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:45,440
at the end of the day you got to go with your handjack i'm gonna jack your hand all right that's

1305
