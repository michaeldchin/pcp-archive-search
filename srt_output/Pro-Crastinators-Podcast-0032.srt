I agree has a lifetime a lifetime more like

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:50,080
Nate says he's feeling fit and fine, and I gotta say that I feel nothing of the sort post rad con and that's what this

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,720
Podcast is all about fat fuckery

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,240
That's right

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,800
journey of being fat and not

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,160
It's I think just every aspect related to to fatness just

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,220
Odious forms. Yeah, of which none of us have because we all have I

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Well, that's that's true

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,560
If we didn't have it before red con we do now that's that's for sure action giraffe was it worth it though?

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
I think it was

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,720
You know you can't get a giraffe job like that anywhere

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
It's all right

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,280
He kind of he coils his neck around your dick. Yes, that's how it is

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,520
So, let me give a little bit of backstory here like because right before rad con

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,120
We were all talking about like these sick diets. We were all gonna go on or we're on even

41
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,480
Jesse had just lost like 30 pounds or something through like just fasting for a month

42
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Jesse's an insane person and can do these things. I don't know how Nate had just lost a bunch of way my broken

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Brilliant, I'm down like 25 pounds for when I start so I'm looking good. I'm under 180 now

44
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
I had lost like a

45
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,480
Like 10 to 15 pounds before rad con Ben was talking about how he's bringing the squat rack down and me and him and DeVue

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,700
We're all gonna use the squat rack Ben. Why don't you tell us what happened with the squat rack?

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,320
Well, is that still a problem? Well, yeah, it is because okay

48
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,640
My squat rack at my last place

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,320
I had the squat rack, but we didn't have a place to put it because our landlord

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,040
Despite promising us the basement kept the basement locked and wouldn't let us in it

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,520
We were gonna set it up there. So when I finally moved down here to the fucking Casa de Conrad

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,200
I

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:45,080
Well, you know we we disassembled the squat rack put it in the car brought it to my parents house loaded up into the other car brought

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,440
It down here set it up realized I was missing a crucial part specifically the pegs on which the barbell rests

55
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,240
So yeah, so I called up my friend in my old place and was like hey are the are the parts lying around somewhere

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,520
And he was like yes, I will mail them to you. I was like, thank you friend

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,120
So like a week and a half later or like two weeks later

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,160
They arrive in the mail and it's the wrong part. I realized I was missing two parts two crucial parts

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,600
And he sent the other ones and I was like, oh are the other ones lying around and he was like, let me look

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Oh, yep, here they are and so now and so now I'm waiting for those to arrive and once they they're

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
They'll be here soon

62
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, well, that's that that's great, but I just want to lift

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,360
I just want to fucking squat and deadlift and bench and be a strong boy

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Understandable used to be however because I hate going to the gym

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,480
I fucking hate leaving the house to work out if I had the rack in the house

66
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:47,520
I would lift I would lift on the regular I have I have a I have a pull-up bar

67
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,400
You know like like in rad con house

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,600
There's a there's that pull-up bar in the kitchen, but I've got one that I'm looking at 24 hours a day

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,800
So all the time I just get up and bust out a bunch of pull-ups. Oh, yeah, like 30 now. I'm doing I'm killing

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm a strong boy right now a lot of fucking pull-ups

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
My record is 50 my record is 50

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm not that's that's legit that's legit when I was like 18 not not all at once right all at once all at once

73
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,920
We've got the we've got the one here I've been doing the same

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,120
I'm up to I'm up to guess guess how many I'm up to I'm gonna guess to 13 15

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
10

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Human ability have been warped

77
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Yeah, I'm up to five five five, okay

78
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,120
After like a week of doing pull-ups on the you know the biggest thing by far

79
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,160
Cuz yeah, the biggest thing is wait if you weigh little you can do like that's the most important thing even more than

80
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Well, so so Radcon happened and I guess I

81
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,400
Decided everyone else I guess sort of got folded into my my my my big

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,760
Theatrics here that we just all completely let loose no one gave a fuck

83
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,000
Eating it all we ate out like 18 times we ate giant I hop and waffle house meals. We fucking we I

84
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,200
Personally, I drank probably two boxes of wine in the span of a week like you know, it was just non-stop debauchery

85
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
We were truly handboys that week I went there prepared for a week of decadence. That's what I

86
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,640
When I was there, I had no idea that that wasn't normal what you were doing

87
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,280
Well

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,360
It would be normal if it weren't for the fact that we were all on diets

89
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Well, yeah, I went from I went from like before I got there like frying one chicken breast a day

90
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,640
To after getting there like going to Wawa and shoving ten donuts in my mouth

91
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,200
16 times a day. I was not planning to start a diet or a workout thing during Radcon

92
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,400
I went there with the full intention of you know, just you know indulging my all my vices and you know, you know

93
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,400
Just having fun just having fun with my hand boy. The problem is for Ben Radcon never ended and he's

94
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,960
Because at Radcon it was like yeah celebration. Let's you know, I'll get the soda with every meal

95
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,120
I even bought some sodas for the house for me to drink man. I was drinking alcohol every night, right?

96
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,400
So then Radcon's over and we're all like me and Ben and DeVoo are all like alright now

97
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,440
We're gonna start eating good again, and I'm immediately like I have withdrawals for everything

98
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,080
Yeah, I hadn't been smoking for like a month and a half

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,040
Ben comes around me and him start smoking together then somehow gets me up to like

100
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,240
Then somehow get like three or four a night Ben burns through like three packs in two weeks

101
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,120
And we're both fucking smoking up a storm. Don't tell them about my vices. I

102
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I can't stop everything

103
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,440
I

104
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,600
Finally it took me like a couple weeks to like put the soda back away and be like, okay

105
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,200
No more soda again, and then I bought in a lot. I'm now smoking an electronic cigarette. So yes

106
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,680
Here's cancer. Good healthy excellent. I don't know if it cures cancer. That's that's what I hear

107
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,480
Maybe helps avoid it to some extent. Oh, yeah, where's my vape? Where's my oh, no, where's my vape? Oh, no

108
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Crisis mode

109
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,200
You know what let's let's take this, you know, this is very this we're all just kind of talking about our own fitness right now

110
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,960
But let's take this a little bit more broad. Why do we all care so much?

111
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,000
What because it's the only thing that matters in life is being hashtag not fat I

112
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,160
Agree for me

114
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,880
It's not that the only thing that matters in life is having everyone know that you're well-laid

115
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,400
You're happy people have to know that your hashtag well-laid so that they'll know that your hashtag not fat if you

116
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,880
You have to get not fat to get well-laid so they know that you're not fat because just being not fat isn't enough to make them know

117
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,400
That you're not fat people are insane and they'll still think of you as fat like on the inside fat is like

118
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,120
Everyone is always looking down on you first for one reason or another and in my mind is just be that's their way of saying you're fat

119
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,880
So you have to get then and then you have to get all the girls and then you have to parade this this

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,400
Secession of sluts around these trophy girlfriends take them to all the parties and go look I do it with hot girls

121
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,960
Look, I'm not fat and they go well. He does have a girl around his arm. I guess he's finally truly

122
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,120
You know fat Jesse

123
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,280
I as the guy around here who's the most long-term committed to two fitness goals

124
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
For the longest stretch at least anyway

125
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:05,080
It is absolutely because I want people to see me and think this guy has his life together because I'm a deeply insecure person and

126
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Only am happy when I'm feeling externally validated and I know it's because when you look fit people like you more

127
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,600
They'll assume that they are a better person and you're you know more likely to not even have girls

128
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,840
But you don't even get treated you don't even get treated like a human being unless you're a certain level of attractiveness

129
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:31,480
Yeah, let's be real. Yeah, you start with that with it. Well, I gotta say, you know, I'm I'm not that cons like for me personally

130
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,980
It's not like I need other people's validation

131
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,320
But when I see other people like Nate who are fit

132
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,880
I do think much more highly of them as a person just like automatically when I see fit people

133
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm like, yeah, like anyone okay like not just any fit person though

134
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,840
Right if it's just like some bro, and he seems kind of douchey then I'm like, oh, whatever, you know

135
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,600
But if it's someone who's cool and they're fit. It's like a double whammy

136
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,080
Cool and fit let me have fucking everything. Let me tell you let me tell you about what a great person I am

137
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,560
See I have realized but by living, you know through my learned experience

138
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,920
See, I think I'm a pretty mediocre looking guy

139
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,800
Even when I was more fit like, you know, I still just I still just look like myself, right?

140
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,200
Like I mean people I think people work out with like they have these long-term goals

141
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,920
Like they want to look like I don't know they want to look like

142
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,520
Yeah, they want to look like Z's or they want to look like, you know, they want to be ripped or they want to be Brad Pitt

143
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,400
Some muscle guy or whatever, but like in reality the changes are subtle and

144
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,160
No, like almost no one ever fucking looks gets huge or looks like a fucking model or

145
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,120
No, no one ever it looks like their goals because there's things about your body that you can change and there's things about your body

146
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,600
That you can't like like your overall proportions are all gonna stay the same

147
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,680
You know like your height and like your shoulder to waist ratio and stuff

148
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,480
Depending where you start that can I mean if your hips shrink when you lose weight then you know a little bit

149
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Anyway, I realized that you know like even even if I got even when I'm more muscular than I was now

150
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,200
I still like, you know, I still had kind of like a stocky build, you know, whatever and I'm just like, you know

151
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,320
being fit

152
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,160
doesn't matter and

153
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,360
Now I don't respect people for being fit. Well, I what this ties into my I mean, I mean I do

154
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,400
I mean, I think it's cool and all but like I used to I

155
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,440
Used to feel bad, right? Like watching say like like watching anime or something like the main character would be like pretty fit

156
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,620
Right, and I'd be like man, you know, I you know, I wish I looked like that or something like like I wish I was like

157
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,880
DBZ man DBZ inspired a generation including me to work now

158
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,320
But now I'm like, you know what looking like that is like half genetics and and it doesn't matter

159
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,280
And I no longer think that people are better for you just because they're worth it

160
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,120
I think I think they're worse if they're not. I don't think they're better if they are well

161
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,280
No, I do think they're better if they are I think I think what it is is like if there's a cool person

162
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,160
And he just happens to be fat you you don't hold it against them, but you like yeah

163
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,760
That's a shame. Oh, yeah, but if there's a bad person who's fat then they're way worse. Well, you know

164
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,320
I actually really like fat people who like own their fatness and throw it around those people are cool

165
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,880
You know, here's what it is. Here's what it is. If you if you like someone

166
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Then yeah

167
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,160
That they're fat. It's true. It's totally true. It's really not a question about whether they're fat

168
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,440
All right, imagine this for a second. Do you like them? I don't know if I agree Ben

169
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't think they'll like I know I think that people who like you like you less if you're fat

170
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,080
I genuinely don't know if you know if someone's cool then they're being fat is a part of their cool

171
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,600
I would say it's not that they don't it's not that they think less of you is this that they they feel like a

172
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,720
Separate sort of little disappointment in you that yeah, exactly like I have no chime in anyone

173
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,040
I know who like anyone who I know who is cool who is fat and I know that they like

174
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,880
Don't necessarily wish they were fat. Yeah, but that's it

175
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,440
That's but I feel like this constant Chloe like every time I look at them

176
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,600
I think God why won't you fucking not be fat anymore? Okay?

177
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,880
Here's what you people talked about like here's here's an example Drake and Josh right Josh peck started that show off chubby and adorable

178
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,040
Right and that's was part of his persona right is this chubby adorable guy by the time the show ended

179
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,080
He had somehow lost all his weight gotten tall gotten like really prettier than he was prettier than Drake at the end

180
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Yeah, you know I'll drink at the end a hundred thousand dollars in debt

181
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,080
His whole persona just like didn't work out was fat Drake so

182
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
So so me and my brother

183
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,000
We go up we're watching that show back when we're kids loving that show and we watch that decline of his persona didn't work anymore

184
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,980
Well, it just so happened that my brother himself was a very chubby boy for like all his life until he was like 16

185
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,160
When the when the summer drought of 2012 came in and it was a hundred and five degrees every day

186
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,640
And he played tennis up against the side of a barn every day for hours and lost all of his weight

187
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,920
And one fell swoop and as he was doing it

188
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,360
I was like, you know like now that you're gonna lose your fat

189
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,960
You're not gonna be able to tell the same kind of jokes anymore

190
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,960
You're gonna be like Josh peck you need to adapt your style

191
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,760
All of his skits all of the like videos we did that were like little comedy things

192
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,440
He completely changed his persona to being like this like freaky weirdo guy and it totally works

193
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,160
So it's important whether or not you'll lose your charm if you get fit is just to be smart and adaptive and create a new

194
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,040
People are way terrible people are terrible at adapting to changes in their lives in general if they were better at that

195
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,320
I think that would help a lot with people like getting fit in the first place and then avoiding these like oh if I get fit like

196
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,960
Oh, I'm gonna have to change things about my life

197
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,280
You know just just be a new person just do things that you know lie to that

198
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:08,360
There's a great quote from from hot diggity demon Max Gilliardy where he said like you can't be funny if you're not funny looking

199
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,880
And after he said that like no after he said that

200
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,480
I looked at every single person I consider funny and I realized all of them were funny looking, you know

201
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,680
There's an episode point out looking in what way like Robin Williams doesn't look funny, but he still yeah

202
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,120
He does he looks incredibly funny because he looks like that guy looks like he will tell Jim an amazing joke

203
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,600
He just looks like a happy dude. I was gonna say Jim Carrey because Jim Carrey is spectacularly handsome

204
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,600
But that guy makes some pretty funny face. He's really funny. I don't

205
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm funny looking as in like bad looking. I mean funny looking as in you look as though you can be funny

206
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,760
There's lots of people I look at and I go that person looks so fucking boring and unfunny and shitty

207
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,040
To do is not look funny, so that's true funny

208
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
He does not look weird as fuck

209
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,760
He's got like a weird bald head in spite of being like

210
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,960
He's he's a year older than me dude, I think he might be the most boring person I've ever looking

211
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,400
There is no scientific correlation between funny-lookingness

212
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
My confirmation bias

213
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,840
Clear

214
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
What's up, if you have like a like a

215
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,040
Like exaggerated features that you look kind of like a cartoon character or you can make funny expressions

216
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,200
Then it's easier to be like be visually funny

217
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,960
Anyone can make funny expressions anyone in the world can figure out that's not true look funny. It's not true

218
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,160
Is it if you have to accept this idea then you have to accept that you're funny-looking and you don't want to do that

219
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
Yeah, I know I'm funny-looking

220
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,000
What are you encouraging people to do when you say like you have to be funny-looking or you'll never be funny?

221
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,840
You're just living to figure out how to look funny the worst conversation

222
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,360
Let's get off of this. This is dumb. What are we talking about?

223
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,960
So I was thinking about why I would be drawn to like big muscly people

224
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Because you're gay

225
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,720
Viewers at home spoiler. It's cuz he's gay. There's nothing more. There's nothing more beautiful than the male form. Okay, go on gay aside

226
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,800
You know I was thinking I think of myself as a pretty smart guy, right?

227
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,320
Like smarter than most people and so I think that like when other people are like there like what makes them impressive or whatever

228
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,240
Is that they're smart? I feel like yeah, but I'm smarter than that guy so that guy doesn't impress me

229
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,640
But then when someone's fit, it's like I'm not fit. So if someone's fitter than me

230
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,920
It's like I have some trust in them to be the muscle in the scenario

231
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,760
But there you go. There you go. You're coming from a place of ignorance

232
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,200
You're coming from a place of lack and it's making you and it's warping your perceptions if you had well you would if you had that

233
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,160
But okay, let's just how worthless it truly is well Ben

234
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,400
Let's say that we were out like let's say like at rad con like if we had been out for a drive

235
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,880
And my car had broken down in the middle of the highway and like who do you think I could most reliably expect to be able to

236
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,000
Push my car. I'm going with Nate and then probably Jesse next and not at all

237
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,560
Hippo can ride in the fucking trunk while we push the car

238
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:42,280
Like well like who would be physically capable of doing it. Yeah, that's what I'm saying like you have to innate like to me

239
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,840
There's some when I see someone who's physically fit and they're around it's like I I know I have someone

240
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,160
I can rely on when I need something physical to happen if I were to get if I hang out

241
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,440
My favorite thing about hanging out in like the city with some like my cousin boy. Who's this big motherfucker, right?

242
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,540
He's I mean he's fat, but he's also just big

243
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,640
If I'm hanging out with Boyd no one will ever fuck with me because if I was alone

244
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,840
I don't look imposing at all, but that dude looks scary. Who's gonna fuck with you anyway?

245
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
How often do you get into physical altercation?

246
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,880
Will you live in RoboCop world then when was the last time you lived the house leave the left yeah exactly

247
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,880
Okay, the point the point doesn't it doesn't really matter if these things happen or not what what really

248
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,280
What is at the heart of the whole thing is that we perceive these people to be more useful?

249
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
So we you know have a positive

250
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,940
You know because I know that I never get into physical altercation

251
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:01,040
Well, I have a constant paranoia that every single person in the world wants me dead and is going to kill me at some point

252
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,860
Yeah, but they're not gonna they're not gonna do it as a fair fight

253
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,680
Paranoia, but I'm smarter so I realized that I'm not gonna do it in a fair fight

254
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,240
Being fit has all kinds of real-world advantages and you never know when they're gonna be needed

255
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,760
And it's kind of a safety mechanism as well as like it helps your health

256
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,360
You know, there's a bunch of benefits to to be in fit. So it's a whole package. It's definitely positive basis

257
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,640
That's the thing with me. Is that like by not by not worrying about it. You mean?

258
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,600
No, I feel no by worrying about it

259
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,960
It just makes me feel more comfortable all the time sitting around like oh, hey

260
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,800
I did push-ups a few minutes ago. I'm okay with this feeling of just sitting or standing. It's a lot better

261
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,080
You know for me. I feel the rate what draws me to fitness is just how eat how like

262
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:53,240
I'm not all that tempted by like really delicious foods much more than I am just by like healthy food

263
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
like you know get some chicken and

264
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,360
Cook it with a tiny bit of butter and some water and some mushrooms and some cabbage and some

265
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
A spinach and then just eat that

266
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,160
I only like that taste slightly less than like a hamburger with like

267
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,720
Frot like like toasted buns and cream cheese and ketchup and a tomato

268
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,880
You know, but I feel a lot better after eating the other one. I feel like a lot of people

269
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:24,680
Can probably eat healthy and it's not even like wouldn't even be that hard if they just started because they're just not as tempted as other people may be

270
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,840
Yeah, I'm tempted by all food equally

271
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Um, which is to say a lot

272
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,760
So you might as well eat healthy then you might as well, you know, yeah

273
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,920
I am by far most attracted to food prepared by professionals. That is the kind of food that I gravitate

274
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,560
Well, I know I never I never eat professionally like like a mcdonald's professional

275
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,240
Here's why I here's why I never eat out because one it's too expensive and two I resent paying

276
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,880
I resent paying food preparers for their labor. I don't think they deserve it

277
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,440
I don't think anyone deserves anything every time I every time I look at a menu the number one thing

278
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,440
I I think about is like can I what can I order that can justify?

279
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,000
Having someone else making it something I couldn't make myself, you know, but it's really almost nothing. You can't just make it home

280
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,880
I just I I emphatically disagree

281
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,000
There is nothing I've eaten at a restaurant that I could replicate with anywhere even 50 percent of

282
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, yeah in terms of the details, but you know what the main details are all that matters

283
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,920
I know but 100 percent of it. This this whole thing is very interesting to me

284
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,880
The uh, the the way you guys are talking about how food is important

285
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,520
But to me the perfect world is a world in which all the only food there is

286
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Is that slop from the matrix that has all the nutrients you need basically soylent

287
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,440
All I want is that because then I don't have to even think about it. I can just work

288
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,200
I can do the things I need to do and I'll get a hundred percent of what I need supplements

289
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,040
Why don't you just become a supplement guy?

290
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,640
The only reason I don't is because I have to go out of my way to order it and currently soylent is not perfect

291
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,520
If we had the perfect thing that had everything I needed that would be that would be that I already do supplement

292
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,560
I have tons of whey protein like every day with shakes. I make delicious shakes, by the way, which are awesome

293
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
And they're super easy to make

294
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,200
But my dream is to not even have to spend any time on it

295
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,160
I would love to be a hamster with just like a spigot, you know with like a water bottle outside and just like put my

296
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,880
Mouth to it. I'm not all over my body. It's all I want. I do like food and making it

297
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,680
It's just I I like it, but I think of it as a human weakness that we crave it. I want it gone

298
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,760
I want to be a robot. I don't want to think about these things. I'm not really that extreme about it

299
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,520
Even if I had a robot body, I probably spend most of my time eating

300
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Okay, well if I was a robot I could eat anything and just discharge it and it would matter

301
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,280
If I could have enough synthetic parts in my body that like that eating didn't make me fat

302
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,400
I would just never not be eating. That would be like my whole life. Sure. We all would but the machines we have

303
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,960
You know do get fat, you know, I'm referring to the human body. We get fat. We got all these issues. So

304
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,200
I've been considering being bulimic just just you know for the intellectual experience of like, okay, I'm growing up

305
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about

306
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,640
Because then you can eat whatever you want. You can satisfy your cravings and then turn your teeth out of your face

307
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,520
Right, that that is one of the reasons that I haven't tried it yet

308
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,960
But maybe one I guess if you wear one of those mouth condoms, maybe

309
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,240
Well, it's just to go all the way down to your stomach. Yeah, I mean when you throw up. Yeah, okay

310
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
a mouth

311
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Wait, I don't I don't

312
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,480
Oh my god

313
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,520
You get just gotta be like you just gotta be like fucking uh

314
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,800
Josuke and fucking wear a fucking rubber glove down your throat. Yeah

315
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
Catch whatever it is

316
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Exactly

317
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,840
I'm gonna say be like Josuke and like punch through your stomach and just grab the food pull it out and then heal

318
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,440
In the most reasonable scene the most reasonable scene in the history of anime

319
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,720
When he fucking puts a rubber glove down his esophagus

320
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,640
Well, you know, whatever man to stand stands are well established to be crazy psychic things. They can do anything

321
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
So who cares

322
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,920
There's rules to these things the rules are they can do anything

323
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
I've personally never been fat

324
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,120
Just because of well

325
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,880
D

326
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,440
I'm saying I'm saying that I've never been fat. Nate has never been fat. That's true. The fattest I ever was

327
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,680
You know who else has never been fat hitler

328
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Oh

329
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,040
No, he got fat. If you look at the later part of anything. I don't care about being thin

330
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,040
It's uh, uh, go on the point was that that's thin privilege talking

331
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,520
You can't see your own privilege

332
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
All right, forget it. No, no, please

333
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,600
Well, give I think I don't really know what my point is. It's just that I

334
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,600
Exercises has never been like a lose weight thing. The only reason I've been exercising recently

335
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,960
Is because I'm tired of having a bony butt and I want a nice butt that I can sit on that doesn't feel like shit

336
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,280
You gotta eat big you gotta eat big

337
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,920
You know, I was I was gonna say the hardest thing in my life so far was like when I was right now

338
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,120
I'm I'm losing weight

339
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,920
But when I was trying to gain, you know muscle for a long time. It was really hard

340
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,960
Uh, significantly harder than right now just restricting calories to eat more than I was comfortable eating

341
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:14,520
Per meal and just having to really calculate physically come do it. It's hard. It's really hard. Yeah, if you break it up over the day

342
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,600
It's easier. That was what killed victor when he was trying to do boxing was like rest. Oh, yeah

343
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Like and rest and like yeah

344
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,560
I think a lot of people like anyone who doesn't know about like bulking doesn't realize like because uh, you know

345
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,160
My brother shade you guys all saw him. He's skinnier than all fuck, right?

346
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,080
Because he doesn't eat anything and like he's been for like months now

347
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,440
He's been working out like pretty regularly, but he hasn't really gained much because he just like

348
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,680
Even though he'll he'll move like you need to eat more and he'll be like I've been eating way more

349
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,800
I've been actually eating three meals a day and it's like

350
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,600
Yeah, you need to eat like 10 meals a day, buddy

351
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,320
He needs to get himself a calorie calculator and it's so just keep track of what you eat

352
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,240
And then you'll know like what you're doing now and then just add add some shit

353
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,640
You know, it's easy once you start thinking about the thing with calorie counting that I can't stand is that you have to

354
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,200
You have to expend calories thinking about it

355
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,920
It throws off the whole equation man. It's so much work try to think

356
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,360
I remember seeing a commercial advertising a cereal like

357
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,680
There's like all these cereals that say that they're really, you know

358
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,160
Have very few calories and then there was another cereal that came out saying it has even fewer calories

359
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,480
And the commercial is like a woman at a breakfast restaurant and she like looks at all the things and she has like a calorie scanner in her brain

360
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,920
Apparently non-diagetically. She looks at a donut 800 calories. She looks at like a waffle 400 calories

361
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,560
Then she looks at the competing brand. It's like 120 calories and she's like she's like i'll have that one

362
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,480
But then she looks at the other cereal 105 calories. She's like wait. No

363
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,080
I'll have that one and I watched that commercial when I was like a kid and and that was so retarded

364
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,920
I vowed to never calorie count because she looked like such an idiot doing it

365
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,680
I'm happy if no one else does it because I want everyone else to be a fat fuck because I'll only look better by comparison

366
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,400
It's great. Please continue. Please continue everyone my my fitness goals for here at fucking at digi house

367
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,200
Is I don't want to count my calories because I don't really feel like I need to lose much weight

368
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,760
but I do I do want to start like when I get that last part I want to start lifting because

369
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,280
I I like I haven't really gained or lost anyway

370
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,200
Uh, but I just want to get all right because even if you don't if you don't change what you eat at all, right?

371
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,440
Here's here's what's supposed to happen in theory if you don't change your dietary habits at all

372
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,280
But you start lifting then what starts to happen is your your you start you gain a little bit of muscle

373
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,600
Your metabolism goes up because your body has to burn more calories in order to maintain that muscle because muscle is more

374
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,920
Metabolically active than fat right um and then so just

375
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,440
If you start working out, you know, you will keep keep yourself at about the same weight

376
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,800
You won't gain or lose weight but more of your weight will be muscle and less will be unless will be right

377
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,000
Which is what I want to happen. So I don't I'm not that big about my diet

378
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,480
I just want to start lifting and fucking change my body composition because I'm because I'm a little bit

379
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,960
I guess I would say I'm a little on the skinny fat side right now

380
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,640
Which is a shame which is like the worst thing to be it is the worst it is the worst

381
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:20,360
But you so yeah be careful of that uh since are you following the teachings of ripeto mark ripeto because t-rex mode

382
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,080
Is always a danger when you're living the squat lifestyle doing that go mad gala milk a day

383
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,360
Yeah, I want to I want to be I don't want to be t-rex mode. I just I just want to be kind of the squat rack can be used for benching

384
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,280
Too it's got a I know I use mine for benching too. Yeah. Yeah, um

385
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,040
I want to bench all the time because I've always had my bench has always been my my worst lift

386
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's fuck lifting

387
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,360
Lifting is great. No it is not great shut up

388
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,480
You shut up. It feels good. We need it. We need it. There needs to be some discussion

389
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,920
The world needs to come together. We need to come together as a society and talk about how fucking boring

390
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,280
Lifting is it is boring. That's true miserable. Okay

391
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,720
Jeff everyone goes. Oh, you know, uh, yeah working out is hard

392
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,320
But you just gotta push through it and then you can do it. No, it's not hard. It's fucking boring

393
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I

394
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Why don't I just fucking kill myself

395
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,160
Well, I have to take out of my day to go lift is always the reason that I end up missing it, you know

396
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,240
Okay, here's here's here's all right. Yes, it is kind of boring

397
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:36,920
But I mean most people that exercise don't lift they do cardio and cardio is 10,000 times more boring than lifting

398
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,120
It's also more effective for overall health. They say cardio is a lot easier

399
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,880
It's a lot less boring because you're doing the same you can go on autopilot by just running on a treadmill

400
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,720
That's why it's fucking boring, dude. When you're lifting when you're lifting when you're lifting you have like a little micro goal

401
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,600
No, when you're lifting it's like it's like standing at a conveyor belt and the conveyor belt is your body

402
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,840
And you're just like Lucy shoving those chocolates into your mouth the same fucking repetition over and over lift it up and put it down

403
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Lift it up put it down

404
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,160
No, you have to like concentrate on what you're doing when you're lifting so it's less boring

405
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,480
There's actually like a risk. All right. Hang on. Good. Good. What's up?

406
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,880
The thing was like when I'm like running or cycling on a thing

407
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,080
Like it's a it's a repetitive thing you you can turn your brain off

408
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,280
But you can listen to music and that makes it not boring when you're lifting

409
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,080
You have to you have to concentrate on it and you can't

410
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
That's exactly why it's not boring

411
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,640
Okay, if you have to concentrate on lifting

412
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Lifting which is boring then that is twice as boring like going out for a run at least you can think about anything else

413
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:52,120
That's boring fucking plot out your novel like I mean to me like going for a long walk

414
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,720
I don't even feel like it's like cutting out of my day in any way because i'm thinking about the same shit

415
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,280
I'd be thinking about at home. So it's like I'm just doing what I would be doing except

416
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,880
I'm also walking or else like something that you can something that you can zone out of and think about something else

417
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,000
That's the definition of boring. That's all I'm saying. Yeah, but there's nothing. I find more boring

418
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,200
It's always boring. It's just that when you can zone out you can do something else, which is you know, it's entertaining

419
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,040
That's that's literally the definition of layering or you see that's what being boring means

420
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,560
Everything I've been doing has been all focused on making any sort of routine or habit that that is

421
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,960
Is structured around the lifestyle and daily flow. I already have you know and what I've been doing a lot

422
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,240
Every almost every day is just watching tons of anime

423
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:46,280
And so I like to do things that make that flow in with that really easily like getting a dumbbell and doing curls

424
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,560
Because you can watch stuff while doing curls. So I just like to do that, you know sometimes

425
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,880
Yeah, but then you're just curling. Yeah, but you know you can do more like one thing

426
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,240
I usually will do is that I will do like push-ups and sit-ups during the opening and ending themes

427
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,160
And that has made me able to do way more push-ups than I could before I'm sure at the beginning at the start of the year

428
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
I probably couldn't do like five

429
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,080
Because I hadn't been doing anything and now I can do like 30. I just busted out 30 pull-ups by the way. No big deal

430
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,200
I said push-ups day niggers from outer space. Uh, everyone worship me. I'm the greatest man in the world

431
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,160
Now you're going to sound all fucking winded through the whole podcast

432
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,480
Because I do cardio I recover quickly. All right, here's the thing

433
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,920
Here's a big part of why I have such a trouble working out

434
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,480
It's kind of tied to what devu was saying that like, you know, it's good to find stuff that flows into your day

435
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,920
I don't feel like anything flows into my day because for me

436
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,160
That's why I want to have the rack in the house so that I can just take like a little half an hour break

437
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,840
Head over there do like a couple squats and I mean just get right back to it even then like even just doing normal like

438
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,640
You know calisthenics stuff like when I feel

439
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,560
Sweaty and winded it makes me not want to do my job

440
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,640
You know like the job of sitting at a computer and typing which is entirely your arms sitting up

441
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,960
You know like as you type shit and it's like if your arms are sore because you just did 50 push-ups

442
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,240
Then that suddenly is miserable. You know, well did you all right? Let me tell you that's why I really love gross or something

443
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,440
That's why what I I have a ritual that I love doing of exercising

444
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,800
Immediately showering and then for the rest of the day, I feel like a golden god because I did my shit

445
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,560
Then I can just do my work

446
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:33,560
That's part of why I want to get back into an exercise routine because it was great because it'll make me shower more

447
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,240
Oh god, because I really should and let me tell you Ben needs that Ben could use that

448
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,040
Fuck off. I I admit. I'm look

449
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,360
I fucking I fucking live at my fucking house and I don't I work at home

450
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,520
Mostly, you know, I sit in my room and I draw all the time. I don't worry about going out very much

451
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,560
So yes, sometimes I go a few days without a shower because I don't think anyone's gonna see me

452
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,640
And but you know what? I feel terrible about it and I hate myself and I want to change

453
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
As long as you do that, okay

454
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,800
As long as they're shame

455
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm satisfied so anyone listen. Oh, they're shame

456
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,800
You don't necessarily be discouraged by what did you said about not wanting to do computer stuff

457
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,040
After you've done a little bit of like working out because like I'm totally I don't I don't feel the same way at all

458
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
Usually when I've been sitting around too long

459
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,760
I start to feel like death is approaching

460
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,800
I know that feeling and I got rid of that feeling when I bought a $500 computer chair

461
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,880
That's how I got rid of that feeling

462
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,680
Well, don't so guys whatever you do don't buy a $500 computer chair. What's what's so special about this chair

463
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,240
You can sit in it for eight hours before it starts to really make you feel like yeah

464
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Does it have a butt dildo? Is that what it is?

465
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,200
You've you've seen my chair, right? Yeah, but I didn't sit. I didn't experience it. I didn't experience

466
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,800
Well, it's the thing is it's not like it's not comfortable in a traditional sense. It's just

467
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,160
You can sit in it. Sounds like $500 well spent

468
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,080
Well, no like okay when you sit in like a comfortable chair

469
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,280
You're like, wow, this is real comfy and then like an hour later. You're like, oh my god my back

470
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm gonna die in this chair. You sit in it and you're like

471
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,680
Oh, this is this this doesn't feel like anything but then suddenly like eight hours have passed and you're like

472
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,600
Now my back's starting to feel funny. Oh, right. I've been sitting in this chair for eight fucking hours

473
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:29,320
Let me bring up a fitness related pet peeve of mine and Nate. I'm sure I'm sure you're gonna agree the rest of you

474
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm not sure. We'll see. We'll we'll see how stupid you are. I'm interested

475
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,400
um

476
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,720
When when girls say I don't want to lift because I don't want to get all ripped and muscled

477
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Ah

478
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
No, no one please

479
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,360
Let me just I hear this all the fucking time. It drives me insane

480
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,960
Yeah, girls are well, well, you know what I was about to say girls are stupid

481
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,440
But actually everyone's stupid everyone's stupid on this point. Nobody doesn't people when you work out when you lift to gain weight

482
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
First of all, no girls think okay

483
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,680
Well, I just what I just said about you know how if you don't change your diet

484
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,720
But if you start lifting all that happens is you lose fat and gain muscle

485
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,800
You used to keep the same weight you keep about the same proportions or you keep about the same weight

486
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,960
You lose fat and you gain muscle you get you know quote unquote toned you get more toned is what is what happens

487
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,320
um

488
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,600
I don't want to get ripped. I do want to get toned. That's what I don't want to get

489
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,320
I don't want to keep muscle mass. That's gross girls think that if they gain any muscle

490
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,600
They will look like a bodybuilder

491
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,240
They will they think that if they fucking touch a weight if they pick up a single dumbbell that they will

492
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,080
Ew they'll get like some weird bulgy bicep that they'll get like veins in their arms

493
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,600
People are so fucking you know, you know, even guys think this too even guys. Can you imagine a male being stupid? It's true viewers

494
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,480
Even are you fucking SJW piece of shit? I

495
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,240
Yeah, guys think gut people think that if they fucking touch a weight like oh

496
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,160
I only want to do cardio because I only want to get toned people work for fucking years

497
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:07,480
They put in years of hard work and dedicated effort to fucking get ripped and people think that they'll do it by accident

498
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,920
Like it'll happen overnight without them noticing and then they'll be oh, no

499
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,280
Oh, no, I'm so muscular all of a sudden. Whoops. What a shame that I fucking lifted it all

500
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,360
Guys just to put a some numbers to put some numbers to this. That's not necessarily stupid. It's also

501
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
All right go all right you're first

502
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240
I hate them

503
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,240
All right. Well, anyway, it's stupid. I was just gonna say to put it I was gonna say it's not necessarily stupid

504
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:49,240
It's dishonest and lazy. They know they're not gonna accidentally become ripped. They're just making excuses for themselves

505
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
Fucking idiot faggots

506
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,120
All right, I know people all right that is part of it that is sure some people I'm sure fall under that

507
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,120
But it's a lie that they've convinced themselves of

508
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,320
I agree and by the way, if you gain 10 pounds, so like less than one pound a month of intense lifting

509
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,960
That is like miraculous. That is great viewer. If you're sitting at home if you're sitting at home and you don't exercise

510
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,560
Um

511
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,120
100 percent of you would look way better

512
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,000
If you gain 10 pounds of muscle 100 percent you might think that that would look bad

513
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:29,160
You might think that being muscular is not an attractive look. You are wrong. You are wrong and ladies out there

514
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,440
I love muscular girls get ripped get ripped. I'll fuck you. I'll fuck the shit out of you. I love

515
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,400
I don't I don't really like I don't really like I don't really like the muscular look on a girl

516
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,160
But I do ladies at home

517
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,040
If you gain 10 pounds of muscle, you won't look like a fucking ripped weirdo. You won't get that look

518
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,400
You're just gonna look female bodybuilders female power lifters. Watch the watch. Look how cute they are. They're perfect

519
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
They're perfect women. I want us

520
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,800
I I used to I mean when I was in like college, you know, I read up

521
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,800
I read shit tons of literature on like the science of weightlifting and the science of you know

522
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,800
gaining muscle and stuff and so I like I haven't put it into practice in a while

523
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,000
But back in the day I did I was lifting like not I wasn't lifted

524
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,760
I wasn't breaking any records or anything

525
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,080
But I was lifting respectable amounts and I want to get back there and but yeah during that time

526
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,280
I would talk about fitness with people and nobody had any fucking clue

527
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Nobody reads the goddamn sticky

528
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,840
I I don't want I don't want I only do cardio. I don't want to lift at all

529
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,720
I don't want to look like a bodybuilder. Ew idiots if they knew what bodybuilders eat

530
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,040
They would not have that concern. It's just such really should not such ignorant

531
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,400
That's what kills me. There's so much ignorance on such a vital

532
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,240
Area of being a fucking human being with a body. No, no

533
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:48,760
Ignorance and as Jesse said dishonesty and laziness. Yeah, right. I want to ask a question about about uh about uh

534
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,560
Lifting and stuff. Sure. I'm a kind of a new but at exercise and stuff. So I you probably know what to do. Um

535
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
If I want to bulk up

536
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,400
And I do the the right exercises for that. Am I supposed to do

537
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,680
A bunch of reps or like hold the reps for a really long time

538
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,600
What you want to do there's a there's a sweet spot that has been researched

539
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Uh, and I think in like the 80s

540
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,960
They did some studies or this and they found out that like if you if you shoot for first of all you always want to go

541
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,640
To exhaustion. So just do reps until you can't do anymore

542
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,520
But you want to shoot for about 12 to 15 reps is the optimal sweet spot

543
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,480
So if you can do 15 and you fail, that's great

544
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,840
Do you mean 15 reps in one set or do you mean like three sets of five?

545
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,480
I mean, I mean 15 in one go

546
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,720
I mean, there's distinctions between um, if you do if you do it for 15 reps per set and do three sets

547
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,680
Like doing 15 is more for uh strength and then doing five heavier

548
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,560
You know doing five reps with heavier weight that more builds muscle or builds like size

549
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,920
All right, I'm just saying that this is this is what I've been hurt

550
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,720
And it's all of all of the strength building routines that I know of recommend sets of five

551
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,720
When I think it's you just want to do it you want to do it with enough weight

552
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,240
That that three sets of five exhausts you when me and victor were going to the gym together

553
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,840
We would start with like like weights that we could like whatever weight I could comfortably

554
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,720
Do 15 reps with and then from there

555
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,320
I would go up to each different one and see how far I could get until I got to a weight. I couldn't lift

556
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,360
Yeah, yeah, that's what you're supposed to do. And then I mean you keep the same number of reps, but you increase the weight

557
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,160
Yeah, and that basically every time you do that exercise. Yeah, you increase the weight try to do it

558
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,520
And like whatever your number is that you are able to do until your failure

559
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,560
That's fine. But just do it again next time until you can do like 12 or 15 then up it and so on

560
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,880
Okay, what I've been doing at the moment because I think I misheard you at one point earlier

561
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,800
Not none this podcast, but like I told me to hold it for a really long time

562
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
So I've just been doing like two or three

563
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
for like holding it until

564
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,360
That is that's that's really funny. Uh, yeah, no, no, that's not the no, you don't know hold

565
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Holding a rep is not is not a thing

566
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,360
But I mean some people do it, but it's dumb doing them slowly is a good idea like doing it take like one one thousand two

567
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,360
and thousand up one

568
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,240
Maybe if you're doing a curl or some other gay lift well

569
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,240
If you're doing like a good lift like a squat or a bench press, you don't want to hold it

570
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,560
You want to you want to just you want to do it like explosively and just like power through them

571
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,800
Yes, that's true

572
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,080
And if you got any other questions give ask me anytime because I would love to be of use in this area

573
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,240
How do I muscle my dick?

574
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,440
You kegels dog kegels, you know, you got to do dick push-ups

575
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
Those two

576
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,560
Power or size man. Are you looking for power or size? You gotta all about the size

577
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,800
I only I only do cock push-ups for aesthetics

578
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Hey, Jesse, we can see you're playing Tomb Raider

579
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,080
What discord discord is is what it's betrayed. Oh, yeah

580
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Quit playing Tomb Raider anniversary

581
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,520
traitor

582
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,520
I hate

583
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
I bet the best program

584
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,720
Sulking and I'm playing Tomb Raider. No one can stop me

585
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,600
Laura Croft lifts for share and she looks good as fuck. So ladies be like her

586
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,760
Hey guys now, let's talk about another issue relevant to this which is being held back by the people around you

587
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:24,680
Oh, that's a big one dude. That's a big one. It is pretty big. You gotta be in a really depressing topic

588
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,480
Well, okay, here's it. Here's an example from my personal life, you know, because like

589
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,960
My family has

590
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,520
Up until we all got old enough to start affording our own groceries and shit, you know

591
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:43,400
Like my family has a problem where everyone has different taste and food and different needs and wants from the grocery store

592
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,240
You know, and it's like at dinner time. We make dinner for five

593
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:53,720
So it's gonna be whatever all five people can eat and if you're trying to do like a hardcore lifting regimen

594
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,160
Then you're gonna be stuck eating some fucking dumb bullshit that has nothing to do with your diet and plan

595
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,520
You know, it's like you kind of have to be self-sufficient about your food or at least like, you know

596
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:11,000
If you're if you're not old enough or you don't have enough money to be self-sufficient about your weightlifting then convince your parents like

597
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,760
Let me buy 10 cans of chicken, please, you know, like

598
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,640
Cans of chicken. Well, you know, I I think I really think that wait, mate

599
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,240
You don't do cans of chicken for uh, I buy I buy breasts dude. I buy fresh fresh chicken in a can fry them up

600
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:31,400
That's a common thing chicken in my my my friends when my friends were talking what they would do is buy like

601
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,680
Five like each each day they'd come home from the gym

602
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,480
And my friend brando would take like five huge cans of chicken and five huge cans of tuna

603
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Mix them all into a bowl with like like an egg and like a bunch of other shit

604
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,160
And then just have this gigantic bowl of chicken and tuna and then just eat all of it and that was how they bolt

605
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,480
So this is this is like that's pretty good. Okay, you know, wait, wait, wait

606
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,920
Do you not know canned chicken? Is this weird like yeah, this is weird

607
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,800
I've never known anyone who does is it like can chicken with

608
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,840
Grady that you would get from a pie. Is that so no, it's just chicken breast in a can

609
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,200
It's like the way you get tuna in a can same thing. Yeah, it's the same

610
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:17,080
I don't know that I have no idea what that is. I've never seen this actually sounds pretty good. That's great. That sounds really

611
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,760
It's extremely great and extremely convenient. It's the best canned chicken

612
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,040
It's by far the best like because the reason they all ate that is because it's the best protein for your dollar that you could get

613
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,120
Like you can get eggs

614
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,120
Eggs are number one in my book. Like you can't eat 20 eggs at once or you're gonna get sick

615
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:39,480
So, you know, you can eat 20 cans of chicken that are like Gaston ate two dozen eggs every breakfast and three dozen every evening

616
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,960
So don't tell me what you can't do with eggs. Gaston's a fucking car too. Gaston is just fucked though, bro

617
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:50,200
Three dozen eggs, but now that he's grown, he eats four. Oh my mistake. I undersold it. No, it wasn't four and now it's five

618
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,120
It keeps going up. I don't know when he's I don't remember the Gaston diet

619
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,920
You know, you know why the beast was able to beat him because he eats six dozen eggs. That's why that's why I should

620
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,080
It's a lot of eggs

621
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,760
It's a considerable amount

622
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,280
But no to get to DeVue's point

623
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:10,040
It's entirely true that especially if you're a kid if you live it's it's because we live in these little pack units

624
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,240
Where if you're a kid you're entirely dependent on whatever your parents buy you have to eat it. You can't even argue

625
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:21,720
I think people I think that generally like the the cleanliness of one's diet is overvalued

626
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,200
I think people should worry more about the lifting

627
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,200
Unless they're like unless they're like an experienced lifter and they're really trying to do like a dedicated bulk or something

628
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,240
Well, that's the thing dude

629
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,360
If you just I think lifting's more important and that should be the focus

630
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,560
But oh if your parents buy you shitty food and you eat it for dinner

631
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,040
Well, yeah, it's not great, but you know what there are worse

632
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,800
Well, I'm not even really concerned about the quality of the food so much as the volume

633
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,200
Because when you're trying to bulk you need a lot of fucking food and you need to eat the right

634
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,680
You can't have fucking pies all the time and expect to gain

635
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,040
You know the kind of muscle you're looking for you you need, you know protein

636
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,960
You need that shit in your diet and even for me

637
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,360
I eat a ton of protein supplement with my food

638
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,360
Even then it's still hard to get like there's a there's a rule of thumb that if you're trying to bulk

639
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,480
You should go for like a one gram of protein per pound of body weight you have per day

640
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,640
So that's for me. That's like 180 grams

641
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,760
Oh my god, you really have to eat jeep. That's a lot

642
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,600
That's a lot of grams, right?

643
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,760
Well, your average person does not eat that much

644
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,080
Families like families and stuff is I think that a pretty sizable percentage of parents want their kids to be fat

645
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,640
Because or rather they don't feel better about themselves like they don't like I feel like a lot of

646
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,880
I was being hyperbolic. I feel like parents, especially moms usually put way more emphasis on

647
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,000
Having their kids be fed than having their kids be fit because of their, you know

648
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:46,040
A genetic desire to feed their children once again really hard for them to care about fears about their past like my dad

649
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,880
My dad grew up when he was in high school. His family had no food

650
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,720
So he was like super deathly skinny and like he was a super sporty guy

651
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,600
But he couldn't play on any teams because he was too fucking skinny

652
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,120
And so like he saw it. He's always seen it. It's like, you know

653
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,360
Everyone should like, you know, if you live in if you're in my house and you're hungry

654
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
You can eat you can eat whatever it is

655
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,640
It must be like he's always wants there to be food for people to eat and for you to eat whatever you want, you know

656
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,160
and I mean

657
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,440
Thankfully

658
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,000
Me victor and shea to all have pretty small appetite. So none of us have ever become super fat

659
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:24,840
But we easily could have you know, it's like overcompensating for my dad having been, you know, right?

660
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:32,360
So once again, this meme of uh caring about your kid's happiness strikes. Who gives a shit how happy your kids are

661
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,200
Our children need to be swole earth. They need to be more muscly. They need to be bigger

662
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,800
I don't care about my kids being happy. They should be as unhappy as possible

663
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,160
Uh to make them productive members of society. They're happy to see if they can figure that out someday later. Great

664
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,800
I don't care

665
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,880
incidentally, uh since I brought up my dad one of the one of the

666
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:57,400
biggest reasons that I feel the need to work out and get swole is because my dad is really healthy and really fit

667
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:04,120
And like it there's there's definitely for me a deep sense of embarrassment that I am half my dad's age

668
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,600
And he could easily beat me in a fight easily outrun me any I mean

669
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,960
He runs fucking like 10 kilometers in a in a morning just because he feels like it, you know

670
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,720
He'll bike across the whole fucking city and I can like run across my lawn and I'm winded, you know

671
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:25,160
So like just knowing that I am this able-bodied, you know

672
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,520
20 25 year old guy like I should be able to do all these great things, you know

673
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:36,680
But no my dad if he wanted to could lay me out in a heartbeat, you know, and like that's upsetting to me

674
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,080
I mean he doesn't upset me as much that victor is so fit because victor's also like

675
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,360
I mean victor's like broad-shouldered and like

676
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:50,680
Like he has he has the kind of physique that he would be able to beat me up even if I was muscular, you know, but uh

677
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,000
Millennials are ruining the movie industry and everything else says able-bodied man

678
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,320
That's a headline. Yeah

679
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,520
You said you said able-bodied. Yeah, I know why it happened

680
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,520
Um

681
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,920
Oh god, you completely threw me off. I have a problem eating a lot of stuff specifically like when

682
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,680
I have the opposite problem

683
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:24,440
It's the middle of the day and it's lunch lunchtime and I'm supposed to go and make something because no one's around

684
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,160
And I just like I'm too lazy to just get anything. I mean just don't eat anything

685
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,080
Hippo, I advise getting into protein powder because I mean you don't have to eat it

686
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,400
You just consume a bunch of powder and like a drink and it's done and that'll give you all that protein you need to build with

687
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,360
Some of them are even good. Yeah, it's not bad. Yeah

688
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:48,360
The protein powder I used to make my shapes is it make me shakes is absolutely delicious. I love it. It's the best

689
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:54,840
I eat shapes. I eat shapes. Yeah. All right. Let's talk about something more interesting. Um, such as

690
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,400
Fat women we hate them. Yeah. All right guys. Are you ready for a mind blow? Okay, but way long ago

691
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,280
We were talking about how if you like someone then like their fatness, you know, you'll like excuse it for them or whatever

692
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,640
It's picture this picture me seeing a fat woman

693
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:15,480
Liking her and not wanting her to die. It's happened. I'm just saying it's happened in my life. Can you believe that?

694
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,800
It's hard for me. I knew it. I'm a traitor. I'm a traitor. It's true

695
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,120
I've even been attracted to some imagine that if you like someone

696
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,560
Then it doesn't matter if they're fat. You'll excuse their fatness. It's true

697
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,480
It's not really the most important thing. I can't see myself talking to a fat person. Honestly, you know

698
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,680
Look at you fat person. You talk to cider. Well, not fat. And yeah, you think that

699
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:45,720
You were friends with fat people before by the time I became friends with cider. He was already hashtag not fat

700
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,160
I mean, he's fluctuated here and there but uh, you know, I mean when he when he was a kid

701
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,520
He was like 300 pounds and now he's like my weight. So

702
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,000
I don't consider myself fat. Well, you know, I mean, I definitely stupid

703
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,000
I used to consider myself to an adherent of the peter griffin rule of

704
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,640
Men can't be fat only women are fat, but I found myself excusing even them

705
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,480
When I when they're just when they're cool people, you know, it's just if I just don't like fatness

706
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,400
I think it's a bad thing to do for the most part unless you're hilarious. Um

707
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,000
Yeah, well, that there's a threshold where it becomes a bit

708
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,560
Much where like they're whiter than they are

709
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:30,600
Our healthcare at some point I have to pay for people who are less healthy and being fat makes you more risk

710
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,840
Uh a verse, you know, and that's just a bad I just just don't do it like I have to pay for that

711
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,120
Wait, that makes you risk a verse. Well, I don't think he meant a verse. You know what I mean

712
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,880
I think it means prone prone. That's that's what I meant. Oh, yeah. Yeah

713
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,640
So on that basis, I think I have a reasonable claim to ask people politely to uh, be consider the rest of our tax dollars

714
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,800
Thanks, obama

715
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:59,400
Yeah, um, I I okay. I'll talk about now. Um the problem I'm

716
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,640
I I encountered

717
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Today yesterday

718
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:10,440
Uh the the past month so rad con happened all my vices came back and I've been struggling to get rid of them

719
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,560
but like

720
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,560
uh, the problem I'm having right now is

721
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,480
That there's a lot of shit going on in my life at the moment, you know

722
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,840
I got two new people living in my house. My parents are gone

723
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,120
You know, the house was a huge fucking mess after rad con and we only just cleaned it. Um

724
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,800
Like and I'm trying to get like all these projects off the ground me and devour working together

725
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:37,240
We're watching all this fucking anime trying to make these projects and stuff and at the same time trying to like

726
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:44,360
Work out and or diet and and stop smoking and all of that at once is just too much

727
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,520
And at some point I thought okay, I can't do all these things at the same time

728
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,800
But I need to get the work stuff done first

729
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:58,680
So I kind of went like fuck it, man. Fuck the diet. Fuck quitting smoking. I'll buy an e-cigarette

730
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:03,320
And uh, that's where I am right now. So I mean I'm in the danger zone if you will

731
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,680
What what advice do you have about this, Nate?

732
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,480
Well, that's that's was my that was my plan too. That's why I wasn't worried about anything else

733
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,760
The only thing I really wanted was to get the squat rack set up and start lifting and you know, fuck the diet

734
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,160
And if I get that settled then I'll be good

735
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,240
I think that what's what the best thing to do in a situation like you like you can't make a

736
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,520
No one in the world can just do a lateral shift to like a whole new lifestyle all at once. So like

737
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,200
It's small changes. I guess I would definitely make a plan of everything you want to change

738
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:40,600
For these things they're concerned like just get them all in a row and then just like do one like the easiest one preferably

739
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,960
Yeah, whatever it is. Just like do that the biggest problem for me is like, yeah, okay

740
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:50,600
Eating out makes me happy and working out does not make me happy and that's the hardest part is like

741
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:51,720
You know what?

742
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,280
It's you know deciding because I'll be midway through the day and I'll be like man

743
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:03,080
I could really use a sub sandwich right now or I could really use a cigarette at no point in any day in my life

744
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,520
If I ever gone man, I could really use 10 push-ups right now. That would make me feel swell, you know

745
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,040
No, but when I when I was when I was actually work

746
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,840
When I I didn't I didn't I never got the thing about feeling good after working out

747
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,280
But I did when I was so good afterwards when I was into a lifting routine

748
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,360
I did just kind of always passively feel a little better like yeah

749
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,680
It feels good to finish

750
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,920
Hey, you know what I mean?

751
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,320
Yeah, it does do because all the time I could just think I don't know

752
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,720
I just just felt more energetic and I could always think like yeah, I'm fit. I lift a bunch, you know

753
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,440
I it just passively felt a little better all the time

754
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:46,440
Do you really not feel Ben after like specifically after I work out and then if I shower right then and then I step out of the shower

755
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,120
I feel like a god. I feel like I'm glowing. I feel so great

756
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:54,680
I mean like I feel like Dennis Reynolds like I am the king of the entire fucking world

757
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,760
And everyone is below me and with to do with what I will like two years ago

758
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,400
Was the period when I was most regularly working out it was and me and victor were actually going to the gym

759
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,840
And uh, and I I got down to like 155 pounds

760
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,600
which is the lightest I've been in my adult life and uh, and you know

761
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,520
I I felt

762
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,960
Like measurably stronger and I really liked that aspect of it

763
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,400
I liked the idea that like I can I felt like I you know

764
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,960
The idea of like getting up to go do something was so much less tiresome

765
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:30,440
Like if I if I was thinking uh, let's say my dad calls me up is like hey, uh, go buy this thing from the store

766
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,560
And I'm like, yeah, I want to move. You know like that part was cool

767
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,920
but

768
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,360
Every single time I worked out I felt like shit for the rest of the day and usually the next day as well

769
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,680
And I really like

770
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,440
The last few times I worked out I felt like shit for

771
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,880
For a while, but it's just because I wasn't into the routine anymore. I wasn't accustomed to that level of activity

772
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,200
Is it because the doms? Is it the doms you're getting?

773
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,520
Not the doms just like fatigue

774
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,200
Every single time I did it

775
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,880
I was thinking like when am I gonna reach the point that I am that I am capable

776
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,120
Like when is this gonna get to the point where I've done it enough and now I feel good about it

777
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:15,320
But the thing is if you want to make progress you have to constantly you have to always push yourself to the limit

778
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,760
You know like your your muscles won't grow unless you rip your muscles

779
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:24,040
And if you rip your muscles then the next day your muscles are gonna feel like shit and so like

780
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:30,360
No, that goes away. You eventually get accustomed to that level of exertion. Let me just tell you I my friend Femian college

781
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:36,120
Uh, absolute legend of a man like he once he once thought that he checkmated me so expertly

782
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,520
This is after I like first started working out. He's like Nate. How? Okay, so when you work out

783
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:46,280
You rip your muscles then your muscles are torn the next day you work out again after your muscles have healed

784
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:51,480
They're torn again, but you're tired from that previous workout at what point will you ever get stronger than when you started?

785
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,080
It's never gonna happen. They checkmate working out as a waste of time

786
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:01,880
Get it out. You've got it out like understand that like how I mean how would anybody get strong if that

787
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,440
true

788
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,760
It's like zeno's fucking period

789
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,680
It's impossible to get stronger because you're always getting tired from working out like

790
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,480
To give Femi credit. He might have just been dunking on me and I just I mean

791
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,560
Did you at some point ask him like explain strong people then?

792
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,080
Well, yeah, and he also started working out recently

793
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,000
So I think he got over it if he ever really wasn't just fucking with me

794
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:34,040
But yeah, like you are going to feel uncomfortable. Okay, but the whole thing about dom's

795
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,040
Just as okay dom's goes away after you've worked out for a while

796
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,360
You stop getting the pains in your muscles for me

797
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,040
It takes maybe like two to three weeks of like lifting maybe every other day

798
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,040
And I just don't get it anymore after I've taken a break for a while and as for the fatigue

799
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,520
I mean I've been doing a hardcore running program running every other day for the last

800
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:57,720
Three months or so now and I just I just feel great all the time

801
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,240
I can't wait to run when I do I feel good when I'm running at the end

802
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,960
I feel like shit and I want to be dead and I hate everything about my life

803
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,000
But right afterward after I've showered and feel like a god again

804
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,360
Uh, I just I just don't feel tired and I can sleep easier

805
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,880
It's easier for me to go to bed at the right time and my whole life just feels bad

806
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,680
I'd love to be at that point, but like you know those months are hard those starting months are tough

807
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,520
Yeah, like well because you know me we've all been doing these pull-ups on the pull-up bar

808
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,320
And like there was a day where I got up to four pull-ups is the the best I'd done yet

809
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,400
And then this was like two weeks ago

810
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,160
I went into the to the garage where ben's got the squat racks set up

811
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,720
But you know obviously doesn't work and I just grabbed each of you soon

812
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,960
I just started taking the weights off the rack and just like doing a bunch of uh

813
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,840
Arm workouts with them, you know, I did a bunch of curls a bunch of like

814
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:49,480
Shoulder things over the head stuff like all all that good us as shit that you could do with big fucking round circular weights, right?

815
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,560
and I

816
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:59,320
Have not yet been able to do like more like I like every time I go to do four pull-ups again

817
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,360
I'm still sore and it has not stopped for two weeks

818
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,680
I have not had a single time where I could get up and go to do pull-ups and I felt like oh now

819
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,000
I'm finally ready again. Like it's just you know

820
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:17,800
I hear you dude. I hear you on that but what I would recommend is just literally ignoring the pain doing it anyway

821
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,080
I've I've been there. I have lifted done specifically with leg works out

822
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,280
I've done it and felt like sheer agony unable to walk straight without limping for like a day or two

823
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,000
But then I like it's been two days. It's time to do legs again

824
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,920
I do it again through the pain like it feels like sheer agony

825
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,800
Except when I actually start to do the actual movement of the lift itself

826
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,760
I have felt like the pain kind of goes away and then after the workout things have started to feel better

827
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:47,160
So I really think just doing it kind of mixes up the lactic acid gets it out a little bit

828
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,280
And like helps you move along towards recovery. I don't know about you

829
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:56,920
But for me, how much pain like bothers me depends on whether or not I know or slash think it's bad or good for me

830
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,040
Like there's a pain that all bothers me unconditionally

831
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,440
If it's pain, it bothers me

832
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:08,360
No, like if I'm feeling sore after a workout, it's like good because like I know that it's good for me

833
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,400
Whereas like if I'm if I'm getting like, you know

834
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:17,880
If if I'm going to the doctors and like getting a shot like the pain of the needle entering my skin is the worst feeling in the world

835
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,800
You guys you guys should see ben you guys should see ben when he needs to get a shot

836
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:27,480
He is the biggest spaz in the world. I've been I've been better. You know the last time I got a shot. I was way better

837
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,040
All right, that's great

838
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,640
I'm really freaked out when when when I don't what were you been there for?

839
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,560
We were getting shots together. I I don't know. It might have just been that time

840
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,840
We were going full gay or something. I don't know. Yeah

841
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,960
We were getting our age shots

842
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,760
um

843
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:50,120
I've been doing exercises for like I think like almost a month and a week now

844
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,200
um

845
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,120
You know like I've never really done any sort of regimented exercise before

846
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:01,560
And the first few days, um, it was mostly my legs. I was doing and my legs felt really heavy

847
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,920
Yeah, and it was weird like all the time. They're really heavy and then

848
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:10,680
I just sort of got used to them being heavy and now I realize that it's just because there is more muscle there

849
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,080
And my legs are no longer just sticks

850
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,960
Well, okay, too. It doesn't it doesn't hurt at all. It's just they feel like

851
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,600
Like they feel normal. Mm-hmm, but they don't feel like they've gotten lighter at all

852
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,440
Well, okay, sure, but just as a public service announcement

853
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,640
You can really only expect to gain like maybe a pound of total body mass

854
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,320
When you're working out at first, you know, we're talking about noob gains or something

855
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,440
You know that that is true noobs do gain faster significantly no no no no noob noob gains means that

856
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,360
Noob gains isn't about putting on muscle noob gains is about your lifts going up

857
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,560
And it's because you're right. Am I right here? That that's definitely true. You know that that actually might be right

858
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,320
All I know is that it happened really fast. Okay, well, you know, I'm not gonna question it. I'll believe it

859
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,960
If they feel heavier sure, okay

860
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,200
I mean, I have like really

861
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,640
Skinny legs forever. So what's that line from get action?

862
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,960
Creativity is a muscle and da da da da. I'm just gonna jack it something like that

863
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:11,160
I know the line because I wrote it, but I don't feel like telling you

864
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Oh

865
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,120
This show sucks get out of here

866
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:23,000
When you go back to just interrupt me anyways, why don't you go be uh back to fucking burger king you piece of shit

867
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,840
It's sorry about interrupting you

868
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,560
I don't work

869
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,520
That burger king

870
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,520
I

871
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Sounds like a sheep he does

872
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:49,320
Uh, are we going anywhere with this where no, I feel I feel like we're we've just been saying things about a clean hour

873
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,120
We've got a clean. It's very clean at that time. Yeah

874
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,520
I um

875
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,240
What else could we even talk about specifically?

876
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:04,360
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Jesse was gonna tell us about his nightmare of a burger run that he did before this

877
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:10,840
What happened with that shit? I don't know. You know, I had some wacky rant, but uh, oh come on

878
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,480
Come on

879
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:20,440
I stopped caring pretty quickly. I went to get a hamburger

880
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,760
Well, look, this is why uh, you know the trick to losing weight

881
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,080
Is to not eat

882
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,200
And that's pretty easy because eating is a tiresome burden

883
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,280
And it's miserable and no one should do it the act of getting food

884
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,080
Is usually so miserable that it makes the act of eating food not even fun

885
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,200
Like I had to get a hamburger today

886
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,520
I ordered it from the burger bar

887
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,680
So I get in my car. I'm driving to the burger bar to pick up my burger

888
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,760
There's all this traffic

889
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:55,320
I could have just walked there in half the time that it took the drive there. I'm hitting every red light

890
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:00,920
I can't park anywhere. There's like some weird halloween festival going on. There's cars everywhere

891
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,880
There's a fucking beer tent set up in like the entire parking lot

892
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,600
So I got a like I got a park halfway across town

893
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,680
I could have walked there in the time to get my burger

894
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:14,360
I get into the burger place the guy behind the bar. He's fucking ignoring me. I'm like, yeah, I can see my burger

895
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:20,600
I can see my burger behind the bar and the guy's just walking around and he finally he takes my card

896
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,800
He takes my debit card. I'm paying for my burger

897
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,640
But then he starts shaking drinks and mixing drinks and fucking around and doing all this bullshit

898
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,080
He's gotten my debit card. I've paid for my burger. I can see my burger. Just give it to me

899
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,680
Just give it to me and he goes to the cash register

900
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:44,760
He's finally about to start, you know, entering the shit with my debit card and he fucking answers his phone

901
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,760
Oh, yeah

902
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:53,960
A bartender answered his phone at the bar while I was trying to pay for my burger and then he turns around

903
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,920
After he's done on his phone

904
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,960
He's finally, you know, punching in my numbers in the stupid cash register. He turns around and looks at me

905
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,800
He says some stuff at me

906
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:10,040
He starts speaking in tongues in this bizarre alien language with like this weird goofy smile on his face

907
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,920
Like he's conversing with me. He thinks in his mind

908
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,880
He's speaking English, but he's like having a stroke or something. He's looking at me and I swear to God. He's going

909
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,960
Ah

910
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:30,200
And I'm just like, why what are you saying? What do you want me to say? I'm just like nodding and being like, yeah

911
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
burger boy, yeah

912
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:40,520
And he's fucking so then he's like, okay, uh, do you want to buy a burger by ketchup packets?

913
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,480
He's like monkey man. It's like a tick to this guy. You want to need a burger boy ketchup packets?

914
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,200
It's like, yes, I'd like some ketchup packets, please

915
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,000
Finally I get home. I open my I open my burger boy container

916
01:08:53,480 --> 01:09:01,080
And I'm trying to get my burger. I look at the ketchup packets. There's like one ketchup packet. There's six mustard packets

917
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,880
Oh, no, I didn't ask for mustard. I didn't want mustard. I don't like mustard

918
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:13,000
I hate him. So now I strongly dislike mustard. That's I'm never fucking eating again

919
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,880
I'll never be a burger boy as long as I live. I'm a ham boy and only a ham boy for the rest of my life

920
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:23,240
Crucial crucial difference between a hamburger boy and a ham boy. That guy can never be a ham boy

921
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,400
A hamburger boy is not a good one. I don't know what a ham

922
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,680
I don't know what a burger boy is, but I don't want it anywhere near me a ham boy

923
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,520
You can trust a burger boy is some kind of child molesting monster from hell

924
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,000
I don't like him

925
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,360
But that's why you should never eat. That's why everyone should go on a strict

926
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:48,840
Um anorexia diet. It's the it's the diet that works. That's the campaign slogan that I invented for my invention of anorexia

927
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:55,720
You know, I I know that guy and I asked him what he was he was speaking burger boy language

928
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:00,600
And I asked him so what were you actually saying to just he said he was like what I was saying was jesse

929
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,240
Why don't you go back to work?

930
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,640
at burger king

931
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,920
No burger boy. No, I told you once I told you

932
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,120
I don't work at burger king

933
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:19,160
And you know, okay on a serious note, uh about this whole not eating thing jesse is actually

934
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:24,360
Jesse is actually let me just say real quick if if I had to get in my fucking car and drive to eat

935
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,040
I would never eat because fuck that. Yeah, that's why it's terrible that I keep that

936
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:32,520
We have all this food in the house that I have food in my fridge. I gotta stop. It's a meal that needs to die

937
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,920
Agree, but but okay, uh the the whole thing we've talked a lot about lifting

938
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,280
But the thing is if your goal is just to lose weight

939
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:46,280
Uh, the what just eat like the the food is what makes the difference just figure out what you're eating wrong

940
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,160
Eat less calories just eat like half of what you're eating now

941
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:55,000
That's that's the way to do it a lot a lot of people think that just losing weight is a good goal when for most people

942
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,120
It's not most most people should be if they want to look better

943
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,000
A lot of people think they'll look better just by losing weight

944
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,840
But really everyone should be trying to gain muscle too because it's always good

945
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,440
Everyone thinks it's everyone thinks it's less important, but it's more important in my humble opinion more important than you know viewer

946
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,760
I I'm more I'm talking to like the fat people right now who are seriously looking to lose weight

947
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,920
I think people really need to spread the word it needs to be made

948
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,120
More people need to be made aware of the fact

949
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,200
That losing weight is the easiest fucking thing in the world

950
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:31,000
It's not difficult anyone who says it's too hard to lose weight is a whiner and a fool

951
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:37,000
You know memes really reinforce themselves is just is just eat less shitty food or just not eat at all

952
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:43,240
It's so easy you see food and instead of sticking it into your craw you don't stick it into your craw

953
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:46,200
And that's all you have to do. It's zero effort

954
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:53,960
It is a massively destructive meme out there about like the incredible difficulty involved in losing weight when like you said

955
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,720
It really is not that complicated if you put a little bit of thought into it a couple months ago

956
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:04,280
I just got bored of being fat. You know it was funny for a while

957
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,400
You know I I figured you know everyone every every great artist should have their fat years

958
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,080
It's it's you know

959
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,680
It there's a novelty to being chiefly for a little bit. You're like, yeah

960
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,080
I can sit around in my chiefly body

961
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,640
And I can you know I can have the women flock to me because women love a man who's well fed

962
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,200
They love the the biggest man in the tribe

963
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:31,160
But you know after a while the novelty wears off. I'm like, okay. I'm bored. So I just decided one day. I'm done

964
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:37,000
So I fucking stopped eating. I lost 30 pounds in like one day. It was the easiest thing in the world

965
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,680
He cut his leg off he got his leg off

966
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:46,280
Rad con I go to rad con and you know rad con is like my week and a half of decadence while I'm there

967
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,160
I I gain like like a bunch of you know, first of all, I went from like in a couple months

968
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:57,400
I went from 225 to 195 and I was feeling good. I'm like, yeah, awesome. I'm the best at this. It's super easy. I'm cool

969
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,720
I'm smart. I'm bad. I'm cool. I'm nobody's fool. So then I go to rad con. I'm like, okay

970
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:06,680
I'm gonna shove all the fucking food in my mouth. I don't give a shit. I'm at rad con. It's party time party central

971
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:11,640
Drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. Do I like to party? The answer is yes shove it all in me, baby

972
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,840
So I'm I'm I'm going to rad con. I so I I get I get a little way to rad con

973
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,480
I went from 195 to by the time I got home from rad con. I was like 205 again

974
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,600
Mm-hmm. So I get home

975
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,400
But then within a fucking week of getting back to my old habits. I'm back to 195 again

976
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:34,200
So it's so fucking easy even if you fucking splurge and get fat again for like one week

977
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:39,640
It doesn't even matter. You just stop eating again. These things are always fixable. It's always fixable

978
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:45,000
There's no need to despair. You know, it's always always always I was saying earlier. There's always room for mistakes

979
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,440
There's always room for a fun week of decadence and splurging

980
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,000
Anorexia

981
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Invented by Jesse Wood

982
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,560
The diet that works and I just put that on a t-shirt. It's just important to think of of eating as a part of like

983
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:05,080
The mechanism of your body. It's not just indulgence that you do three times a day of having infinite fun. It's important

984
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,640
You know, that's what I want people to know. I promise everyone

985
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,520
Everyone in the audience if you stop drinking soda, you will just

986
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,360
Naturally lose like 10 pounds join the water club, baby

987
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:23,640
Every time I've ever started drinking soda. I've gotten like fatter instantly and every time I've stopped drinking soda

988
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,280
I've gotten thinner instantly like it's

989
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:32,440
Unbelievable drunk. I've probably drunk less than a hundred sodas in my entire life because I just don't like them

990
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,000
Yeah, that's that's pretty good. That's probably why I'm so skinny

991
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,760
I drink a soda now and it's just I think I had a soda when I was like a year place

992
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:44,680
There was dr. Piper like I haven't had in a while gross way too sweet. Can't it's like drinking a syrup of sugar can't do it

993
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,360
But whatever it's not about me. Incidentally, if you're an alcoholic like me scale back your drinking to once a week

994
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,880
It helps also

995
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:56,520
Drinking is like a lot of calories a lot of calories in that alcohol

996
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,880
Also, you might be interested to know that alcohol is

997
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:05,320
Technically a poison only in the sense that it has no nutritional value whatsoever

998
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:10,920
And is converted directly into fat the alcohol calories are nothing else happens with them

999
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Other than the mechanism of your body processes those calories into fat

1000
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:18,200
There's like nothing else happens with them. They just get stored as fat

1001
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,480
It's interesting and that's the same with sugar sugar is the exact same way

1002
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,800
Yeah, I was gonna say yeah

1003
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,200
Carbs do that too. I think well it depends on the type of carb, but but yeah, like is that right?

1004
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:34,040
Yeah, there's a little bit of a difference into what they do, but whatever anyway closing statement viewer

1005
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,720
If you're worried about getting healthy fuck off just go lift

1006
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,040
Just lift and don't worry about anything else. Everything else will take care of itself. That's what I think

1007
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:46,360
I would say just eat right and don't worry about lifting that much worry about that later

1008
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,960
Okay, so let me get nothing and lift all the time. Yeah

1009
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,320
So if you are if you are at home if you think if you think you have a fitness problem

1010
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,600
You do but no matter what the problem is you will find that lifting is the solution

1011
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,880
Here's my tip and all other paths will become clear to you of all the solutions all the plans you could do

1012
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,960
Do whichever one is easiest like if you love soda you love chips

1013
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:16,440
You love Fritos, whichever one you love the least try to stop eating that one. That's how I've done everything

1014
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,440
I've just been like I'm not when I started like you know, I quit my job

1015
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,360
So I had the baseline of having had a blue collar job for energy usage

1016
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,280
But now I'm like, all right, I'm going to try doing push-ups and setups and stuff like that

1017
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,880
But I'm not going to give it any schedule because I know I'm not going to be able to do a schedule

1018
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,640
I'm just going to do it randomly whenever I remember to do it

1019
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:42,520
And I has such low expectations for myself. I was able to exceed my expectations all the time and it was awesome

1020
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,040
Yeah, excellent. Yes. Take it small steps. Couldn't agree more. That's the way to do it. That's the way to do it

1021
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,360
Or you could be a hero like me and make spreadsheets and do everything

1022
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,800
You know hardcore all the time be the strongest man in the world. Yeah, that's also possible too

1023
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:01,960
Or just take a start like that though. Yes. I started as a guy. I was born a god and I've been one my entire life

1024
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,920
Or just take up smoking. It makes you less hungry

1025
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Nate you were you were never you were

1026
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:16,040
You've always been you've always been fit-looking, but like yes before you ever lifted you were like skinny skinny ripped

1027
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:19,080
And then now that you lift you're like muscle ripped

1028
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,760
He went from a Simone to a Kamina is basically what you're saying

1029
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:28,680
Oh, don't don't sell Kami to that short by saying my current body can rival the god himself one day

1030
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:34,040
I'll be a one day. I'm gonna do a the reason I lift is so that I can do a good Kami to cosplay one day

1031
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,440
And one day I will no I can't I'm not fit enough not even close. I have to be twice my size

1032
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:44,040
You were kind of fat. Yeah, Nate's not cut enough for it yet. I'm cutting right now. He has been he has been

1033
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,600
I need bigger shoulders too to be like Kami, but whatever. Anyway

1034
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,880
Oh, whatever you think Kamino would fucking worry about the size of his shoulders. I want to look like him and I know what he looks like

1035
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,880
Hey, yeah, you know what you know what?

1036
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,680
Oh, god the closing statement on all this. Um

1037
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:03,880
People that lift to be cool. Yeah, you know what's way cooler than being fit is not is not worrying about being fit

1038
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:09,720
Worrying about how you look is way more uncool than being fit is cool

1039
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:13,640
Well, if you're like me and you bottle it up and never tell anyone then it's perfect

1040
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,360
Then if you just pretend then you're just then you're just secret uncool

1041
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
That's fine. I'm prepared for that

1042
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,600
Absolutely like he said it's about other people thinking that's right. That's right

1043
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,720
We've been we've been we've been talking. You know what? We've gotten off topic the real topic here

1044
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:33,400
I don't know why I haven't pushed this harder the real the real truth of the matter

1045
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:38,760
Is that none of it matters and being fits not important and if you think it is then you're not cool. Yeah, you know for me

1046
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,000
It was that's only if your priority is happiness

1047
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,280
Right. Mm-hmm, which is not for me. It was like I think it should be for anyone

1048
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,280
It does not believe in happiness. Nope

1049
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,040
Everyone everyone in the world is just a pile of misplaced priorities. Like people that's true

1050
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,040
People think they have to lose weight. They're wrong. They actually just need to lift

1051
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,080
But then that whole thing is based on thinking you need to be fit

1052
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:04,520
But that's wrong. You just need to fucking not be a little bitch and not worry about how you look

1053
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,560
That's how that's the truth. Honestly. Honestly. I think being fit is kind of gay

1054
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:14,840
Or no, I think I think being ripped. I think I think working out too much or I think I think like

1055
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,720
No, that's I've only seen sometimes

1056
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,600
I think it's the only way in my life to this point that I've seen other naked men has been at gyms

1057
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,800
So that's hashtag pretty gay. You know, hashtag pretty gay. I don't know

1058
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,880
You know what? I think I think there's a suite. All right. There's just way too many closing statements

1059
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,360
So we're gonna wrap this up now. There's a sweet. There's a sweet spot of how much you should worry about fitness

1060
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,840
And I think I am I am under that bar. I am I am worrying not enough right now

1061
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,720
But there is definitely you can definitely worry too much. Sure. Okay. All right. All right. Yeah, I agreed

1062
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:51,160
All right, we're done. Fuck fitness. All right. Thanks for listening everybody. We will yeah hashtag fuck fitness. We'll see you next time

1063

1064
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,240
I'm sorry. I apologize. I apologize everyone. I fucked up. I fucked it all

1065
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,240

1066
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:14,040
Be working right now, but I'm not working

1067
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,840
I'm doing nothing

1068
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,400
My dick. I'm jerking

1069
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,120
Myself. I'm sucking

1070
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,760
I am an asshole

1071
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,400
I am a stupid

1072
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,040
I've got a deadline

1073
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,760
Don't want to do it

1074
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:43,240
What the hell is wrong with me?

1075
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,600
I'm supposed to be making money

1076
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:53,880
I'm supposed to be creating funny

1077
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:59,400
Things that the people gladly will pay for

1078
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,680
Artistic genius. That's what they came for

1079
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,160
Instead I'm tweeting

1080
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,800
Ashtag repeating

1081
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:15,320
That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling

1082
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,840
Yeah

1083
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,840
It's quite the burden

1084
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,400
It's a hard knock life

1085
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,720
Being a genius
