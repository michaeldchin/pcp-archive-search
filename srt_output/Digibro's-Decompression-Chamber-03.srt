Oh dear god, all fucking Christ.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Welcome. If you hear some pitter pattering, that's because it's raining outside at the moment.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hopefully that just makes it even more soothing if you can even hear it.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So...

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'd been saying on the last couple shows that I felt great.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I kept reiterating that I feel great as I've been pumping iron and eating whatever I want

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
or whatever.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,360
But man, I also said on the last show that I was gonna quit smoking because it was starting

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,080
to get out of hand.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,000
And boy, quitting smoking when you actually have started to get addicted to it, not easy.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,880
Not an easy proposition, I gotta say.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,040
You know, historically, this is the way I handle things when I'm scared I'm getting

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,240
addicted because I definitely have always had an addictive personality.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,160
I take something and I make it a part of my life and it just is what I do from then on.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:43,400
From when I was about 12 until I was 22 or 23 I think, I drank nothing but Mountain Dew.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,520
I just drank Mountain Dew all day, every day.

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
It's all I drank.

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Yeah, before that I drank mostly Sprite and other sodas.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,200
I grew up on soda, you know, I grew up exclusively on soda pretty much.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:03,040
Huge oversight on my parents' part, but they also drank soda, or did drink soda back then.

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,800
None of us were very health conscious until much later.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,840
But yeah, I grew up drinking Mountain Dew for the better part of 10 years and, you know,

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,400
all the teeth fucking I have have cavities and fillings and shit, let me know cavities

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,440
now they're all filled, but I have asked tons of fillings, you know, I drank it obsessively

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,120
for so long and anytime I'd go without it it was like a real problem, you know, it was

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,520
definitely a hard line addiction.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,600
I would get real upset and real depressed if I didn't have Mountain Dew for, you know,

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
like a day.

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,200
There was one time that my parents, you know, as we got, as the years went on they started

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,280
to realize how bad Mountain Dew was for you.

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,280
So at one point when I was like 17 I think, I think it was in my senior year of high school,

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,160
my parents decided to stop buying us Mountain Dew.

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,000
They were like, you know, we're not going to, we're not going to support you guys drinking

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
it anymore.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,360
To me, Victor and Shay, because we all drank it.

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
Those are my two little brothers, if anyone doesn't know.

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,960
And yeah, so they stopped giving us Mountain Dew.

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:22,520
And so because at the time I was riding my bike to and from school every day, I would

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,120
just like not spend my lunch money, you know, I'd just like save up my lunch money for a

53
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
couple days.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,800
I'd save up the, my mom would give me like $3 because it's like $2 for a regular lunch

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,120
and then an extra dollar to get like, you know, to get more essentially because the

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,280
lunches were pretty small.

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,600
So she would give me the extra dollar and then I would save up those extra dollars and

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:53,600
then every other day I would go to 7-Eleven on the way home and buy a like, you know,

59
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,720
a big ass Mountain Dew ball, like the biggest one I could get.

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,480
And this went on for a few months of like us not getting Mountain Dew and I, I was fucking

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,240
miserable for those three months.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,600
Like I was, I was generally depressed anyways back in high school, but I was like real bad.

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,440
I stopped writing my anime blog entirely for those three months.

64
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,000
Like I think I made one post, it was, it was like, I distinctly remember that I just went

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,120
on this long unintended hiatus from everything that was going on.

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,000
I wasn't really watching anime either.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,160
I think I, I think I just stopped everything essentially.

68
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,360
It was just, just feeling like shit for that whole time.

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,680
And then what finally broke it was that my parents went out of town, like they were going

70
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
out to go to like some other country or something.

71
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,320
And they left a bunch of money for us to buy groceries.

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,960
Now me, Victor and Shade are not the type to like, buy groceries.

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,640
Like we'll subsist off of like bread rather than actually make food, you know, for ourselves

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
and stuff.

75
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,320
Like we probably, I don't even know if we bothered.

76
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,640
I mean, I don't know how we would even get.

77
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,560
I think my parents had like, no, it wasn't that they left us money for groceries.

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,400
It was like that they had, we had bought groceries before they left and then it was like, this

79
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,960
is if you run out of food or if there was an emergency or something, you know, we'll

80
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,640
leave you with some money.

81
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:30,120
So we, as soon as my parents left, we went down to 7-Eleven and bought like 12 bottles

82
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,320
of Mountain Dew, two liters, you know, and it brought them all back home.

83
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,080
And then we, we marathoned Lucky Star.

84
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,600
Like that night, me and my, my friend Donsan, we sat on the couch and this was the time,

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,960
I think I've mentioned this before in a video somewhere that like we, we had Anime Suki

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,640
open and there was this thread on Anime Suki, which is an anime forum, um, which had like

87
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,080
goes through every single reference in Lucky Star and explains all of them.

88
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,560
And we were like watching the show while like pausing to look at the references and stuff

89
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,520
and, and you know, figure out what all the jokes mean and stuff.

90
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,840
It was a great time.

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:17,360
We marathoned the whole show in a day, 20, 24 episodes, I think, in one day, drinking

92
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,960
all this Mountain Dew and you know, by the time my parents got back, I guess they had

93
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,800
just like forgotten or they figured out that we had, you know, done this and they're just

94
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
like, fuck it.

95
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
So they started buying this Mountain Dew again.

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,760
Wasn't until I was 22 or 23 that I finally had the willpower to just do it myself to

97
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
actually quit.

98
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,760
So I quit completely and what I took up instead is Wawa Diet Green Tea.

99
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:50,400
Wawa is a local, um, convenience store slash like fast foodie restaurant kind of thing.

100
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,320
Um, and it's mostly a convenience store.

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,440
They sell food that like they, they'll make for you kind of thing.

102
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,800
There's nowhere to actually sit down and eat.

103
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,760
But anyways, they have their own tea and I don't know what it is about their tea in

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,280
particular because like, uh, growing up, I never liked tea, but then I discovered like

105
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,520
cold green tea and I was like, this is actually kind of drinkable and I tried a bunch of different

106
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,040
brands, but the Diet Wawa Green Tea is the one that like really is the only one I really

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
like.

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,320
So I took that up and the reason I chose Diet Green Tea is because it has no nutritional

109
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
value.

110
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,400
It's basically just water and fake sugar, you know, it's just like water and aspartum

111
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,560
and that's it.

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,640
And aspartum has a lot of people say a lot of bad stuff about aspartum.

113
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,000
Most of it's not actually scientifically founded.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,760
It's mostly rumor aspartum is not actually bad for you.

115
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,760
And as it happens, there's been more scientific studies done on it than like anything else

116
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,720
in the universe because of all the bad rumors, but it's not actually bad for you.

117
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,840
So yeah, I have an addictive personality.

118
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,840
I gave up Mountain Dew and took up Diet Green Tea.

119
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,920
Now Diet Green Tea is a completely harmless addiction, so I don't mind that I'm addicted

120
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
to it.

121
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,720
I will get irritable if I don't have that like regular caffeine intake and have, you

122
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,640
know, something like the Diet Green Tea.

123
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,960
And now I can't even really stomach much soda anymore.

124
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,120
I can have like a soda a day kind of thing.

125
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,920
But I was always, you know, it's okay to be addicted to that, but I've always been afraid

126
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,400
of other addictions.

127
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,760
I try to keep everything to a minimum.

128
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,680
Like I love drinking alcohol, but anytime I've started to feel like maybe I'm drinking

129
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,360
too much alcohol, I'll put a stop to it.

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,680
I'll stop drinking for a little while.

131
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,080
And I've always found it's easy to do so.

132
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,600
Alcohol to me doesn't feel like an addiction so much as just something I really enjoy doing

133
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,480
and, you know, not doing it for a long period of time is just boring and it feels like

134
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,160
why am I not, why have I decided not to drink alcohol, you know, because it doesn't feel

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,040
like I'm dependent on it, just feels like it's something I enjoy doing.

136
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,760
Now cigarettes, on the other hand, it's always been this sort of tightrope balance where

137
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,480
I took up smoking in like 2011.

138
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,320
At first I was barely doing it.

139
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,200
At first I didn't even like it.

140
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,600
But then the period when I started smoking more was my mom was in the hospital with cancer

141
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,320
and the stress from that I was just looking for any way to relieve the stress.

142
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,560
So I started smoking and I would only smoke one cigarette a day, two at the most, because

143
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,640
by the time I finished one usually I was starting to get a head rush.

144
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,080
Like smoking more than you can handle will give you headaches and make you dizzy and

145
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,560
make you feel weird for the rest of the day.

146
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,640
So for a long time I couldn't even handle more than one cigarette a day, you know, and

147
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,760
one cigarette a day felt like this is not enough to, you know, to become a huge problem.

148
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,320
I'm not addicted, you know, the people who have real health risks from smoking or the

149
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,800
people who are smoking like two packs a fucking day, you know, not to say that there's no

150
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,800
health risk in smoking period, but you know, I didn't feel like it was becoming a big problem.

151
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,400
But for years I've been like keeping myself to any time I start to get used to smoking

152
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,540
more than one a day, that's when I stop.

153
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,240
If I get up to like two a day starting to feel normal, I could even handle three a day,

154
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,320
I would stop and I would just quit for like a month all the time.

155
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,520
I would just say like, this is getting too scary, I'm gonna quit smoking and I'd quit

156
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,440
for a while.

157
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,480
Usually what would start me back up is someone who I know who smokes would come around and

158
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,400
we'd have a cigarette together because having a cigarette together is super fun.

159
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,760
Great social, like great way to hang out with people and have a conversation is to stand

160
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
around and smoke.

161
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,840
It's super cool and fun and aesthetic and awesome.

162
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,760
But it also means that you have to go buy another pack of cigarettes and a pack of cigarettes

163
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,160
has 20 cigarettes in it and if you have 20, you're gonna smoke them all.

164
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,440
Now sometimes I would take two months to smoke 20 cigarettes, you know.

165
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,400
Sometimes I have one every couple of days, forget about them, leave them around, you

166
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,560
know, take my time.

167
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,000
I'd buy cigarettes so rarely that, you know, one of the problems with being addicted to

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,920
smoking is that it can be a huge drain on your wallet, you know.

169
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,400
It's only five and a half bucks for a pack of cigarettes here, which is pretty low compared

170
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,960
to how it is in some states, but nonetheless, you know, it's not expensive if you're not

171
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,160
doing it all the time.

172
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,960
If you're smoking a pack a day, it's obviously quite expensive.

173
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:51,000
So I had quit smoking for a little while and then Ben moved in and Ben also smokes when

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
offered.

175
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
He hadn't been before he moved in, but we started smoking together.

176
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,160
Well Ben was smoking a lot more than I'm used to.

177
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,480
He would go out three or four times a day and because I was drunk consistently for like

178
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,960
a week when Radcon happened, I was smoking just as much with him.

179
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,280
And so I got back into it and I got harder into it and I started smoking more and buying

180
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,040
more packs and buying more different kinds.

181
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,400
Well, it wasn't too bad, but then, you know, Ben loves vaping and Ben sees it as like if

182
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:30,840
you're vaping, then it's no big deal because even though like the worst thing about vaping

183
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,000
is that it's addictive, it's that you will, like it's still addicting to be addicted to

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,880
nicotine and you, you know, you had to spend money to fuel that addiction.

185
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,640
But it doesn't cause like most of the problems that cigarettes cause.

186
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,040
There have been cases where vaping was causing other problems, but those have been regulated

187
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,440
since then and like currently, I mean, it's possible that it causes problems that we don't

188
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,120
even know about yet because there's not enough research done on it yet, but like the way it

189
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,920
looks right now is that the worst thing about vaping is the fact that it's addictive, which

190
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,840
in itself doesn't seem like a huge problem as long as you're okay with being addicted

191
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,640
to something and spending money on it.

192
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:28,760
So Ben is all about vaping and he got me interested in the idea, so I bought an e-cigarette, not

193
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,560
a full blown vape, just like one that you can buy over the counter at 7-eleven, you know.

194
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,280
And what I quickly found is that because you can vape indoors and because there's no sense

195
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,600
of finality with a vape, where with a cigarette, you smoke it until it's done and then you

196
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,720
throw it away.

197
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,560
If you're trying to keep to one cigarette a day, that's very easy to do.

198
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
With a vape, you don't know how much is too much.

199
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,040
You don't know how much you're really getting.

200
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,120
You don't know when to start and stop every time you do it.

201
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,960
And so you just kind of consistently vape all day, you know, and you don't have to leave

202
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,060
the room to do it because it just dissolves into the atmosphere, it's gone, it's vapor.

203
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,060
So very quickly, I started vaping way more than I was ever smoking.

204
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,740
You know, it's way easier to vape all day.

205
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:27,340
But what I found with the e-cigarettes is that the stupid fucking, the little cartridges

206
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,580
they give you, like my cigarette came with one, you know, and then you buy them in packs

207
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
of two.

208
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,580
The cartridges only last like two days at the most.

209
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,900
Like, if you're smoking it, you know, consistently, it only lasts you about two, two and a half

210
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,500
days.

211
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,480
And a pack of two is seven dollars.

212
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,420
So this is way more expensive than smoking normal cigarettes would be.

213
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,940
Like normal cigarettes, you buy a pack for five and a half dollars and it's 20 cigarettes.

214
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,860
Even if I was smoking for a day, that lasts me five days and that's, you know, as long

215
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,420
if not longer than the seven dollars for the two fucking cartridges was gonna, you know,

216
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,700
was gonna run me.

217
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,100
So yeah, I was like, this is way more expensive.

218
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,980
So immediately, I switched back to cigarettes.

219
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,540
But now, thanks to vaping, you know, making it easy to consume nicotine all day long,

220
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,940
I found that suddenly I could smoke way more cigarettes.

221
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:34,620
Suddenly I can smoke five or six in a day, you know, which I couldn't, I could not do

222
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,620
before.

223
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Not that I didn't do it.

224
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,900
I could not even do that before.

225
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,100
And I had, I had bought these cigarettes, I bought a couple of different specialty like

226
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,940
cool brands that I had heard about, you know, that I just wanted to try and got way too

227
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,940
into it.

228
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,460
So I was like, okay, this is out of hand.

229
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,740
That's where I was when I recorded the last podcast was like the day that I decided, okay,

230
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,940
let's quit again.

231
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,580
Now here's the important question.

232
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,340
Do I take up vape or do I just quit entirely?

233
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,580
Now the obvious answer is quit entirely, right?

234
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,940
Who needs another expensive smoking hobby in your life?

235
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,860
Why even do this stuff, right?

236
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,180
But the truth is that there's a reason that I've been smoking all this time and vaping

237
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
and all this stuff.

238
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,620
And it's because it is a stress relief and it is a simple stress relief you can do from

239
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,620
home.

240
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
It's something you don't have to go anywhere.

241
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,220
You don't have to do anything other than, you know, it's an excuse to get out of the

242
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:39,140
chair, to get up and go stand outside for five to 10 minutes and just relax and, you

243
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,860
know, and consume something which slightly changes your mind for a minute and helps you

244
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,180
to have more energy and stuff, you know.

245
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,660
It's kind of like an energy drink, except not completely disgusting.

246
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,820
It makes your stomach hurt, at least for me.

247
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,860
That's what they do to me.

248
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:05,420
So you know, yeah, it's like vaping, again, the worst part about it is that it's addictive

249
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,900
and that you have to pay for that addiction.

250
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,620
But am I willing to have that addiction or do I think I should just go completely, you

251
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,420
know, completely without it?

252
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,500
So my first instinct is fuck getting your vape.

253
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,900
I'm just gonna, you know, I'm just gonna cold turkey it as I've done so many times before.

254
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,460
It's never been hard before.

255
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,820
It was never that hard to drop cigarettes for a month.

256
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,420
You know, I might feel a little like, I might feel cravings for a couple days, but I didn't

257
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,420
feel like I needed it.

258
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,140
These last three days, I felt like I fucking needed it.

259
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,740
I felt irritable.

260
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,380
I felt shitty.

261
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,380
I didn't want to do anything.

262
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,700
And it doesn't help that this was compounded with another, in the last podcast I was talking

263
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:57,980
about the sort of big release that you get, the big come from posting a video up on YouTube.

264
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,820
And I kind of got this like one-two punch going on where I finished watching Tsukuyomi

265
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,220
Moonphase, which was the last thing I had to watch for the first part of this video series

266
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,100
I have upcoming.

267
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,420
And like, it was a pain to watch.

268
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,500
Like I did not enjoy most of the show and it really sucked to try to finish it.

269
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,500
But I finished it like right at the same time that DeVu was finishing up the Cool Character

270
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,740
Designs Gorilla Gone video and that released right at the end of the month and I got all

271
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
my affairs in order.

272
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,820
I had a lot of stuff kind of piled up that I had to finish and I finished all of it at

273
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,220
once.

274
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,860
And I was standing at a point where there's no half finished project that needs to get

275
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,180
done right now.

276
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,020
You know, suddenly there's nothing on the plate.

277
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,980
We skipped PCP this week so I didn't have a PCP to edit.

278
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,860
We, you know, I finished editing the commentary for the month.

279
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Some other shit.

280
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,060
I mean, there are some half finished vlogs that I mentioned in the last podcast, but

281
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:06,100
like nothing that was immediately on the plate was left uneaten.

282
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,300
And so for like, you know, at the start of November 1st, I just kind of woke up and was

283
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,220
like, oh, I have no plans.

284
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,860
I have nothing to do.

285
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,500
And I also don't want to do anything.

286
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,420
I don't want to start anything because I have this really intense craving for nicotine

287
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,500
right now and I feel like shit.

288
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,060
And I just kind of didn't do anything for a whole day.

289
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,100
And then I borrowed the book Brand New World from Ben, started reading it that night, passed

290
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,260
out, finished reading it the next day.

291
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,220
That's all I did.

292
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,340
I read Brave New World all day.

293
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,660
Both of these days, I was awake for like probably only 12 hours or so.

294
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:52,420
Like I woke up before noon and passed out before midnight at some point.

295
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,180
But like, you know, close to those times, I just, I lost all energy.

296
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,260
I was completely lethargic.

297
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,220
I didn't want to do anything.

298
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:10,700
And then today, you know, the third, it's the fourth now, but the third is where I start

299
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
today.

300
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,660
Um, I was just like, fuck it, I'm going to buy a vape, like, because even if this is

301
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,980
a feeling that will eventually go away, even if cold turkey would eventually lead to me

302
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,940
not craving this, I thought there's no way I'm going the rest of my life without smoking

303
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
or vaping.

304
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,620
There's just, it's unreasonable to think so, you know, because again, what they provide

305
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,500
is something that I would want even if I wasn't addicted, just to be able to get up from my

306
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,180
chair, stand outside for five to 10 minutes and take some drags of something that's going

307
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:51,900
to calm me down and help me to deal with the monotony of my existence, which is a life

308
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,100
where I, all I, everything I do is connected to a computer chair, you know, and I look

309
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,660
for every excuse to get up from that chair.

310
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,660
And most of the excuses I have are to go get food and I can't constantly go get food,

311
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
you know.

312
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,180
So at some point, there has to be something else I can do and it ended up being the easiest

313
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,860
thing to do at home is to just go outside and have a smoke.

314
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,940
So I was like, I don't think I'm going to not do this ever again.

315
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,740
So I might as well just buy a fucking, like a real vape, you know, because it ultimately

316
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,620
is a lot less costly than using the e-cigarettes because even though the e-cigarettes, the

317
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,140
thing about a real vape, like the one I'm currently holding and have been taking hits

318
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:43,340
from as, as I record this is that the vape itself is like $45 and the liquid, I got like

319
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,700
a $15 bottle of liquid, which is pretty big.

320
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,340
And it comes with a battery, it's rechargeable, so I shouldn't need a replacement battery,

321
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,320
but that's something you, you know, you can get and it comes at these coils and the coils

322
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,100
last about two weeks before they burn out and then you have to replace them.

323
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,620
I have one extra one.

324
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,980
So about, they cost about $5.

325
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,300
So every two weeks, you're spending $5 on a replacement coil and every once in a while

326
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:13,460
you're buying more of the, of the shit you burn in it.

327
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:19,060
So it still costs, you know, a decent amount of money and especially it's front loaded.

328
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,060
You pay a lot upfront for all this shit, you know, and then you kind of maintenance it.

329
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,540
Whereas with the e-cigarette, it's like $10, you know, but then you immediately have to

330
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,260
buy cartridges.

331
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,940
This shit ultimately is way cheaper if you're going to be doing it for a long time compared

332
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,500
to the e-cigarettes.

333
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,380
So you know, that's a big part of it because I really didn't want to go back to the e-cigarettes

334
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,740
because they're way too expensive.

335
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,740
There's just no way I could justify spending what would probably be like $15 a fucking week

336
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,060
to keep that thing going.

337
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,460
And also doesn't hold a charge for shit.

338
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,580
You, you like, you know, drag on it for like five minutes and the battery's dead.

339
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,620
So yeah, you have to constantly have it on the charger if you're not using it, which

340
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,580
is a pain in the ass.

341
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,260
The real thing, infinitely better.

342
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:15,100
So I went for it and yeah, that's why I'm going to end up being a vapor from now on,

343
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
probably.

344
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,140
It's just a matter of like, what fits my lifestyle.

345
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,340
And I'm not saying that I would advise this to anyone else or that like my justifications

346
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:33,500
are necessarily like a good idea, but just I can't see myself as someone who would not

347
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:40,460
at all find it infinitely easier for my life for me to be able to get up and go outside

348
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,300
and take a drag of a vape as composed as opposed to being someone who doesn't, you know, have

349
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,540
to drop that little bit of money and that little bit of a, of knowing that I'm addicted

350
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:58,300
to something on the table.

351
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,780
You know, I have always been an extremely impressionable person.

352
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,220
A big part of how I end up smoking so often is that I see someone else doing it and I

353
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,740
immediately want to do it.

354
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,860
Or I just even see a cigarette or have a suggestion of their existence.

355
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,020
I'll want to do it.

356
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,980
But also when it comes to creative stuff.

357
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,140
I have a tendency when I see someone doing something, especially for something I think

358
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,500
I could do on some level that I immediately want to do it.

359
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,740
Any time I like, you know, consume a piece of media that really affects me in any kind

360
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,500
of way, I'm like, I want to recreate this.

361
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,900
I want to make something like that.

362
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:51,860
Now I've kind of curbed this in more recent years to mostly apply to things that I am

363
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,140
already in the wheelhouse of like, I no longer will watch a movie, like a great movie and

364
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,540
immediately think I want to go make a movie because I know what goes into making a movie

365
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,980
and it's not fun.

366
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,660
It's not stuff I want to do.

367
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,580
It's not really my field of expertise.

368
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:16,260
I mean, sometimes I wish, sometimes I have ideas in my head that I think would only work

369
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,420
as a movie, but not that often.

370
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,420
More often than not, the way I think has become reflective of the mediums I work in, which

371
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:36,100
are writing and YouTube videography, vlogging essentially, you know, vlogging, vlogging.

372
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:44,940
Like I mean, the stuff I do, like podcasting is not considered a vlog, but it is essentially

373
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,860
the same thing, you know, it's just a vlog without a face.

374
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,820
And while vlogging is thought of as showing your face on camera, what I do in my main

375
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:02,540
channel is just blogging, like I ran an anime blog and I write the exact same way I did

376
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,860
before, it's just now a video.

377
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:11,900
So it's basically vlogging, you know, all the stuff I do is vlogging essentially or writing.

378
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:19,980
And so when I see writers who are inspiring to me of any kind, like if I read a film crit

379
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,380
Hulk article, that's always a great inspiration for me to go make analysis videos because

380
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,620
he's my favorite media analyst.

381
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,660
And so reading his writing really, you know, gets me in that mood of like, oh, I'm going

382
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:37,820
to write a great analytical blog post, you know, but then seeing certain stuff that's

383
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:43,780
more narrative driven, that's like, that reminds me that I could be creating a narrative.

384
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:50,460
Those are the things that sort of get to me in a way that is of questionable goodness.

385
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:59,260
Because I'm not a good fiction writer, I'm not good at weaving a narrative that's anything

386
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,140
other than obvious or like is exactly what I am.

387
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,100
I'm very blunt and direct about my approach to things.

388
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,900
When I watch like an endless Jess video, one of his that go into like these really winding

389
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,980
or in depth scenarios, you know, especially something like the Horseshoe finale or its

390
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:26,100
sequel, then I have this sense of like, man, I could be doing so much more with the medium

391
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,700
of YouTube videography.

392
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:33,580
You know, I could be creating these meta loop holes and like really, you know, twisting

393
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,420
my language in such a way to set up and pay off and all that stuff and creating a more

394
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:44,700
narrative experience because I do think that people feel something more deeply when they

395
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,940
get that kind of narrative experience.

396
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:54,700
You know, I think I've made a lot of vlogs that people have told me are like deeply important

397
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
to them.

398
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,060
Once in a while, I make a podcast or a vlog and people tell me, man, this one really

399
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,500
resonated with me and it's my favorite one you've ever done and I'm so glad you said

400
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,940
this and it's been really life affirming for me and I really appreciate that.

401
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,220
But at the same time, I feel like with those kind of videos, you will eventually just internalize

402
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,020
the sentiment more so than remember the video.

403
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,420
You know, like if I say something like, here's what you, here's how you should treat your

404
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,260
life and someone says, wow, I never thought of it that way.

405
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,460
I'm going to treat my life that way from now on.

406
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,860
It's the sentiment that you'll keep remembering, not how it was delivered to you.

407
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,260
And with Endless Jess, what you remember is how it was delivered to you.

408
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,340
You know, what made Horseshoe Finale so memorable is not just the things being said, but the

409
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,940
fact that he was in that set with that shot, you know, in that pose, him saying it in the

410
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,720
way he said it.

411
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,020
Not to devalue what I do, but I definitely think that there's, there's a level of artistry

412
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,300
to what Jesse's doing, that I haven't completely tapped into yet.

413
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,380
And I have had moments that did it.

414
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:14,220
I think the biggest one is in the Asterisk War Sucks Part 9 with the McDonald's thing,

415
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:20,100
where I, you know, I just broke into this very evocative, artful feeling and I sort

416
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,180
of told this little narrative about me going to McDonald's and it really had a lot of impact.

417
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:33,400
Not just like, you know, it wasn't just about the sentiment of A1 Pictures makes things,

418
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,740
you know, all look the same.

419
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,940
It was like the way it was delivered was what's memorable about it, that, wow, he, he did this

420
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,860
film segment and, you know, I want to be able to make more things like that.

421
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:52,580
When I read novels, like classic literature, like I just read, you know, Brave New World,

422
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:58,380
and I was thinking how, if I wrote a story like Brave New World, my instinct would be

423
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,700
to just literally describe it, to just describe this world.

424
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,180
And a lot of the book is kind of that.

425
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:10,220
This book is very heavy on just world building and a lot less story.

426
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,460
And when it actually does develop a story, it gets a lot less interesting, in my opinion.

427
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,940
The most interesting part is the beginning where it's just establishing the setting.

428
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,940
But it does it in a very, you know, narrative way, with very flowery language that sort

429
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,940
of leads you through and has all these clever, you know, writing techniques.

430
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,860
It's not blunt the way my writing is, the way my talking is, where I'm just telling

431
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,660
you exactly what things are, you know.

432
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,940
There's nothing to interpret in the way I talk.

433
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:45,140
And I think that that extra little bit of having to interpret, of having to, you know,

434
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,620
process information, helps it to become more memorable and more ingrained in your psyche.

435
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,260
Where if I just tell you something, then you immediately get it.

436
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,540
But if you have to think about it a little bit to get it, then it sticks with you longer

437
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,100
and it lingers in your mind.

438
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:07,420
And that's why so many of what we consider artistic masterpieces are things that are complicated.

439
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,700
Because when it's simple, you don't ruminate on it for very long.

440
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,980
You just consume it and it's over.

441
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,260
But you know, if you're watching like Neon Genesis Evangelion and there's images in

442
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,100
that show that only mean something once you've seen the whole show twice or you've really

443
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,940
thought about it and you've really connected with it on this deep level, you'll remember

444
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,780
that for a lot longer.

445
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:39,340
And it's not necessarily that I think that those works are more valuable, but I do think

446
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,300
that they are more valued.

447
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,780
I think that people put more stock in that stuff.

448
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:49,100
I think people will talk about it for longer, they'll consider it to be a more important

449
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,660
part of their lives, they'll remember it forever.

450
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,380
And while I think I stay in people's minds because I make this consistent output that

451
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,540
I'm always making new videos and talking about new ideas and perspectives, I don't think

452
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:10,540
I've made a lot of stuff that if I stopped producing shit today, people would keep bringing

453
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,620
it up forever.

454
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,140
I think there's a few things that would get brought up a lot.

455
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,820
The asterisk war sucks, the sword online sucks.

456
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,340
Those will keep being mentioned for years if I stopped making stuff.

457
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,740
People would bring it up every once in a while in an argument, maybe a few of my other videos.

458
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,140
But most of it is stuff that matters in the moment.

459
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,900
You internalize the message and you forget the video.

460
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,300
And I see all the time, or some of the stuff that I consider the most important parts of

461
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,140
my message, people have to be reminded of it.

462
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,380
I'll bring up some video I made and people will be like, oh yeah, that video.

463
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,620
And even though they've already been using quotes from that video from then on, they

464
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,660
don't remember that the video itself existed.

465
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,900
It happens to me too.

466
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,780
I forget a lot of the stuff I've written.

467
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,500
Sometimes I go back and watch a video from two years ago that I forgot about and I'm

468
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:08,660
shocked that it makes points that I am still thinking about and forgot I made before.

469
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,820
I have that experience fairly regularly.

470
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:19,340
Because I haven't written a book that everyone remembers that conveys that message so perfectly

471
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:26,380
that you never forget that that's what you consumed.

472
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,860
So that's what I stay hung up on as a writer.

473
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:36,220
And I've kind of been worried lately and I get this worry all the time when I start

474
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:42,860
making stuff that's more specific that the further I get away from that kind of emotional

475
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:47,300
resonance, the less people are going to care about what I have to say.

476
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:53,100
Because with Shinbo in the 90s, that's a passion project for me because I love looking

477
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
at directors.

478
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,380
I love looking at that kind of intimate data stuff.

479
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,060
It's basically just data crunching.

480
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:04,800
It's just me consuming a lot of data, crunching it down and informing you of the same data.

481
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,940
But there's almost no emotional resonance to it.

482
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,780
There's no heartfelt slant, especially with Shinbo because there's so little to say about

483
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,900
him other than his stylistic trappings.

484
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:25,180
With Hideaki Anno, I could really get into the heart of what this creator was trying

485
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:30,700
to do and say with his work and it had a lot of emotional resonance.

486
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,380
Shinbo doesn't have that.

487
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,780
And I'm worried that if I started focusing on Shinbo, like if I made a bunch of videos

488
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:45,140
about him and made that the focus of my channel for a while, people would stop seeing me as

489
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:50,140
someone making interesting artistic points that resonate with them.

490
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,820
When I make a really great video, people, it resonates with people.

491
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,300
And if it didn't resonate with people, they wouldn't give me money on Patreon.

492
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,540
They wouldn't follow me on Reddit and stuff.

493
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:08,080
The kind of stuff that makes people a fan of you is the kind of stuff that touches them

494
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,420
on some kind of emotional level.

495
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,940
And I think I've done that before and I don't think I'm going to do it with Shinbo in the

496
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
90s.

497
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,100
I don't think anyone's going to get emotional about that.

498
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:23,780
So even though it's a great technical work of data crunching, even though it's very academic

499
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:30,820
and great as someone compared it to a Wikipedia article, and I was like, you know, it is like

500
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,500
a Wikipedia article, but I like Wikipedia articles.

501
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,020
And what's important about this one is that I'm the one writing the Wikipedia article.

502
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,020
I'm the one constructing all the data.

503
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,740
I'm the one compiling it.

504
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,460
I'm the one writing the article.

505
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,300
But it is ultimately a Wikipedia article.

506
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,340
And Wikipedia is a website that has so much trouble getting people to see it as more than

507
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:59,180
a utility that they always have to do these fucking huge donation funds to keep the website

508
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
running.

509
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,940
Because everyone uses Wikipedia, but no one wants to pay for it because no one thinks of

510
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,300
it as like a deep, important part of their life.

511
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
You know?

512
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,380
Granted, I do.

513
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:19,180
I always give money to those Wikipedia fundraisers, but you know, I don't want people to necessarily

514
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,180
see me that way.

515
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,820
I don't want people to start looking at me as just a repository for information, but

516
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:31,020
one that's not like actually giving you something meaningful and personal because I like being

517
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,380
able to provide those things.

518
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,180
So I always feel like I have to strike a balance.

519
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:44,220
And that's why I constantly feel like I have to be taking on like this multitude of projects

520
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,820
where there's one half of me that's like, you need to make the biggest research project

521
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,820
ever.

522
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,900
And then there's the other half that's like, you need to make the biggest emotional like

523
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,980
meta, you know, make people think about themselves and their lives thing ever.

524
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,540
And it's great when those things can come to a head.

525
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,140
Something like the asterisk war sucks is a lot of those things coming to a head.

526
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
Every post in it is very emotional.

527
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,100
It's like, you know, here's how to write a good main character.

528
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,380
That's very relatable, very like everyone wants to know who's the worst anime character

529
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,500
in history, you know, who, how do you write a bad setting?

530
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
What's what's wrong with this studio?

531
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,540
Whoa, this show is good and that one's bad.

532
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:32,220
Like the fucking the chivalry of a failed night comparison is like, it's poetry that

533
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,660
I was able to find that connection.

534
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,820
Like that had nothing to do with me pure luck that those two shows aired at the same time

535
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:45,420
and were so parallel and that they could have such a strong narrative together that these

536
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,860
two shows like that one could be so bad and one could be okay and yet be almost all the

537
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,860
same components.

538
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,300
I could not have possibly asked for something better than that.

539
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:02,020
I will never top the level of beautiful coincidence that allowed me to write that piece because

540
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,980
it's so narratively strong, even though it's an analysis, even though it's data crunching,

541
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,500
it has the strongest narrative to it and I'll never get something that, you know, that perfect

542
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
again.

543
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:22,140
But I can still string narratives out of analysis, you know, and the next thing I've written

544
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,500
about Shinbo does, I did write a little bit more narrative into it a little bit more here's

545
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:34,300
why you should care about this as opposed to here's just a bunch of data, you know.

546
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,420
And yeah, like as I read these classic novels and classic literature and stuff and I feel

547
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,340
like people don't like this for the data.

548
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,140
They like it because it's memorable because it sticks with you because the things it makes

549
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:53,180
you think about are presented in such a way where oftentimes it's just that one sentence

550
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:59,340
that one perfectly worded sentence in the middle of, you know, of a chapter where suddenly

551
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,980
it like clicks into place and you totally get the point and it's put so eloquently that

552
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:15,100
you'll never forget that phrasing and, you know, I want to have moments like that.

553
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:22,980
Now continuing on the subject of the previous podcast, I listened to it back and I couldn't

554
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:31,780
help but feel like, wow, I come off as arrogant to the point of borderline megalomaniacal in

555
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,900
this podcast.

556
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:41,540
And you know, if there's one criticism I get a lot of it's that I'm arrogant and egotistical.

557
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:47,980
That's by far the most common thing that gets brought out against me and I completely agree

558
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,620
with it.

559
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:56,460
But it's funny because I feel like I don't know if that's something that I could change

560
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,340
or if that I'd be, if I'd be better without it.

561
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,580
I think it's kind of a matter of there's just certain people who aren't going to like you

562
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,700
in this world, you know.

563
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:14,580
When people criticize me for being arrogant, all I can think is, yes, I am arrogant.

564
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,220
Like there's nothing I could do about that.

565
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:24,740
Like it feels weird as a criticism for me because it's not a constructive criticism.

566
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,860
It's basically you're explaining why you don't like me and it's totally understandable.

567
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,740
But to say that like, you know, he needs to be less arrogant.

568
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,140
It's like, I can't just do that.

569
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,140
It's how I am.

570
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,020
And it's because, and I'm sure I've explained this somewhere before, but I'm going to put

571
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:49,260
it, I'm going to put it in clear terms here and explain from the beginning.

572
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,220
I've mentioned before that I grew up being told that I was a genius.

573
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,980
My parents told me that I was a genius.

574
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,420
They took me to a doctor.

575
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,060
I was about two years old.

576
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,260
They actually thought, because I acted so weird, they thought I wonder if he has autism because

577
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,260
autism was the craze of the times, early 90s autism starting to take off as a thing that

578
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,740
gets diagnosed.

579
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,140
They take me to the doctor and the doctor says, I don't think he has autism.

580
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,260
I think he's a genius.

581
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,900
So they become convinced I'm a genius and they tell me as much my whole life.

582
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,980
And I learned things a little faster than other kids, you know, but I also had weird

583
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:28,100
habits and tendencies like lining up cars.

584
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,940
I would just take all the cars I had and line them up by size and do that obsessively all

585
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:39,460
day, make sure all the lines were perfect, you know, very sort of autistic way of acting.

586
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:44,820
And if I reflect on myself from any point up through high school, possibly even up through

587
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:50,580
my first job, and I've taken like, you know, Asperger's quizzes on lines and got like,

588
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,700
you know, like you definitely have Asperger's scores until I started working on YouTube

589
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,980
and a lot of the things that I used to do, I completely don't anymore.

590
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,420
And I don't think I would qualify even slightly at this point, which is weird.

591
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:11,220
But I do think it's considered a thing that you can kind of grow out of to some extent,

592
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,140
like it's considered something that's more amongst young people to have.

593
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,540
I don't know if that's just because more young people are diagnosed or what, but I don't

594
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,980
know, it's odd.

595
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:26,300
But in any case, I was raised being told I was a genius, so I believed it.

596
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,220
And all throughout school, every year, everyone, you know, people constantly ragged on me and

597
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,100
made fun of me and hated me for this or that reason.

598
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,220
And I saw it as they're all wrong about me.

599
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,060
I know that I'm a genius, so everyone else must be an idiot.

600
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:48,580
But then when I got into high school, it kind of flipped on its head just a little bit.

601
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:54,580
Not that I thought I was any less intelligent, but I thought that clearly it's my fault I'm

602
00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:01,700
not popular, you know, to like, to flip on the Tomoko, no matter how I look at it, it's

603
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,260
your fault I'm not popular.

604
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,660
I didn't feel that way.

605
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:11,540
I felt like me being smarter than everyone else was not working to my benefit, you know,

606
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:16,820
because I think that it's sort of what separated me from like the classic idea of the fedora,

607
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:22,180
of the like the the Elliot Roger, where Elliot Roger said, you know, I'm perfect.

608
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,380
So if everyone else doesn't like me, it must be because they're all terrible.

609
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:34,340
But I saw it as, you know, I'm perfect, but I shouldn't be perfect.

610
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:40,060
I should be like those people, you know, clearly they're happier the way they are, and I shouldn't

611
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,060
be the way I am.

612
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:46,540
I probably wasn't this well thought out, you know, when I was that age.

613
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,580
I'm able now as a guy who's able to put things into very easy, clear terms to like put it

614
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,580
that way.

615
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,100
I would not have been able to describe it this way at that age.

616
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,380
But I definitely felt like I was an outsider and I was wrong for being an outsider.

617
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,580
This was all my fault, but I wasn't changing it, you know, I wouldn't change anything.

618
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,060
I was never willing to like give an inch.

619
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:15,740
I just was like hoping that one day I'd run into someone who accepted me for who I was,

620
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,620
you know, I always thought, you know, I'm not going to go and change myself to try to fit

621
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,620
other people.

622
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,780
I'm going to wait until someone accepts me for who I am.

623
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:32,220
But until then, I'm I'm just going to be this lonely, sad sack of shit.

624
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,620
And now I'm famous and everybody loves me.

625
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:45,060
So basically when I was 16, I remember coming up with this phrase, I'm sure I've repeated

626
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:52,300
this, that if I can't do what I want, then I'm going to kill myself.

627
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:59,620
Because the way I saw it is that life, normal life to me was nothing but depressing.

628
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,940
It was just a bad time.

629
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:07,380
Trying to act normal, trying to act like other people only made things worse.

630
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,060
You know, if I had tried to dress differently or act differently or get into different things

631
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,860
than what I liked or to get a normal job that I didn't want to do, all of those things were

632
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:22,460
only going to make me even more unhappy than I already was.

633
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:28,180
So the only way I was ever going to be happy is if I did something I wanted to do.

634
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:34,460
You know, if I did a job I wanted to do, if I worked creatively, if I got to live my passions,

635
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,020
if I got to act how I want to act.

636
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:42,220
And I really thought that life was not worth living otherwise.

637
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,140
Like what's the point of living if you're not going to be happy?

638
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,700
You know, if you're not going to be as happy as you can be, or as you want to be.

639
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:58,020
If I'm going to feel like I'm not achieving my full potential, my whole life, that I'm

640
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,340
never going to be happy about it.

641
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,500
So I might as well just kill myself.

642
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,060
Why live if your life sucks?

643
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,100
That was my logic.

644
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:14,740
So I went about it as let's never do anything other than what I want.

645
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:22,420
And for years I struggled with, you know, like, I mean it was a long time before I got off

646
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,420
my feet.

647
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,820
And I still did it young.

648
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:29,380
You know, I was like 23 when my YouTube career really took off.

649
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:35,300
But you know, between when I graduated high school at 17 and started taking off on YouTube

650
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:40,540
at 23, was just a whole lot of me doing things I didn't want to do.

651
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,260
All while thinking I'm just working towards the thing I want.

652
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,700
You know, in the background I'm working towards the thing I actually want to be doing.

653
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,700
And eventually I was doing the thing I actually wanted to be doing.

654
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,860
And that's when I, you know, I felt good ever since.

655
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,660
I felt good about life.

656
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,620
But I still have to maintain that.

657
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:08,820
You know, I still have to be convinced that what I'm doing is right and that I like what

658
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,540
I'm doing and that I like where my life is going.

659
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:16,620
Because if I wasn't convinced of those things, then laying under that just one layer deeper

660
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:22,580
is a person who thinks that if I'm not feeling that way, I might as well be dead.

661
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,740
That's still a person who lives down there.

662
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:30,740
You know, the guy who has attempted suicide in the past.

663
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:37,220
Someone who, you know, went to the hospital to try to have them put me on suicide watch.

664
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:42,180
The kind of person who was so anxious and so paranoid about everything that I would just

665
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:48,980
not leave my room sometimes, you know, for long periods and just, and not talk to anyone

666
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,900
about any problems I was having and bottle it all up.

667
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,940
That person's still down there.

668
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:00,820
And the only thing that I can do to keep them at bay is to constantly convince myself that

669
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,460
I'm doing things right and that I'm happy with where things are going.

670
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,860
And that's easy to do when I'm doing exactly what I always hoped I would be doing, which

671
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,940
is what I am doing.

672
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,980
But to try and speak of something else would be dishonest.

673
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,660
To try and say, like, to try and act humble or something.

674
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,700
That's not reflective of how I feel because how I feel is like I'm amazing and I'm on

675
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,660
top of the world and everything's perfect because if I didn't feel that way, then it

676
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:37,220
would just, it would just regress to how it was before, you know?

677
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:43,660
So to me, the arrogance and the ego is what's keeping me afloat.

678
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:50,260
And it's not a facade, it's all completely honest and I have to be honest because being

679
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,740
honest is the thing I always wanted to do.

680
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,860
It's the thing, it's the way I wanted to live my life, was do honesty.

681
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:02,020
And if I started, you know, lying about it, then it would just be dragging me back down.

682
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:06,380
Like, I would be depressed about the fact that I was lying and not doing what I want

683
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,260
to do, which is be honest, you know?

684
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:16,460
And being honest makes me happy, which makes me egotistical, which makes me arrogant.

685
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,260
It's a weird cycle.

686
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:26,420
And so, like, ultimately, sometimes I feel bad because I recognize the arrogance.

687
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:34,540
I recognize sometimes when I'm just going, like, so full tilt on the idea that I'm just

688
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,460
amazing and stuff.

689
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,500
And I do hold myself in high regard.

690
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,700
And not to say that I think I'm, like, the best writer or anything like that.

691
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,580
There's tons of people I look up to.

692
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:50,060
There's tons of people who, I mean, Film Crit Hulk is a perfect example.

693
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:56,460
I don't think I'm close to the caliber of a writer that he is in terms of being able

694
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:02,820
to convey very grand emotions in his writing and to really, like, bring this excitement

695
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:06,840
that after you're done reading one of his things, you're just so excited about what

696
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,300
you just read, you know?

697
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,260
Or on a technical level, I'm not as good as Ghost Lightning, who was, you know, the

698
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,380
guy who sort of trained me in how to write better.

699
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,620
He was just more eloquent, had better words, was better read, you know?

700
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,180
And over time, I will eventually be as good as Ghost Lightning.

701
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,900
Maybe I'll eventually be as good as Film Crit Hulk because I don't think either one of them

702
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,380
is an extraordinary genius who I could never hope to match.

703
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:40,980
They both are just ten years older than me, you know, and ten years more experience, ten

704
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,580
years more writing, ten years more reading, ten years more knowledge.

705
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,380
And eventually I'll have that, and I think I'll be as good as either of them.

706
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,580
There are some people who I'll probably never be as good as.

707
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:55,980
I don't think I'll ever be as good a writer as Andrew Hussey of Homestuck because the

708
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:03,100
way that he writes is this, like, this insane natural extension of his mind.

709
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:08,140
It's like his whole creativity goes into, yeah, goes into Homestuck and it's just so

710
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,820
much more sprawling and creative than anything I'll probably ever do.

711
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:20,620
I'll never write something as massive as Homestuck and as influential and as, you know, as wide

712
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,900
appealing or anything like that.

713
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,060
But, you know, he's a very special kind of genius.

714
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:31,020
But I am nonetheless going to be a great writer.

715
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:37,140
And I do think that I'm better at writing than most of my contemporaries, most people

716
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:42,460
my age, most people on YouTube, certainly all anime writers.

717
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:48,500
You know, I don't see anybody, maybe some text writers, you know, can beat me.

718
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:56,820
Some people who, I still think that text blogging is a lot ahead of YouTubeing in terms of writing

719
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:03,060
because I think the kind of people who can YouTube is maybe a different subset from people

720
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,660
who can write well.

721
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,860
You know, there is some crossover but I feel like there's a difference in priorities and

722
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:14,620
that so many people who figure out how to YouTube well by having a good voice, having

723
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:20,580
good production values, you know, have not actually figured out how to write well yet.

724
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,140
Some of my friends are kind of on that borderline where I think Hippo, Crit and Best Guy Ever

725
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,540
are both fantastic video makers, not very good writers.

726
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,340
Great at coming up with stuff in video form that I'd never think of, you know, both great

727
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,860
editors, far better editors than I have ever been.

728
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:44,000
You know, Hippo can make jokes out of the creativity of how he films things and the

729
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,340
creativity of how he edits things and performs things that that's half the joke, you know.

730
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:56,040
He can take a joke that is just badly written and deliver it so hilariously that it becomes

731
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,880
a good joke, you know, and Best Guy Ever can edit his fucking, he can edit anything.

732
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,840
He knows his way around the programs perfectly.

733
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:10,560
I don't have those skills but I can definitely write most people under the table and the

734
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:17,840
only person I know who is better at writing than me in the video world is Endless Jess.

735
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:25,080
He's the only person who's more clever, more, you know, more intimately connected to the

736
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:31,760
written word and that's because Jesse writes way more than he video produces.

737
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,760
He has like hundreds of unreleased scripts.

738
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,040
He writes blog posts on Patreon now.

739
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,040
He's written tons of shit.

740
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,560
I've seen his writing on Facebook where he would write these rants and stuff.

741
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:48,180
Jesse's always been more of a writer and also more of a reader than most everyone I know.

742
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,320
He reads a lot more books.

743
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,800
He's just better with the language than I am.

744
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,000
Mr. Betung is better with the language than I am so far.

745
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,420
I don't think I would have too much catching up to do to him but he's definitely better

746
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,560
with the language than I am.

747
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,680
Those are the only people I know of on YouTube who I can definitively say that about, who

748
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,400
I watch and I go, that guy's a better writer than me, you know.

749
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:22,160
So yes, I am arrogant but I also see myself in a place, in a place, in a gradient and

750
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,960
not everyone would agree with the gradient.

751
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:31,680
Not everybody would put everyone in the same places that I do but when you think of yourself

752
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,840
the way I do, I think for a lot of people who are looking at it from the outside, they

753
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,040
just see a bunch of titans.

754
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,400
Anyone who writes at all, anyone who's a creative, they are just these gods far above

755
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,480
and if they don't really like you, like, you know, if someone doesn't really like my writing

756
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,600
and I compare myself to a writer who they do like, they see it as like, how dare you,

757
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:03,080
this lowly plebeian, compare yourself to one of the exalted gods, you know.

758
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:09,000
When I get that, but for me as a writer, I see myself as working my way up a ladder,

759
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,960
a ladder of writers.

760
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,480
If I go up one rung, bam, I've grasped the rung that puts me above this other guy, you

761
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,480
know.

762
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,800
When I started writing video, I would have put myself on the level of errant signal and,

763
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,640
well, Egoraptor might have been a much better video producer than me, for sure.

764
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,400
But like, in terms of writing, I would have put myself around Egoraptor, errant signal

765
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
and stuff.

766
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,840
Now I think I'm better than them.

767
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,220
I do think I'm a better writer than errant signal, whose style has not progressed almost

768
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:43,280
at all in the time I've been watching him, he makes very little progress.

769
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,380
And Egoraptor, who just stopped writing about three or four years ago, and for whom writing

770
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,560
is a very laborious process as I understand it.

771
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,320
So you know, I'm making progress, I'm climbing the ladder, one day I'll be able to write

772
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,880
as well as Beton, one day unless Beton continues improving, one day I'll be able to write as

773
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:10,080
well as Ghost Lightning and Film Crit Hulk, and maybe if I'm fucking lucky, I'll be able

774
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:15,280
to write as well as Jesse, but I do think Jesse is also still improving and still hashing

775
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,320
out whole new ways of writing and whole new creativities.

776
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:25,160
So I think with him, I'll be chasing a moving object that might even be moving faster than

777
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,160
I am.

778
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,360
But still, as a writer, this is how you think of yourself.

779
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,160
I am in that world.

780
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,960
I am a professional.

781
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,200
This is my job.

782
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:44,640
Whether you think I can write well or not, the fact is that I'm a professional writer.

783
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,720
How do you want to measure it?

784
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:53,280
Do you want to measure it by your personal taste, or do you want to measure it by accomplishment?

785
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,600
I've got 250,000 subscribers.

786
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,040
I make a middle-class wage doing what I do.

787
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,120
I live happily.

788
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:11,680
I can't think of an oculod that you wouldn't ascribe to me other than something that is

789
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,840
very personal to you.

790
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:22,200
So yes, I'm arrogant, but I also have accomplished the things that make someone arrogant.

791
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,200
I've been there.

792
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:32,960
I've been to the mountain, and if you think that that's nothing special, then I agree.

793
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:40,200
I think that the arrogance is not necessary for having completed these tasks, but it is

794
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,440
what gets me through life.

795
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,920
It's how I see myself, and I see myself as I need to be this way in order to keep making

796
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,920
progress.

797
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,880
If I don't see myself as getting better, if I don't see myself as trying to climb towards

798
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:01,720
these gods, then I'll never reach those gods.

799
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,880
I think if you're the kind of person who's sitting around saying, like, I can't compare

800
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,840
myself to the greats, how can you ever hope to be like the greats?

801
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:16,120
And that's all I want, is to be the best I can possibly be, and if I can possibly be

802
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,120
as great as the greats, then I gotta keep climbing and keep looking at myself as someone

803
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:31,040
who's gotten better, and is good, and is doing everything to put me on that path.

804
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,280
I intended to go into that rant more apologetically, but I ended up coming out of it more arrogant

805
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:43,560
than ever before, so hopefully at least this seems like it's probably an interesting podcast.

806
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:50,040
This has all been one recording so far, so I'm gonna go pass out now, and maybe there'll

807
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:56,360
be more from another day.

808
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:04,680
So it's October 7th now, the day that probably this video will come out, the night rather.

809
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:12,240
I recorded the whole first hour of this all on the 4th, and it's kind of funny to think

810
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:18,360
of this as a show that, you know, because I put dates on it, and it's always like a

811
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,040
specific day, but it's being recorded for the whole week, so you should really think

812
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:30,560
of it as the week of November 7th, that the video comes out, or that the video represents

813
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,600
rather than the day.

814
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:38,560
But the reason I chose to use dates is because I find numbering everything boring, you know,

815
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:44,920
I have a lot of, I've always kind of presented numbered shows on YouTube, because it implies

816
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,120
that you have to watch them in a certain order, and I hate that when it's a show that you

817
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,720
don't have to watch in a certain order, and I just think it's a bad way to go about things,

818
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,120
because if you number everything, people aren't gonna go back and find number one to start

819
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,120
from there.

820
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,320
Now I have numbered some shows on After Dark, mostly because I don't take it that seriously,

821
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,000
those videos, or like the first one kind of explains the concept, and you might as well

822
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,280
watch them in order and why not kind of thing, but I generally don't like numbered series

823
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,280
that much.

824
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:22,000
The Procrastinators is numbered kind of unnecessarily, like you don't really have to listen to them

825
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,480
in order, and nobody does, so the numbers are just kind of there to keep track of how

826
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,480
many we've done.

827
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,760
But with this podcast I thought, why not just label each one with a date, so you can tell

828
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,960
them apart, they don't have to have unique titles, but they're not numbered.

829
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,080
And it kind of implies that it's a diary, you know, because it's really, it's pretty

830
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:47,800
much like if I had a diary, this is the kind of stuff I'd be putting in it, you know, and

831
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:53,160
these days I am much more liable to record something than I am to write something.

832
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:57,800
I mean like the way I treat vlogs now is how I used to treat Tumblr back in the day, like

833
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,880
how, you know, I'd get a random idea that wasn't quite enough for like a video, but

834
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,520
a little too much for a tweet, I'd make a Tumblr post about it, nowadays I would make

835
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:14,360
a vlog, or a podcast, and this podcast in particular is like super, you know, personal

836
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:19,800
diary stories, so I think it makes sense to give them dates.

837
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,480
In other news, I've felt better again ever since I started vaping, talked about that

838
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,160
earlier in this episode, that I went out, wait did I mention that I went out and bought

839
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,160
a vape?

840
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,480
I think I did in the early part, I think that was the day I had done it, and I felt great

841
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:40,880
ever since, so that problem's out of the way.

842
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,680
Vaping is super fun, although it is annoying because I keep doing it during podcasts and

843
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:50,840
stuff and then not realizing how loud it is until listening to those back, so I'm gonna

844
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,040
try to curb that habit a little bit, try to make it to, it's just that it's such an ideal

845
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,000
time because I'm not doing a lot of other stuff, you know, especially if I have somebody

846
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,480
else with me and I have to like listen to them, then you know, it's like what do I do

847
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,400
with my hands while listening to them?

848
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,600
You know, like on the pub crawl, we always drink when the other person's talking, you

849
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,960
know, that's how we end up getting so drunk on the show, it's just whoever's not talking

850
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,320
is usually drinking.

851
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:24,560
But I felt good the last few days, I've kind of become a real comic book boy in a way that

852
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:31,600
I've always wanted to and never did until now, and it's really entirely because of now

853
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,400
I understand how comics work, I don't remember if I mentioned this in another episode, that

854
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,700
like, you know, Jesse started up the panel cast and it got me looking into individual

855
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:46,560
comics and what I realized as I was reading through Gwenpool and The Vision, like shortly

856
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:52,520
after reading The Vision, it suddenly became very clear to me that comic books almost always

857
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:59,880
come out in these like one or two volume stories, like even if it's a long running comic, like

858
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,120
I've always been under the impression that you really have, like there's these long runners

859
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:08,080
that have been going on forever and you have to read the whole fucking thing, all 80 volumes

860
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,800
or the endless, the endless annals of this comic book, you know, in order to understand

861
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,440
it, and I think it doesn't help that I was into DC, because when I tried to get into

862
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:25,400
comics in 2012, it was because the New 52 had just started, and like, the thing about

863
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,960
New 52 is that it was like a complete reboot of the entire DC universe, so I thought, well

864
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,000
that's a really easy way for me to get into it, I mean that's exactly what they were going

865
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,680
for, is to get a bunch of new comic book readers to have an easy end and not feel like they

866
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:43,280
had to catch up on 80 years of continuity, you know, and so I'd read, you know, a few

867
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:48,920
of the ones that interested me, I read Batwoman, which I love, Swamp Thing was, Animal Man

868
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:55,920
was okay, and there was a couple others I read, but like, because it was so early on,

869
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,680
I was under the impression that like, I'm just going to be reading these forever, like

870
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,560
this is a, this new comic has started up, and it's going to keep going and going and

871
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:07,720
going until the end of time, you know, and it will switch artists weirdly and randomly

872
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,960
and I won't know what's going on sometimes. I didn't realize that the way comics really

873
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,480
work is more like, you know, like the comic will keep going on forever, but it's like

874
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:22,080
these little stories that are then later collected into graphic novels, or their stand-alones

875
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:26,760
and stuff like that, and there's tons of those, and a lot of them are the most interesting,

876
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,880
a lot of the best stories are just like these little one volume things that are meant to

877
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:37,680
be graphic novels and shit like that, and I never realized how much of comics was like

878
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:43,120
that. So, you know, now I'm looking at, like I've been reading a bunch of stuff where I

879
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:47,840
just pick some, some series, you know, some part of a series, and I just read that, and

880
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,040
I'm like, oh, okay, now I've completed that whole thing and I have a better understanding

881
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:57,680
of the characters and what's going on. Jesse recommended this one Silver Surfer comic with

882
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,160
like unbelievably gorgeous artwork. It's only four issues. It was about the death of Silver

883
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,640
Surfer, and it was fucking epic and cool, and now I, I understand Silver Surfer, and then,

884
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:13,000
um, you know, did the same thing with a few others, and the one that was most interesting

885
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,280
is just yesterday, I went out and saw Doctor Strange, and it was the first time that I

886
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:25,280
ever felt like I understood what comic book fans feel when they watch a comic book movie,

887
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:32,160
because I, I've heard stuff like Kevin Smith on his podcast where he talks about, like,

888
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:39,160
um, how he'll, he'll go out and see like Batman v Superman, and just the fact that this one

889
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:45,120
kind of character shows up was enough to justify the whole movie's existence to him. Like, even

890
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,840
though he admitted to all these flaws in the movie, like, the fact that that thing was

891
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,160
there made it interesting and worth seeing, and like, that's something I couldn't relate

892
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,280
to at all. But with this Doctor Strange movie, I was like, I, I went into it and I, I watched

893
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:02,520
it, it was okay, it's a, it's a decent movie, and just like any other Marvel movie, I mean,

894
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,600
my impression of all the Marvel movies is basically, yeah, that's a fun time, but they're

895
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,520
all pretty much the exact same thing, I'm, I'm very sick of the, the formula of them,

896
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,760
but what made it different this time was that I watched it because I was curious about Doctor

897
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,560
Strange, because I had just read in Gwenpool where Doctor Strange shows up and he seemed

898
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,640
really cool, and then he was in the Silver Surfer comic and he seemed really cool, and

899
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,640
I was like, man, I kind of want to read Doctor Strange, so then I go out and I see this movie,

900
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,040
and now I know the whole backstory of Doctor Strange, I didn't know any of it, I knew nothing

901
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:38,560
about him other than that he was like, basically a time lord, you know, that's like all I knew,

902
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:43,720
so now I know his whole backstory, and like, in the context of seeing the movie, that wouldn't

903
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,840
have been that exciting, it would have been like, alright, well, now I know about another

904
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,920
superhero guy, whatever, but where it got exciting was I came home and I immediately read the

905
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,600
whole current run of Doctor Strange that started last year, so 13 issues, the first 10 of which

906
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:04,080
comprise a pretty open and shut story, like, the story is still, like, the current story continues

907
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:09,440
from where that one left off, but it's like, it's a definitively different chapter, you know,

908
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,680
it's a new story, it's got a new artist who's not nearly as good as the other one, but like,

909
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,600
what was great about it was I picked up this comic and like, it takes place, you know,

910
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:23,280
pretty far into Doctor Strange's narrative, but I now know who all these characters are,

911
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,040
like, I completely got it, I knew who everyone was, why they were important, and I was like,

912
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,600
sweet, you know, all I needed to catch up on was like, the little subtle changes between the

913
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:37,520
film and comic interpretations, so yeah, it was really neat, and I got to read that comic,

914
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:43,120
and I think I appreciated it more because I'd seen the origin story, and the comic is even

915
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:47,920
better than the movie, because the movie has the problems of following, you know, the Marvel

916
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,560
Cinematic Universe formula too much, and being, well, very trippy for a mainstream movie, not

917
01:07:54,560 --> 01:08:00,480
that trippy compared to what you would find in a comic book, whereas the comic is like,

918
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,800
especially trippy even for a comic book, you know, like, when I was watching that film,

919
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:12,240
I was thinking, this is kind of epic in a way that's not unlike how Silver Surfer was epic,

920
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,880
because Silver Surfer had these like, crazy-ass ideas, he's like, these high-minded sci-fi concepts

921
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:22,000
just thrown about, you know, and the movie kind of does that, but the comic of Doctor Strange,

922
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,640
like, the whole point of it is that it's just non-stop insanity, like, because Doctor Strange's

923
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:37,440
world is one of just like, you know, mind-breaking horror at all times, so yeah, I think the film

924
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:44,240
does a good job of like, broaching the subject of Doctor Strange, whereas the comic really fulfills

925
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:50,800
the promise of Doctor Strange in a way, so yeah, it was pretty cool, and I read the comic, I really

926
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:55,520
liked it, particularly the first part, the new storyline that it's now going into isn't as

927
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,760
interesting, but I'll keep up with it for a while, you know, probably read some other older Doctor

928
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:06,720
Strange stories that are good, you know, and check out, check out what's out there, but now I just

929
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:12,640
feel so much more acclimated to what comics are, and like, how to explore that medium, you know,

930
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,520
that I can read it in these little bite-sized chunks, and like, most of them involve other

931
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,560
characters, so I can, you know, start to feel out who they are, like, I got interested in Doctor

932
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:31,280
Strange because he was in Gwenpool and Silver Surfer, and even those characters I now only know

933
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:35,920
so much about, and I'd like to see more of them, you know, Scarlet Witch plays a big role in the

934
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,000
Vision comic, Scarlet Witch is also in Doctor Strange, so now I'm curious about Scarlet Witch,

935
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,400
I might read her thing, you know, so yeah, it's a cool way to just jump into this web,

936
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,720
and like, find your way around, and I think I like the Marvel stuff more than the DC stuff,

937
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:56,480
it could just be that I haven't read the best DC stories, you know, like, Batwoman, what I kind

938
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,320
of liked about it was that it was not super connected to everything else, and I mean, it becomes sort

939
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,640
of tied up in the whole Batman thing, you know, obviously it's related to Batman, but she was

940
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,800
pretty individual, and I didn't feel like I had to know too many other things in order to appreciate

941
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:17,840
it, but with the Marvel universe, I feel more inclined to explore all these different people

942
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,040
and find out about them and why they're important to one another, and I'm sure at some point it'll,

943
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:28,880
like, the whole broken continuity thing will shatter my mind to pieces, but honestly,

944
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,600
it doesn't bother me that much because I kind of see each individual comic as like a parallel

945
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:41,040
universe from the last one, like, I can't really, like, I read Doctor Strange, and I've read Gwenpool,

946
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:46,000
and I don't think that they necessarily, like, it doesn't make sense to have them in the same timeline,

947
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,600
like, I don't know at what, like, Doctor Strange is definitely the same character in both stories,

948
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:58,160
but with what's going on in the Doctor Strange story, he couldn't possibly appear as he does

949
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,880
in the Gwenpool story, so when does her story even take place in comparison to his?

950
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,920
When does any of, it's such like a temporal fuckfest, like, to even read two comics that,

951
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,880
for me, it's easier to just compartmentalize each of them as just a totally different comic

952
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,120
that happens to overlap in some ways with another one, you know, kind of like reading or watching

953
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:24,560
everything by a clamp if you're an anime fan who knows clamp, like, they had the same characters

954
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,080
would appear in all these different stories, but not necessarily make sense in them.

955
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:36,720
Now, what's, what it's given me to get into comics is something great, because I've long

956
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:43,200
wanted to explore every medium. I want to be someone who is cultured in every, like, you know,

957
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:50,080
main medium of art, and part of it is because I want to see all these different interesting

958
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,000
ideas and, you know, explore all these things and be able to have conversations about them,

959
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:01,280
but also a more selfish part is that all of it helps me to justify anime, because I explain

960
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,720
this in my video, like, is anything deep, where when I consume stuff in other mediums that is

961
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:13,600
considered to be deep, it never actually feels like, like, like anime is any less deep, and I

962
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:19,920
feel like there's this, this cultural idea in every medium that, like, this medium's deeper than

963
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,640
that one. This one's got more going on, and I think right now, the medium that's the most

964
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,920
pretentious is film, because even though we've got this whole, like, actually it might even be

965
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,800
spurned on by this whole Marvel universe thing, where there's all these big Marvel popcorn movies,

966
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:40,400
and it's really created this heavy divide in the film communities of people who, because they see

967
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:47,600
those movies, they now are, like, overcompensating on loving the, the, the so-called masterpieces,

968
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:53,760
the, like, you know, the super deep films and stuff, and the artsy stuff, and I feel like there's

969
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,880
this overcompensation happening to really celebrate the super deep stuff, and to present it, like,

970
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:06,000
it's this high-brow shit, whereas other mediums, I feel like there's, there's not so much of a divide

971
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,960
between the, the popcorn stuff and the deep stuff, that, like, stuff can bridge that gap fairly easily,

972
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,480
and anime bridges that gap constantly, where I really think that shows, like, Kill A Kill or

973
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:25,520
Guru on the Gone have some of the deepest stories I've ever seen, you know, in any medium, and they

974
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:32,080
can do that while still being something that can also entertain and be, be fairly normal, you know,

975
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:37,680
whereas in other mediums, like, film, and there are, there are films that do this well, Speed Racer,

976
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:44,640
great example, deep story, high intensity, fun, you know, wacky kind of presentation,

977
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:50,960
that totally works with the nature of the story, but I feel like a lot of people feel this pressure

978
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:58,320
that a film has to either be, or it has to be, you know, like, there's, there's, there's a lack of

979
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:04,240
the middle ground that should be there, that other mediums are exploring well, and the more I read,

980
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:09,280
and this is especially true when I read books and fiction, because I've been reading a little bit

981
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:16,560
more fiction the last, the last couple weeks, and as, I'm not going to say which story, because

982
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,640
there's some I haven't finished yet, and I don't want to jinx myself by saying that I'm reading it,

983
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:25,360
and then that'll make me never finish it, but I did finish Brave New World, which I hadn't read

984
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:30,880
before, and that was pretty great, and like, as I read fiction that is some of which is considered

985
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:38,000
to be super deep, I find that it actually has a much better approach to like, mixing high and

986
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,040
lowbrow kind of ideas, where like, the stories that are considered classics, the ones that are

987
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:48,800
like really heralded as high art pieces, are not pretentious about it, none of them are these like

988
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:56,240
stuffy, classy, oh, everything is the, the, the, the perfect, oh, the cinematography, the blocking,

989
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,560
like, it's not quite like that, most of it's actually a lot more experimental in free form,

990
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,680
like the books that people really celebrate are usually the ones that combine like really

991
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:14,720
heady and interesting ideas with like, this very human, like, rough and gritty kind of feeling,

992
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:19,200
you know, and, and those are the, those are the ones that are like considered masterpieces,

993
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,920
whereas I feel like, you know, we do get some films that are kind of like that, but then people

994
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,520
always want to take a step back and be like, oh, well, but you know, like, like something like

995
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:33,200
District 9 is a great example of a film that, that's very dirty and very homey, you know, and

996
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,520
like low budget and gritty, but also has this big message, but even with that movie, I feel like

997
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:44,160
people are so hesitant to call that a masterpiece, because of the fact that it's not like a classy

998
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:50,640
high art movie, you know, and I'm like, but that's, but it's a masterpiece, you know, like, how do you,

999
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,800
like, if you, if this was a book that did the same thing, had the same approach, you would

1000
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:02,400
definitely say it was a masterpiece, you know, um, and anime, I feel like the people, like, people

1001
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:08,000
who, who, who consume other mediums and who are kind of ashamed of anime and like its animanness

1002
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,400
are only willing to celebrate the stuff that's like classy, you know, and I talked about that,

1003
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,960
this is basically what my boring taste in anime video was all about, this whole idea of like,

1004
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,680
people who, you know, only want to present themselves as, oh, well, I like, uh, Mushishi and

1005
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:25,600
Legend of the Galactic Heroes and like all these, ooh, these shows that don't have a bunch of dumb

1006
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:31,840
anime shit, but the anime shit is just, it's just human, it speaks to the human condition

1007
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,000
as much as anything else, there's a reason we want to watch shows about this shit, and if you can do

1008
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,320
that while still conveying an interesting theme and, uh, and premise, especially if it, if the, the

1009
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:47,840
dumb stuff and the high-minded stuff are combined in a way that makes sense, you've knocked it out

1010
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:56,000
of the park, you know, so, yeah, I really think that, uh, that help, it helps me to appreciate anime

1011
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,440
even more, to consume deep works and other mediums, and it's really funny to me that that's the case,

1012
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,960
because there's so many people who will tell me like, why do you waste your time and your analytical

1013
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,320
skills on anime, you could be, you could be reading, uh, Ulysses, you know, and then I read Ulysses,

1014
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:15,200
and I'm like, this is batshit crazy, like this, this, this is just as crazy as anime is, you know,

1015
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,080
like, or people who want me to review like some highbrow film because of its deep cinematography,

1016
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:26,480
and I'm like, yeah, you know, I think anime has great cinematography, I think Ava has the

1017
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:32,480
best cinematography of anything I can fucking think of, you know, um, so yeah, I guess that's the

1018
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:37,040
point I'm making, and it makes, it's really cool when I get to like, read comics and figure out

1019
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,560
like, where do they relate to anime and manga, and where do, where do movies relate, where do

1020
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,200
books relate, and then I can, uh, sort of have this greater cultural understanding of all of them,

1021
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:52,720
and one day I'll have read enough books and read enough comics that I can actually talk about them

1022
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:59,360
in like, a forum with other people, you know, because I feel like, uh, when I've come to realize

1023
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,560
about why I don't do that, why I don't talk to other people about like, comics, because I went on

1024
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:10,240
co, uh, the, the 4chan comics board, and I was looking at some of the impressions of like, Dr. Strange

1025
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:15,040
and stuff, and the co, the conversations are very specific, and everyone's very opinionated,

1026
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,200
these are all people with like, deeply held beliefs about these characters and stories,

1027
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:24,720
and like, what they want them to be, and I'm, I realized that I'm kind of afraid of being

1028
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:30,800
influenced by that, like, I don't want, even the panel cast is a little, a little scary,

1029
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:36,160
because like, for instance, Jesse will tell me something like, you know, uh, Lady Thor is terrible,

1030
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:40,400
right, he has all these great justifications for it, but what that creates in my mind is like,

1031
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:45,760
the expectation that if I go read Lady Thor, I should expect it to be terrible, when really,

1032
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,560
I might read it on my own, and like, because my values in comics might not end up being the same

1033
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,680
as Jesse's, you know, maybe I'll see it in a totally different, right, light, I mean, I have no idea

1034
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:59,920
if that'll be the case with Lady Thor in particular, but like, you know, there's a lot of stuff that I

1035
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:07,520
want to form on my own, without having to confront other people's opinions too much until I've made

1036
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,160
it there, and then once I have all my opinions, then I can go into that sparring match, and you

1037
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:16,240
know, with a little bit more confidence, and not let myself be swayed by what everyone else is

1038
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:22,640
already thinking about these shows, or these comics, you know, I'm very, I'm the type of person who,

1039
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:29,120
I feel the need to know, like, to feel comfortable that I know everything about what I'm talking about,

1040
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,400
before I talk about it, you know, not that I have to be right about everything, but that I

1041
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:38,560
have to have all the information, and like, I'm so careful, even on Twitter, to even mention

1042
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:44,400
having consumed something, because I don't want to have to, like, if I, I almost tweeted out the

1043
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:51,360
other night, saw Doctor Strange pretty good, then read the comic very good, and what I was afraid of

1044
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:56,160
is that the tweets that I would get in response would either be other people's opinions on Doctor

1045
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:01,760
Strange, people telling me which Doctor Strange comics I should be reading instead of the 2015 one,

1046
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,800
people telling me to read just some other comic, or see some other movie, or asking my opinion on

1047
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,560
the MCU and all this shit, and I was like, I don't want any of that, I don't want any of that right

1048
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:16,800
now, I want to on my own, find my way through Doctor Strange, and if one day I come to the

1049
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,000
conclusion that yes, that comic is not as good as this old one, or maybe I thought the movie

1050
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,800
could have done this or that differently, then fine, but you know, I'm not ready yet to have other

1051
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:32,880
people sort of affecting my overall perception of comics, you know, I'm willing to let Jesse

1052
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,880
guide me through, because I, he's a trusted tour guide, and someone who, who really wants me to

1053
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,320
think comics are cool, you know, he wants people to like comics, so it's important to him that,

1054
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,760
that you know, that he not try to, that he not end up ruining it for anybody.

1055
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:58,720
So, so yeah, I think it's, it's, it's a fun, fun little trajectory, and I've talked about this

1056
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:09,440
with The DeVoo plenty of times, that I think I am relatively close to having completed anime.

1057
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:14,640
I think that day is coming in the next three years, and here's what I mean by completed anime.

1058
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:21,280
Um, there is a limit to how many shows I think I need to watch, like there's, there's an end goal

1059
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:26,080
to that, because you know, if you go back to anime history, it only goes so far, the first shows,

1060
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,120
you know, the first TV shows are from like the 60s, you know, there's movies going back before

1061
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:38,560
that, but not a whole lot of them. It would not take that long to consume all of the things that

1062
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,600
I need to, that I haven't seen yet from history, you know, and then there's also a lot of stuff

1063
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,160
that I need to rewatch, to reaffirm my opinions on, to like, you know, to figure out how I feel

1064
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:53,120
about them, and lots of stuff I want to cover with regards to both. There's lots of shows I

1065
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:57,680
haven't seen yet that I want to talk about, lots of big concepts, lots of creators I want to follow,

1066
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:04,400
lots of, and lots of older things I've seen before that I want to cover again, and I think

1067
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:11,520
that in three years, I'll have covered all of it. I think within three years, anything, anything

1068
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,240
that exists now that I haven't talked about, that I have an idea for, I will have covered in the

1069
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:22,640
next three years. Now, anime is always coming out, so it's not like I'll ever have no anime to talk

1070
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:27,920
about, and this estimation could be a little short, it could be a little, it could be even, um,

1071
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:34,400
maybe I'm overestimating how long it'll take, you know, because I've knocked, I've had some moments

1072
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:41,600
of knocking something out that, like, for instance, music videos. I watched all of them,

1073
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:46,400
you know, for the sake of that, that video, uh, the ten, ten anime music videos you should check

1074
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:51,120
out. I watched all the anime music videos that are out there, you know, with the exception of, like,

1075
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:58,560
some that are not, uh, professional work, or are, um, just not listed on my anime list for whatever

1076
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:04,080
reason, or are a part of, like, a bigger series that I didn't cover. But I've watched pretty much

1077
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:09,040
every anime music video, so that's done. I just, I don't have to worry about that until new ones

1078
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:14,240
come out and I can take them individually as they come. Um, you know, I watched every shinbo show

1079
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:20,000
from the 90s, that's been on my bucket list forever, you know, that's done. I don't have to watch any

1080
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,640
of them ever again, I've already talked about them, you know, there's only a few that I'd really feel

1081
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:30,320
the need to go back to if, even if I wanted to. So yeah, there's a chance that within three years,

1082
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:34,480
I will, I will have finished everything I wanted to do with anime, and I'll still talk about it

1083
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:40,400
forever, but at that point, I'll be ready to branch out into other mediums, and I want to have a

1084
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:45,040
footing in those, you know, I want that in three years, in the same way that, like, when I was

1085
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:51,040
fading out of, uh, doing MLP stuff and fading into anime, like, I started introducing anime videos

1086
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:55,120
in there, and like, started, you know, mixing the pot a little bit, and then I, then at some point,

1087
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:59,280
I was full-blown anime, and it was supposed to be anime and everything else, but there's nothing

1088
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:04,480
else I wanted to talk about as much, but I'd love to eventually, like, bleed in other things, or maybe

1089
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:09,280
there's only one anime video every couple of months, but then in the middle, oh, here's a

1090
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:14,480
interesting film analysis, here's a comic book analysis, here's an analysis of a, of this or

1091
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:19,920
that thing, you know, I want to be an everything guy, not just an anime guy, and, uh, and so it'll

1092
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:25,120
be interesting to see if that day comes, and, like, I've been collecting all these charts, I love

1093
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,680
collecting recommendation charts, especially from 4chan, because they make tons of them, and I've

1094
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:34,160
been going to every board and just, like, checking until I find charts, and then downloading all the

1095
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:39,440
charts I can find, and just crossing off anything I've consumed, and it doesn't, like, when you look

1096
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,240
at one of those charts and you haven't seen anything on it, it looks huge, but then once you've crossed

1097
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:49,200
off ten things, suddenly it doesn't look that huge, you're like, huh, well, it only took me this

1098
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:55,120
long to cross off ten, how long would it take to cross off the other, you know, 60 or whatever,

1099
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,280
well, I guess, I mean, it would just be six times what I just did, and what I just did didn't take

1100
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:04,960
a year, so, what, seven years, that's, you know, a reasonable chunk of time, and that's not consuming

1101
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:11,040
all at once, that's while doing everything else, so I think it's reasonable to assume that I could

1102
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:16,480
eventually become cultured in every medium, and, you know, every time I read a book, every time I

1103
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:21,600
read a comic, I'm one step closer, every time I watch a film, I'm one step closer, there's a

1104
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,960
finite number of them out there, at least for the time being, a finite, if you will,

1105
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:40,640
even though infinite is not infinite, well, all right, I wasn't sure if I'd have anything else

1106
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:45,200
to follow up with at the end of this podcast, I'd had a few ideas over the last few days, I don't

1107
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:51,040
think I covered any of them, but I don't remember what they were, so, yeah, that wraps up this,

1108
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:57,040
this episode of the DigiBro decompression chamber, I hope you enjoyed it, I really

1109
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:02,160
felt this was like my strongest one yet, I had a lot of fun with all these topics, so

1110
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:09,040
thanks, thanks for listening, go have a nice day, and, or a nice night, as this one will probably

1111
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:13,840
be released at night, daylight savings time ended, so it's like fucking dark outside, it's not even

1112
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:25,680
six o'clock, have a nice night, listen to this relaxing music, and chill out.

1113
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,740
you
