00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:39,000
me, a BGE, and we've got Ben Saint. Hello. Greetings. Give me a take. Hey, hey. Give me a take. There it is. DigiNay, what's up? I'm a girl now. Yeah. That's what they tell me. Everyone said last episode, why, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,860
isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why

4
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:57,460
isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why

5
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:06,900
isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't,

6
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,960
why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why isn't, why BLU

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Can't blame you. I also don't do either of those things. Even when I'm not on.

8
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,960
It was sad. It made me sad. I cried.

9
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,960
I did watch the dick show. That was pretty fun. And the fucking kill stream with May afterwards.

10
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
That was incredible. I hope she goes on again.

11
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,960
That was a scary place. I've never been to a kill stream before, but the people who were called in were like,

12
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Oh, right. I see.

13
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Yeah. Well, you know. I mean, it's called the kill stream.

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,960
They kill people on there, that's what you're saying.

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,960
May held her own. It was good. It was well done.

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Yeah, May held her own. That was really cool what she was doing.

17
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Some legitimate laughs in there. Such as when, you know, such as when it was said that, you know,

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,960
I can't remember what it was. Someone wants to fuck. And then May was just like,

19
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Yeah, I want to have sex with Dick Masterson. I remember that. Epic. Epic.

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,960
You just sat there. It sounds like a real knee slapper.

21
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Yep. What a culture we live in, ladies and gentlemen. It's just an exciting time to be alive.

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm having a ball. But more importantly than any of that.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Okay, wait, did you have something to say?

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Oh, it's just thinking it is like the most exciting time imaginable. Everything's on fire.

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
It's fucking crazy.

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Do you remember that that was happening right now?

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
You guys watching all that?

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm looking at a few tweets here and there.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,960
You guys watching America?

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Yeah, I'm looking. I'm looking with my eyeglass.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Yeah.

33
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Smoking.

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Yeah, it's sick.

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
It's fucking sick.

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,960
It's so good. It's really great.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Nate, they're happening in your city. Has anybody burned anything yet?

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,960
You know, I googled it a little bit. So there are protests.

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,960
And I saw like a couple of smashed windows, but like on the whole, it seems pretty peaceful overall.

40
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,960
I mean, you know, in terms of amount of property damage or whatever.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Nobody has been hurt to my knowledge, so it seems relatively calm as opposed to, you know, not violent anyway.

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,960
So I'm glad to hear that. And it's certainly, well, I mean, I live, it's by UC,

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,960
which is the center of the city of Cincinnati. And that's, I guess, a 10 minute drive from me.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,960
So not super far, but it's all in like, you know, commercial areas and stuff.

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Well, I guess the school isn't a commercial, but around there. So, yeah, I'm not too worried.

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,960
There are protests in Boston today.

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Yeah.

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,960
But I mean, they're not going to be on the level of like, you know,

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,960
Nothing's going to reach Milwaukee.

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Minneapolis.

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Yeah, that's Neo Minneapolis.

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,960
I mean, I guess I'm surprised they've spread as much as they have.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,960
And that now they're in like, I mean, it must be like a dozen different cities.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,960
I've seen like footage of people like bashing in cop car windows and stuff.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Yeah. I don't know. I think I first heard of it.

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Okay. Well, obviously it's mainly in Minneapolis and then the other places would like Texas.

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I heard there was something in like Houston.

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Maybe it was wrong about whatever.

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,960
I saw footage from Dallas is where Dallas is where the guy had the sword.

60
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
You see the sword guy?

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's right.

62
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,960
The guy who got nearly to death, right?

63
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Yeah. I mean, he got sent to the hospital.

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
There's no indication that he almost died.

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,960
He looked pretty fucked up, but like he got unconscious.

66
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Did you know he put out a statement today like defending the people who beat him up?

67
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
No fucking way.

68
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,960
He literally came out and was like, you know, he literally said like us white people do deserve this or something like that.

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Like literally that is fucking.

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
I mean, he I mean, he literally did deserve it.

71
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,960
And so that's fun unexpected.

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
It's pretty funny.

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,960
He literally blamed his he literally put it on white people.

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,960
He did. I mean, why did you go up with the sword?

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,960
If that was his thing?

76
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
I guess he was defending his store.

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
And then he was like, you know what? It's understandable.

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,960
I guess, you know, I didn't want my store to get broken into.

79
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
But I read that he wasn't even defending his store.

80
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,960
He was just defending a store like someone else's store.

81
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Yeah.

82
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Well, then where did he get the store?

83
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I mean, I assume that his his shit was near.

84
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Well, not from a store.

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Like, I mean, I assume he just brought it.

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
All right.

87
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
The light rail Avenger was still.

88
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,960
I feel like we have to revisit the guns versus swords bonus episode and break up how ineffective this sword was in the situation.

89
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Are you buying that there's lots of guns in use, though, because that is not the case.

90
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I have not.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
I have not.

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
It's fucking swords versus skateboard.

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
That's true.

94
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,960
I mean, apparently there have been shootings, like people have like rolled it.

95
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,960
No, no, there are people have shot people, but I have seen so far there's been the lady in the wheelchair who was like stabbing people.

96
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Yeah, I was going to say she's making this hard case for swords right there.

97
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Yeah, the stabbing wheelchair lady.

98
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
That's pretty good.

99
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
There was the bow and arrow guy who got his car flipped over.

100
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Yep.

101
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Yep.

102
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,960
And now and then there was sword guy and then also there were some gun gun shootings, but like those aren't funny.

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I thought guns were supposed to be easy to get in America.

104
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Why would there?

105
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Why is everybody settling for these, you know, primitive instruments?

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,960
I think I think it's it's because if you wheel the gun in a place like that at a time like that, you're probably just going to get shot to death.

107
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Nobody wants to risk that.

108
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Particularly by the cops who are all over the place.

109
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Sure, sure.

110
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
And you take a gun to a riot where there's violence happening.

111
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
No, we'll kill you.

112
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
That's what pretty much started all this madness, so.

113
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Yeah.

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Yeah.

115
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Uh, scary.

116
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Scary.

117
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Don't go outside.

118
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
That's what I'm thinking for a little while.

119
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
They already said.

120
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
They weren't supposed to.

121
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,960
I was doing it though, so now I'm not going to.

122
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Uh, I mean.

123
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Out of my own volition, not because the government told me not to.

124
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I mean, uh, yeah, I don't know.

125
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
If there are a couple.

126
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
You going to go looting, Ben?

127
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
You going to go looting?

128
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
There's not going to be.

129
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
You going to go loot a target?

130
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I don't, I don't even.

131
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Ben.

132
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I wouldn't even be grudgy doing it.

133
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Oh, no.

134
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Could you go get me a switch?

135
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Could you get me a switch?

136
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Okay.

137
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Uh, I, there's nothing, there's nothing immoral about looting a target.

138
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Uh, first and foremost.

139
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Target defended it.

140
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Target themselves put out a statement like.

141
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Really?

142
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
We don't even mind that you looted our stores.

143
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
We can afford to rebuild them.

144
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
It's like we stand with the cause.

145
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
They literally put out their email.

146
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
You know what?

147
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
They cut themselves.

148
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
I mean, they're right.

149
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
They're absolutely right.

150
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
And like, I don't think they even care.

151
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Uh, like they're all going to be insured.

152
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Like it literally doesn't even matter.

153
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
It's a victimless crime.

154
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
That fact is why I am.

155
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
There's definitely been plenty of victims of these riots.

156
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,960
And obviously there's plenty of people out there doing fucked shit.

157
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
But like in concept, this is why I am okay with it.

158
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Like if it was just looting targets, like just exclusively like nothing but all those businesses.

159
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Burning Arby's and looting targets.

160
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
Like God bless you.

161
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Like I don't, I can't see any real negative consequences of it.

162
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Honestly.

163
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Yeah.

164
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Compared to obviously if you're like breaking some mom and pop store, like those people's

165
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
lines are doing.

166
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
So, you know, for that.

167
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
And people are going to do that.

168
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
And that's bad.

169
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Yeah.

170
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Obviously.

171
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,960
The real crime is lowering the prices of the real estate in the area.

172
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
That's the real crime here.

173
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
That too.

174
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Uh, I mean.

175
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
You will make your own house worth less.

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Yeah.

177
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Although if you live in a worthless place and I guess you just don't fucking care at that

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
point, right?

179
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Like if, like what was the property value of these places?

180
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I mean that was intended to be a joke, but.

181
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Well, I'm just thinking about it because like Virginia Beach hasn't had anything yet.

182
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Hard to tell.

183
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Hard to tell.

184
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,600
I feel like here there wouldn't be riots for that reason that like nobody would want to

185
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,960
lower the property value when like Virginia Beach property values are like going up and

186
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
it's really good for the people who live here.

187
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
The kind of.

188
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,960
That just makes me want to like start a riot so that I can buy a house.

189
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
It's like, uh, it's too expensive.

190
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
I should start a riot.

191
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Lower property values.

192
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
You go there because you're looking to, you're looking to get a home.

193
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,960
That's probably why all these people are coming from out of state to join the fucking riots.

194
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
They're like picking the city they want to move to.

195
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Fucking it up.

196
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,960
You know, I read that the mayor said that initial reports that arrests were all out of

197
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,960
towners were all grossly exaggerated and lies from the police department.

198
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Okay.

199
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Well, that doesn't surprise me since everything else has been lies.

200
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,960
The media is trying to say that white supremacists are the ones rioting.

201
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
So that's a fucking laugh.

202
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
What the fuck is that about?

203
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,960
There's a, there's a, oh man, I've read a bunch of takes about this.

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I've read people saying that the white anarchist thing or the white supremacist thing, which

205
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,960
seemingly are like interchangeable, even though those are not the same thing at all.

206
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Um, there is like a-

207
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,960
I've never heard the phrase white anarchist before.

208
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Where is that one coming from?

209
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
I mean, I can't-

210
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
You know what it is?

211
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,960
You call them white supremacists if you're talking to a liberal and call them white anarchists

212
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
if you're talking to a conservative.

213
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Okay.

214
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
I think that's probably the line.

215
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Okay.

216
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Uh, but in practice, it's the same thing.

217
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,960
It's, it's actually, there's just a few bad white people that are making all these, all

218
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
the making, it was all, it was all peaceful before that.

219
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Um,

220
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,960
I mean, you could, you could blame, like, I understand the people who are like more broadly

221
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,960
blaming white people for general problems, but like, I don't think there's white people

222
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
causing the riots.

223
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Pretty sure the riots are a reaction to white people, in fact.

224
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Well, there is, um, there were pictures going around the auto zone, like, like one of the

225
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,960
first fires in Minneapolis when the auto zone burned down.

226
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Yeah.

227
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Like that was set by a, like an undercover cop who was pretending to be a protester.

228
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
So there's at least one example of like a white.

229
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,960
There's got to be tons of Psyops going on all over the place, tons of fucking plants, intentions

230
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:06,960
flying left and right, chaos theory in full effect, fucking Camara Antark, IRL, every city

231
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
in America.

232
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Yeah.

233
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,960
But, but what was the theory I heard that like the, the white anarchist thing is an attempt

234
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:21,960
to basically, um, like, like rhetorically divide like black people so that it's like,

235
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,960
okay, no, no, no, like, like affluent black people and black business owners, like, no,

236
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,960
no, no, no, no, like we, the police, we were always on your side.

237
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,960
It's just those like poor people that are like, and the anarchists and stuff.

238
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Those are the, I don't know.

239
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
It's some kind of like.

240
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
I guess divides would already exist though.

241
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Yeah.

242
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
No, it does.

243
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
But it's the.

244
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Yeah.

245
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
It's complicated.

246
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
I feel like that peed it out.

248
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,960
I feel like I knew what it was and I fucked it up.

249
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Let's just talk about something else by which I mean more, I don't know.

250
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,960
I have a hard left turn that I'm itching to get to.

251
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,960
We pivoting away from riots, pivoting away from the riots.

252
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
You could pivot back.

253
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
I got nothing to say really.

254
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I've just been like tangentially like consuming media posts about it.

255
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Just go listen to the song City Hall by Tenacious D and it is the whole story of the riots every time.

256
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Every time there's riots, this is the story of the riots.

257
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Hmm.

258
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,960
You know this song, right?

259
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Somebody surely knows the Tenacious D song.

260
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I don't know.

261
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I heard the link.

262
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I listened to the link you posted.

263
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I had never heard this song before, even though I was a Tenacious D fan.

264
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Which album is it from?

265
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
It's from the first album.

266
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,960
It's the last song.

267
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I just want to say Burning Down the Third Precinct Police Building, pretty much the coolest thing ever.

268
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,960
All the photos look fucking awesome.

269
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,960
That picture of the Arby's on fire is the coolest looking thing I've ever seen.

270
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
That one's so freaking good.

271
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
We should post that.

272
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,960
That's the best thing about phones getting this good is that this happens.

273
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,960
All the footage we can get is so much nicer.

274
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Also, we have evidence when the cops are like, you know, when they're like fucking like running

275
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,960
people over with a horse or like ramming their fucking car into a crowd or just like coming

276
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,960
up behind people and like macing them when they weren't doing anything and all that shit

277
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:30,960
that like, there's so many classic videos of the cops just fucking like bullying people

278
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,960
and being like sadistic.

279
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,960
It's very epic.

280
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm disappointed that Nihilist Arby's has not made that photo there.

281
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I don't think that America wants to hear from Nihilist Arby's right now.

282
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
They did tweet, hi everyone, how's the week going?

283
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Please enjoy Burning the Arby's.

284
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
So they know what it is.

285
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,960
That's a more positive take than I expected from them.

286
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Well, it's Nihilist Arby's.

287
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Nothing matters.

288
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Right.

289
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,960
But I always suspect that Nihilist are Nihilist until you start torturing them specifically.

290
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Nate, do you think that Nihilist Arby's is run by the real Arby's?

291
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
You know, I've never even considered it.

292
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I actually had thought that.

293
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Yeah.

294
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Yeah.

295
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
I had thought that until just now.

296
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I mean, I mean, thinking about it, it doesn't seem that out of the like possibility for

297
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
like marketing.

298
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
They don't feel anything truly edgy.

299
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Arby's has a real social media presence.

300
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,960
The funny thing is the actual Arby's social media presence is nothing but them like posting

301
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Kill Law Kill figures next to Arby's shit.

302
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Like it's all fucking weebs stuff.

303
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
That's true.

304
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
It has been very confusing for a long time.

305
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
They're stretching their social media.

306
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,960
You know, social media people are just millennials and or zoomers doing what they would do but

307
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
with a brand next to it.

308
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,960
So Nihilist Arby seems like it could exist as a real thing.

309
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,960
The Nihilist Arby's is actually run by the bassist of a band called the Laurence Arms

310
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
that does the song.

311
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,960
I never tried that but I know I don't like it or maybe I do and I'm just doing to fight

312
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
it.

313
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
I don't know if you've heard it.

314
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
You'd like it, Ben.

315
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
It's a good Ben.

316
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
I mean, it sounds kind of edgy, I guess.

317
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,960
It's your type of edge.

318
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Your type of Irish punk edge.

319
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Hmm.

320
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Okay.

321
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
You are Irish.

322
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
I don't think I could get behind it.

323
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
They have like, or maybe they're just English.

324
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
I don't know.

325
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Hmm.

326
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Hey, the whole Irish separation movement or whatever, is that specifically about like

327
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,960
religion specifically or is it more about like territorial control at the end of the

328
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
day?

329
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Which of those is more important?

330
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Boy, I feel like I'm going to like expose my ignorance if I try to talk about it.

331
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,960
But I mean, I think it's just like basically it's like a sort of like a colonialism thing.

332
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Like Irish, Ireland was basically just like owned as a colony basically by England and

333
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:03,960
just kind of, you know, heavily taxed or something or probably war crimes were committed.

334
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I mean, it was.

335
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,960
We in the old England, we had.

336
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
There was a famine.

337
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Ah, fuck.

338
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,960
We won as in like being the coolest and then we said to Ireland, ha ha, fuck you.

339
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,960
And we stood all over, we trampled all over the sandcastle and there's like, fuck off.

340
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Sure.

341
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
They were like, oh, faith in pagoda.

342
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Top of the morning to you.

343
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
They're always saying that shit.

344
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:35,960
They were like, ah, ah, me laddie, I don't just throw a grill shrimp on the barbie.

345
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
The dingo ate my baby.

346
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
And it was sad.

347
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
They really do be like that though.

348
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
They really do.

349
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Cool English.

350
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Tear cunts.

351
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
And I don't like them.

352
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
That's what they say.

353
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,960
That's great.

354
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
All right.

355
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Here's my left turn.

356
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Hard left turn.

357
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Here it comes.

358
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Minutes before.

359
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
I understand more and more.

360
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
My Star Trek quest continues.

361
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Minutes before we started this very podcast, I finished the final episode of season seven,

362
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
the very end of Star Trek Voyager.

363
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,960
So I have now in my quest to consume all Star Trek shows.

364
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I wouldn't say media, because I'm sure most of it's terrible.

365
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Like the video game.

366
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,960
You should play all the old video games on like DOS.

367
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
I mean, that might be fun.

368
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
That might be interesting to explore.

369
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Like pre-DOS windows.

370
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Well, you know, Ben, because I think that developers have gotten way out of control

371
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,960
because they have the technology to do stuff that technological limitations prevented them from doing,

372
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
those might legitimately be better games than what we get now.

373
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Some of the best games are really hard to use.

374
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,960
But once you get to understand them, they're the best things ever.

375
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Let's check it out for this fucking...

376
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
I know there's one that gets...

377
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,960
I think I've said this before, but there's always this meme that gets posted on the V video games board.

378
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,960
They will always post Ducat.

379
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
What did it happen?

380
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Ducat, whatever he was.

381
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Like leader of the Kardashians.

382
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
At least that one time.

383
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
He had a complex political history.

384
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
And he says, so tell me, commander, if Starfleet is so great,

385
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
then why are there no good Star Trek games?

386
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,960
And then a thread will spiral about how there are no good Star Trek games.

387
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Or some people are...

388
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Has there never been one good Star Trek game ever?

389
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,960
People like that one in VR where you're on the bridge.

390
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah, we're on the bridge or whatever.

391
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
I don't know.

392
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,960
I feel like the thing with a Star Trek game is that Star Trek itself is not action focused.

393
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
It's cerebral.

394
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,960
So like building a game around that, it would only really work as a tech space chooser.

395
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
But there is a great Star Trek game.

396
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
It's called Mass Effect.

397
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Right, right, right.

398
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Fair point, fair point.

400
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,960
And that's why I need to keep playing it one of these days.

401
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Okay, but the point I was going to say was, so I finished.

402
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,960
I watched Next Generation, then Deep Space Nine, then The Original, and now Voyage.

403
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
That's four.

404
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,960
I will watch Enterprise, which I hear is maybe the worst,

405
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,960
but the Red Letter Media Boys recommend it as part of the Pantheon, so I will consume it.

406
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,960
But I'm going to re-watch The Next Generation first to get my joy back.

407
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Because Voyager ended on a real limp-ass fart.

408
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
It wasn't bad.

409
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,960
And you know, I was just doing my...

410
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
A real limp-ass fart.

411
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
It wasn't bad.

412
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Would you like to explain?

413
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Well, the fart is not that bad.

414
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
You know what?

415
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
I guess there are worse things out there.

416
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Oh my God, this reminds me.

417
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Okay, last night, whatever, I thought Michelle was not in the bed with me at the time.

418
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,960
It was this morning, and I'm like, okay, Michelle's not around, time to fart.

419
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,960
And I execute, maneuver, incredibly loud fart in the bed.

420
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,960
I hear a rustling as Michelle's bolt up right next to me in the bed.

421
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
I'm like, oh no.

422
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
See, Michelle is no fan of the farts.

423
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,960
And out of courtesy to her, I have been restraining myself for these last night.

424
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Well, just saying, all you eat is like peas and vegetables.

425
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,960
I have to imagine you have the worst smelling farts in the fucking planet.

426
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Well, you know, the smell is far less of an issue than the noise.

427
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
The noise specifically.

428
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,960
The diet is key. You're absolutely right about that. Diet is key.

429
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Anyway, from your sound experience.

430
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,960
I do. I have a fart sound, but I don't have my soundboard rigged up.

431
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I should play it right now. See, this is why I need to have it ready.

432
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Everyone in the last soundboard. Well, not everyone.

433
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Opinions were divided over whether you need to stop using the soundboard

434
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,960
or whether we all just need to get our own competing soundboards.

435
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Right, right, right. I'm paying attention to those debates.

436
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Today, I was just too busy to get it hooked up because I have to sell some shit.

437
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Soundboards can be used sparingly for great effect.

438
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
That's the middle path, right?

439
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,960
The fart with reverb, whatever you have.

440
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
If I had said it like this and then you'd do the sound, that would be great.

441
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Yeah, see, that's the sort of thing I should do.

442
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Eleazar, mix that in, would you?

443
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Thanks, buddy. I appreciate that.

444
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,960
All right, anyway, it was from actually, and that was after in the middle of the night

445
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,960
or whatever, sometime last night or whatever,

446
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Sessho was sleeping with Michelle in the bed and just puked all over her.

447
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,960
And so had to get rid of the fucking sheets because there's puke on them.

448
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,960
So got puked on and farted on. Michelle is living a punished existence right now.

449
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,960
It would be so awful if everyone's sitting around her social media next to fart sounds.

450
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
That's so sad.

451
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
What a nightmare for her.

452
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Justice for George Floyd.

453
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Of course, of course.

454
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,960
All right, anyway, the point of this is, okay, here's my short breakdown of the end of Voyager

455
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,960
and my analysis of the whole seven seasons, all right?

456
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Highlights.

457
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Fuck.

458
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Tuvok was okay.

459
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Seven of nine, pretty good.

460
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,960
The journey through the Delta Quadrant being stranded 70,000 light years away,

461
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,960
meaning it's gonna take roughly 70 years to get back home

462
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
and they occasionally make jumps back.

463
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
That was compelling.

464
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,960
The B narrative on Earth, of Barclay from the next generation

465
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,960
and his work on, was it Pathfinder? Whatever it was.

466
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Like this communication satellite that like three seasons in,

467
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,960
they start to have communication between Earth and Voyager.

468
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
All that was based.

469
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Janeway as a captain.

470
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
The weird thing about captain, about Janeway,

471
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,960
is that I think she is the most like traditionally conservative of any of the captains thus far.

472
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,960
I think people are right about that because unlike fucking Jean-Luc,

473
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,960
she spends a lot less time worried about like what's the right thing to do for species.

474
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
They do kind of do that with the Borg.

475
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
They kind of make peace with them to a degree and they're like,

476
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
oh, that's just how the Borg are.

477
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Like we're not gonna murder the whole species.

478
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
They would have to conquer whatever.

479
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
And you know, seven of nine is the Borgans and their crew.

480
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,960
But Janeway is, on multiple occasions, she will just say fuck the prime directive.

481
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Like probably more than anybody except maybe Kirk.

482
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
But Kirk gets a pass because it was the olden days.

483
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Anyway, the show is definitely like a few rungs lower on the intelligence scale

484
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,960
because I talked about before, there's like fucked up stuff that happens.

485
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,960
People are killed. There's like a fusion character who appears

486
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,960
and then he is ordered to be executed to revive the two crewmen that they're a fusion of.

487
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,960
It was presented as incredibly morally fucked up and they do it anyway.

488
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
All the crew is fine.

489
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Man, that was like the most fucked up Tuvix.

490
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Watch that episode for a bad time.

491
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,960
And anyway, the ending of the thing, well, of course they get back home

492
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,960
because they find a transwarp conduit or portal or whatever.

493
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,960
And they just like the whole ending two-parter is a big Borg fighting time travel episode.

494
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,960
They really do not do anything particularly interesting.

495
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,960
And it of course is like a perfect parallel to the finale of Star Trek The Next Generation

496
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,960
which is a big climactic time travel episode.

497
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,960
But it is like perfectly connected to the overall point of the series

498
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,960
and shows like amazing stuff that's going to happen in the future.

499
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
We know what's going to happen to them later.

500
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,960
That's been largely undone in fucking Voyager.

501
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,960
So like they ended on this weird thing where like the very last thing you see

502
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,960
is history was just changed, they blew up the Borg sphere or whatever the fuck

503
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,960
and they're just like take us home and they're flying back to Voyager.

504
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,960
The ending, okay, the ending of the original series, it just got canceled.

505
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Like it wasn't, they didn't do a big set up, but it gets a pass

506
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,960
because like they didn't even know it was ending necessarily.

507
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,960
The Next Generation had like the greatest final episode of all time.

508
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
It was fucking incredible and based.

509
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Deep Space Nine ended pretty well.

510
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
It made me really care about these characters.

511
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I was sad to see them go.

512
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
It does a big pan out shot.

513
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,960
You get like a good like 20 minutes at the end of the episode

514
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
to like feel the loss of all the characters.

515
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Voyager, like I said, just ends on a limp.

516
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,960
It was not good.

517
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,960
It was not good emotionally the way it was done.

518
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Okay, but, but I did want to say to its credit,

519
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,960
the real ending of Star Trek Voyager for those people who I know are dying to hear it

520
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,960
was two episodes before season seven episode 23 Homestead.

521
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,960
And it's with that motherfucker, Neelix.

522
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Now nobody likes Neelix.

523
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Everybody hates Neelix.

524
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,960
But when they got stranded in the Delta Quadrant

525
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,960
at the very beginning of season one of Voyager,

526
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Neelix was their first friend.

527
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,960
He like joins the crew and he's one of the boys.

528
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,960
He has this girl, Kess, who joins the crew.

529
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
And he is a whole developmental arc, right?

530
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,960
As like the annoying cook and like pretends to be ambassador sometimes

531
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
and they puff up his ego sometimes,

532
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
but really mostly people are annoyed about him.

533
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
He's kind of an okay guy, whatever.

534
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
He's like the fucking nanny of the crew.

535
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
And he's annoying sometimes, but he's not that bad.

536
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
He's not that bad.

537
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
And when you get into his backstory,

538
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
it turns out his whole planet was obliterated

539
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,960
or was like turned completely toxic during a war.

540
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,960
So his entire species in his lifetime became nomads

541
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,960
due to the loss of their fucking home planet.

542
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
So like they're completely scattered to the winds,

543
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
that's why he can like be on the crew and stuff.

544
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
So it's like really fucked up what this guy has been through.

545
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
He's got incredible PTSD.

546
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,960
His entire family was killed.

547
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
And he deals with that a lot.

548
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
He has dreams, there's episodes about it.

549
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
It's pretty good.

550
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
His girlfriend Kess, he meets the very beginning.

551
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
All right, Kess was cool.

552
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
She was like a nurse,

553
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,960
but then she went Super Saiyan Ultra Instinct mode unfortunately

554
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,960
and had to leave and became like a god of psychic powers.

555
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,960
So that didn't work out well for Neelix.

556
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
And he has like no girlfriend for the rest of the series

557
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,960
and is pretty sad sack and it's unfortunate.

558
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Okay, all this is to say, there were things

559
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
just like in Deep Space Nine

560
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
where I didn't give a fuck about any of those people

561
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
at the beginning, but then I did by the end,

562
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
just as like people, I liked them.

563
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,960
Neelix was that guy in this series to the largest degree

564
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
because he wasn't that cool,

565
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
but he was like your dad or your mom

566
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
and he was nice to have around.

567
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,960
And the last episode, two episodes before the end

568
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,960
where they find a colony of other Tlaxians like him

569
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
because you gotta understand, Voyager starts with him

570
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
joining the crew and they're just sailing

571
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,960
further and further away every single day

572
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
from Neelix's home in the Delta Quadrant

573
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,960
because they're leaving, they're going to the Alpha Quadrant

574
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
and he's abandoning the place that he grew up

575
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
because the species is already scattered to the winds.

576
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
And okay, so all right, understood.

577
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
But like in this last episode, right,

578
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,960
two episodes before the end, they meet a colony of Tlaxians

579
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
and he likes them.

580
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
And while he is totally overshadowed

581
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,960
on the crew of Voyager by everybody else,

582
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,960
among these Tlaxians who are like desperate for a leader,

583
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
all his experience with Voyager

584
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
has like perfectly prepared him to like be

585
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,960
an actual competent like space faring leader

586
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,960
of this little community, like 500 people.

587
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
And so he does it and he fucking leaves

588
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
and he gets this amazing salute

589
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,960
and send off by every officer in the crew

590
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
saluting him as he walks out,

591
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
finding a final episode of Scrubs or whatever.

592
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,960
And that was like the most heart-rending thing,

593
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
seeing him leave.

594
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
So basically what I'm saying is that was the real end.

595
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,960
That was the true heartfelt ending of Voyager.

596
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
And that episode was fucking based.

597
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,960
So Voyager gets, I don't know, maybe like a seven out of 10

598
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,960
overall pretty good, not even close to TNG.

599
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
There you go.

600
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
There's my review of Voyager.

601
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
You should watch it though.

602
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
If you like Star Trek, it's worth watching.

603
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
I don't know why people be saying that Voyager

604
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,960
is like so bad across the board.

605
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,960
There are episodes of fucking the next generation

606
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,960
that are worse than anything.

607
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Not morally, just in terms of entertainment value.

608
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
All right, all right.

609
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
That's it.

610
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
That's the review of Voyager.

611
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Take it and leave it people.

612
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Hey, Nate.

613
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Yeah.

614
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
I got a question.

615
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Sure.

616
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Why you not make videos about watching Star Trek?

617
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Easy answer.

618
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,960
My video, I have two few slots for videos

619
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
and they take too long.

620
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,960
I probably could make just like a video

621
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
just describing exactly those thoughts.

622
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,960
It's funny you ask that hippo because I really,

623
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
I think the healthiest way to live your life

624
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,960
is to not think about needing to make videos

625
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
about everything just because you do

626
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
have things to say about them.

627
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
I'm looking for content.

628
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,960
It sounds like you're not looking for content, Nate.

629
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
It sounds like the reason you're not doing a Star Trek video

630
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,960
is that you literally need less content ideas

631
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
so that you can get through them all.

632
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Well, I think these are just two separate issues.

633
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Obviously, I have long planned to make videos

634
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
about Star Trek and I will get to it one day

635
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,960
and all this watching is somewhat in preparation for that.

636
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,960
It's just that we all became Jay just now.

637
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Jay?

638
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
From Red Letter Media.

639
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
We vanished as you were talking about Star Trek.

640
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Right, you're absolutely right.

641
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Well, that's fine.

642
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,960
I just thought people might enjoy a summary of voyage of thoughts.

643
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Well, if anyone did in the comments, I guess, let us know.

644
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
I don't need to know.

645
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
I can feel it.

646
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
I can feel their joy.

647
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Do a little Vulcan version.

648
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Anybody who just like to have enjoyed it

649
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,960
would not feel the need to comment just to let Nate know.

650
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
They would know that he knew.

651
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
They would sense through the tray bars

652
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
that they were of one mind.

653
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,960
They know that Nate knows.

654
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
If you're a real Nate boy,

655
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,960
you know what Nate boy would expect from you.

656
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Here's an actual question, though.

657
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
For those people out there who are Star Trek heads,

658
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
I will be curious, leave in the comments,

659
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
is Enterprise good?

660
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
I hear very mixed things.

661
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
I'm just like, on the hierarchy,

662
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
give me a rating of the five main series.

663
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Let's forget Picard, forget Discovery, who gives a shit.

664
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Of the five main ones, I'm just curious,

665
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
where would you put Enterprise?

666
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Is it better than Voyager?

667
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
So, not bad.

668
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
I'm looking forward to it then,

669
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,960
but I'm very curious.

670
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
People love the original series,

671
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,960
and I assume it gets bonus points for being the original.

672
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Obviously it does.

673
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
It started the idea.

674
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,960
But it just was not as good as the next generation.

675
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Kirk really did flout the Prime Directive way more.

676
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Again, it made sense in the context,

677
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
but wouldn't you just rather hear...

678
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,960
If you like Star Trek, wouldn't you just rather hear Jean-Luc,

679
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,960
opine about the nuances of galactic interspecies policy?

680
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
I know I would.

681
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
I don't get it.

682
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Maybe I'm just gay.

683
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I think I've seen a supercut

684
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,960
of the first Star Trek original series,

685
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Kirk battling rubber suit monsters,

686
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
and that's really funny.

687
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
But that's okay.

688
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
In the context of that episode,

689
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
that's an episode where Kirk,

690
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
as a Starfleet captain should,

691
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
works diligently, does everything he can

692
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,960
to get out of that situation non-violently.

693
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,960
The premise of that episode is that just some god species

694
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,960
has detected two intruders in their territory

695
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
on opposite sides.

696
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
One is the Enterprise.

697
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
The other is that other alien race or whatever.

698
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,960
And to settle this disagreement,

699
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
they're just like,

700
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
okay, you guys aren't gonna fight or whatever.

701
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Or I think the two were fighting in space.

702
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
There was something.

703
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
He just puts them on a planet and says,

704
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
okay, the two cabins are gonna fight.

705
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I'm god.

706
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
You just have to do that.

707
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
And there's no way out of it.

708
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
So there's just...

709
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm curious.

710
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
They put them into situations like that.

711
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,960
How aware are you about, in Mass Effect,

712
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
the whole renegade and paragon thing,

713
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
what that stands for?

714
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
I mean, hell, my biggest exposure was

715
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
B-Tongue's videos back in the day

716
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,960
that I forget to a large degree, so not much.

717
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,960
In that I've been replaying and analyzing Mass Effect,

718
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,960
the paragon route is basically the person

719
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
who always makes the most diplomatic,

720
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,960
most logical decision that is available.

721
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Whereas the renegade option will be

722
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
that you make more emotional decisions,

723
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
more snap judgments,

724
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,960
and basically never take any bullshit from anybody.

725
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
It's like, it's my way or the highway

726
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
is your kind of approach.

727
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,960
And so I think that, you know,

728
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,960
which Mass, or which Star Trek captain you favor

729
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
will come down to like,

730
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
kind of the paragon renegade decision-making,

731
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
because like, if you play Mass Effect,

732
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
always making paragon decisions,

733
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
it is the next generation.

734
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Like you are Picard, essentially.

735
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Which I definitely would.

736
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
You would not make any decisions, I did too.

737
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Like when I played through the first time,

738
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
because I was making decisions based on

739
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,960
like what decisions I would actually make.

740
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
And in my mind, it was like,

741
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,960
well, considering the scope of the stakes,

742
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,960
I would always try to make the careful, logical decision

743
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,960
because it just always makes the most sense.

744
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
And it's not as though it's that careful and logical

745
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
because you're a human specter.

746
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Like what you symbolically represent in the story

747
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,960
is kind of more emotional decision-making,

748
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
because that's how humans are.

749
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Like they're not as logical as some of the other species.

750
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,960
But like, if you play, you know, in a more of a renegade way,

751
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
it would be more like Captain Kirk,

752
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,960
who is more likely to just, you know, go against logic.

753
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,960
And it's interesting because like,

754
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,960
it depends on like, is the appeal of Star Trek to you

755
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,960
that the universe has like all this logic

756
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
and stuff behind it,

757
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,960
but that you still can, you know,

758
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
make emotional decisions within that space,

759
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
or is it more that like you want to participate

760
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,960
in upholding the logic and like making the universe

761
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
a logical space where things make sense,

762
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
which is more what Picard is trying to do, you know,

763
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,960
like literally involving himself in the lawmaking

764
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
in some, you know, aspects

765
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,960
that are certainly the data trial and all that.

766
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,960
And to be fair, all the captains have multiple sides to them.

767
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,960
I mean, because Picard has a not much discussed

768
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,960
large affinity for Klingon culture specifically

769
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
that you would think, whoa, that's weird,

770
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
but he really spent a lot of time with them.

771
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
He loves emotions.

772
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
I think that's why he wants to be so logical

773
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,960
is so that those emotions have a space to thrive, you know?

774
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
It's like, I will create a,

775
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,960
I think he kind of represents the masculine ideal,

776
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,960
which is like, I will create the universe

777
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,960
in which women can be comfortable to express themselves,

778
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
you know?

779
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Like, I think that's like kind of the,

780
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,960
like everybody else will get to be emotional

781
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,960
because there is nothing for them to impede their ability

782
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
to live this way, you know,

783
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,960
as I have rectified the logic of the universe

784
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
to make that possible, you know?

785
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,960
That's what society hopefully is attempting

786
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
to accomplish in existing, you know?

787
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Makes sense to me.

788
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Well, that's it. There's my Star Trek talk for today.

789
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
I'll get back to you when I've finished Enterprise.

790
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
But tell me what you think, people. I want to know.

791
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,960
My fucking hand keeps tingling.

792
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Why?

793
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
I don't know.

794
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
You've got alien eggs in there.

795
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,960
I woke up right before the podcast

796
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
and I felt fine, didn't feel it.

797
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,960
I didn't feel like it wasn't like,

798
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
oh, I woke up and my hand is numb,

799
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
but maybe I slept on it.

800
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
But now I just have like a tingling

801
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,960
in my index and middle finger and my thumb

802
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
and a little down my arm.

803
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Left arm or right arm?

804
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Left arm.

805
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
That's a heart attack.

806
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Thanks.

807
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
It won't quit.

808
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
And I don't like it.

809
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
I don't know, dawgs.

810
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Are you saying you are having a heart attack right now?

811
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
I don't know. Yeah, probably.

812
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Ongoing.

813
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Wait, is that what it's like?

814
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
They say tingling in your left arm.

815
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
They say that that's a sign

816
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
or a hallmark or something connected.

817
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,960
It's like a common one or that you are currently having?

818
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I mean that you're like currently experiencing

819
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
what I think or maybe when it's about to happen.

820
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Wouldn't a heart attack be like a lot more intense

821
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
than like he wouldn't be able to talk and shit?

822
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
It must be a heart attack.

823
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Well, now I gotta go look at, okay, okay.

824
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Seek emergency medical assistance

825
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,960
if you also have left arm numbness or weakness.

826
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
I think tingling,

827
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
a temporary feeling of numbness in your left arm

828
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
is usually no cause for a lot.

829
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
It's not numbness, it's tingling.

830
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Seek a medical assistance if you also have chest pain

831
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
and pressure, back, jaw and shoulder pain,

832
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,960
skin discoloration, swelling or infection,

833
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,960
breathing or swallowing problems, confusion.

834
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Well, I got that.

835
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Sudden headache, facial palsy.

836
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Tell me why this is the land of confusion.

837
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Nausea, vomiting, sudden balance.

838
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,960
What exactly is palsy?

839
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Facial palsy.

840
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Oh, that's a...

841
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Your arm keeps fucking freaking out, right?

842
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Well, not quite.

843
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
This is facial palsy.

844
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
You know what's fucked up?

845
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
My boy.

846
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
He's freaking out.

847
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Here's an interesting story.

848
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
My boy Terar Duweil.

849
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
Okay, I guess it's paralysis,

850
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,960
especially that which is accompanied by involuntary tremors.

851
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Bro, get this.

852
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,960
My boy Terar Duweil, lobster boy himself,

853
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
ASMR-ist extraordinaire,

854
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,960
just got fucking Bell's palsy in his face

855
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,960
on half, excuse me, half his fucking face.

856
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Like, I don't know, like six, eight months ago or something.

857
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,960
So just like an ASMR guy who,

858
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,960
he does the thing, camera right up on his face

859
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
and he'll tell you about it.

860
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Maybe I'll link the video where he talks about it.

861
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
I mean, he's really sad and upset

862
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,960
because like half his face is just like paralyzed for a while

863
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
and you just can't move it.

864
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
And it like drips and...

865
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Yeah, it's fucked up.

866
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Oh, dear.

867
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
For a motherfucker.

868
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Okay, but it is like, it does go away in time

869
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
and he's doing much better.

870
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
So like, he's on the...

871
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Bell's palsy goes away?

872
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
That's what he said.

873
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Seems to be the case.

874
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,960
God, that makes me wanna die just thinking about it.

875
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
It is fucked up.

876
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
But the good news is,

877
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,960
he did an epic two-face ASMR video

878
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
and he was perfect for the role.

879
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Oh, God.

880
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
See, he played around with it.

881
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
That's not from adversity.

882
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Good job.

883
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
You know, maybe this is crazy,

884
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
but like, I do, I kinda wanna just like

885
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
give that guy a message.

886
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
We both live in Ohio and be like,

887
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
hey dude, like I really like,

888
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
you wanna just like hang out at a bar sometime

889
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
like before I like move away or something?

890
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Yeah, definitely.

891
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Because I think you're paced.

892
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
He's watched one of your videos before, hasn't he?

893
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
He has, he has.

894
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
On Twitter, we talked about it a little bit.

895
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
Absolutely.

896
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Who did?

897
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
This fucking guy I'm talking about right now, man.

898
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Don't miss the chance.

899
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
I fucking didn't hang out with a bunch of people in Boston

900
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
who I should have hung out with before I left.

901
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Yeah, good point.

902
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Good point.

903
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
If you've ever logged onto the PCP channel

904
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
and you look at like YouTube recommended videos,

905
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,960
that guy with the big schnoz is the guy.

906
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Yeah, big round egg head, balding.

907
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
He's a good guy, he's a good guy.

908
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
I got a bald head.

909
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Who was it that said that?

910
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,960
That was like a, that was somebody's like catchphrase.

911
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I don't know.

912
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
I got a bald head.

913
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Sounds like a wrestler.

914
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,960
No, it's like a YouTube guy, I think.

915
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Is it fit MC by any chance?

916
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
I don't think so.

917
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Rest in peace, fit.

918
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm sorry to do that to you.

919
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
I just ended his career.

920
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
Now I'm the Minecraft man.

921
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Now I'm the oldest Anarchy server in Minecraft

922
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
and it feels good.

923
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,960
I have been, since my announcement last time

924
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,960
that I'm attempting the Tezuka Award manga thingy.

925
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Yeah.

926
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,960
I've been writing, but also like writer's blocking for a while.

927
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Naturally.

928
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
Writing's hard, dude.

929
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
I don't know.

930
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Have you ever tried like,

931
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,960
have you ever tried just like making the comic wholly without any text

932
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
and then just adding text on afterwards?

933
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Cause that's how a lot of like older comics were written.

934
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,960
I mean, I would probably do that and then delete it and start again

935
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,960
because I only have so many pages to work with

936
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,960
and I can't go over that amount.

937
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
So like if something doesn't fit,

938
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
I would need to change all the panels.

939
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,960
So I want to try and figure it out what I'm doing first.

940
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,960
That's how I've worked with a lot of ghosts.

941
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,960
Like once I have the, I did like a screenplay first.

942
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,960
I knew the outline, I knew what happens.

943
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
So I did a screenplay or I wrote the dialogue

944
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
so that the dialogue sounded cool.

945
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,960
And then I did sketches for all the pages

946
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,960
so that the dialogue could fit and like flow into pages.

947
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,960
So such that when you turn the page,

948
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
something exciting would be on the next page

949
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,960
rather than things being cut in half.

950
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
So like I'm trying to do that with this.

951
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
And well, I'm not to that stage yet.

952
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,960
I'm really just like, I've got an outline and it's very basic.

953
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,960
And I, I'm trying to flesh it out with like stuff

954
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,960
without having nothing.

955
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,960
Like, like, like actions and characters

956
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,960
and parts of dialogue that do not in any way add to

957
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
like the theme I'm going for

958
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,960
or do not add to the character development.

959
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,960
I don't want to have a scene that's just an action scene

960
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,960
and then we move on to the next bit.

961
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,960
I want all the panels to be good.

962
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,960
So I'm like, I, I'm just sort of stuck.

963
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
I've been, I've been going to like the list

964
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,960
of the Tezuka award winners, Manga's,

965
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
seeing what the first chapters were like

966
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
and then going page by page and trying to like figure out

967
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,960
where do they do the things that and why,

968
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,960
like how do they, how do they start?

969
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,960
When do we know who the character is and how cool they are?

970
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Things like that.

971
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
But the hardest part is like the middle

972
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,960
because the middle is so amorphous.

973
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Like it could be anything.

974
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Like it all depends on what you want to say

975
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,960
before you wrap up.

976
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
And it's like, I don't really know what I want to say.

977
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
What is the page limit?

978
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,960
55 pages, I think it's, it's plenty big.

979
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,960
So my mentality towards storyboarding comics,

980
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,960
which was the ones I've done is always like,

981
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
first I just figure out the page, the amount of pages.

982
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,960
And then I think like, what kind of story can I tell

983
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
within that amount of pages?

984
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
And then like, how many pages,

985
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
like if I break that story down into pieces,

986
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,960
like how many pages will it take to get this emotional idea

987
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,960
across like pacing wise, you know, like,

988
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,960
if I like, I think of it in terms of this type of reveal

989
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
takes three pages for somebody to really feel it.

990
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,960
So like this will be a three page reveal or like,

991
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,960
you know, this statement could be crammed into the top corner

992
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
of a panel and it'll be funnier up there, you know, like,

993
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,960
so just thinking about like the page construction

994
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,960
as like the first step of the creation is just like,

995
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,960
what, what will be the length of each scene page wise?

996
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
And then you look at those three pages and you go,

997
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
okay, how do I tell this story within the span

998
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
of these three pages?

999
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
You know, like how many images are necessary?

1000
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,960
How big should those images be?

1001
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
You know, and it's just like building it in words

1002
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
as opposed to how words, you know.

1003
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,960
It's still hard though.

1004
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Like I've been getting like different advice things.

1005
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,960
I think it's just, I know a little bit.

1006
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,960
I don't know fully what the character is quite yet.

1007
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
And so like,

1008
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
Let me ask you this.

1009
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
If you were to ask me like, what is the point?

1010
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,960
I would be like, I'm drawing a comic

1011
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
and that that's not a real point yet.

1012
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
That's no real story.

1013
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
The editor, I think this came out recently.

1014
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I don't know if it's an old quote.

1015
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
The editor of Dragon Ball recently,

1016
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
I saw a quote recently at least.

1017
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,960
This story is about me and my experience of the events

1018
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
that went down was, I saw a quote of the guy,

1019
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
the editor of Dragon Ball said,

1020
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,960
this story is about nothing.

1021
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,960
It's just people fighting.

1022
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
We just wanted to make a cool comic

1023
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,960
and it's like the most influential manga of all time,

1024
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,960
basically.

1025
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
So I certainly empathize

1026
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,960
and I would approach things the same way as you.

1027
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,960
But I was going to ask, do you have the cool moments?

1028
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,960
Do you have badass story?

1029
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Like that's when she kills the guy with a sick pose.

1030
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,960
That's what I want to know.

1031
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,960
I do have a few cool poses.

1032
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,960
I have a cover page in my head.

1033
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,960
I think it's easy to overestimate

1034
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,960
like how much sense it really has to make.

1035
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Like when I think about a lot of first chapters

1036
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
of Shonen manga,

1037
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
like they're definitely not like tight

1038
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
and perfectly constructed.

1039
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
Like I think about like Naruto

1040
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
and like it has a great first chapter,

1041
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
but it is just like, it's really emotional.

1042
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
It's just kind of exploding off the page.

1043
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,960
Like you could tell that like this is a story

1044
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
that really meant something to the author

1045
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
that he probably had a relationship like this

1046
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,960
that he just like, you know, needed to tell that story.

1047
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,960
So it's like, that's going to matter way more

1048
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,960
than like how well constructed it is

1049
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
or how well written it is.

1050
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,960
It's just like, do you have that emotionality behind it?

1051
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,960
You know?

1052
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Just be yourself, bro.

1053
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,960
Seems like if you're going to have,

1054
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,960
if you're going to make it an emotional and affecting work,

1055
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
yeah, you have to feel strongly about it.

1056
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,960
And I guess you can do that by,

1057
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,960
maybe you could do it if like it's a story

1058
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,960
you really want to tell

1059
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
or like it's like themes that you really care about

1060
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,960
or it's just like you really love drawing

1061
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
whatever this shit is.

1062
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Oh man, did I complain about Mon Ben

1063
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,960
and how like half of it just doesn't exist?

1064
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
I think you did.

1065
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
At length.

1066
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
On the PCP I did?

1067
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
Definitely, right?

1068
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
I mean, yes, you definitely did.

1069
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,960
Like maybe it was the bonus episode?

1070
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
No, it was last time.

1071
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,960
Why was it?

1072
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Because I remember I made a tweet about it a while ago.

1073
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,960
You also tweeted about it.

1074
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I remember I made the tweet about it.

1075
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,960
I found and I, oh, well, I guess I won't rehash it then.

1076
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,960
But it's like, I guess it's like, you know,

1077
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,960
how much of that have you seen Hippo?

1078
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,960
I've seen two episodes, I think.

1079
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,960
Oh, I mean, they're not equally fascinating,

1080
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,960
but they're all worth watching

1081
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,960
and some of them are like really, really fascinating.

1082
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,960
There's the one guy who has like a very painterly

1083
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,960
sort of like kind of classical,

1084
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,960
I guess you would say like a sort of classical-ish art style

1085
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,960
and he just like really loves drawing animals

1086
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,960
and he works all by himself and he just like,

1087
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,960
he just fucking like really likes drawing animals

1088
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,960
and he likes drawing like big like Jaguar mouths

1089
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,960
and like frogs like kicking their legs and stuff

1090
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,960
and he's just like, yeah, so, you know,

1091
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,960
I made a manga that was all about how like, you know,

1092
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,960
we have to protect the environment

1093
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,960
and like, or, you know, he's got environmental themes

1094
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,960
and now I'm just gonna draw a whole bunch of pages

1095
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,960
of like a frog girl and a cheetah man

1096
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,960
just like fighting each other and like it's,

1097
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,960
I just, he just loves it.

1098
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,960
He just loves that shit.

1099
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,960
And he's just like, yeah, and I'll just sit down

1100
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,960
for like, you know, 12 hours a day and just sketch that out.

1101
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,960
Yeah, it feels good, man.

1102
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,960
I guess I should maybe try to tap more into that,

1103
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
like just draw what I want.

1104
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,960
Because like, I know like the character design.

1105
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,960
It's the only way to do it for an extended period.

1106
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,960
If you don't love doing it, you're gonna quit.

1107
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
Well, obviously.

1108
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,960
But like, specifically for the story,

1109
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,960
I'm thinking like maybe too much about the pacing

1110
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,960
or the act structure or like rising tension.

1111
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,960
Like I think that will come pretty naturally, honestly.

1112
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,960
I just need to, I really love this character design.

1113
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,960
I love, it's the red-haired like cowgirl

1114
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,960
I've posted a few times.

1115
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,960
That's unironically probably the most important part

1116
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,960
of the whole thing for a manga.

1117
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,960
The Tezuka manga is gonna be about her.

1118
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
Yeah.

1119
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Are you sure you wanted that to be public?

1120
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,960
I'm just wondering if you want to keep that into your hat.

1121
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,960
We could bleep it.

1122
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,960
And I've already like talked in discords,

1123
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
like talking about it.

1124
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,960
Like I've been asking for like advice in Ben's like,

1125
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,960
discord in the infernal scripts chat,

1126
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,960
which I didn't realize was a comic chat

1127
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,960
and now I have realized.

1128
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,960
Wait.

1129
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,960
I thought the infernal scripts chat was about coding.

1130
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,960
No.

1131
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
You don't know.

1132
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,960
I thought that server was about simping for Michelle

1133
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
from what I understand.

1134
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
I guess that's what it's about now.

1135
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
Right.

1136
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
Yeah.

1137
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,960
All three.

1138
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,960
Wait, no.

1139
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,960
That's not.

1140
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,960
People in Ben's server are simping for Michelle.

1141
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,960
What's going on?

1142
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,960
It's called like the Michelle fan chat.

1143
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
No, wait, no, no, no.

1144
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,960
It was called like the Michelle sim chat discord for a while.

1145
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,960
Now, now it's called bug saints wormhole.

1146
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
Oh, and the top chat.

1147
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,960
The general is called Michelle tantrum chat.

1148
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Michelle tantrum chat.

1149
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
Yeah.

1150
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,960
I mean, the, all the, all the, all the channels got renamed

1151
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,960
so long ago and there was a lot.

1152
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,960
It was like, okay, this is going to be this channel.

1153
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,960
This is going to be this channel.

1154
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
But like, I forget the logic behind some of it.

1155
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,960
Right.

1156
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Right.

1157
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,960
There's another, there's another one for game development.

1158
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,960
I think.

1159
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,960
Gamer gulag.

1160
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,960
Dev talk.

1161
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
Yeah.

1162
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,960
That's it.

1163
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,960
It's probably gamer gulag.

1164
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,960
Yeah.

1165
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Okay.

1166
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,960
Yeah.

1167
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,960
I mean, I mean, the thing about my discord is that I completely let my mods run rampant

1168
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,960
and they do.

1169
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,960
And half the time I don't even notice when they like change the entire server's name

1170
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,960
or whatever, or just like change.

1171
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,960
How many mods do you have?

1172
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,960
Probably like six or six or seven or eight.

1173
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,960
Are there power struggles between them?

1174
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,960
Probably more than it's strictly necessary, but it's all people who have been like, you

1175
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,960
know, there for like so long, but they're like, you know, people who are already just

1176
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,960
like constant presences in there.

1177
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,960
So like, why not make them a mod?

1178
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,960
Well, you know, if they, you know, are someone who's just going to take matters into their

1179
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,960
own hands, that might be why.

1180
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,960
You know, because, because I'm, because I'm the kind of guy to just kind of leave and

1181
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,960
not post in my own server for like a month at a time here and there.

1182
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,960
I thought, you know, the server will be more interesting if the mods do have an unwarranted

1183
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,960
sense of I can fuck shit up if I want to.

1184
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
Yeah.

1185
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
Yeah.

1186
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,960
It's really funny.

1187
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,960
My server was deliberate aesthetic choice.

1188
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,960
My server had only ever had one mod up until like a month ago when I finally appointed a

1189
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,960
second one, mostly to run a manga club.

1190
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,960
But I have now made my discord completely free.

1191
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
It is not open.

1192
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,960
It's invite only.

1193
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,960
If any of you guys wants to come in, you can get an invite, but it is free.

1194
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,960
Yeah.

1195
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,960
Why not?

1196
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
So.

1197
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,960
I, I regularly just do rounds of just clicking through discord and see if anybody's talking

1198
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,960
about something interesting.

1199
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Yeah.

1200
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,960
My discord is now free, not open to the public.

1201
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
Nobody can invite except for me.

1202
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,960
And I'll probably make the mods.

1203
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Eleazar, put that in the show notes, buddy.

1204
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
We got to, we got to bust this thing wide open.

1205
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,960
We got to get the people in.

1206
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,960
Actually, actually this is a one time use one hour only.

1207
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,960
So I probably have to post it like three times.

1208
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Wait, no.

1209
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Let's not get in there.

1210
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,960
Because I'm in.

1211
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,960
Different leagues for each of you.

1212
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Yeah.

1213
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,960
I'm in mages discord as well.

1214
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,960
I'll just send you individualize.

1215
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,960
I'm in all the discords now.

1216
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,960
Yeah.

1217
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,960
I joined them all.

1218
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,960
I was thinking for a while like this, I mean too many discords.

1219
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
I don't want to have to check them all.

1220
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,960
I've just accepted that I'm going to be in too many discords.

1221
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,960
And that's just my life.

1222
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,960
That's just my life.

1223
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Hey, this invite is invalid.

1224
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,960
Hey, hey, hey, what the fuck?

1225
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,960
What the fuck?

1226
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,960
You sent me these bum, these bum goods.

1227
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,960
I sent you another one, the personal one.

1228
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,960
Yeah.

1229
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,960
These ones were only one time, the one I sent.

1230
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,960
Well, it's a crime about it, I guess.

1231
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,960
It's invalid.

1232
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,960
What the fuck?

1233
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,960
DJ.

1234
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,960
I'm fixing it.

1235
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,960
It's invalid.

1236
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,960
How about this one?

1237
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Thank you.

1238
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Thank you.

1239
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,960
Did that one work?

1240
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,960
I should, I should get in Tom's discord.

1241
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,960
I don't know whether that's patron only.

1242
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,960
I, I should get, if it, yeah, I don't.

1243
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
I don't mind it.

1244
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
I am Games Discord is not patron only.

1245
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,960
And he is in the I am Games Discord.

1246
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Oh, I should be, I should be in that.

1247
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,960
Yes.

1248
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
Yes, of course.

1249
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,960
The more places I can just post the link to the next Lord of Ghost chapter.

1250
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
Right, right.

1251
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
That's what it's all about.

1252
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
It's better.

1253
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,960
Yeah.

1254
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
I know what I've been saying.

1255
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,960
I've been getting some.

1256
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,960
I mean, I am Games is not very active of a server, but Tom is in there.

1257
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,960
Yeah.

1258
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,960
Isn't that where he does like Q and A?

1259
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,960
If you want an active server, Jim, you all need to join the Pansu party server because

1260
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
that one.

1261
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,960
I'm in that.

1262
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Am I in that?

1263
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
I was a guest on May's stream.

1264
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,960
That's right.

1265
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,960
Oh, of course.

1266
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,960
Of course.

1267
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,960
That's true.

1268
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,960
No, I'm not in there.

1269
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,960
I just saw into it one time on the stream because she had the discord window.

1270
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,960
It will be suspect if I let you join now though, because it's supposed to be on lockdown currently

1271
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,960
to prevent spies.

1272
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Well,

1273
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,960
I think we're generally trustworthy, but that's fine.

1274
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,960
Ten Ted spies.

1275
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,960
I don't know.

1276
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,960
I'm missing some context.

1277
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,960
You didn't watch content cunt, did you?

1278
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
No.

1279
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,960
You got to check it out.

1280
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Next time you're on Pansu Party's channel, watch the video content cunt.

1281
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,960
It's okay.

1282
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,960
It's a whole lot of silly internet drama that is, you know.

1283
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,960
Fair summary.

1284
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,960
As is with old drama.

1285
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,960
It's funny for a little while, but like, I don't know.

1286
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,960
Is it based or is it cringe?

1287
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
That's all I need to know.

1288
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,960
I mean, the video is based, but the person that the video is about is extremely cringe.

1289
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,960
So, yeah.

1290
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
Guys, my hand, still a little tingly.

1291
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,960
The tingling has moved slightly.

1292
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,960
It's now less intense in the fingers and more intense in the palm area a little bit.

1293
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Okay.

1294
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,960
I think I would rate it as improving.

1295
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,960
This is riveting.

1296
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,960
I'm loving this.

1297
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,960
I sure hope Ben doesn't die live on the podcast.

1298
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,960
I sure hope I don't have to get too stents in my arteries or anything.

1299
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,960
I also hope you don't die, but until you do, keep it to yourself.

1300
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
Okay.

1301
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Yes.

1302
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
I'll stay in my lane.

1303
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,960
Yeah, thank you.

1304
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Hey, speaking of riveting.

1305
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,960
I've been riveting a rivet.

1306
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,960
I'm making gummies again.

1307
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,960
I ordered more shit.

1308
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:20,960
I ordered like seven pounds of isomolta oligosaccharides in the mail.

1309
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,960
I got the powdered kind.

1310
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,960
You can just mix that shit with water and it turns into the syrup.

1311
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,960
I'm back, baby.

1312
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,960
I got the syrup.

1313
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,960
I have a big Tupperware container of the syrup.

1314
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,960
I've made two batches.

1315
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,960
I got new flavors.

1316
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,960
I'm going to get apple flavor.

1317
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,960
I'm going to get passion fruit.

1318
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,960
I'm going to get rose flavor.

1319
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,960
Curious how that's going to turn out.

1320
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,960
I'm sorry, Ben.

1321
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,960
I think I've missed this gummy arc.

1322
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,960
Oh, yeah.

1323
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,960
Clearly.

1324
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,960
What's happening?

1325
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,960
Are you making gummies?

1326
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,960
Yeah.

1327
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,960
What kind of gummies?

1328
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,960
Are they like alcohol gummies?

1329
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,960
No, no, they're keto gummies.

1330
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,960
They're sugar free.

1331
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,960
They're made because, okay, well, I guess I'll recap briefly.

1332
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,960
All it is is that I would go, I was going to Whole Foods and I kept buying these sugar,

1333
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,960
these low sugar gummies called sweet smarts and they're so good.

1334
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,960
I couldn't, every time I went there, I couldn't help but spend like $12 on a bunch of these

1335
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:26,960
gummies and just eat them all in one fucking second devour like four bags at a time.

1336
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:27,960
And I was like, enough.

1337
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,960
I'm going bankrupt.

1338
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,960
I'm going to perish.

1339
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,960
There has to be a better way.

1340
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,960
So I looked at the ingredients list and I was like, what are all these weird fucking weird

1341
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,960
like 20 syllable long things?

1342
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,960
And I looked them up and I just ordered big bags of them and then I just, and I concocted

1343
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,960
them, I reverse engineered them and I found the recipe and now I can make them in my house

1344
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,960
and I do and I got worm molds and I'm making gummy worms and I made a bunch of batches before

1345
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,960
and I had mango and I had pear and I had strawberry and I was thinking, what if, I mean, obviously

1346
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,960
I'm always considering how can I merchandise this?

1347
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,960
How can I tie this into endless war somehow?

1348
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,960
So I was thinking, what if maybe I could do something with that?

1349
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,960
But I don't know.

1350
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,960
I don't know about that.

1351
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,960
Right now I'm just, and I got the most amazing thing about it is I learned what makes them

1352
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,960
sour.

1353
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,960
It's citric acid.

1354
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,960
It's pure crystallized acid and I have a big bag of it and I can roll them in it and I can

1355
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,960
make them sour and they have the sour coating on them and it's, and it's, and I have big

1356
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,960
bags of acid and I can just eat it with a spoon if I want to and it tastes really sour,

1357
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,960
but it's kind of good.

1358
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,960
Ben, there's a meme sweeping the nation that you've got to capitalize on made famous by

1359
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,960
one Justin Bieber.

1360
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,960
You've got to make a song cover of his hit song, Yummy, only it's now gummy.

1361
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Gross.

1362
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,960
And you just, you just do that and the money will simply appear before you as I understand

1363
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,960
it.

1364
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,960
That's, that's how it works.

1365
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,960
That's how it works.

1366
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,960
You do that and like you just get, you just get like a mark of advance.

1367
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,960
Granted.

1368
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,960
Granted on your doorstep.

1369
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,960
Yeah.

1370
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,960
A boon is granted you by a friendly genie.

1371
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,960
And I, you know, it's very fun.

1372
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,960
I'll go down and I'll, and I'll heat up my double boiler and I'll pour all my weird

1373
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,960
like goos into it, into a thing.

1374
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Yeah.

1375
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,960
I'll stir it all around and I pour it in the molds and I put it in the fridge for like

1376
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,960
an hour and then I come down and I'm like, okay, I'll just have a couple.

1377
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,960
But no, I eat the entire batch and then I'm like, okay, time to make another one.

1378
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,960
I've spent hundreds of dollars.

1379
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,960
I have spent like probably like, I've spent hundreds of dollars on all this weird shit

1380
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,960
and it's great, highly recommended.

1381
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,960
But you know what?

1382
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,960
Haven't, I've only bought, I've only bought those Whole Foods gummies a couple times

1383
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,960
since then.

1384
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,960
So, you know, it's paying for itself.

1385
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,960
You know, Ben, I, these are, these are two kind of opposite sides of the thing, but,

1386
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,960
but relevant to what you're saying, Michelle was possessed by the food demon the other day

1387
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,960
and she saw that we had bacon in the fridge.

1388
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,960
So she fried up the bacon.

1389
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,960
Dude, bacon, dude, bacon?

1390
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
That's epic, bro.

1391
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,960
It's very keto.

1392
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
That's like so epic, dude.

1393
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,960
Lay bacon.

1394
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Yes.

1395
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
Exactly my thought process.

1396
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
Okay.

1397
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,960
So there was bacon and then she cast her gaze to the side and noticed that there were

1398
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,960
chocolate chips.

1399
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,960
So what she did was she did that double pot boiler thing where you heat up the water and

1400
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,960
melt chocolate.

1401
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,960
She fried the bacon and then she dipped the bacon in the chocolate and produced a chocolate-covered

1402
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,960
bacon, which frankly I had too much chocolate for my taste.

1403
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,960
Dude, even Epicur.

1404
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,960
It was very, very epic.

1405
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,960
I would, I ate it, you know, it was good.

1406
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,960
I would, yeah, it seems like you would get a lot of chocolate on it.

1407
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,960
Too much in my, in my...

1408
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,960
You might, maybe you could like thin the chocolate somehow so you could get a thinner coating.

1409
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,960
That would have been a good idea.

1410
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,960
That would, this was just pure melted chocolate chips.

1411
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,960
I mean, oh yeah, that would be so thick.

1412
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,960
I mean, this is, it's all about experimentation.

1413
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,960
You're right.

1414
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,960
With the gummies.

1415
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,960
I probably made like, I probably made like 10 batches or so, many of which came out like

1416
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,960
just absolutely disgusting before I came upon.

1417
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,960
Cause my goal was, cause if you, cause if you look up recipes, like how to make gummies

1418
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,960
on the internet, what all the recipes basically say is just make jello, but put in like extra

1419
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,960
gelatin.

1420
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,960
So it's like really thick.

1421
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,960
Yeah.

1422
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,960
And it is not, it is not the right consistency at all.

1423
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,960
You eat it and you're like, this is just thick jello.

1424
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,960
No.

1425
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,960
No, no, no.

1426
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,960
No, no, no, no.

1427
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,960
You gotta use that tapioca starch.

1428
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,960
You gotta use that xanthan gum.

1429
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,960
You gotta use that carnauba wax, you know?

1430
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,960
You gotta use that coconut oil or whatever the fuck you do.

1431
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,960
You gotta use pectin.

1432
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:32,960
The Animaniacs Ingredient Song?

1433
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,960
One thing, one experiment with pectin.

1434
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,960
Yeah.

1435
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,960
Pectin seems like it might be a useful ingredient in this, but I don't have any.

1436
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,960
You know that Animaniacs Ingredient Song?

1437
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
It's you making your gummies.

1438
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,960
No.

1439
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,960
I have linked it here in Le Chat.

1440
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,960
Le Epic Chat?

1441
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,960
That's right.

1442
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,960
With bacon?

1443
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,960
Yes.

1444
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:59,960
Listen, I was gonna say, contrary to me eating chocolate covered bacon, this was in fact a

1445
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,960
great return to form for Ol' Nate as I worked out the entire time and was a very fit boy

1446
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,960
and it feels great and I will, I cannot wait for this hellscape of a podcast to end so

1447
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,960
I can go begin, start, track the next generation over from episode one and work out and then

1448
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,960
get back to working various other things, which is what I will do immediately afterward.

1449
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,960
Oh, I still haven't started working out again.

1450
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,960
Oh, Ben.

1451
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,960
Every day I say, mm, Ben, you sure aren't working out today.

1452
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
Yeah.

1453
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,960
And every day it's fucking epic.

1454
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,960
Make today that day, Ben.

1455
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,960
Make today that day.

1456
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,960
I could.

1457
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,960
My back was like hurting.

1458
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,960
No.

1459
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:36,960
Do yoga.

1460
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,960
Fuck yoga.

1461
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,960
Just work out.

1462
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,960
Just don't do yoga.

1463
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,960
Just exercise.

1464
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,960
It'll be good.

1465
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
It'll be better.

1466
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,960
Yoga is not even real exercise.

1467
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,960
I don't care what they say.

1468
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,960
It's true.

1469
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,960
It's fake.

1470
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,960
It's true.

1471
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,960
It's stretching.

1472
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,960
It's glorified stretching, which is good, but you know, ain't burning no calories doing

1473
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,960
yoga.

1474
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,960
Don't give me no shit about hot yoga.

1475
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,960
It's not even real.

1476
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,960
You burn a couple.

1477
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,960
Yeah.

1478
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,960
Burn calories.

1479
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,460
Also literally playing chess, sitting there, using your brain at max capacity, which I

1480
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,960
prefer to do.

1481
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,960
That's hence my video gaming.

1482
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,960
I burn a lot of calories.

1483
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:16,460
Dude, imagine it's like death note, but instead of being a detective, L is just a gamer, and

1484
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,960
he's just like, bro.

1485
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,260
I mean, I'm already loving this idea.

1486
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:28,360
Every time my reflexes are so fast, like when I 360 no scope, every time I do it, I need

1487
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,360
to eat some more.

1488
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,360
I need to eat some more.

1489
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,960
How does this map onto death note, though?

1490
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:37,800
I don't understand the connection there of this highly strained metaphor.

1491
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,640
That's where the meme of your brain using so many calories comes in, right?

1492
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,640
Oh, because L did that.

1493
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,640
That's why you ate so much sugar.

1494
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,640
Yeah, obviously.

1495
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,640
That was the right idea.

1496
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,640
What did you think I was talking about?

1497
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,640
Okay, you're right.

1498
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,640
I see.

1499
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:55,600
Hey, so I played some more Dungeons and Dragons yesterday.

1500
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,600
Yeah.

1501
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:03,240
I talked about Higgs Ozoks, The Dry, my frogman.

1502
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,200
He's my new OC.

1503
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,720
He's my new best friend.

1504
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,120
He's really coming into his own.

1505
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,360
He's really coming into his own as a character.

1506
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:19,160
He's a little bit of a voice of reason.

1507
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,160
He's very practical.

1508
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,840
He's always like, guys, no, let's not get in trouble, guys, please, guys, please.

1509
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,480
I just want to dig a hole and put water in it and just make a new little pond.

1510
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,240
I just want to live in a pond, guys.

1511
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,280
Let's not incur the wrath of the hobgoblins, please, please.

1512
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,280
Respectable.

1513
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,280
I ordered.

1514
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,360
Do you know what Hero Forge is?

1515
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,360
No.

1516
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:46,480
Hero Forge is a website where you can go and they have a spore creature creator style

1517
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:54,120
thing where you can customize the design and posing of a little figure and you can print

1518
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:01,280
out a custom miniature, basically, to use on a D&D combat grid.

1519
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,280
Can I make a very small dildo?

1520
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,640
Just a very small.

1521
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,640
Very small.

1522
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
That's all I can handle.

1523
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Imagine about...

1524
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Bad dragon.

1525
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I'm coming for you.

1526
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
One step at a time.

1527
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Under two inches long, I think, would be the maximum.

1528
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,040
I can handle that.

1529
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,120
But they had frog heads, so I was like, well, I have to do it.

1530
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:25,800
I have to give them my money now, so I made a little Higgs, a little Higgs mini.

1531
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,800
I made a little Higgs mini, and then I was like, wait, no, I could have added mushrooms.

1532
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,400
I could have put mushrooms on the ground, and I forgot.

1533
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,600
So I sent them a desperate email.

1534
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:39,120
I was like, Mr. Heroforge, sir, please, CEO of the Heroforge Corporation, please, please

1535
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,120
stop production.

1536
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,120
Henry Heroforge.

1537
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,120
Stop production, please.

1538
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,120
I need...

1539
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:54,000
Fwoggy want mushrooms, and Mr. Heroforge said, well, you know, we have a 24-hour cancellation

1540
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,920
window that is meant to be used in this way.

1541
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,560
You should have canceled the order and reordered it.

1542
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:06,080
If you wanted to change the design, however, I suppose, since we have not technically produced

1543
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:11,240
the figure, we can technically accommodate you, so please use the attached link to send

1544
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,440
us your new design.

1545
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,480
Thank you, and good day, sir.

1546
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,800
And I said, oh, thank you, sir, oh, thank you, yes, please.

1547
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:24,240
Thank Fwoggy want mushroom, please.

1548
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,240
My subplot, right?

1549
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,240
Yeah.

1550
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,240
Higgs's subplot, which I have decided upon without any...

1551
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,200
I'm not telling anyone about it.

1552
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,800
It's just the thing I'm doing in the background until it becomes relevant.

1553
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:42,520
Every time he goes anywhere, he is scanning the ground, he's scanning the walls for weird

1554
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,280
lichens and molds, and every time he gets a place to rest, he's like, all right, all

1555
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
right.

1556
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,880
So this weird lichen I found, I try to brew it into a beer.

1557
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:52,880
How does it taste?

1558
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,880
I don't like.

1559
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:02,160
And the goal is to be the number one brewer in the weird mining complex that he now finds

1560
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
himself in.

1561
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,160
Wait, did you say he's looking for mushrooms?

1562
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,160
Did I miss that?

1563
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,760
Was that the mushroom element there, or was that the side factor?

1564
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,840
Well, there's two mushroom elements.

1565
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,640
The first is that I wanted to add them to the figure.

1566
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,640
Right.

1567
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,640
Right.

1568
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,720
On the base of the figure, on the stone's texture he's standing on.

1569
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,440
And the second is, yeah, he's looking for...

1570
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,720
Well, he's looking for native vegetation, because he's been transported to this underground

1571
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,040
complex, and he's looking for native vegetation to make beer out of.

1572
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,000
So he is in fact a mushroom hunter.

1573
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,200
He is a brewer by trade.

1574
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,480
I mean, yeah, mushrooms and lichens.

1575
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,320
I mean, if there was regular vegetation, he would look for that too, but that doesn't

1576
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,320
exist here.

1577
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,160
So yeah, it's mostly mushrooms.

1578
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,640
He's all about that mush.

1579
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:50,200
Just imagine, if you will, audience me going sicko mode on the soundboard right now.

1580
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,400
Absolutely ballistic with the bazegas.

1581
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,920
If he were to find a morel, for example, he would savor the flavor.

1582
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,200
It would be a delicacy.

1583
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:06,680
But however, it's tragic, it's tragic, because his species, the grung, is immune to poison,

1584
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,680
which technically means...

1585
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,680
So they can't get wasted?

1586
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,680
Huh?

1587
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,680
So they can't get wasted, is the name?

1588
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,680
They can't get...

1589
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,920
No, they don't get drunk, but that's not why he does it.

1590
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,920
He does it for the flavor.

1591
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:15,920
Oh, okay, that's fine.

1592
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,880
He does it for the flavor, because it's a delicacy among his people, and he doesn't

1593
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,000
understand why the dry folk get all weird when they drink his shit.

1594
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,320
Oh, okay, I see, I see.

1595
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,000
Makes for some wacky situations.

1596
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,040
Whoops, it was poisonous.

1597
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:34,000
Whoops, oh good, I brewed it with the slime off my back.

1598
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,560
What, oh no, it gave you fucking palsy in your face.

1599
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,800
With the slime from my balls.

1600
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,600
I said it, I said it, gross.

1601
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,600
Sam, dude.

1602
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,840
Yeah, I'm not afraid.

1603
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,520
To make a stand.

1604
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,240
Everybody come drink my brand, it's made from semen.

1605
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,240
Mine's...

1606
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,240
Really?

1607
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,240
God.

1608
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,240
All right.

1609
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:04,560
Funny, funny fact that I stumbled upon quite by accident.

1610
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,400
So yes, Higgs is a grung.

1611
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:13,640
There is another player in the campaign who is a yuan-ti pureblood, turns out, and this

1612
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:23,840
is a total coincidence that in the lore, the yuan-ti consider grung eggs to be a delicacy

1613
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,000
when candied.

1614
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,080
But it's okay, it's okay, because the explicit backstory of the yuan-ti is that she is like

1615
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:38,040
a bleeding heart, liberal, who thinks that other humanoids are, you know, they technically

1616
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,080
have the right to life, you know.

1617
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,080
Right, I see.

1618
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
She's like an animal.

1619
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,080
Technically not cringe.

1620
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:49,400
She's like an animal rights activist for humans and dwarves and elves and stuff.

1621
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:55,280
They don't deserve to be slaughtered in factories, you know.

1622
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,280
Interesting that you would say that.

1623
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:00,080
I just googled it, and unlike the, I don't know, what is this, homebrew wiki, I don't

1624
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,080
know what this is.

1625
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,320
I assume it's D&D related and that it's relatively official.

1626
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:08,680
There's a quote here from the yuan-ti race, which are big, like, Lamia-looking motherfuckers.

1627
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,280
They come in different varieties.

1628
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,280
Oh, okay.

1629
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,760
They're sort of general, like, sneaky people.

1630
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:19,080
Direct quote from Masters of the Forbidden City by Koto Vidak says, quote, the yuan-ti

1631
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,280
cast off their humanity long ago, and with it, their sanity.

1632
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,280
Ooh.

1633
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,120
Despite that, that's, that's, the racial divides run deep, I guess.

1634
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,160
That's a harsh criticism, but maybe not all.

1635
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,040
Hashtag not all yuan-ti, I guess.

1636
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,040
Some community.

1637
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1638
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,920
Hopefully.

1639
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,280
I feel like, I feel like there's something else to say with that.

1640
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:47,920
Maybe, maybe I've said all I need to say about, about, about that.

1641
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,680
Oh, I did have something, I have to complain about something.

1642
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,680
Sure.

1643
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:57,000
So, I've been working on, you know, since the Kickstarter ended, I've been getting, I've

1644
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,240
been talking to the manufacturer, they have made one, they have produced one pin so far.

1645
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:09,600
They are currently working on, they're currently making samples of like five more of the, of

1646
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,200
the pins that got designed.

1647
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,200
And there's like.

1648
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,200
Just being the RFCK Kickstarter.

1649
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,200
Yes, the RFCK Kickstarter.

1650
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,200
Right.

1651
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,200
I think like 24 different.

1652
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,000
Certainly, there aren't any other Kickstarters that you're neglecting your duties on.

1653
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Certainly not.

1654
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
There couldn't be one.

1655
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I'm not neglecting my duties.

1656
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
But I know.

1657
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:31,480
Hey, Nexus messaged me after last episode and was like, please, sir, Mr. Boss Man, please

1658
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:38,200
don't bully me, please don't tell people that I'm not done with the pages.

1659
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:43,200
And I said, and I said, hey, Nexus, listen, I own your ass, right?

1660
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:49,720
You work for me now, I'm going to keep, I'm going to keep, you're going to, you have to,

1661
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:55,080
you have to pay me in, I said, for every month, I said, for every month that you don't, for

1662
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:59,640
every week that you don't get me those pages, you have to pay me interest on their costs.

1663
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,000
And you're in the negatives now.

1664
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,040
So we're at the point now, when you finally get me your pages, you have to pay me for

1665
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,240
the privilege of having them published in my work.

1666
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,240
You're welcome.

1667
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,000
And he said, yes, sir, thank you, sir.

1668
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,880
It sounds like Nexus, yeah.

1669
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,640
And that's, I have screenshots, I have screenshots of all this.

1670
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,760
Okay, I believe it, that's legal.

1671
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,760
I'll post them.

1672
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,760
I'll fucking post them.

1673
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,760
I'll fucking post them.

1674
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,880
I got receipts.

1675
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,280
And why was I talking about that?

1676
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,320
So your point being that you're pins, you're moving forward on the pin thing.

1677
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,320
Yes.

1678
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,680
And all that, everything I just said about Nexus.

1679
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,680
Oh man, I'm sorry, that wasn't even my main criticism.

1680
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:38,200
I was talking about the fucking Radcon 4 one, how you're dragging ass into fucking us all

1681
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,680
over on that Kickstarter.

1682
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,440
Okay, yeah, okay, yeah, yes.

1683
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,880
Well I said yesterday, I would get it done before the podcast.

1684
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,560
I didn't get it done, but I'm going to do it as soon as the podcast ends, I'm going

1685
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,560
to go to the recording.

1686
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,560
Wherever I heard that.

1687
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,560
Shut the fuck up.

1688
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,560
All right, Ben.

1689
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,440
I was going to tell you that you need to tell the artists who are not done yet.

1690
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,120
It's just like, just be like, you have a week to finish it or you're getting cut.

1691
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:04,120
And just like, get somebody, I don't know, that's a reasonable tactic to have deadlines

1692
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,320
for which there are consequences.

1693
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,280
You know, I mean, literally at this point, they've had so much.

1694
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,320
I mean, it's like, well, it's got to be like, look, like the customers need the fucking

1695
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:18,160
comic, like you got to finish your shit or I fucking can't, I can't hold this thing

1696
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,160
back forever.

1697
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,200
You know, there has to be a cutoff somewhere.

1698
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:27,800
Yeah, at some point, and I guess so, but then that means I know who one of the artists

1699
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,680
is, and I know for a fact, they've done tons of other commission work in the time that

1700
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,360
they've owed you this comic.

1701
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,000
So I think you just need to tighten the noose around these kids a little bit.

1702
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,720
I know who they are.

1703
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,720
These child slaves.

1704
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,120
You've got to whip a little harder.

1705
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:46,000
I mean, Nexus has sent me like, you know, some artwork from Pages.

1706
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,760
I know that he's gotten at least some of it done.

1707
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,520
I'm just saying that he has also finished a bunch of other artwork since then.

1708
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,800
He's the one he's the he's the only one that I've seen positive proof that any work has

1709
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,040
been done on it at all.

1710
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,760
That I mean, I have seen.

1711
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,000
Oh, wait, wait, I'm not counting Gibbon and Cheezy who arrived.

1712
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,360
I have all of the artwork for the Cusomega book, and I haven't even launched the Kickstarter

1713
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,520
or paid anybody yet.

1714
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:17,240
I was thinking yesterday that, OK, if I do Vapors 3 Kickstarter, which I mean, I guess

1715
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:21,600
I will, like I'm going to just like not even launch the campaign.

1716
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,160
I'm going to contact the artist first.

1717
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,320
I'm going to write scripts.

1718
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:24,560
Good idea.

1719
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,840
Contact the artist first.

1720
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,640
Tell them, hey, I want you to make this for when I make the book.

1721
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,120
Right.

1722
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,680
And then once they're done, then I launch the Kickstarter.

1723
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,680
Reasonable, reasonable or something.

1724
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,480
That's the approach I took because I want to have.

1725
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,560
No, then I wait, but then I can't do them as stretch goals.

1726
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,560
Ah, that's fine.

1727
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,080
OK, never mind.

1728
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:42,920
I'll think about it.

1729
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,920
Yeah.

1730
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,480
The point is that this, yeah, obviously this structure has has my the way that I

1731
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,920
planned this one out had some shortcomings, which have may have become apparent.

1732
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,680
I think next time you've got to pick artists based on who is reliable instead

1733
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,480
of who you're friends with.

1734
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,280
Um.

1735
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,720
No.

1736
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,200
No.

1737
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,280
Unless you can trade those people to become those other people.

1738
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,560
Who is reliable except me and Cheesy?

1739
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,880
Who is reliable?

1740
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,880
Who is reliable?

1741
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,840
Who is reliable?

1742
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,040
I'm usually able to find reliable people.

1743
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,560
But again, part of it is you do have to turn the screws on them.

1744
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,040
Like, you know, I.

1745
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,960
I OK, I I have not.

1746
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,160
I have been very hesitant to turn any screws.

1747
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,960
So I mean, I so it's understandable.

1748
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,320
Like, you just got to I mean, I mean, since I mean, I guess I kind of thought,

1749
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,920
like, you know, I am paying them.

1750
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,880
Like I money is not a motivator for artists, though.

1751
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,960
They they have to be like, is it not, though?

1752
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,080
Because you have to think about money.

1753
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,720
It should be and everyone needs money.

1754
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,840
Think about why you don't do your work when you know that you need.

1755
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:56,880
The money, like it's because you have like 10 ideas that all are equally

1756
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,440
interesting and yeah, you might need the money, but will it be as emotionally

1757
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,560
satisfying as the other thing that you actually want to do today?

1758
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,760
Like if if you're in if you're not in the mentality that like you're going

1759
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,000
to do this comic, like you have to literally you have to get these people

1760
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,080
to in their minds set aside a day that they're going to do this.

1761
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,160
You have to be like, by this Saturday, you need to pick a day that you're

1762
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:21,080
going to draw this goddamn comic for me, you know, or weekend or something.

1763
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,120
Yeah, I mean, you're you're not wrong.

1764
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,400
You're not wrong.

1765
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,600
You know, I hate, you know, I wouldn't.

1766
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,960
I would never want to be like punitive about it.

1767
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,000
I would never want to be like, you failed me.

1768
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,040
Now die.

1769
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,240
But at a certain point, I mean, you get just, you know, said these things.

1770
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,320
Obviously, it's not your suggesting.

1771
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,200
With what? How many months, how many months has it been?

1772
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,440
Probably going on six.

1773
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,040
About three feet.

1774
01:14:54,040 --> 01:15:02,320
I mean, to be I mean, to be to be fair, I mean, there like around the time

1775
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:09,320
that I pledged around when I ran my campaign, another comic artist, Emily

1776
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,440
Rhee was running a Kickstarter as well.

1777
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,640
And I pledged to that one, like at the same time, like because I kind of knew her.

1778
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,120
Actually, she was one of the guest artists in the first book.

1779
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:23,400
But and like, you know, that is still being worked on.

1780
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:30,880
Also, I guess I should say that one had like had not even been like she's still

1781
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,040
drawing like drawing that one, right?

1782
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,160
But like, you know, these is still being drawn.

1783
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:35,720
I don't know.

1784
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,520
So like six months to deliver on a Kickstarter is not.

1785
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,920
OK, longer than I wanted.

1786
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:47,600
It's it's not ideal, but like it's not an unheard of length of time.

1787
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,280
I'm just saying in the time, your Kickstarter concluded, one of the guys

1788
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:58,840
on my Kickstarter did a two page comic and then a 12 page comic and

1789
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:04,000
this illustration all within the span of a month for a Kickstarter

1790
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,520
that is not even launched yet.

1791
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,160
So yeah, you know, it's all about the motivation, you know, if you don't

1792
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,000
want to give him only a week, give him two weeks.

1793
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,040
I mean, well, you got to get him in the right.

1794
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,880
Like, you know what?

1795
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,920
Here's the best way to do it, actually, even better.

1796
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,680
Don't even forget about all the ideas I had before.

1797
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:29,160
Invite them to do a draw call with you and draw the comics together.

1798
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:30,600
What?

1799
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,880
Like get them all into get everybody hang out and draw

1800
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,840
comics together and get them to do it that way so that they can just like.

1801
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,480
Oh, so they can like mutually pressure one another.

1802
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,240
Well, and also hang out and talk and have an like a social element

1803
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,440
to completing this comic that might make it more doable for them.

1804
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,960
You know, I don't know about a call, but that might be a good idea

1805
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,720
to have like a temporary discord so that you can bark, say, do your work

1806
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,000
and they're all there and like, I guess I was thinking more like a hang.

1807
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,840
Like everybody just hangs out for a couple of days, you know, talking

1808
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,640
and drawing their comics for like an artist's retreat.

1809
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:05,920
Right.

1810
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,560
Exactly.

1811
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,280
Like, like you've all like pretending as though you've all

1812
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:14,040
holed up in the same room to finish this comic together and they're not allowed

1813
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:14,880
to leave.

1814
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,440
Exactly.

1815
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,200
That's the main thing.

1816
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,440
I mean, personally, I find it like your company is so inviting, you know.

1817
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,760
We have beanbag chairs and standing desk.

1818
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,400
Exactly.

1819
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,040
And tea and mums.

1820
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,160
You've got mums.

1821
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:33,640
I personally find it very difficult to work when I'm in a call with people

1822
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,880
and I'm having fun.

1823
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,400
I'm the same.

1824
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,200
Actually, I don't know if that would exactly work for me.

1825
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,880
If there's complete silence, then maybe it works, but it's not usually

1826
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,680
complete silence.

1827
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,640
If there's complete silence, people stop leaving.

1828
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,320
Yeah.

1829
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,240
Yeah.

1830
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,040
The main thing, I don't know, whatever, fucking pressure.

1831
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,240
Like I'm doing with you right now, Ben.

1832
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:51,920
We're waiting on you.

1833
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,000
You are the X factor.

1834
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,120
Please produce thing.

1835
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:54,960
You say we're going to that.

1836
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:55,880
I mean, that works for me.

1837
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,480
Yes, yes, yes, I have it.

1838
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,280
I have it all up.

1839
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,080
I have the files.

1840
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,360
I like, I was, I was typing out the lyrics so I can refer to them as I record.

1841
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,640
If I have one overall piece of advice to come out of this, it's that artists

1842
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,720
are bitch mode and the only thing that can straighten out a bitch is hard cock.

1843
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,160
So you've got to really bend them over and you've got to just stick it in.

1844
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,480
And they'll learn to like it.

1845
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,080
Makes sense.

1846
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,160
Hey, hey, I have another public

1847
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,200
public rest for information, basically, because I don't know

1848
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,440
anybody who's far enough into it.

1849
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,520
I was talking about this on my stream the other day, but I'm just putting it

1850
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,720
out here for more people to hear the also, I really like we just had that

1851
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,520
whole conversation and probably all of them will hear it.

1852
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:35,920
Right.

1853
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,000
Which is that's good.

1854
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:37,480
It's good.

1855
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,800
I guess it's not a bad thing, but it's just fun.

1856
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
I just did your job for you, basically.

1857
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,080
So yeah, it's plus.

1858
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:43,640
All right.

1859
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,440
Here's my question.

1860
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,400
So there's a new Shantae game out, right?

1861
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,120
There's a new Shantae game out.

1862
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,880
I love one game in the Shantae series.

1863
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,880
The rest are mediocre to OK. Pirate's Curse.

1864
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,520
Pirate's Curse is my favorite.

1865
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,640
Yeah, it's great.

1866
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,920
It's I'm a huge fan of it.

1867
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,120
So there's a new one out Shantae and the Seven Sirens.

1868
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,280
I have, unfortunately, this is a public disclaimer slash question.

1869
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,120
We were doing research a little bit.

1870
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,560
No need for I was looking this up on my stream yesterday or whatever.

1871
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:15,080
And he said that he had deduced that the power ups that you get are like they do

1872
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,080
not do the movement synergy that makes Shantae and Pirate's Curse like my

1873
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,840
favorite game to just play and experience the movement mechanics ever better than

1874
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,480
Super Metroid, better than all other shit.

1875
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,160
It's the best.

1876
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:26,840
It's the best.

1877
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,800
And I heard that this new game, the Seven Sirens or whatever, just does not do that.

1878
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,800
I'm just curious.

1879
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,680
Does anyone who's played the game so far?

1880
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,720
Because it's been out for a while.

1881
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,440
Anyone care to comment who's actually played because I'm not going to play this

1882
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,560
game until I hear back from this question.

1883
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,760
If the answer is no, I'm just not going to play it because you're asking

1884
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,000
the commenters.

1885
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,080
Yeah, not not you people.

1886
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,680
Of course, I'm asking the commenters.

1887
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,720
This is a public request for information.

1888
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,960
Let me know.

1889
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,720
I will check the comments for that and the Star Trek shit about enterprise.

1890
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,800
Oh, I meant to post this visual aid.

1891
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,720
Pirate's Curse looks pretty good and never did get around to playing it.

1892
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,680
Pirate's Curse is great.

1893
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,200
Pretty good.

1894
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,680
He has pretty good, pretty good.

1895
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,920
Everyone should play Pirate's Curse.

1896
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,480
It's it's whatever.

1897
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,240
It's not perfect, but like the elements that are great are the best I've ever

1898
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,560
played. That's that's a shame, Nate, because I only play games that are

1899
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,840
objectively perfect.

1900
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,520
So such as Tetris Tetris might be objectively.

1901
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,480
Yes, I play Domino's.

1902
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:32,280
I call Domino's and ask for 20 pizzas delivered to your house and then run away.

1903
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,000
That's how I play Domino's.

1904
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,160
Oh, I never I never got around to finishing my point before.

1905
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,280
The reason I brought up the pins is because.

1906
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,160
All right.

1907
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:48,480
So when I use the old pin manufacturer for like the Vapors pins, all I had to do

1908
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,200
was make an image and they like converted it into a design file.

1909
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,520
These Chinese this Chinese company, they won't do that.

1910
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:00,560
I have to make give them a vector file, which I found a pretty not too difficult

1911
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,720
way to do that.

1912
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,560
It's it's a little finicky.

1913
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,800
I have to like convert a bitmap to a vector in a program called Inkscape.

1914
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,800
There is a function that can kind of do it automatically.

1915
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,760
I have to fuck with it a little bit sometimes, but like it's not it's not

1916
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,920
that hard, but so that's all was for the pins, right?

1917
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,640
So I had to do that for all the pins.

1918
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,480
It was kind of a hassle, but no big deal.

1919
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,920
But for the slime coin, have you seen the design for like the slime coin?

1920
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,080
No, I haven't checked back here.

1921
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,480
Well, this is what it's going to look like.

1922
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,960
That's very.

1923
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,960
Hmm.

1924
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,800
Is it good? It's very detailed.

1925
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:39,240
Yeah, it looks like like the sort of there's like a physical Bitcoin design.

1926
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,080
So so it looks like it's actually I haven't I haven't actually posted

1927
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,000
these final designs, but this is what it's going to look like.

1928
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,120
OK.

1929
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:50,680
And I made these right and like I had to take the Bitcoin logo

1930
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,800
and take the B off and like put these new designs on and sort of like

1931
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,800
fuck around with it to add in like the details that were missing

1932
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,600
from like removing the old piece.

1933
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:59,080
Right.

1934
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,920
And it was very a lot of detail out of fucking around, but whatever.

1935
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,400
It came out pretty good.

1936
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:03,920
Yeah, yeah.

1937
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:09,480
But then I realized this is like actually not a big file and OK.

1938
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,480
I want to stress like like this took me a lot of time to get this like just right.

1939
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,840
And I realized this is a small file.

1940
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,280
The resolution is low.

1941
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,160
I can't convert this to a vector.

1942
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:25,720
I have to remake this entirely as a vector.

1943
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:31,080
And I really don't know how like I do not know how to work in a vector program.

1944
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,920
So I don't know.

1945
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,240
I don't know if I even can.

1946
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:39,040
You know, my roommate was like he made a suggestion jokingly, but it was a great

1947
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,400
idea and I think I'm going to do it.

1948
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,240
I think I'm just going to go on Fiverr and like maybe look for someone

1949
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,800
and just pay someone to do it.

1950
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:51,440
That's not a bad idea because I would probably spend days learning how

1951
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:57,080
like to like do really like delicate operations in a vector image program.

1952
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,240
And then it would take me a really long time to actually produce the image

1953
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,360
once I figure that out.

1954
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,200
I'm all for that idea.

1955
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,120
I think it's a great idea.

1956
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,280
Yeah, so I might do that like tonight or something.

1957
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:08,800
I don't know.

1958
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:15,920
But yeah, that was a fucking that was a real headache that I was dealing with

1959
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,080
today this this week.

1960
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,760
Whenever I make a video just as a small example.

1961
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,040
And I realized that like I found a file.

1962
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,960
I was looking at a file recently of like old gameplay.

1963
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,280
It was just like a screenshot or something.

1964
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,560
And I was like, Oh, no, it's too low res.

1965
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,720
I have to now go to this particular part of this video game.

1966
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,400
Track down exactly when this line of dialogue is spoken and get like a

1967
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,960
high definition version.

1968
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:47,040
So I do my quest for like an hour and I don't really find much better stuff.

1969
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,800
It's just the Tizm, man, this damn Tizm.

1970
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,800
I hate low quality stuff when I know that better quality stuff exists.

1971
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,600
And then if it gets to a certain point, I will just have to

1972
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,920
capture things myself.

1973
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,080
But I mean, I can't justify playing like 20 hours of a game to get to one

1974
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,480
specific part for one little clip.

1975
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:06,800
Even though I'm sure I could get the highest quality footage that exists of

1976
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,760
this particular clip in the world, at least at least it's not on YouTube.

1977
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,360
Is it a game?

1978
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,840
Yeah, it was a game screenshot and I wanted that in higher resolution.

1979
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,040
So yeah, I would have to like you could try you could try looking through long

1980
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,360
plays. I've done that.

1981
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:23,960
I've done that.

1982
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,640
And I well, I won't say what game is for just whatever for fun.

1983
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,520
I'll let people speculate.

1984
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,840
But it's Final Fantasy 7.

1985
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,200
This particular game was from an old console.

1986
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,960
It wasn't Final Fantasy 7, it was something else.

1987
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,040
But whatever, it was from like an old console and there are multiple versions

1988
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,000
on different platforms.

1989
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,240
So like when you try to find one, there are different versions.

1990
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,360
I'm like, OK, do I want this one?

1991
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,000
Do I want this one?

1992
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,240
There are differences between them.

1993
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,080
Which one has this exact line of dialogue and there actually is differences

1994
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,800
between different versions that are released.

1995
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,200
So whatever, it doesn't matter.

1996
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:55,400
It's just whenever I deal with questions like that, it's a headache.

1997
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,320
And I have this unfortunate compulsion to get the highest quality stuff

1998
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,800
available and it bothers me if something's in like a lower quality that I could

1999
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,880
find. Actually, right now I have been replaying Final Fantasy 7.

2000
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,880
And so I talked before about like the the quest to get like, you know,

2001
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,200
like the mouth things fixed and like the best quality on PC that you can get.

2002
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,240
But there's actually there is like a thing I didn't do that I probably should

2003
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:22,160
have, which is like the CRT filter that makes it look kind of like

2004
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,400
better and more the way it was supposed to look on the original types of TVs.

2005
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:31,200
And I just didn't use it, but like I kind of want to and like recapture some stuff.

2006
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,120
I'm sorry, what game are we talking about?

2007
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,680
In this case, Final Fantasy 7, how like the PC version just has their polygon.

2008
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,560
So everything's like really blocky.

2009
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:43,200
But the backgrounds are are pixely because they were made that way originally.

2010
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:48,520
Those those like, you know, I played all those old those like PS

2011
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,240
was PlayStation Final Fantasies.

2012
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,960
I played them on the original PlayStation.

2013
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:57,360
I, you know, I'm not usually I'm not particularly fussed

2014
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:01,360
about like like visual fidelity or anything, but like the weird

2015
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:06,880
crispness sometimes of like those 3D, those like blocky 3D models rendered

2016
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:11,000
in like an HD screen on like on like a pre-rendered background.

2017
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,640
Like it looks really bad.

2018
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:17,360
And this is what CRT filters exist to fix so that they look more in the universe.

2019
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,960
And they do have a real purpose.

2020
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,560
They I'm playing it like right now, like Cloud's head is just like perfectly.

2021
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,040
Wait, oh, fuck.

2022
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:30,120
I don't there's a video it's from like a I think it's from a pretty big channel.

2023
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,200
So I feel like people would have seen it.

2024
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:39,400
But there's a video explaining why, like when you scroll in Mario 3,

2025
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,320
like the side of the screen has like a green line on it.

2026
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:43,920
You know what I'm talking about?

2027
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,800
I haven't seen that one.

2028
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,920
Yeah, I know that.

2029
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,840
Yeah, yeah, that's that's a thing, anesthing.

2030
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,640
Yeah, yeah, it's if you play like an emulator of Mario 3, you will see

2031
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,720
that like the right side of the screen, like as the screen scrolls,

2032
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,160
a little bit of it will just kind of be like green.

2033
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,680
And it turns out the explanation, it's something to do with the way

2034
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:05,000
that it draws the screen and the way that it like blocks out areas of the screen

2035
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,080
with like color palettes and can't do that on like the edge of the screen,

2036
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,520
like in mid scroll or whatever.

2037
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,960
Makes sense, makes sense.

2038
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,240
And it's just like a weird, persistent thing that like will constantly

2039
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,760
happen through the game is the very left right side of the screen

2040
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,720
will just have this weird discoloration to it as a program.

2041
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,040
And it's in the game details.

2042
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:25,040
It's really cool, but the but like the funny thing is about it.

2043
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,040
And this is like the reason why they they launched it that way.

2044
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,760
And like it was OK and it wasn't seen as a problem is that on an old

2045
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,440
CRTV, usually you just wouldn't see the edge of the screen.

2046
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,080
Like they have like sort of the black sort of border around them.

2047
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,160
And it would just be covered by the television you would play it on.

2048
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,480
Going back and playing like different versions of an oldish game.

2049
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:48,960
So like, yeah, like, like, like old media is like meant to be consumed

2050
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,600
in like a very specific way in like a lower res way.

2051
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,520
And like with something like Final Fantasy Seven,

2052
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,120
it just looks, it just makes so much more sense looking at it in like,

2053
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:02,200
you know, pixelated CRT fucking quality.

2054
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,200
That's probably like the only way that the creators

2055
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,920
like really saw it when they were playing.

2056
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,560
And like, sure, when they're designing the models,

2057
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,240
yeah, because they're thinking like this is how it's going to look.

2058
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,840
Yeah. And when someone's playing it, oh, OK, it looks good.

2059
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,760
Oh, wait, we're going to upscale it and high-res it and like increase the

2060
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,160
resolution and like suddenly the resolution of the models doesn't match

2061
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,840
the resolution of the backgrounds.

2062
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,600
The worst one is Final Fantasy nine has been done the most dirty by this process.

2063
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,480
Yes, I know I've seen that.

2064
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,080
It's really sad.

2065
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,120
I have the final.

2066
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:38,160
I think I've already said this, but I have the Final Fantasy nine PS one game

2067
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,200
physical just for that purpose.

2068
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:45,200
I saw it and I bought it because I knew the end like the the HD version was so bad.

2069
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,200
So I wanted to get the real experience.

2070
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:52,160
And luckily just fucking release it in just make it lower resolution.

2071
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,360
I mean, they would have to put to do that.

2072
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,880
They would have to like produce a like a CRT.

2073
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,920
But luckily the modding community, you could you could easily put a visual

2074
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,880
filter on the game that would just lower the resolution of like the backgrounds

2075
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,080
or the models or whatever, just so they fucking match.

2076
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:12,000
I would love that to be an in-game option that you can just tick and then done.

2077
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,720
Problem solved.

2078
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,600
Can't.

2079
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,600
Yeah, it can't be that hard.

2080
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,560
It's just because modders do it.

2081
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:22,720
It's it's certainly doable just like we talked about in the past, like GBA games

2082
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,440
were all really bright because the GBA had no backlight and was designed to be,

2083
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,880
you know, so like all these.

2084
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,640
It's really interesting to think about all these practical concerns that go

2085
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:34,040
into like engineering, a piece of technology to be used in very specific

2086
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,400
conditions. It's very cool.

2087
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,440
It's very cool.

2088
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,840
Specifically, GBA games.

2089
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:41,960
I've never been able to enjoy emulating games that I have.

2090
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,720
I only want to play them on my little GBA that I still have.

2091
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,520
I played a lot of GBA games on my PSP.

2092
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,360
I'm so used.

2093
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:47,920
Yeah.

2094
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:52,280
I'm so used to how it feels like the colors with the with the backlight

2095
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,400
it has, the SP.

2096
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,840
Good old SP.

2097
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,080
Best console ever made.

2098
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,480
Well, hey, I mean, I've said the things I came here to say.

2099
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,360
I told people my tale.

2100
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,240
I have one thing.

2101
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:06,760
Yeah, go for it.

2102
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,560
Digi.

2103
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,120
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

2104
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,800
I just have to address on the procrastinator's anonymous.

2105
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,160
I'm continually mocked for, oh, God, we're floundering.

2106
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:13,680
We're floundering.

2107
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,080
We got to get to the voicemails, guys.

2108
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,240
It's I'm losing my fucking mind.

2109
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,000
I can't stand the silence.

2110
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,360
That's how it should be when we get to the point that we're all like,

2111
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,840
I guess they've said everything we have to say.

2112
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,400
We go to the voicemails, right?

2113
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:27,960
I mean, I don't feel that that is a fair representation of what I do here

2114
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,720
on the procrastinators.

2115
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,200
I mean, if you do that, then we all do that.

2116
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,240
Well, yeah, I mean, is the is the is the claim that you're always

2117
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,080
the first one?

2118
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,640
Yes, that I rush to the voicemails.

2119
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,960
Usually when you say it, I agree.

2120
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:43,720
Well, there you go.

2121
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,880
You say I've been vindicated by Benz himself.

2122
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:52,040
Anyway, Digi, I was wondering, since you are transitioning.

2123
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2124
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,080
How are you going about the voice change?

2125
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,280
So like, I want to add to this.

2126
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,360
I want to add to this.

2127
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:05,800
I did mean to just say like, since everyone in the last episode was like,

2128
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,360
why isn't Digi on?

2129
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,120
I want to know.

2130
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,680
I was why isn't this the Digi Nay episode?

2131
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:14,960
Why don't we have Digi on to talk about being a girl or whatever?

2132
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,240
What's up with that?

2133
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,400
So I don't know.

2134
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,200
Put up put put their minds at ease.

2135
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,200
Like, I don't know any.

2136
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,000
Well, I don't know.

2137
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,760
I don't know what exactly there is to say about it.

2138
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:26,720
I mean, I ended up talking about it on the pub crawl that I did satisfy them.

2139
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,560
Yeah, if you guys really want to hear more, you can go listen to the pub crawl.

2140
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:35,160
But as for the voice feminization stuff, it's really complicated because like

2141
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,200
there's people are sending me guides and stuff and I'm looking into all that.

2142
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:43,240
And like, for me, it's not a matter of what I can or cannot do.

2143
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:52,680
It's a matter of, like, confidence and being like, like, it's very easy for me

2144
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,640
to do all kinds of effeminate voices.

2145
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:58,960
But it's like, this feels strange to talk to my friends, you know, like I it's.

2146
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,520
Sure, it's contextual.

2147
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:04,400
It's it's like, and I don't know what I want my voice to sound like.

2148
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,200
I don't know, like, long term.

2149
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:13,080
I think what I'm going to try to do is like find like voices that I want

2150
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:17,960
my voice to sound like and then just copy them, you know, and try to get try to get

2151
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,760
it down and then from, I mean, basically the same way I do everything else,

2152
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:25,360
I do artistically, you know, copy somebody else until you find your own voice, literally.

2153
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:30,720
So this would probably be the biggest artistic change in your in your content.

2154
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,200
Did you know it's funny because Twitter.

2155
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,840
Did you put like a voice filter on a on video?

2156
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:40,240
I put one on just the pub crawl video because I had recorded that before I was

2157
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:44,600
even attempting to do a voice and but I released it after I'd already put out

2158
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,240
other videos where I was attempting to do a voice and I didn't want to go back.

2159
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,400
So I like just pitch shifted it a little bit.

2160
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,840
But like, oh, but you won't.

2161
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,680
Well, OK.

2162
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,640
What were you going to ask?

2163
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,520
I was going to say, do you want to say anything about what you're doing

2164
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,760
with the lecture video?

2165
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,520
Because you said on Twitter that you're going all out with it.

2166
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,560
Yeah, well, I mean, I already was doing like heavier editing

2167
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,040
because I because of the fact that it has two cameras, there's like a lot of

2168
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:19,640
stuff I can do to, you know, enhance the dynamic between the two cameras

2169
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,000
when I cut back and forth between them.

2170
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,920
So I was like, I was having a lot of fun coming up star wipes.

2171
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,480
Gotcha.

2172
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,720
Yeah, I was having a lot of fun coming up with ways to fuck with the two

2173
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:32,480
camera stuff and I was getting pretty heavy into the editing before I went and

2174
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,760
did all the neuro typing stuff.

2175
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,720
And that's kind of what took me away from it for a while.

2176
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:43,160
But then I also want to add because the the Brony lecture, the way that I did

2177
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:51,440
it is it's it's kind of too dark and I want to add some levity back into it.

2178
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,240
So I'm going to add some.

2179
01:33:53,120 --> 01:34:00,120
I'm going to record like another segment as Digi-nay reflecting on the experience

2180
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:04,920
and sort of sharing the part that I don't think male Digi bro was comfortable

2181
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:09,320
talking about, I guess, you know, and like sort of evening out the odds to make

2182
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:13,400
it more nice because I really think in the lecture, the way that I did it, it's

2183
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,440
pretty fucking brutal.

2184
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:19,160
Like it's it's it's I've watched the whole thing and it's it's, you know, it's

2185
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:23,000
very aggressive towards the Brony community, even though I obviously got,

2186
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,640
you know, all of my friends, all my connections, everything I have now

2187
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,560
started there.

2188
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,640
So it's like to come out that negative towards it.

2189
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,840
I feel like it's just like a bit of was a bit overdone.

2190
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:39,760
And I'm my recollection now, I guess my recollection of it is that.

2191
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:46,400
Yeah, it's pretty hard on a couple of individuals who suck and maybe critical

2192
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,440
of the whole thing, but I don't I don't know.

2193
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,600
Was it that it's more hard on the whole thing?

2194
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,920
It's not so much that I was hard on it.

2195
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,920
I said the tone of the video is very dark.

2196
01:34:54,960 --> 01:35:00,600
Like the tone of it is like this, that like I have a lot of regrets and I have

2197
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,960
a lot of trauma related to this.

2198
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:05,040
And I think that for me, recording it was a way of getting a lot of that

2199
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,560
trauma off of my chest.

2200
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,120
And then like in retrospect, it's like, OK, well, now that I've said all that,

2201
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:14,840
like I can also address the nice things that like maybe I didn't feel maybe I

2202
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,280
just wasn't feeling as nice because I was dwelling on these things that I,

2203
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:22,000
you know, that had kind of troubled me about it, you know, and now that those

2204
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,960
now that I've expressed that, then it's like I can now go back and say more.

2205
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,440
But like, since I haven't released the video, why not just add that in, you know,

2206
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,000
and make it even more complete?

2207
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,480
So I'm not talking about adding like a ton of shit, but just like touching up

2208
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,520
certain areas where like I come down really hard on certain people or certain

2209
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,760
times and then kind of maybe show the other side of like, OK, well, you know,

2210
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,960
it was also like this.

2211
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,400
There were there were these things that happened to that I didn't bring up or

2212
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:52,160
didn't I don't even mention Derpy Hooves once in the whole lecture.

2213
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:56,480
So I had to add a whole section on her for one thing, like, OK, you know,

2214
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,880
OK, yeah, yeah.

2215
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,480
So yeah, just just stuff like that will be added in to to touch it up.

2216
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,120
But remember at the beginning of the things you can't say.

2217
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,080
Piece of the episode where Munchie and give did their little intro that was

2218
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:12,760
guys, please don't be mad at us for being on the episode.

2219
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:13,920
Don't don't be upset.

2220
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,960
We're we're still going to release the podcast where we say all the stuff.

2221
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,040
But don't blame us for it, please.

2222
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,120
I'd say.

2223
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,120
Well, whatever you think is good, everything works.

2224
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,920
You know what I have just remembered a little piece of shit.

2225
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,600
I am a fucking Alicorn Princess.

2226
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,280
Oh, yeah, I just remember that.

2227
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,760
It's it was the writing was on the writing was always on the wall.

2228
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,040
I mean, I was never subtle.

2229
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:40,720
I in my mind, I was never subtle about the idea that I just

2230
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:44,880
writing was we talked about we I think we talked about this in the

2231
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:49,600
discord or in some discord we talked about it always on the wall.

2232
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:55,560
The last episode, we did briefly touch on I I said, I was like, I didn't kick your

2233
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,680
ass. Hey, come here and say that.

2234
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,080
Hey, yeah. Mm hmm.

2235
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,360
Yeah, get fucked.

2236
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,520
Yeah, fucking bend you over.

2237
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:03,840
Well, here's the classic.

2238
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,440
I've never respected your opinion.

2239
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,040
So obviously you were a woman all along.

2240
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,640
Exactly. There you go.

2241
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:09,360
There's the classic.

2242
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,680
You're not the first, not the first, but it's still.

2243
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,600
Yeah, it is a classic.

2244
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:18,760
It's great. No, the thing I said last time was like, I I saw these things,

2245
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:22,440
but I didn't connect the dots and I didn't see it coming because I thought

2246
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:26,200
it was just sort of like an anime slash digi slash how it's funny to say

2247
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,320
gay things thing.

2248
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:30,480
I mean, all that's true as well, because that's the thing.

2249
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:34,920
Like, I mean, it's that's I think there's a lot of people who have looked

2250
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:38,720
at my situation and they're kind of going like, well, wait, I do all

2251
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:39,800
the same things you do.

2252
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,840
So like, am I also like harboring something deeper?

2253
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,400
That's a question for all of you to find out for yourselves.

2254
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,000
But like the for me, it's like.

2255
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:54,600
I don't think that the way that I've behaved is necessarily the way

2256
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,400
that comes the most naturally to me.

2257
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:01,320
It's the way that it's it's the way that, you know, cuts out the parts

2258
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:04,240
that are embarrassing, you know, like, like for me,

2259
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,120
if you listen to like old, old podcasts, like before I really started doing

2260
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:13,600
tons of podcasts, before I figured out like how to sound to make people

2261
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:18,000
think that I sound cool, like, you know, in older stuff, I don't have nearly

2262
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,080
as sure of a voice.

2263
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:22,360
I it sounds like I'm kind of making up a voice as I'm going.

2264
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,560
I burst into song all the time or say weird things.

2265
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,760
They're like, I'm not I just not as good at communicating because it's like

2266
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,560
to me, there's this fundamental disconnect in like how I see myself and how

2267
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,080
other people see me and that confusion makes it difficult to communicate, you

2268
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:42,640
know, and so it's like once I figured out what elements of myself can I put

2269
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:48,360
forward that make sense, you know, like as as being a bearded sunglasses,

2270
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:53,040
you know, hobo man living in his room, like what attitudes that I have are

2271
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,840
congruent with this character that I can put into the internet.

2272
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,240
Any elements that aren't congruent with that character.

2273
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:02,960
I just wouldn't display in, you know, in a public way or as the character

2274
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,880
of Digi bro, I would in my private life, you know, and obviously all of you

2275
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:12,080
know me more emotionally than like the other people online would, you know,

2276
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:16,600
like you you know more of what I'm like in person and and probably have, you

2277
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:22,280
know, probably know that I'm less logical as I come off in like podcasts and

2278
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:27,160
stuff, you know, that like my IRL personas is just like a lot more

2279
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,480
unhinged in a way.

2280
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:36,880
And that unhingedness in my mind has to do with the the like with being a girl,

2281
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,200
the right, right, just a total hysteria, hysterical.

2282
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:46,520
I literally like it's so you can't you because of the fact that gender

2283
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:51,360
really shouldn't exist as a concept or make sense, like, like, like because

2284
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:55,600
women, obviously there's no set of traits that is definitionally female, right?

2285
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,560
Like women could be could act any number of ways.

2286
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:05,000
However, to have an impression of what you think a woman is that like defines

2287
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,120
it for you, that like you relate to and then you kind of project the idea that

2288
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:14,320
like, OK, you know, that is how a woman behaves.

2289
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:18,360
And you can you can confirm it by, you know, knowing enough women to know

2290
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:23,160
that overall, yeah, most women do be that way, you know, like for me,

2291
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:26,800
gender realism makes me feel like more of a woman is basically what I'm trying

2292
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:31,480
to say, like the more people say like, oh, this is how a woman acts, not a man.

2293
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:35,920
I go, well, that's how I act, you know, so it's right.

2294
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:43,640
Yes, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha in in in so in so far as the as the role

2295
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:47,800
is is, you know, socially constructed, right?

2296
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,320
That's the one that is more of a yeah.

2297
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,120
And that's why it makes more sense to me.

2298
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:56,720
Like because and the rejection for me as a kid is like, you know, people

2299
01:40:56,720 --> 01:41:00,280
just told me I was a girl as a kid and I thought of it as you are

2300
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,880
categorically wrong because I'm not a girl.

2301
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:07,440
However, now I'm kind of thinking of it the opposite way that like I was wrong,

2302
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:12,080
that like they were more correct to think of me as a girl because I would

2303
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,840
have fit better into society as a girl.

2304
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,360
Like if I had embraced my tendencies and my way of thinking and thought and

2305
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:23,000
like just decided to agree with everybody else and just say, oh, OK,

2306
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,640
you guys all say I'm a girl than I am, things would have gone more smoothly for

2307
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:32,840
me, I think, you know, like, I think it was the hassle of trying to trying

2308
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:36,200
to put distance from from that, like trying to say, oh, I'm not a girl,

2309
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,640
I'm a boy, I like boy things.

2310
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:42,080
But then like utterly failing at all aspects of manhood, you know, like,

2311
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:45,320
that's the that's the tragedy of my life.

2312
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:48,720
You know, here's an interesting thought that I saw online.

2313
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,520
There was a there was an interesting post one pedantic romantic that I thought

2314
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,360
was intriguing.

2315
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,880
And I don't know, I was curious what your thoughts might be.

2316
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:01,360
I saw I saw Pedro say like something like gender.

2317
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:04,480
What was it? Gender confusion is not a choice.

2318
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,840
Gender dysphoria is not a choice.

2319
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:10,840
Being trans is a choice because it's a community thing.

2320
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,480
It was like something to that effect.

2321
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,880
Yeah. And I was like, I kind of see the point.

2322
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,320
Yeah, I would agree with that.

2323
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:20,760
Like in my mind, it's like, even though I've always had this and this is why

2324
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,120
I thought gender fluidity was such a great term for me, because it's like I

2325
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:28,600
can I can be a woman on my own time or in my own mind and still be a man

2326
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,120
and project that outwardly.

2327
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,960
And yeah, I would agree that, like, I mean, plenty of trans people who in

2328
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,640
their minds, they're like, I am a woman.

2329
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:39,000
They choose to represent themselves as male because they are just not

2330
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,040
comfortable doing it the other way.

2331
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,760
You know, like the unknown Otaku is an example of that.

2332
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:47,400
Like identifies as a woman does not attempt to sound like a woman

2333
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,280
because she's not comfortable doing that, you know?

2334
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,400
But like I and I totally get that.

2335
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:57,760
But for me, it's like, well, to me, that just makes it even more confusing

2336
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,560
for people, right?

2337
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,880
Like if I go and tell you, oh, I'm a girl.

2338
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,320
And then I act completely like a guy.

2339
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,680
You're like, well, why what the hell is the point?

2340
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:10,240
You know, it's like if I to me, it's like I'm not changing my behavior

2341
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,160
to act more feminine.

2342
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,640
I'm just acting more true to myself, you know?

2343
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:18,360
It's like whatever whatever seems like a new behavior is just behavior

2344
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:22,280
that I used to have back when I was a teenager that I, you know, curbed

2345
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,160
in order to not seem this way, you know?

2346
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:28,680
And like to some degree, I think that everybody is obviously curbing

2347
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,560
some of their behavior.

2348
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:32,320
I'm not going and saying every thought that comes into my head or else I'd

2349
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,280
be typing kill yourself 300 times a day.

2350
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,160
But like sometimes I do and I just had to delete it each time.

2351
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:44,960
But like, you know, the but like there's there's different levels

2352
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,000
of holding yourself back.

2353
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,640
You can be and everybody has a comfort zone, you know?

2354
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:54,640
And like, I think that my comfort zone was to act more masculine

2355
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:58,880
because it means that I don't have to address this issue, you know?

2356
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,800
And I came to a point in my life where I was like, not addressing this issue

2357
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,360
is causing me more problems than addressing this issue would, I think.

2358
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,720
So let's go ahead and start working on it, you know?

2359
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,400
And that's where I'm at now.

2360
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,960
Things have been going great because, you know, when you come out as trans,

2361
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,080
you get a lot of support from that community.

2362
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:21,320
So regardless of what they think your other takes are, so that's been helpful.

2363
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,040
Now, stop asking for the Digine episode in the comments here.

2364
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:33,520
I mean, it was just one episode, but I, you know, I was thinking about,

2365
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,200
you know, it's just I saw it coming.

2366
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:38,880
I was like, oh, God, now that this has happened, the comments are all going

2367
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,720
to be like, where did he, why isn't she on to talk about the thing that she said?

2368
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,600
And it was true.

2369
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:51,680
I could, you animals, you fucking animals, you thugs in the, you thugs in the comments.

2370
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,200
We should put you all down.

2371
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:57,000
We should be using live rounds because you're all, you're so predictable.

2372
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,600
All right, let's go to the voice mail.

2373
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,200
Yeah, I was, I was going to fucking say something.

2374
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:08,760
All right, I was thinking about like gender and the idea of dysphoria, all of it.

2375
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:12,000
Oh, and how you're a secret training, you're a secret trans, right, give?

2376
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,560
That's right.

2377
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,840
No, no, no, no, no.

2378
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:27,280
No, the sex as in, like, sex as in like gender, not gender, the sexual organs is

2379
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:32,560
like the difference and the gender is like all of the societal things that are

2380
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:38,800
associated with one sex over the other that have been built over time to be,

2381
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:41,040
you know, whatever is currently the case.

2382
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:46,600
Like the reason men have short hair is probably because we fought, the men fought

2383
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:49,680
the wars for like thousands of years and long hair gets in the way.

2384
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,480
Particularly once you started using guns.

2385
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,440
That's, I think, when short hair became like a masculine trait.

2386
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,080
Yeah, so it's like things like that.

2387
01:45:57,080 --> 01:46:01,040
They're not necessarily male or female, but they have become symbols of this or

2388
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:05,320
that clothing, you know, skirts used to be female.

2389
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:09,880
I mean, they still are, but like trousers used to be exclusively male stuff like that.

2390
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:15,760
And I was thinking the idea of people being gender dysphoric is entirely based

2391
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:21,200
on how society pressures people to be a certain.

2392
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:26,160
I mean, ideally there would be no, this just wouldn't be like your sex would

2393
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:30,520
just be something that, you know, categorically is, is like something that

2394
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:33,520
you can write down for like medical reasons, but just doesn't matter.

2395
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:38,240
And I mean, again, there are tendencies that your sex is more likely to bring you

2396
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:42,320
towards. It's just like, it's a matter of we look at things prescriptively

2397
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:43,480
instead of descriptively.

2398
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:48,600
It's like, if you are describing that most women act a certain way, that's fine.

2399
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:52,720
If you're saying therefore this is how women behave, that's where the problem

2400
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:59,640
lies, you know, and like when you, when you like as a child, you know, only really

2401
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:02,080
have a certain impression.

2402
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:06,920
It's like, for me, I only really started to kind of find any sort of answer

2403
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:11,480
and like why, why do I feel this way when I, when I started to find out that

2404
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:14,400
like gender identity is apparently developed when you're like three or four.

2405
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:20,160
And like you start identifying the idea that there's like men and women

2406
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:23,240
when you're like two or three, like you figure out that there are two different

2407
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:27,520
ones and then you figure out which one you are before you could explain this at

2408
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:32,080
all before you have any reason to like, you know, to like choose one of the

2409
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:36,760
other. And so I think that a lot of men who deal with gender identity issues are

2410
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:42,960
ones who, you know, are just like had way more female presence in their life

2411
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,320
than male and like struggle to figure out how to be male.

2412
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,080
And there are two different roads that this can kind of go down where either

2413
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:55,520
you really want to be a man and so you need to find male role models and be

2414
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,480
more manly and you learn how to do that.

2415
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:03,200
Or on the other hand, it might be if you're like me, that you never really

2416
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:07,720
admire anything masculine and just end up admiring more and more feminine things

2417
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:12,120
as you go down, you know, as you grow older and, and start to wonder like, oh,

2418
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,360
maybe I should just like, maybe I relate to that better.

2419
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:20,120
And like, again, calling myself a woman or saying like, you know, call me,

2420
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:24,880
she, her pronouns or using a different voice is really less a matter of like,

2421
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:28,880
I need you to do that in order for me to recognize myself.

2422
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:32,560
It's more, there is some degree of that for now, at least, but like,

2423
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:36,640
it's more that like, if you were to think of me as a woman,

2424
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:41,480
I think you'll understand my actions better in just a general sense because

2425
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:45,680
of the cliches, because of the fact that I act like a stereotypical girl.

2426
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:50,400
It would make more sense to think of me as that, you know, and like, and that's

2427
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,120
what I hope. So, and it's funny because like in my mind, it's just as simple as

2428
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:57,160
flipping a switch of just like, which one you're calling yourself, you know,

2429
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,760
oh, I'm calling myself a girl. So that's what I am.

2430
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,160
Please think of me as that.

2431
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:05,480
And for nobody else is it that simple as obviously your mental image of Digi

2432
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:08,360
Bro is bearded man. So it's like, how do I turn,

2433
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,800
how do I turn that mental image into this,

2434
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,240
this picture I have on Twitter of how I feel like I look, you know,

2435
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:20,040
how do I physically or even just in audio or even just in art, you know,

2436
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:23,840
if I, if I got to a point where I didn't want to show my face at all, you know,

2437
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,120
like, how would I convey to you that this is what you're supposed to think I look

2438
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:28,960
like, you know?

2439
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:36,960
Yeah, I was having similar, like, well, not similar to you specifically,

2440
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,200
but just like the, it brought on like questions that I was asking.

2441
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:45,800
And ultimately, I think it's really just that I have things that I like in both

2442
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:52,560
gender areas. And so like, there's no reason for me to pick one over the other.

2443
01:49:53,880 --> 01:50:00,320
Or to like, you know, like make it like, even if I lean more heavily to one side

2444
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:03,960
than the other, that doesn't mean I should like do anything about it.

2445
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,640
It just means I have a lot of varied interests and some of them aren't masculine.

2446
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:10,640
Definitely. And that's just, yeah, that's, that's just how it is.

2447
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:17,760
I was thinking the old, the old line, the old line is like, um, I, oh, I, you know,

2448
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,960
why, why is any, why you gotta, why is anyone got to pick one or the other?

2449
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:27,120
Well, you know, I don't feel like, I don't insist on any pronouns or anything.

2450
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,040
I don't feel like a man or woman.

2451
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,200
I just feel like me.

2452
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,440
And I always felt that way.

2453
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:34,720
I always was like, yeah, I'm with that.

2454
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:37,240
But is the logical conclusion of that?

2455
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:41,320
Like, oh, we should all, we should all be, we should all be pronoun.

2456
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,640
We should all put any pronouns in our bio.

2457
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:46,800
I don't know if everyone is, is just themselves.

2458
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:48,040
A large part, maybe.

2459
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:53,800
I would just love to just banish genderedness from the language specifically because it's

2460
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:54,840
a real shame.

2461
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:59,480
It's a real shame that we're saddled with this, like, yeah, we are with the gender

2462
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,920
binary in our language, purely linguistic.

2463
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:06,320
And I would love like an accident of history that is like annoying because I just want

2464
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,840
to operate in the world, just not offending anybody.

2465
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:11,440
And I really just want to do my own shit.

2466
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:16,120
But yeah, the language itself forces you to some degree to, to like take positions.

2467
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,800
And it's very unfortunate.

2468
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,600
It's very unfortunate.

2469
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:19,080
It isn't.

2470
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:19,880
Yeah, it is.

2471
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:22,040
We think it could be worse.

2472
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:23,400
It could be a game design.

2473
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:24,120
Spanish, Spanish.

2474
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:27,160
Literally, you can't even fucking finish a sentence without the gender.

2475
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:28,960
Oh, yeah.

2476
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:34,840
You can't use every single word has a gender of your like bridge or your like, uh,

2477
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:39,680
uh, like bridges are masculine, uh, tables of feminine, like all these weird things.

2478
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:42,040
And like, I like, I put it out in Europe.

2479
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:47,520
I get, I think gender has a usage, like in culture, to like, culturally

2480
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:51,160
be useful as like, you know, people kind of orbit around these sorts of traits in

2481
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:53,680
general, you know, okay, there's, there's utility to that.

2482
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:56,600
But then of course, because it's not a perfect system, there's all kinds of

2483
01:51:56,600 --> 01:52:00,200
complications that come up and now we're, we're dealing with one of many of them.

2484
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,520
I don't know, man.

2485
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:02,480
We'll just see how it goes.

2486
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:06,760
I mean, they're, they're based on patterns that, that do exist.

2487
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:07,200
Right.

2488
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:10,800
And, um, they're based on patterns, but they are cringe.

2489
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,280
Men typically better just, you know, across the board.

2490
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:18,600
Yes, the better, and we're winning the war as far as I'm concerned.

2491
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,480
But where will we be without our underclass?

2492
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,680
You know, we'd have no one to, to feel better than.

2493
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,920
So they're important as well.

2494
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:28,640
Thanks.

2495
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,360
Thanks guys.

2496
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,760
Uh, hey, update on the hand situation.

2497
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,000
Yeah.

2498
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,560
Tingling.

2499
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:34,200
We've been waiting for it.

2500
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:34,800
Subcited.

2501
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,200
Subcited.

2502
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,520
Oh, that's hell yeah.

2503
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,880
It was just a sound board, mate.

2504
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:41,280
After all, hit that celebratory sound board.

2505
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,280
I will eat your ass.

2506
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:48,880
Thank you, Alex.

2507
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,080
Eleazar, mix that in.

2508
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:51,680
Put that in.

2509
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:52,280
Thank you.

2510
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,480
Over, over what I said, please just mix that in as well.

2511
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:56,960
All right.

2512
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:02,520
Well, hey, I got, I've got, the audience has asked and I have delivered a humble

2513
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:06,760
two voicemails, one of which I could, I mean, I didn't need to play, but I thought,

2514
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:10,400
hey, there's two, we can afford to play one, which was, I thought we'd give an

2515
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:13,920
opportunity to the man who left 16 voicemails last time.

2516
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:16,080
And this is just his, uh, okay.

2517
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,560
So speak by people linked down below, leave voicemails.

2518
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,520
I think I am upping my standards in real time.

2519
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,560
So I think I'm generally playing less.

2520
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,480
It's don't, don't really need that many, but okay.

2521
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:25,920
Here we go.

2522
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:29,720
So this is, uh, hear me out, promise I'll cut it.

2523
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:30,520
Okay.

2524
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,280
And go.

2525
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:32,160
Okay.

2526
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,000
Hold on, hear me out.

2527
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:33,720
I know what you're thinking.

2528
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:37,360
And the last voicemail I sent, I was like, yo, this is the only one I'll do for a

2529
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:41,880
little bit, but in the last episode, you said I could do three.

2530
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:44,760
So let's just have this compromise at two.

2531
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:48,160
This is, I'll, I'll, you know, lay it off for another like week or so.

2532
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:48,880
Why do we need three?

2533
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:49,120
I don't know.

2534
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:49,760
Hear me out.

2535
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,720
This is why, uh, I sent a lot of voicemails and shit.

2536
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:56,960
I mean, I didn't even realize it was like 16, but it's basically just cause I have

2537
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:01,760
no friends that like the stuff I like, cause I have friends, but they don't.

2538
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,440
I like, I share not that many common interests with them and stuff.

2539
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:09,240
So, and then I like talk to you, uh, I not really talk to you.

2540
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:11,760
I like send voicemails to you about shit I'm thinking about.

2541
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,800
And then you can actually like talk about it.

2542
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:18,880
Cause, uh, you know, you mostly share like a decent amount of common interests with

2543
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:22,280
me, just throughout all the members of the PCP and stuff.

2544
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,280
And, uh, it got to my head.

2545
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:28,360
Like I was just like, man, if I just send like 20 voicemails, I'll get featured in

2546
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:33,200
like three of them, but I should have been thinking like, oh, yeah, I should send

2547
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,960
like really good voicemails.

2548
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:35,760
Like, I don't know.

2549
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,160
Yeah.

2550
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,400
You know, and then I get featured all of them.

2551
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:40,800
Uh, yeah.

2552
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,160
But I, I, you know, I didn't do that.

2553
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,040
Hey, hey, man.

2554
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:46,120
So, um, I'll try to fix it in the future.

2555
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:46,360
All right.

2556
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:46,800
That's enough.

2557
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,120
And, uh, all right.

2558
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:48,720
Yeah, I don't know.

2559
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:49,240
I understood, I understood.

2560
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:49,480
Thank you.

2561
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:49,560
Yeah.

2562
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:50,600
Shoot me a DM.

2563
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:54,560
I'll let you into my now free Discord server and you'll be able to talk to

2564
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,400
some people with similar interests.

2565
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,520
Join Pansu Party's Discord server too.

2566
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,240
Be aware of that parasocial relationship that you've been with there.

2567
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:04,240
That was the worst voicemail I've ever heard.

2568
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,120
Voice jail, voice jail.

2569
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:08,440
That's not, that's the worst excuse.

2570
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:10,160
I mean, I'm, I'm so, I get it.

2571
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:11,200
I get it.

2572
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:11,520
Yeah.

2573
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:13,160
But like, come on.

2574
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,600
I know it doesn't excuse.

2575
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:15,800
Okay.

2576
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,440
I mean, hey, I chose to play him, but he left far too many.

2577
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,920
By the way, this person doesn't have a name and that bothers me.

2578
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:23,080
I want to give him a name, uh, because he's not.

2579
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:23,920
I feel like I've heard that.

2580
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:25,200
Tiny Tim.

2581
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,000
Tiny Tim.

2582
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:26,200
There.

2583
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:26,480
Okay.

2584
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:26,920
There it is.

2585
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:27,960
You're tiny Tim now.

2586
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,000
Congratulations.

2587
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:30,960
The smallest man I've ever seen.

2588
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,840
Uh, I let him off the hook for that one.

2589
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:34,600
That wasn't that bad.

2590
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:39,400
I just, it's, it's, I mean, if he doesn't have anyone to join my friends,

2591
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,480
don't share my interests.

2592
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:46,400
So I'll just send, I'll just send my thoughts to the procrastinator's podcast.

2593
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:49,760
I feel, I feel like he's learned his lesson because Nate yelled at him.

2594
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:50,280
Sure.

2595
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:55,320
But, um, don't, I mean, don't be like this.

2596
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:57,560
You know, we, we haven't, we've had a redemption arc here.

2597
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:57,960
I hope.

2598
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,840
Tim is wrong.

2599
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:05,440
Like it's, it's not like a, it feels like you're forming a strong parasocial

2600
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,040
relationship with the PCP.

2601
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,320
I gotta say, yes, my thoughts as well.

2602
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:11,000
Try, try not to do that.

2603
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,840
You can send questions if you have something you want us to discuss,

2604
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,960
but I would encourage instead to go to the discords.

2605
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,360
Go to patreon.com slash the procrastinator's $5 bonus episodes and the discord.

2606
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:30,360
Go, go, go to bug saints wormhole and, and talk about how we need and talk about

2607
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,680
how we need a communist revolution.

2608
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:39,160
And we also need to elect Michelle, uh, you know, uh, for, uh, for, for

2609
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:40,240
um, buds, what's the word I'm looking for?

2610
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:43,640
Isn't there a word for like a fat queen or like, uh, what am I thinking?

2611
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,560
Oh, size queen.

2612
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,480
We don't like the size queen.

2613
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,320
That's, that's the word I was looking for.

2614
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:48,720
Okay.

2615
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:50,680
I thought a little bit.

2616
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,360
She's a size queen too.

2617
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:52,680
That's all.

2618
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,560
Yeah, that's, that's good.

2619
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:54,680
Uh, okay.

2620
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:55,600
Well, he's been set straight.

2621
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:57,640
Tiny Tim, thank you for your call.

2622
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,040
Uh, don't do it again.

2623
01:56:59,160 --> 01:56:59,520
All right.

2624
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,320
We're going for quality now.

2625
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,760
The set of standard has been set.

2626
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,160
There you go.

2627
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:03,760
Okay.

2628
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,200
How many more?

2629
01:57:04,240 --> 01:57:07,040
This was the one, one other, and this is it.

2630
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:12,040
And this, this was the best voicemail so take, you know, keep that in mind and

2631
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:13,600
let that affect your perceptions.

2632
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:14,040
Okay.

2633
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:17,360
This is the long awaited chronicles of an American hero.

2634
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,080
Part two.

2635
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:19,040
Remember part one?

2636
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:19,800
I, I remember.

2637
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:20,720
No, I laughed.

2638
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,320
Okay.

2639
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,920
Well, could you refresh me?

2640
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:27,200
Uh, he just had a crazy story about a school shooting only was at his house.

2641
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,040
I think the cops rated, it was a funny story.

2642
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:31,720
It was a linguistic masterpiece.

2643
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,560
That's all I remember.

2644
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,840
Uh, but let's let him take it away with part two.

2645
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:35,440
Go.

2646
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,080
It's Saturday morning.

2647
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:40,960
I've zoomed over to the local shopping mall where I'm enjoying the high

2648
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:45,600
life, smoking crystal meth behind the dumpster of an anti-empt pretzel shop with

2649
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:50,360
my anime body pillow, a far better companion than a lowly piece of garbage.

2650
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,120
Two D girl.

2651
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:55,000
After my scheduled smoke break, I head back to stone the haters doing

2652
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,840
cake flips on my sick ass skateboard down the stairs and I head to the central

2653
01:57:58,840 --> 01:57:59,360
plaza.

2654
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:04,760
There I see the worst threat to America at large, a large person in a

2655
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:07,360
Chuck E cheese mascot suit.

2656
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:10,080
Recognizing him as a ploid than Dr.

2657
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,960
Nate, young children to a degenerate furry lifestyle.

2658
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:17,520
I throw him into a fountain water bordering him as I pull him out of the

2659
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:22,040
water for a short reprieve and he pleas for mercy through his cold, dead, on

2660
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:25,720
excise, deep black, like the police lineup for a drive by shooting in the

2661
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:26,960
gang lands of Chicago.

2662
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:31,720
I deny his cries and dunk him in again, melting him into the ether as my

2663
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,720
meth strength bulges through my veins.

2664
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,440
Another job well done.

2665
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,920
Yeah, that's it.

2666
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,360
All right.

2667
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:38,800
Great.

2668
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:40,400
Thank you.

2669
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:40,880
All right.

2670
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:41,320
Thank you, sir.

2671
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:41,800
All right.

2672
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,320
I like the part about the story.

2673
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,280
Met strength was my favorite part.

2674
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,480
No doubt killed the mouse dissolving the ether.

2675
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,520
Fantastic.

2676
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:48,800
All right.

2677
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:49,320
Well, there you go.

2678
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,800
That's all the voice melts today.

2679
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:51,680
See, see people.

2680
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:52,680
I'm taking feedback.

2681
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:55,480
I appreciate the, uh, the input, uh, close your eyes.

2682
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:59,160
Imagine the bugs, imagine them, imagine them crawling all over you,

2683
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:01,960
all into your wormhole, dissolve.

2684
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:04,360
Uh, I believe more.

2685
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:08,800
Hey, of quality at speak pipe link, uh, down below, those cucks are still

2686
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,920
letting us record more.

2687
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:11,600
I haven't emptied it at all.

2688
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:13,600
This is absolutely embarrassing.

2689
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,960
It's like that one episode of Bible black that I don't we're basically,

2690
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,800
we're basically looting them and it feels great.

2691
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:22,720
It's like that one episode of Bible black that I always skip on a rewatch

2692
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:26,120
where they do the inflation and they fill, uh, professor.

2693
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,680
Could not, could not be the redhead.

2694
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:31,480
They fill it with water and it's way gross and I'm not into that.

2695
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:32,440
So I don't watch that.

2696
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:35,880
I don't know about you, but episode three, no thanks.

2697
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,480
Uh, it's not like that at all.

2698
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:41,640
It's the way the speak pipe is filled with excellent voice males.

2699
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:44,520
It's favorite episode of Bible black.

2700
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:45,400
Where's that episode four?

2701
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:46,320
I was confused the two.

2702
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:46,600
Okay.

2703
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,800
In any case, um, no, you're just feigning.

2704
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:49,320
You don't know.

2705
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,000
I would never.

2706
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:50,440
Oh, yeah.

2707
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:51,440
To cover your tracks.

2708
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,720
Uh, well, okay.

2709
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:54,920
Hey, Twitter updates.

2710
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,840
Uh, more Rikon stuff.

2711
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:56,360
We're working on it.

2712
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,720
Twitter there at TB.

2713
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,600
Crasinators on Twitter.

2714
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,400
Speak pipe.

2715
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,040
You already said that.

2716
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:01,600
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

2717
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:05,320
There will be a new bonus episode out by the time you hear this guns versus

2718
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:05,880
swords.

2719
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:11,400
We settle the debate at long last who's, uh, one, who's next.

2720
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,680
You decide salvage your slaughter.

2721
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,760
Guns versus swords on that episode.

2722
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:16,520
Was Jesse there?

2723
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:16,760
Yeah.

2724
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:18,880
I think it was you, me, Digi and Jesse.

2725
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:19,520
If I remember correctly.

2726
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:19,880
Yeah.

2727
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:21,360
That's like the first bonus episode on.

2728
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,560
I've been on like two years and like a year or two.

2729
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:23,840
Yeah.

2730
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:24,160
Yeah.

2731
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,240
But, uh, but there it was.

2732
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:28,040
And, uh, what a good time was had by all.

2733
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,080
Actually, that was a good episode.

2734
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:29,240
Ever.

2735
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,800
You should legitimately go listen to it.

2736
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,640
It was, uh, it was a topic episode like the olden days.

2737
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,760
So give it a, give it a shot.

2738
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:36,000
Five dollars.

2739
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:36,760
What a steal.

2740
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:38,400
And, uh, whatever.

2741
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:38,800
Fuck it.

2742
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:39,280
That's it.

2743
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,080
That's all you get.

2744
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:41,960
I couldn't do this for 10 minutes longer.

2745
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:42,760
Easy.

2746
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,280
Well, I'll let you off the hook.

2747
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,120
Uh, all right.

2748
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:45,600
That's it.

2749
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,400
BCP episode done.

2750
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:48,320
Thanks for listening.

2751
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,080
We'll be back next week and we'll do more shit.

2752
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,120
I feel another tingle.

2753
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:52,640
I feel another tingle on my finger.

2754
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:53,440
Oh no, it's gonna die.

2755
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:53,960
Oh god.

2756
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:54,800
I'm gonna die right now.

2757
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:55,280
Oh god.

2758
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:56,240
Terraria, I'm coming.

2759
02:00:56,240 --> 02:00:59,000
Someone call the freaking, call the freaking, call 911.

2760
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,640
Call the fucking, uh, I can't believe it.

2761
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:02,160
No, don't.

2762
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:03,200
Uh, they're busy.

2763
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,640
I'm gonna die live on air at the moment, at the moment this episode ends.

2764
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,400
Continue, please.

2765
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,320
Uh, thanks everybody.

2766
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,160
We'll see you next week.

2767
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,360
Goodbye.

2768
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,160
Bye.

2769
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:12,480
Bye.
