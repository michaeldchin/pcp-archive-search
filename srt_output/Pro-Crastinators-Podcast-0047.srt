00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,460
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,420
I am the best guy ever, send all your money to patreon.com slash best guy ever.

3
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,420
There's also these other people, but don't send them money, here's The Davoo.

4
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,420
Hi.

5
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:45,420
There's Endless Jess, Ohio fuck, Mumkey Jones.

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,140
Hey guys, don't tell Nate but I'm hiding under the table.

7
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,980
That's an original meme, and Digibro is here.

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,980
Hey, what's up buddy?

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,980
Hey, thanks for being here.

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,980
Alright, hey guys.

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,140
It deserves mention that we were going to have Ben on this episode, but Ben spontaneously

12
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,980
re-grew his virginity and couldn't be here.

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,180
This is mature men only, there's no room for it.

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,780
I think we decided to rule, what was it, if you go for, I think we said six months without

15
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,460
having sex, you re-grow your virginity, it just comes back, right?

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,060
That time frame is completely, first of all, it was, I think it was like two years or something.

17
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,060
It was one year.

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,060
One year.

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
One year.

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
I don't know.

21
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,060
It's second of all, I'm thinking more like five minutes.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,860
I can't be on this episode if we keep this rule in place.

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,460
That means that if you space it out strategically, you can lose your virginity every six months

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,460
for the rest of your life.

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,460
That's right.

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,460
Oh shit, that's the goal.

27
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,300
That's the perfect life.

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,740
Time out Nate, what's all this virginity talk, what is this episode even about?

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,940
This episode is about virginity.

30
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,940
That's what the episode is about.

31
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,940
It's a weird topic.

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,940
The lack thereof.

33
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,860
The lack thereof, that's true, that's true, because every man in this call has in fact

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,540
lost his virginity, though he may have grown it back at some later point.

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,540
That's what this is about, losing your virginity?

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Yeah.

37
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,540
Yeah.

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Well shit, okay, sorry guys, I didn't mean to waste your time.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,540
He actually dropped out of the call.

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Okay.

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,540
Hey, I'm back.

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,340
Did you lose your virginity just now?

43
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,340
I ran off to fuck junkie and now I'm back.

44
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,340
Okay, great.

45
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,340
That's fantastic.

46
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,940
So we're thinking about doing this just round Robin style, telling stories.

47
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,340
I mean, I'd like to talk about virginity itself at some point, but it's more fun to

48
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,540
just talk about the fucking story.

49
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,340
We're all such funny guys, you know, it's no wonder we've all had sex.

50
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Yeah.

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
We're so charming.

52
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:51,140
You should see me on my A game, dude, with my van outside the back of the club, you

53
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,740
know, a woman comes out for a cigarette, I entice her with magic tricks and sleight

54
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,340
of hand, and then I clock her on the head with a bowling ball, get her in the fucking

55
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
van and bam, that's how you lose your virginity.

56
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
Wasn't she already enticed?

57
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,340
Why did you have to clock her out?

58
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,340
It's a complex dance.

59
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
You wouldn't understand.

60
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
Believe me.

61
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,340
It's a back and forth.

62
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
They want to be clocked.

63
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
They want the caveman thing.

64
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,340
This seems like a very dentist's method of using it.

65
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,340
He has to use bowling balls because he only goes after gutter sluts.

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,340
I actually meant to say bowling pins because you actually can juggle those, but no, bowling

67
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
balls.

68
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,340
Yeah, you hit him with bowling balls.

69
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
What size bowling ball do you use?

70
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,340
Because I need to practice this method.

71
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,340
The bowling balls I keep in my jeans, dog.

72
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
There you go.

73
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,340
So weirdly small, and it takes several slabs to get the job done.

74
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,340
That would just hurt you.

75
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,340
So we're recording this episode in celebration of the fact that Davoo lost his virginity.

76
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
That's right.

77
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
That's right.

78
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,340
Congratulations.

79
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,340
That's why I propose we do this episode now because it's a toast, if you will.

80
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Davoo lost his virginity to someone in this room, but who is it?

81
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,340
Find out the procrastinators.

82
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,340
Find out what this quote-unquote room that we are recording in, of course.

83
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,340
It was Digi Bro in the kitchen with the candlestick.

84
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Who is the candlestick?

85
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,340
You're tearing me apart, Davoo.

86
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,340
Okay, now to Voo.

87
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,340
I don't want to be accused of coercing someone to kiss and tell, but perhaps you could give

88
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,340
us some tasteful information about...

89
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,340
That's the whole point of this episode.

90
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,340
I was definitely coerced into this episode.

91
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
That's right.

92
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,340
That's right.

93
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
We forced him to.

94
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,340
Just like he did with the girl that he lost his virginity to.

95
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,340
There was some forcing going on there.

96
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,340
We forced him by providing him with a list of topics and him writing his name down on

97
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,340
the list of topics for this episode.

98
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,340
That's how we forced him to be on here.

99
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,340
Okay, Davoo.

100
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,340
Tell us the tale.

101
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,340
Tell us this hot, fresh tale because we're all very curious.

102
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,340
We don't know anything about this.

103
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
Hold on.

104
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
I've got to get my lotion and tissues, one sec.

105
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Okay, I'm ready.

106
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,340
Let's do it.

107
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,340
You are now listening to erotic stories from real men.

108
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,340
I had sex.

109
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,340
What the fuck?

110
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
Hold on.

111
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,340
I want to hear someone else tell the story first, so I get an idea about...

112
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Yeah, I think it'd be better if someone who's...the rest of us have had years to take these stories

113
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,340
in turn.

114
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
To come up with a convincingly cool sounding story of it.

115
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,340
Yeah, exactly.

116
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,340
But to figure out what the heart of the story is, what's the real meat...the fact that we

117
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,340
got laid is the cool part that makes us look cool.

118
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
You could just say I had sex.

119
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,340
I don't know about you guys, but...

120
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,340
Now I just look at it more as how can I make the story as hilarious and wrong as possible

121
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,340
is now what I want to focus on.

122
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,340
Yeah, there's that.

123
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,780
And everyone knows, every real boy knows that sex is the culmination of a lifelong struggle

124
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,180
and battle to obtain ultimate victory for one brief moment which continues for the rest

125
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,340
of your life, you know?

126
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,340
At first, Nate, I thought you were going to read the Urban Dictionary definition.

127
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,340
Maybe I should, dude.

128
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,340
Let's go check that out.

129
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,340
Well, Nate, do you want to be the first to tell your story?

130
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,340
Sure.

131
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
I'd be happy to.

132
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Let me just see if there's an interesting description here.

133
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,340
I ask because I feel like Nate's story might be comparably normal compared to the rest of

134
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,340
us, so I want to have it established.

135
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,340
I like that you have no idea what my story is and you just automatically assume Mumkey's

136
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,340
virginity story is going to be embarrassing.

137
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,340
Well, tell me that it's not.

138
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,340
Tell me that it's not.

139
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,340
I can't say that my story is going to be normal in any sense of the word.

140
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,340
Well, I'm assuming that like it involves time travel and like a net and like a beam saber,

141
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,340
some kind of helmet that makes that makes monkeys smarter, something like that.

142
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Okay.

143
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
So here we go.

144
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Here's like a little girl from Ape Escape.

145
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,340
Is that what you're saying?

146
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
You fuck someone from Ape Escape.

147
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,340
I don't know that it's the little girl or a human from that game.

148
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,340
You got fucked by the net.

149
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,340
So, so listen to this fucking description of sex on Urban Dictionary.

150
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,340
Here's the description.

151
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,340
Sex.

152
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,340
What kind of moron are you that you look up sex in the Urban Dictionary?

153
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,340
That's it.

154
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
I'm getting tired.

155
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,340
They got me.

156
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
They got us.

157
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,340
Oh, man.

158
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,340
These fucking smug cunts.

159
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
All right.

160
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
Anyway.

161
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
It's an epic joke, XD.

162
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Okay.

163
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,340
So let me, I'll tell you my tale.

164
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,340
So I lost my virginity when I was 21.

165
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,340
So late, late bloomer for sure.

166
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,340
I was in college.

167
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
I was a senior.

168
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,340
So I had a girlfriend.

169
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,340
And you know, the thing about sex is that no guy wants to admit it, but it's like a,

170
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,840
maybe this is just me, but I'm like kind of obsessed with sex and that I think about it

171
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,340
all the time and how to get it and whether or not no guy has ever admitted that.

172
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,340
It's a secret to everybody.

173
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,340
I don't know how important it is to every guy out there in terms of their self-identity,

174
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
which is what I'm trying to say.

175
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,340
Literally all that matters.

176
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,340
I would say.

177
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,340
Okay.

178
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,340
Good.

179
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
All right.

180
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
It's probably high on the list of the only thing that matters.

181
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,340
A list consisting exactly of sex.

182
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,340
I would, I would describe myself as nihilist except for sex.

183
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
That's the one thing that matters in this life.

184
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
Yeah.

185
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,340
So when you're talking about, I don't typically care about other people's feelings.

186
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,340
But as a long time researcher of virginity, I think it'd be best if we avoided saying

187
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,340
things like, Oh, 21, I was a late bloomer.

188
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,340
Like I'm guessing a lot of people listening are older than that and also virgins.

189
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,340
So maybe avoid that kind of phrase.

190
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,340
I mean, I, okay, I will, I will.

191
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,340
But, uh, sensitivity training with Munky Jones.

192
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
Yes.

193
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,340
We have to be, did Munky just give us a trigger warning on this video?

194
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,340
We have to make sure this podcast is inclusive for fucking, for incels.

195
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,840
Because specifically, I know that people who are virgins over the, a certain age are going

196
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,340
to go shoot people and I don't want Nate to be the next victim.

197
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Yeah.

198
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,340
You know what?

199
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,340
Before, before I get into that, I have friends who are still virgins who are much older than

200
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
and it pains them.

201
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,340
And I have such deep sympathy for anyone, for any incels out there.

202
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
And I don't use that term.

203
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,340
I just, just to shorten to say people who haven't had sex, but they want to.

204
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,340
They, they know.

205
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Empathize guys.

206
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Empathize.

207
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,340
Yeah, they know.

208
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,340
There's no fucking, you can say 21 is a late bloomer.

209
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,340
We all know half of our stories are going to be over that age, just so you know.

210
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
So like.

211
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,340
It's just that the average age for having sex in America is like 15 for losing your virginity

212
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
or something.

213
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,340
So it's, it's, it boggles my mind.

214
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
The average up baby.

215
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
Yes, we are dragging it out.

216
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Okay.

217
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,340
Partly because, partly because we're millennials and this is a social thing that, that our

218
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,340
generation has a harder time communicating and getting laid.

219
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
Yeah.

220
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,340
So, you know, it's, it's, it's partly a generational thing.

221
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
That's my excuse.

222
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,340
That was like the most insecure sounding sentence I've ever heard you say.

223
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,340
I wanted to make it sound that way.

224
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Generational thing.

225
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,340
That was, that was a joke.

226
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,340
The problem isn't me.

227
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
It's my generation.

228
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,340
So go ahead and talk shit.

229
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Talk shit about me.

230
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,340
I got my millennials backing me up.

231
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
We don't, don't give a fuck.

232
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Yeah.

233
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
We won't ever give a fuck.

234
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,340
Oh, tell you, you give a fuck about me.

235
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
All right.

236
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
Let me get my generation.

237
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,340
I got a chainsaw.

238
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,340
I skin your ass raw.

239
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
That's a different song.

240
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,340
I don't care.

241
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,340
It's all the same song.

242
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,340
It's just one continuous.

243
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,340
It's all a concept album.

244
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,340
I was just so excited that someone made a reference to limp biscuit

245
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
that I had to follow up on it.

246
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,340
Well, I'll tell you, these biscuits ain't limp because we're talking sex here

247
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,340
on the Pro-Presonator podcast.

248
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
That's right.

249
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,340
That's beautiful.

250
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,340
Okay.

251
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,340
So, so just, just, there's a, there's a fun bit.

252
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,340
So I went to Japan when I was, so I had a girlfriend in college.

253
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
And never.

254
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Who did that?

255
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Who's the funniest guy in the world?

256
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Well, well, well done.

257
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
Well done.

258
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,340
That was, that was my, my jingle for the imagery we all had in our head

259
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,340
of the plane flying across the map like in Kill Bill.

260
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,340
That's what I was imagining as I said that.

261
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
That's Nate flying to Japan.

262
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,340
You know, yeah.

263
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,340
Oh, okay.

264
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Great.

265
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
Perfect.

266
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Moving on.

267
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
Did she love you a long time?

268
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,340
Well, no, no.

269
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Actually, I'm sorry.

270
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
I'm just, I know I'm a guy who tells way more context that is necessary.

271
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,340
I was just going to say in college, I had a girlfriend, got a couple handys here and

272
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,340
there, but never lost my virginity, which really bummed me out.

273
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,340
And then I went to, I hope this story is just a plot of Beverly Hills Ninja.

274
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,340
Who made it first.

275
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
Yes.

276
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,340
That's exactly what you can forget.

277
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,340
If you want the short version, just go watch Beverly Hills Ninja.

278
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,340
But it additional detail.

279
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,340
So I went to Japan like immediately after I had broken up with this girl.

280
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,340
And there was a great awakening that took place in me while I was there.

281
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,340
And I was the most outgoing I'd ever been in my life.

282
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
I went out with my buddy Garif, another guy.

283
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
I was at this big school where everybody learns Japanese.

284
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
And me and him hooked up.

285
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,340
We met a couple of friends there and we went out to the red light district.

286
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,340
We hooked up in terms of heterosexual brotherhood and partnership to get laid.

287
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,340
We were both virgins at the time actually.

288
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Not with each other.

289
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
Not with each other.

290
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Not with each other.

291
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,340
But it became our quest to get laid because he had the worst case of yellow fever I've

292
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
ever seen.

293
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,340
And we both just wanted sex in general.

294
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,340
He succeeded while we were there for like three months or whatever.

295
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
I did not.

296
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,340
But I got so much practice.

297
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Guys, go to Tokyo.

298
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,340
Go to, I forget the name of the district, but go to the red light district.

299
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
It's the most fun place in the world.

300
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
I need to.

301
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Do whatever you want.

302
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:49,340
Nate, you were telling me that the methodology these guys were using was to go into bar

303
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,340
bars and then just grab women and pull them aside.

304
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
That's what we did.

305
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Because there was a language barrier.

306
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,340
So you guys would just go in and just grab women.

307
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,340
And if they didn't run, then they were interested.

308
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
That means they were down.

309
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,340
That meant they were into it.

310
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,340
Yeah.

311
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
That's how it worked.

312
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,340
We actually met a bunch of like, I mean, I'm not going to call them professionals,

313
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,340
but like guys who-

314
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,340
It's nice to know that some things are the same all over the world.

315
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
That's right.

316
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
That's right.

317
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,340
We met guys there who like their life was they had come to Japan.

318
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,340
There was a bunch of like American dudes from like New York and shit.

319
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,340
And there was this one guy, I forget his name, but he-

320
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
Were they wearing Naruto headbands and stuff?

321
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
No.

322
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,340
These guys were just like professional yellow fever like curers of themselves, if you know

323
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
what I'm saying?

324
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Like it was their goal in life to have sex with as many Asian women as possible.

325
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,340
And they allowed us to observe their techniques.

326
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,340
And it was fascinating.

327
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Nash, no, Nash was my other friend from there.

328
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
Okay, whatever.

329
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,340
I got a massive amount of experience in a very short amount of time as to how to meet

330
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,340
and manhandle women.

331
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
And it was great.

332
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
But I did not get laid in Japan.

333
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,340
However, got back to college, came back to school, and with my newfound, highly honed

334
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,340
Ninja Asian skills as in my movie, Beverly Hills Cop.

335
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
I mean, Beverly Hills Ninja.

336
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,340
Beverly Hills Ninja.

337
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,340
I was then able to utilize those Ninjutsu arts to like Halloween came and we just went

338
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,340
to a party or something.

339
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,340
And I mean, just the story was actually pretty cool.

340
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,340
Like there was a bunch of, there was a party at this Halloween place.

341
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,340
There was this one girl, I was trying to hook up with her.

342
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,340
It didn't work out.

343
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,340
And I was really bummed that that didn't happen.

344
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,340
But then another truckload of new freshmen pulled up to the house in front.

345
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,340
They all got dumped out.

346
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,340
And on my second major pull of the night, I just grabbed this girl, literally took her

347
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,340
out back of the house in the dirt and we just fucked like animals for a while.

348
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
And it was fucking amazing.

349
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
There was dirt everywhere.

350
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
What were you dressed as?

351
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,340
I was dressed as nothing.

352
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
Yeah, I had no costume.

353
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
What?

354
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,340
I was just a dude.

355
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,340
I was just a dude.

356
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,340
I had no costume.

357
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,340
You got laid at a Halloween party without even wearing a fucking costume.

358
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,340
I can't remember.

359
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,340
I honestly can't remember.

360
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,340
The only thing I remember was that I lost my Virginia at this party and that was really

361
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,340
cool because when I came home to all my friends, I was like, guys, I did it.

362
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
I had sex.

363
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,340
I have laid with a woman and formed the man.

364
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
He went to the party as a virgin.

365
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,340
And I came home a champion.

366
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,340
When you had sex, the party was over.

367
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
She was dressed as...

368
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
You know what?

369
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,340
Maybe I'm wrong.

370
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,340
Maybe it wasn't actually Halloween.

371
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,340
It might have been a little bit later because I'm thinking and I don't remember anyone actually

372
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
being dressed up as anything.

373
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,340
It was like Ash Wednesday.

374
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Exactly.

375
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,340
And he excused the party.

376
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,340
Yeah.

377
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,340
Anyway, that was it.

378
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
It was just fun.

379
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,340
It was just this experience of going out, learning a bunch of shit about how to deal with women

380
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,340
that I came home, applied it to these weak white women.

381
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,340
And they fell to me like dominoes before my eyes.

382
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,340
My two questions are...

383
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,340
I'm just amazed you lost it in the dirt.

384
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,340
Like just fucking outside like an animal.

385
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
It's awesome.

386
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,340
It was actually nuts.

387
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,340
So I met this girl on the dance floor.

388
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,340
And I had been bumped out because this other girl it didn't work out with.

389
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,340
We had tried to fuck, but we got interrupted.

390
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,340
And then I went back downstairs to the basement where everybody was dancing, saw a girl.

391
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,340
And God, it was a magical moment.

392
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
I was so amped up.

393
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,340
I saw this girl, said, hey, that was the only word I spoke to her, grabbed her, pulled her

394
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
to me, started dancing with her.

395
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,340
And not 10 minutes later, I had just pulled her upstairs.

396
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,340
We were in back of the house and we were just fucking in the dirt like animals.

397
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
It was nuts.

398
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
No words were spoken.

399
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
Wait, upstairs?

400
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,340
Well, we went from the basement upstairs around the back of the house where nobody was.

401
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,340
And then we fucked.

402
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,340
Wait, is this like an MC Escher house?

403
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:49,340
They were in the basement dancing, so they went upstairs to the first floor.

404
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
Wait.

405
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Do you remember her name and did you ever talk to her again?

406
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
I never got her name.

407
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,340
And I saw her again at another party and pretended I didn't know who she was.

408
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,340
Yep.

409
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,340
What the fuck?

410
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
Well, she doesn't remember me either.

411
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
So who gives a shit?

412
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,340
Does not remove social awkwardness at all.

413
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,340
Well, it was about social awkwardness.

414
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,340
I just didn't want to have to then deal with the baggage of having fucked her.

415
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,340
I'd rather just move on.

416
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,340
He just didn't want to suddenly be married.

417
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,340
Well, no, monkey, if you talk to her after you become married and that's where it all

418
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
goes downhill.

419
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
That's the law.

420
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Yeah, I didn't want to talk to her and get her pregnant.

421
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,340
That would have been a big mistake.

422
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,340
Yeah.

423
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
That's Bundy's law.

424
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
That's how it works.

425
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
That's how it happens in Clonad.

426
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
That's right.

427
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
Exactly.

428
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
Okay.

429
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,340
There you go.

430
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,340
There's my very sloppy story.

431
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
All right.

432
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
Yeah.

433
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
Who wants to go next?

434
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,340
Monkey?

435
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,340
Jesse?

436
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
I think it's Davoo's turn now.

437
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
If he wants.

438
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,340
I don't know.

439
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Maybe we should save Davoo for last.

440
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
You can just listen to everybody.

441
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,340
I think Davoo wants to hear everybody else's stories to gauge his own.

442
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,340
I don't know.

443
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
Where are you going?

444
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Nobody's going.

445
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,340
Nobody's offering.

446
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,340
Fine.

447
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,340
You're a bunch of fucking bullies.

448
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
Good.

449
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Go.

450
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,340
You're a personal story.

451
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,340
And I never should have come here.

452
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,340
I'm only here for the money.

453
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,340
I have to say things about my life for money now.

454
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,340
This Patreon has ruined everything.

455
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
Oh yeah.

456
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Patreon's on kind of Patreon now.

457
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
The procrastinators.

458
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
Yeah.

459
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
Everybody go.

460
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
Bonus episode every month.

461
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,340
If you pledge $500, Digi will take your virginity.

462
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Yeah.

463
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,340
What the fuck was that?

464
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,340
I don't know what that was in response to.

465
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Go ahead.

466
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
I assume a spider fell on him.

467
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
So.

468
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
No, that was a combination.

469
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,340
The mental pot of Digi naked.

470
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,340
It was a combination of thinking about Digi naked and taking my virginity and also, and

471
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,340
also grabbing my pants.

472
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,340
There it is.

473
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
There's that world famous Endless Jess meme.

474
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
There it is.

475
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
There it is.

476
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,340
Pants man.

477
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
Yeah.

478
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,340
World famous Endless Jess wit.

479
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,340
So all right.

480
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,340
My story begins as so many of my stories do on the internet, on the pub crawl.

481
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,340
The show that I do every week.

482
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
I still do it.

483
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Show where I get drunk with my Australian friend Sider and we talk about whatever the

484
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
fuck.

485
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,340
And it used to be that this show was a live radio show that had a live chat.

486
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,340
So people would, you know, like interact with us while we were doing the show.

487
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,340
I say radio as an internet radio.

488
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,340
Very few viewers.

489
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:31,340
But it was like shortly after my 23rd birthday, 23rd, something like that.

490
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,340
It was 2013, maybe 22nd birthday, whatever.

491
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,340
I was complaining about how I just turned 20 something and still had never had a girlfriend

492
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
or gotten laid.

493
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
And I'm just like whining about it.

494
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,340
And then someone in the chat is like, Hey, I like you.

495
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
I'll have sex with you.

496
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,340
And I, this is always my reaction.

497
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,340
I don't believe you.

498
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
That always how I feel.

499
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,340
My reaction is always like, I don't believe you unless you can prove it.

500
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:08,340
But some a certain, a certain persona non grata was in the chat and was kind of trying to

501
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,340
convince them to give more information.

502
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,340
Are you talking about Dr. Wolf?

503
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
Was it Dr. Wolf?

504
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,340
Dr. Wolf, Dr. Lee.

505
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,340
Hell yeah, hell yeah.

506
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,340
So she kept nothing.

507
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,340
She started expanding on the information.

508
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
It was like, I'm completely serious.

509
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,340
I want to fuck you.

510
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
I'm a big fan.

511
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,340
I am a woman.

512
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,340
Here's some pictures of me, you know.

513
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,340
And she'd taken pictures of like, like no face, just body, you know.

514
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,340
She knows what to do.

515
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
She knows.

516
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,340
Yeah, but she had a, she had a nice body, you know, a nice enough body.

517
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,340
Did you request a shoe on head picture?

518
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
You should have.

519
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,340
A shoe on head?

520
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
What is, I don't.

521
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,340
By the way, I hate that the shoe on head meme has been co-opted by that girl shoe on head.

522
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
Does anyone else present that?

523
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
I don't know this meme at all.

524
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,340
All right, don't worry about it, never mind.

525
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:01,340
So she, so I tell her like, you know, since she seems serious, I'm like, here's my Skype name.

526
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,340
So we get on to Skype and we're talking for a few, a few more hours after the show, you know.

527
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,340
I'm sourced.

528
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,340
I'm open.

529
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,340
And we quickly start talking about it stuff and kind of kind of hitting it off because

530
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:19,340
the only requirement I have to find someone attractive is that they find me attractive.

531
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
That's, that's all it takes.

532
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:28,340
You just have to be into me and be at least physically attractive enough that I can be into you back and I'm sold.

533
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:35,340
So by day two of me talking to this girl, we already have decided that we're going to be boyfriend and girlfriend now.

534
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
Might as well.

535
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:44,340
After I've, after, after through like one conversation, I've already made her cry because I just was like asking.

536
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,340
And they cry a lot.

537
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,340
So I was asking about her personal life, which was shit.

538
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,340
So she,

539
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Oh, what's your dad like?

540
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
That's,

541
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
Yeah, exactly.

542
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,340
That's how you raised me.

543
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,340
I asked what's your dad like and that might as well be exactly what it was.

544
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
Oh, Lord.

545
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,340
So I asked her what's your dad like and then we, she was totally into me.

546
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,340
So it took obviously though, here's the problem.

547
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,340
She lives in Montana.

548
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,340
I live in Virginia opposite ends of the country.

549
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:18,340
So we're already at the, we need to fuck now stage, but we're living too far apart, right?

550
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:27,340
So instead it's just lots of sexually suggestive texting and Skype calling and, you know, and, and, and, and flirting that way.

551
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,340
Lots of very sexual Skype calls, but I'm like, all right, I got to get over there.

552
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:39,340
So I within like, I would say within a month of our, of our relationship starting, I bought a ticket to, to go to Montana.

553
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:48,340
So I fly out there and she's waiting for me at the airport and like this super skimpy outfit, which is hilarious because it's the, it's like October.

554
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
It's like the start of October.

555
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,340
In Montana.

556
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,340
In Montana.

557
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,340
It's freezing cold.

558
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,340
And she's waiting for me in the car, like freezing her ass off in this skimpy little outfit because she was trying to look sexy for me.

559
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:10,340
You know, she'd been taking, she'd been taking birth control pills, which I guess like completely fucked with her and like made her have like all these horrible migraines and stuff.

560
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,340
She just wanted to be sexy.

561
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
Right.

562
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,340
I respect that effort.

563
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
So sorry for her.

564
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
Yeah.

565
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,340
But, but at the same time made her extremely horny.

566
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:28,340
So, so we go to her place, you know, we, we walk in and immediately we're like, we start making out and stuff, you know, I'm like, oh, I've never had never been kissed before.

567
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
This is happening.

568
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,340
You know, that's some sick makeups going on.

569
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Start taking clothes off.

570
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
Start moving towards the bedroom.

571
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,340
Now here's where shit gets weird.

572
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Uh-oh.

573
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
So, so, all right.

574
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
How comes that BBC?

575
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,340
I know it's going to hit that table any second now.

576
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
BBC.

577
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
What is that?

578
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
She has a big black cock.

579
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
Oh, okay.

580
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
No.

581
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,340
So what happens is, now mind you, she'd been listening to me on the pub crawl, right?

582
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,340
Now this, this girl has listened to me like nonstop continually for months.

583
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:09,340
Like she would go to her favorite video of mine is my vlogs about BronyCon 2013, which is like three hours of me just describing what happened at this convention.

584
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,340
Because she just likes listening to my voice and so would listen to it on repeat like all day.

585
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:21,340
And she had listened to me and Cider talking about like video game discussions on the pub crawl.

586
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,340
And we've been talking about the concept of ludonarrative dissonance a lot.

587
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,340
So this is important.

588
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,340
Now I know what that is, but for the audience at home, please explain.

589
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,340
Oh, God.

590
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
Oh, no.

591
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
You're bringing back the trauma.

592
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:42,340
So ludonarrative dissonance is when the narrative and gameplay elements of a story seem to be in contrast.

593
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,340
Watch Dogs 2.

594
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:53,340
Well, the classic example that Aaron's signal made a whole video about was Grand Theft Auto 5, where in that game, it's got a very serious story.

595
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,340
Four.

596
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,340
Or four.

597
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,340
Yeah.

598
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,340
Grand Theft Auto 4 has a very serious storyline.

599
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,340
And then in between that story, you're just like murdering people haplessly on the street for no reason.

600
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,340
Like just the gameplay and story we're in conflict with one another.

601
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,340
It's a very debated phrase, especially in the academic world of gaming.

602
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,340
Killed a lot of people, and they were.

603
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,340
It was a very romantic thing as I run over these seven fucking people walking on the sidewalk.

604
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,340
So, now my ex, she loved listening to me talk.

605
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,340
Didn't comprehend a lot of it.

606
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,340
Not exactly an analytically minded person or someone who studies music.

607
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,340
Is she watching this, did she?

608
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
No.

609
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
She's dead.

610
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,340
I killed her.

611
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
She's in the ground.

612
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
That's how the story ends.

613
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

614
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,340
And she would, I don't think she would, she herself would always say like, I don't really,

615
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,340
she doesn't care about what I was talking about.

616
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,340
She just liked that I sounded smart and had a cool voice.

617
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,340
Like that's what she likes about my content.

618
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
I thought we had to tell real stories here.

619
00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:00,340
So, she, I'm sorry, a woman being dumb is the most realistic story I've ever heard in my life.

620
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,340
That's right ladies, I hate all of you.

621
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,340
There you go.

622
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:09,340
So, she, so I'm in her room, in her apartment in Montana, very sparse room on a mattress on the floor, right?

623
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,340
Whoa.

624
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:16,340
And we've gotten to the point where, you know, I'm naked, she's on top of me, she's naked.

625
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,340
Ooh.

626
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,340
She, you know, she, she's always about being on top, right?

627
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
Likes to control the situation.

628
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,340
I think out of, out of like embarrassment sort of, like she wants to think, like, yeah,

629
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,340
like she wants to be in control because she's shy about it, essentially.

630
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,340
Yeah, I get that.

631
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,340
So, so she gets, you know, she inserts my dick inside of her.

632
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,340
All right.

633
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,340
And she's struggling on top of me.

634
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,340
We get what's going on here.

635
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Yeah.

636
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
Well, it's all important.

637
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,340
More detail, more detail.

638
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
I'm almost there.

639
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,340
Then she, she, oh yeah.

640
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Now, keep in mind, mental image here.

641
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,340
I am five foot eight and a half.

642
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,340
My girlfriend was six foot two.

643
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,340
Holy shit.

644
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,340
She's way taller than me, right?

645
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
She does not deserve a dick.

646
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:10,340
So she has, because she can easily tower over my whole form and she's at this time, I'm

647
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:18,340
probably a hundred and seventy five pounds, you know, she's like proportional to her height.

648
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,340
She's only a little less heavy than me, you know, so like, I'm not, she wasn't like fat,

649
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,340
but she had a little chub shabbiness and she's way taller than me.

650
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,340
So she was physically much, much more imposing than I am.

651
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,340
So she grabs onto my wrists and is holding them above my head, right?

652
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
Cause she's, she's sort of locked me down.

653
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
Okay.

654
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,340
Like I can't, I can't move.

655
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,340
And I keep wanting to just like, I just want to touch.

656
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,340
I just want to, you know, grab things.

657
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,340
I just want to, I'm seeing all this for the first time.

658
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,340
I want to, I want to fucking figure out what it all does.

659
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,340
You know, I'm like, whoa, what's this thing?

660
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Oh, I haven't seen that one.

661
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,340
I'm like trying to reach and grab for everything.

662
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,340
I just want to touch everything.

663
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,340
I want to shove my fingers into her eyeballs.

664
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,340
You know, I just want to like touch all the parts, figure out what they all do.

665
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:13,340
But she, every time I start touching her, because again, I think she's just like shy about it.

666
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,340
She keeps grabbing my wrists and pinning me down.

667
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:23,340
And then she would just sit there and she was like, I'm not like, like, I'm not going to move until

668
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,340
you explain to me the concept of ludonarrative dissonance.

669
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,340
What, what?

670
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,340
A phrase, a phrase which she cannot pronounce.

671
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,340
She keeps saying ludum and the dissonance like that.

672
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,340
She can't pronounce the phrase ludonarrative dissonance.

673
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
This is next level shit, dude.

674
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,340
How did I never know about this?

675
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,340
God damn.

676
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,340
So she keeps telling me like, explain ludonarrative dissonance.

677
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:55,340
And then I'll start explaining it and she'll start moving because she's like getting off to hearing me talk.

678
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,340
But then once she starts moving, my mind completely goes blank and I can't do it.

679
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:09,340
So this is like probably 15 minutes of struggle between she won't do anything unless I start describing ludonarrative dissonance

680
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:15,340
and I am just so far out of my element that I cannot possibly describe ludonarrative dissonance in this situation.

681
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:21,340
But part of what I'm grappling with also is that this is my first time having sex.

682
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,340
But I jack off more than anyone else in the world.

683
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,340
So I'm realizing the difference in feeling here.

684
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,340
Yeah.

685
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,340
That, that, uh, that it's big.

686
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,340
I think, I think, I don't want to, I don't want to like this.

687
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
I don't want to make this gross.

688
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,340
But I think she, gross, gross, gross.

689
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,340
I think it's been gross the whole time.

690
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Yeah.

691
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
I'm already, I'm already gay.

692
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Wait, no, the opposite of that.

693
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Whatever.

694
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,340
My theory at the time, she was masturbating a lot.

695
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Like she, I know this because I would watch sometimes on Skype.

696
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,340
She had, she used all these like dildos and stuff.

697
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,340
I think she was just a little too wide for me at the time.

698
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Oh shit.

699
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,340
Okay, okay.

700
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
And that's how he became dildo, bro.

701
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,340
The world.

702
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:18,340
My point is I'm just not quite getting the level of grip that I'm used to.

703
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
Yep.

704
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,340
You know, I'm used to my hand, which I can manage the tightness of exactly.

705
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
They call the Death Grip Digi Bro.

706
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
So yeah.

707
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,340
Exactly.

708
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Death Grip Digi Bro.

709
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
Um, so I'm used to, you know.

710
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Is that where Death Grips get their name by the way?

711
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
Is that?

712
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Probably.

713
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
Yeah.

714
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
From Digi Bro.

715
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
From Death Grip Digi Bro.

716
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
That's what.

717
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,340
They heard this story and they were like, that's it man.

718
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Right there.

719
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Okay.

720
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Anyway.

721
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,340
So yeah, I'm used to the Death Grip, but she's, she's, you know, I mean, aside from

722
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,340
not being the tightest, she's also extremely wet because she comes nonstop.

723
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:57,340
So like, um, so there's just liquid everywhere and I'm sliding in and out and around.

724
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
And I'm like, I'm trying to figure out.

725
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,340
It's like a slip and slide on the floor.

726
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Yeah.

727
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,340
I'm just trying to figure out like, is this, like, am I doing something wrong or is she

728
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
doing something wrong?

729
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Yeah.

730
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,340
I can't get off like this, you know.

731
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,940
Um, so after all this ludonarrative dissonance and shit, like finally we start getting into

732
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,540
the meat of it and we have sex for, I want to say literally an hour and a half and I

733
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,540
never can come.

734
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,100
And like, she starts to become kind of distressed about it where she's like, you know, she's

735
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
like, am I fucking up?

736
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,340
And I'm like, but I think I'm like, at this point I'm having fun, like after the whole

737
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,220
all the ludonarrative shits over, I'm like, all right, now I'm starting to get the point

738
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
of this.

739
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
I'm starting to be fun.

740
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,040
I can, there's boobs here.

741
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
That's cool.

742
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,820
You know, I can put those in my mouth.

743
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
Oh my God.

744
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,820
Oh my God.

745
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
Oh my God.

746
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:53,260
So I'm, I'm fucking up for like an hour and a half.

747
00:31:53,260 --> 00:32:00,580
So if we're counting losing your virginity as you have to come, then it took, it took

748
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
like,

749
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
Wait, hold on.

750
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
You have to come in a vagina?

751
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
No, you don't have to come in a vagina.

752
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,580
You have to insert your dick is what I would say.

753
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,700
Well, anyway, so I just, my point is that it took a really long time because it took,

754
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,340
we probably had sex like two or three times before I, before we got the rhythm down and

755
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,100
then it all made sense and it clicked and it was like, okay, now this all makes sense.

756
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,180
I know what's going on here.

757
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:29,140
I know where my dick is meant to go in this, you know, it's not just a matter of sticking

758
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,140
it in.

759
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,300
It's a matter of, you know, fitting it, you know, no matter who you're, no matter who

760
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,180
you're getting with, there's always going to be some period of adjusting to each other

761
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,500
to figure out, you know, what works.

762
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,660
So this makes sense.

763
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,340
I can't help but notice that Ben St. has suddenly joined the call.

764
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,100
I don't know if he's recording audio or if he, if he's,

765
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,060
Hey, hey, hello, hello, I'm here.

766
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,540
Are you recording?

767
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
I am recording.

768
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
I am recording.

769
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
You lost your virginity just in time.

770
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,300
Wait, this is, this the ladies, is this the ladies cast?

771
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
It was the virginity cast.

772
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
It's the stories of how we lost our virginity.

773
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,300
You know, oh, oh, well, should I tell mine?

774
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Well, if you want to, that's what the point of this show is, Ben.

775
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,620
Digi, Digi, that story of yours, you were literally describing like my worst nightmare

776
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,820
in life of like, like, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll get with a person and we'll be having

777
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,060
like a real human intimate moment and she'll be like, yeah, now do like YouTuber stuff.

778
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
Be a YouTuber.

779
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
Yeah.

780
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
Explain to me things.

781
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,060
Do an analysis video.

782
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,060
Tell me why Applejack is a real character, Jesse.

783
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Tell me about it.

784
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
Exactly.

785
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,060
God fucking dammit.

786
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
Exactly what it was.

787
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
I wish, I wish.

788
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,060
When you come in here, I want you to go, endless jack.

789
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,060
We're not, we're not, we're not.

790
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
I want you to say it.

791
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
I'm a demon.

792
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,700
And I want, and I want, and I want Gibbon on guitar in the corner to strum, to strum

793
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
the beat.

794
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Yeah.

795
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,180
Um, I'm so sad, I'm so sad that I missed everybody's.

796
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Um, I'm sure I missed.

797
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
Well, you only missed two.

798
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
You've only missed me and mine.

799
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
You've only missed me and mine.

800
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
You've only missed me?

801
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Yeah.

802
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Me and Digi.

803
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Me and Digi.

804
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Yeah.

805
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Oh, okay.

806
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
Um, um, well, mine, mine's not really that interesting.

807
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:15,180
Um, I went to college and I, and I met a girl and there was like some drama about would

808
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:21,500
she leave her boyfriend from high school for me and eventually she, she was like, okay,

809
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,340
I broke up with my fucking high school boyfriend and I was like, oh, sweet.

810
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
And I don't know.

811
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,180
We fucking, oh, we like kind of, okay.

812
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:35,500
Well, specifically we were on like the couch in like our dorm basement and we were like

813
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,900
making out and we, and we kind of like started, yeah, my first time I kind of like started

814
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,500
fucking or like on the couch in like, sounds like he's making the pump as he goes, in the

815
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
basement.

816
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,580
No, no, we were in like the public, we were in like a fucking public basement like next

817
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:55,300
to like the fucking laundry machines and like, I think, I think someone like, we heard someone

818
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,300
coming down the stairs like to do their laundry while we were trying to do it and we were

819
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,580
like, oh fuck.

820
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,060
So I think we had to give it up at that point and then we just like, I don't know, went

821
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,500
back to my room and like did it and it was like, okay.

822
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
And that's it basically.

823
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,300
You had to follow indigy step and tell us about like how she inserted the penis and

824
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,620
all like really close details.

825
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:20,660
We were like laying on the couch and I don't know, fucking inserted the penis.

826
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,380
It's just, it's just normie sex is what it was.

827
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,820
It's pretty, pretty, the only thing not completely normal about it was that we were in like a

828
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,380
fucking public room and then someone was coming by and we were like, oh shit, let's go to

829
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,900
my room and then we did and then it was just like whatever.

830
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
Yeah.

831
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,620
Well, I'm glad my story is so much better than that.

832
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,540
Oh, so glad Ben could make it for this episode.

833
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,180
Yeah, really great contribution, Ben, get the fuck out of it.

834
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,940
Wait, wait, I also want to say that I'm pretty sure I didn't come my first time because I

835
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,180
have the endurance of a fucking, of a fucking athlete.

836
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,580
Of a Kenyan gazelle.

837
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,820
Yeah, I mean, I, I'm a guy, I'm a guy who didn't my first time for like an hour and

838
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
a half.

839
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:11,900
Yeah, I'm all about, I'm a slow and steady, I'm all about that endurance.

840
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,420
That's me with sex.

841
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,340
I actually felt, I actually felt more accomplished once I was able to come in like three minutes.

842
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,340
Yeah.

843
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
Like that's what I was like, don't you mean?

844
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,660
We've got this down, like we figured this out because now I can do it as quickly as

845
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
I should be able to.

846
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:31,500
Yeah, the story is about people who like guys who like come too fast their first times,

847
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,820
like I don't fucking get it.

848
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,020
I don't get how that happens.

849
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,500
I wonder if that's a bit of a meme.

850
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,460
Because they probably don't jack off that much.

851
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,340
It's probably guys who don't, who don't touch their own dicks that much.

852
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,860
That doesn't, that doesn't like, like going a while without jerking off doesn't really

853
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:50,620
make, well, I guess if I go a really long time without it, then yeah, like it's, it's,

854
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,500
I'm fucking a little bit of a hair trigger.

855
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,780
I guess, I guess that could be part of it.

856
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,860
What's the thing about guys who jerk off a lot, or I mean, isn't like the meme that

857
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,260
if you jerk off a lot, like you're conditioning yourself to come as quickly as possible, as

858
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,740
opposed to like if you edge or whatever, that's like training yourself to endure longer, right?

859
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
Right?

860
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,740
I don't know if that even makes sense.

861
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,580
Well, the thing is, since I was like 14, I've trained myself sort of inadvertently

862
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,100
to make it last longer so I can get my money's worth.

863
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
That's good.

864
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
Yeah.

865
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
So I basically expect myself the wrong way.

866
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,660
I can control the exact length of how long I want to jack off.

867
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:28,900
It's all about like, am I doing this because I'm bored and I want it to last all day?

868
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Yeah.

869
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,260
Or am I doing this because I need to get a quick nut before, like, you know, I just

870
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,860
like, I'm anxious or something.

871
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,460
I use jacking off like drinking a coffee.

872
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,940
It's a great pick me up and then I can continue other stuff that I need to do.

873
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,620
Somehow it both puts me to sleep at night and wakes me up in the morning.

874
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
I know.

875
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
It's incredible.

876
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,500
I don't know how that's possible, but it's amazing.

877
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,620
Wait, is that not the case with anyone?

878
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,900
No, that's not the case for me.

879
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,220
I fucking, I focus, I focus so much better before I jack off.

880
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,460
Once I jack off in a day, I'm kind of like, my focus is usually just like fried for the

881
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,460
rest of the day.

882
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,500
You know, I guess I just wish that there was an old born out there that interested me

883
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,180
because I'm always interested like, oh, hey, how can this narrative bend itself to be even

884
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
more hot in the next page?

885
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
I don't even understand that.

886
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,420
Like women, just look at a woman.

887
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,420
That's it.

888
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,380
And then, you know, it's attractive or it's not.

889
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:25,380
The other day, as I was starting to get sick because I was so lethargic and didn't want

890
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,460
to do anything else, I just jacked off like probably seven or eight times that day.

891
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,460
What the fuck?

892
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,100
It was a great time.

893
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,580
It doesn't take anything from me.

894
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,900
I can jack off to literally nothing.

895
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,900
It's just like...

896
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Okay, we're talking about jacking off and shit.

897
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
The mere thought.

898
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
We're talking about losing Virginia.

899
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,180
Well, Ben's virginity story was too short.

900
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
Yeah, that's true.

901
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,780
Nate, Nate, I want to say, maybe, I mean, maybe you're normal and I'm crazy, but it's

902
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
for me.

903
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,620
It's not enough just to look at an attractive woman.

904
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm turned on by fucking concepts as gay as that is.

905
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Yeah, absolutely.

906
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,340
Well, I know what you mean.

907
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
There are certainly things that are more attractive than others.

908
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,580
Can't you just come up with them in your head, though?

909
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,020
I could come up with them.

910
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,420
I can come up with them in my head, but...

911
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,420
I have so many.

912
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:16,060
I have scenarios that I've imagined for jacking off that I continually come back to.

913
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:23,260
I have a sort of library of pornographic stories that I have written in my own mind,

914
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,940
and I can remember all of them going back like 10 years.

915
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,340
You know what?

916
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:33,060
Some of them are just like random, you know, like, some of them are original characters

917
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:39,500
do not steal, and some of them are, you know, like anime characters who I've imagined into

918
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,500
these certain sexual relationships that I've just held onto, that exact imagination for

919
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
so long.

920
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,820
It's like a spank bank of a creative one.

921
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
You know?

922
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,140
Yeah, I know what you mean.

923
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,300
I used to do that when I was younger.

924
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
I don't know.

925
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,300
I don't maybe, yeah, I don't really imagine it for myself.

926
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,700
Now I like, I don't know what it is.

927
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,300
It's just so easy to Google porn.

928
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:09,900
If I'm imagining it for myself, then it's not as real as if someone else has created

929
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,900
it.

930
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,940
If someone else has created it, I don't know.

931
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,940
Maybe there's some kind of...

932
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,140
I could definitely get off faster to someone else's creation because they're probably better

933
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,140
at it than I am.

934
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,140
At least the drawing.

935
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,140
I don't know.

936
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,140
I don't know what it is.

937
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,940
I don't know why it's hotter if someone else has fucking created it and prepared it for

938
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,260
me than if I'm just thinking of it myself.

939
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
Just think about it this way.

940
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,660
Like, I don't think our brains are wired for us to like imagine, like when you're talking

941
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,100
about being aroused or like sexual attraction, it's not like our brains were programmed

942
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,060
to like for us to imagine things that make us, you know, aroused and then do that.

943
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,020
It makes sense to me that we're built to like visually observe a phenomenon that immediately

944
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,060
is a more efficient way of like triggering our responses.

945
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,060
It's more like it's a real thing that's happening.

946
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,060
Right.

947
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
Right.

948
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
When I...

949
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:02,300
Incidentally, I don't know about you guys, but if I decide like I'm bored, let's jack

950
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,220
off, I need to, you know, like I have to accomplish a boner first.

951
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:14,980
My method is just to go to A on 4chan because guaranteed something on the catalog page is

952
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,140
going to give me a boner.

953
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
I know what you mean.

954
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,140
That's my pro tip to the audience.

955
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,620
If you're, if you need, if you, if you were like, like always trying to find something

956
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,220
to like start, like, you know, get the, because you can't just go right to porn because it

957
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,220
looks gross.

958
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,100
When you don't have a porn, when you don't have a boner, porn looks gross.

959
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,460
You know, I don't find myself with that issue much.

960
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,780
I usually don't jack off unless I'm already aroused and that happens like all the time.

961
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,860
So I don't really have much of a need to do it because I consider it a waste of time

962
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,860
to jack off.

963
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,740
I'd rather be doing work except I need to deal with this problem before I can, you know,

964
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,740
go do a show.

965
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,380
But sometimes, sometimes the, the, the crushing reality that your life is the same thing day

966
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,060
in and day out really seeps into your bones and creates a lethargy where, where you think,

967
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,700
man, I should really do work today.

968
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,660
I mean, I've already produced literally 12 vlogs and a whole video, but I should really

969
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,180
do more work today.

970
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
Never mind.

971
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,260
I have to, something has to make me go to bed because this is too much, you know.

972
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,260
It happens.

973
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,260
It happens and it makes me sad every time.

974
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Okay.

975
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,780
Let's move on to our next story.

976
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,260
It's enough about jacking off for now.

977
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,260
How about Jesse?

978
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,100
Why don't you tell us your tale?

979
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
Okay.

980
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,060
It was a dark and stormy night.

981
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:30,700
A boy was walking in the snow with his loyal growl from home.

982
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
On the outskirts.

983
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
He was walking far from home.

984
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,140
On the outskirts of Ponyville, a dark shadow was cast.

985
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,260
Nate, don't try to appropriate my memes.

986
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,500
Oh, I forgive you.

987
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,980
It's my meme now, baby.

988
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,380
I'm the puppy dog boy.

989
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,260
You stole my career, so I stole your meme.

990
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,060
We can co-opt it.

991
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,700
Okay.

992
00:42:51,700 --> 00:43:00,500
My story is a, is a story of, of, of, of perseverance through hardship, onwards to glory, onwards

993
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:06,940
ascending to manhood, to godhood, fighting all obstacles, going through them.

994
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,940
Having sex.

995
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,700
No matter how many policemen tried to stop me, I got what I came for.

996
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Yeah.

997
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:18,460
This sounds like it's going to be a good story for Victor's book, the, how to find, how to,

998
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,140
how to get a relationship in just six easy years.

999
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,140
Right.

1000
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,140
It sounds like it would fall into this category.

1001
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,620
How to escape the friend zone in six easy years.

1002
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,620
Right.

1003
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,620
That's what it is.

1004
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Yeah.

1005
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,620
Okay.

1006
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,820
It sounds like a great piece of fiction.

1007
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,660
The friend zones for life, baby.

1008
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,660
Believe it.

1009
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,660
Okay.

1010
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,660
Sheld that away in the fucking fantasy section.

1011
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,620
You know what they say, real niggas stay friend zoned for life.

1012
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,620
That's right.

1013
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,620
That's right.

1014
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,620
Hashtag babies.

1015
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,620
Okay.

1016
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,620
Let's go on, Jess.

1017
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,620
What else?

1018
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,620
What else happened?

1019
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,620
Okay.

1020
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,860
So this is a, you know, it was way back in, in high school.

1021
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:02,860
And my, my, my best friend at the time was a girl whose, whose identity I will protect,

1022
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,220
whose name I won't, I'll give her a fake name.

1023
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,820
Her name was Angela Lena.

1024
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,820
Angela's mom.

1025
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,820
Angela Lena.

1026
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,820
Yeah.

1027
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,820
So Angelina Jolie.

1028
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,820
Right.

1029
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,820
Yeah.

1030
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
Exactly.

1031
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,300
So she was like my best friend.

1032
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,820
I had a super huge crush on her.

1033
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,860
I was totally in love with her, but I was very shy.

1034
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,700
I didn't know about how to make a girl like me.

1035
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,700
I was nervous.

1036
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,740
I thought that she would hate me if I, you know, encroached upon our friendship more

1037
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,620
romantically, which is always true because women are psychotic.

1038
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,620
True.

1039
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Right.

1040
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,860
So, so I didn't know how to, you know, make it go that next step.

1041
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,380
And you know, every, we would go to like, like high school dances and they would always

1042
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,580
be so horrible and I hate them cause I'd sit and I wouldn't, you know, have the courage

1043
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,340
to ask her to dance or anything.

1044
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,460
And it was just lame and I hated it all.

1045
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,180
And then I fucking, eventually it was at, it was, it was at senior prom.

1046
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,180
And she was there.

1047
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,180
That's a make or break.

1048
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,180
Yeah.

1049
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,180
It was make or break.

1050
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,180
It's like, this was my last chance.

1051
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,940
If I don't have the courage to dance with her at the senior prom, then that's it.

1052
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,580
It's my last chance that she's gone forever.

1053
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,820
I'll never do it.

1054
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,980
And I didn't do it.

1055
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,900
So I was just what I thought.

1056
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,780
This was like the idyllic high school romance 80s film story.

1057
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,860
Oh, just, oh, just wait.

1058
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:28,340
So it was at senior prom and I felt like I was, I was blowing my one, my one chance,

1059
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,340
my last opportunity.

1060
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,340
I was sitting there sad.

1061
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,020
I was watching her, you know, on the dance floor having fun.

1062
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,780
I was off and at my fucking table with my friends and I just, I was feeling so low and

1063
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,540
so down in the dumps.

1064
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,820
So I just had to get up and I had to walk out through the door out into like the patio

1065
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,420
because we were at some fancy fucking prom place with like a, you know, patio or whatever.

1066
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,420
Right.

1067
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,340
So I just, I walked out the door out to the patio and I just, to just stand by myself

1068
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:57,260
and just mope around and gaze for Lauren at the stars.

1069
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:03,580
And I was out there on the patio and this other girl comes up to me who was two grades

1070
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,580
below me.

1071
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:09,500
So it wasn't supposed to be at the prom, but I guess she had just snuck in there anyways

1072
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,740
to hang out because she was fucking, I don't know.

1073
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,740
Some other guys date maybe?

1074
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,220
I can hear, I can hear a rumbling in the distance.

1075
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,700
I hear a chant coming over the horizon as the story continues.

1076
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:28,660
Sex with the young, sex with the young, sex with the young, sex with the young, sex with

1077
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:36,580
the young, sex with the young, sex with the young, sex with the young.

1078
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:42,540
So, so I was feeling sad and rejected and lonely and I felt like, you know, I lost my

1079
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,660
chance.

1080
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,020
I'll be a virgin forever, whatever, you know, and I was, and I was sitting there.

1081
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,140
I was standing out there on the patio and this girl from two grades below me comes up

1082
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:56,180
whose name, whose identity I will also protect, um, Adriana.

1083
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,940
She comes up to me and I remember exactly what she was wearing.

1084
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,740
She was wearing this like beautiful, like, like shiny emerald green gown.

1085
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,300
Her hair was like down to her ass.

1086
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,300
She has super long hair.

1087
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,780
She was magnificently pretty.

1088
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,540
She was a perfect specimen.

1089
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,980
Everything, body, young, hot, sex with the young kind of girl.

1090
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,980
Jesse, how long was your hair at this time?

1091
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,940
My hair was about as long as it is now, back then.

1092
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,100
I see.

1093
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,700
So I was a long hair boy back then, too.

1094
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:34,060
And so she comes up and she's pretty and she's, it turns out, like I found out years

1095
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,300
later that like every girl in high school had a crush on me, but I didn't notice any

1096
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,020
of them because I had such a crush on my friend.

1097
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,460
Oh, fuck.

1098
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,540
So she came up to me.

1099
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,740
That's the Victor story, isn't it?

1100
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,740
Yeah.

1101
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,620
This really is the six easy years story, except that you got it much quicker.

1102
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,660
Well, there was no friend zone here.

1103
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,220
Well, OK, go on, go on.

1104
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,180
So, um, yeah, I just remember she came up and she approached me and she talked to

1105
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,020
me and we just danced.

1106
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,980
Like she danced with me alone out on the patio.

1107
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,140
It was like there was no one else there.

1108
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,140
And it was like this weird, like a romantic, like a, like a height, like a teen

1109
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,660
movie, like a John Hughes moment of me, like, wow, that's a cool thing.

1110
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,620
But then, um, anyways, later in the night, I got arrested.

1111
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,900
So I ended up.

1112
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,540
Jesus Christ.

1113
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,620
I ended up, I ended up not following up on that with her right away.

1114
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,100
Yeah, there was a whole big thing with with guns and swords and, you know, the cops,

1115
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,700
they took my sword and I never fucking, I never got it back either, because they

1116
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,020
put it in their fucking police station that we were, we were fucking on.

1117
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,940
And they really took your sword.

1118
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,820
That wasn't a cautionary tales of swords.

1119
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,460
No, that was it.

1120
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,860
No, we all are.

1121
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,500
Why did you have a story from his real life?

1122
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,540
Because I went to, because I went to prom as a pirate.

1123
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,620
I had a sword.

1124
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,060
This is a whole new dimension.

1125
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,700
The cops took my sword.

1126
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,140
Is that what the girl came up to?

1127
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,860
Yeah, me and all my friends, we were on our knees in the side of the road.

1128
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,020
We were laying on our bellies that I had like fucking like 12 fucking guns

1129
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,980
pointed at my head at one point.

1130
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,900
It was really scary and really traumatic.

1131
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,340
And they took my sword and I lost my sword forever.

1132
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,780
And also, you know, and so I didn't, and I didn't see Adriana for a fucking

1133
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,660
year after that.

1134
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,380
And also, so it was like, so it was, it was a year later.

1135
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,620
And by now I was however old you are after high school, a year after

1136
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,060
I was like 39 or something.

1137
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,220
So that was still a Virgo.

1138
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,380
All these long months after high school.

1139
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,060
So after that, so it was a year later and we ended up getting kicked out of

1140
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,580
our house because of rent stuff, which is why we always get kicked out of the

1141
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:42,900
house.

1142
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,340
My life is just a, my life is just like an intermittent, intermittent

1143
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,860
homelessness, peppered by like occasional sex with the young.

1144
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,540
Right.

1145
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,660
So like we were getting kicked out of our house.

1146
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,980
I know Ben can relate.

1147
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,860
That's so true.

1148
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,580
Yeah.

1149
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,940
He's a worthless human being.

1150
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,420
What else is going on?

1151
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,540
Yeah, yeah, totally agreed on all counts.

1152
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,140
Yeah.

1153
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,220
So we had to move.

1154
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:13,860
We had to get out of there.

1155
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,780
So my mom, you know, we fucked around.

1156
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,820
My mom picked a house.

1157
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,980
She fucking in a little bit of ways.

1158
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:24,180
Turns out out of, out of complete happenstance, this house that we were

1159
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:29,660
now moving into was neighbors with the girl who danced with me at the senior

1160
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,220
prom.

1161
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,980
So she, she messages.

1162
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,540
Counts is John Hughes level.

1163
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,860
I don't think we've lost it yet.

1164
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,860
Yeah, yeah, it's got some extra plot twists, but it's, it's going in the

1165
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,100
right direction, the action, the action scene with the sword fight and the,

1166
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,260
and the guns was a nice little, a nice little interim.

1167
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,660
Yeah.

1168
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,820
The, the fucking, maybe this is a little bit more Joss Whedon.

1169
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,700
My, my, my, my, does she die at the end?

1170
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,980
My, my Scott pilgrim sword fight at senior prom that ended in bloodshed

1171
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,380
and carnage and tears.

1172
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,340
Um, yeah.

1173
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,140
So she messaged me on my space because that's what that was in.

1174
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,620
That was the fashion at the time.

1175
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:07,100
I had an onion on my belt and we were all using my space and she

1176
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,220
messaged me on my, okay.

1177
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,020
What does that mean?

1178
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,420
I know all about the onion on the belt.

1179
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,140
Us, us old, us old timers.

1180
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:17,820
Us old timers.

1181
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,300
Yeah.

1182
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:19,740
Okay, great.

1183
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:20,620
Yeah.

1184
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,220
Yeah.

1185
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,940
That was the fashion at the time.

1186
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,300
Yeah.

1187
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,300
You know, you, you, you could get the yellow onions, but if you really,

1188
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,140
the choice white onion, if you were a high class bloke.

1189
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,020
What about red onions?

1190
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,580
Foreigners only.

1191
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,220
Okay.

1192
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,580
All right.

1193
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,900
That's how you knew they weren't from around here.

1194
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,340
So fucking.

1195
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,460
Sorry.

1196
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:45,740
I'm sorry.

1197
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,180
Okay.

1198
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:52,940
So fucking Audrey Lena fucking messages me on, on, on my space.

1199
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,300
He goes, Hey, uh, I guess you're moving in next door to me.

1200
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,460
Whoa.

1201
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,220
And I'm like, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1202
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:00,740

1203
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,740
I'm like, Oh yeah.

1204
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,300
Totally.

1205
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,540
Babe, I was real cool on my space.

1206
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,780
Um, yo, so he was calm.

1207
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,700
Oh yeah.

1208
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:12,940
Yeah.

1209
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,660
I was like spaghetti all over me.

1210
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,220
Yeah, there it is.

1211
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:15,620
That's the one.

1212
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,060
Yeah, there we go.

1213
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,060
That name.

1214
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,860
I really blended that one.

1215
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,260
All right.

1216
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,260
So yeah, we moved into this house.

1217
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,300
It was a really cool fucking farmhouse with like a huge, like a yard.

1218
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,580
There was like, there was cattle.

1219
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:35,100
There was like big old fluffy cows in the backyard and stuff.

1220
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,580
It was a cool house and, and it was a big old farm.

1221
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,820
Like, and then like there was a fence at the top of the hill and you just hopped

1222
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,300
the fence and then you were at her house.

1223
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,740
So we started talking when I moved in and like, yeah, let's fucking hang out and

1224
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,340
fucking, and fucking hang out.

1225
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:53,460
So I fucking, so, so she, she messages me one night while I'm there.

1226
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,940
She's like, Hey, I had a, I had a big fight with my dad.

1227
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,340
I, my, my dad's a jerk.

1228
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,060
I hate my dad.

1229
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,460
I'm like, Oh no, what's your dad like?

1230
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,140
So she starts telling me about her dad.

1231
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,900
So, you know, so I go over there.

1232
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,140
I climb, I climb the hill.

1233
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,100
I hop the fence.

1234
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,060
I go over to her yard.

1235
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,460
We sit on her, on her back porch.

1236
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,700
We have to be quiet cause her parents are sleeping.

1237
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,580
And, and, and so I'm just sitting there on her porch.

1238
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,180
I put my arm around her.

1239
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,260
She's, she's like crying about her dad.

1240
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,060
I put my arm around her.

1241
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,780
We, we look at the stars together.

1242
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,980
We talk, we bond.

1243
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,580
At night, we, we, we gave a little kiss.

1244
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,740
Got a little kiss that night.

1245
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,540
Nice.

1246
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,140
And I, and I.

1247
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:33,940
On the dick.

1248
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,660
Hey, hey, hey, don't make my story.

1249
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,380
This is a, this is still an innocent.

1250
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,380
You don't sully it with your porn fantasies.

1251
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,060
You're still, you're still on the, you're still playing the, the Marvin Gaye.

1252
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,500
You haven't yet switched over to the DMX.

1253
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,500
I'm still.

1254
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,140
That's right.

1255
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:56,060
I'm, I'm still, I'm still dabbing the, the lube on the butthole.

1256
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,780
I'm not pushing on it yet.

1257
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:04,180
So I went back to my house and I went to bed that night feeling so fucking groovy.

1258
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,900
So like, yes, I have a girly friend.

1259
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,620
I'm going to get more kisses.

1260
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,860
Maybe I'll even see a bub.

1261
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,420
I was so excited.

1262
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:20,180
So the next day she comes over to my house and we start kissing more because

1263
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,700
now it's a thing that we do now.

1264
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,900
And now we kiss and we were fucking making out.

1265
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:28,100
We started making out, I started touching boobs, started touching her fucking body.

1266
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,900
Pulling her, I gotta start off, got her fucking pants off, started touching that,

1267
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,020
that, that, oh, that little, little hairy 17 year old puss.

1268
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,820
And that's, and that's why I'll turn B.

1269
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,820
That went through the air.

1270
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,940
You just heard that one, that one song coming out of the ether.

1271
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,380
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga.

1272
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,420
I leave you stank, nigga.

1273
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,260
What the fuck you thinking, nigga?

1274
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,540
Yeah, that was the one.

1275
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,340
No, no, this is the, this is the song I heard off in the distance.

1276
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,940
Bork, Orph, Bork, Bork.

1277
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,500
I got a tiny little puppy dog erection stick it inside your Johnny with a protection.

1278
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,060
So, so I was touching on the vagina.

1279
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:16,540
I was holding her, her, her, her smaller, her thin little frail, perfect little

1280
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:21,580
teenage body in my hands, you know, holding, holding a young woman's

1281
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,900
body in your hands, feeling her, her skin in your palms.

1282
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,940
You know, you just realize at that moment, I realize that this is the only

1283
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,060
thing that's real in life.

1284
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,580
Everything else is the fucking matrix.

1285
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,660
This is all that there is.

1286
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,860
This is all that, this is all that will ever matter to me.

1287
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:41,020
This is, this is my fucking, this is my desert of the real.

1288
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,500
And I am fucking Morpheus.

1289
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,660
I am Morpheus and Neo combined.

1290
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,740
I am the one.

1291
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,980
I am all the ones.

1292
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,900
I'm Jet Lee combining all the ones into one one.

1293
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,820
Everyone wants a munchie.

1294
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,860
In that moment, my Christ consciousness levels skyrocketed to a plateau

1295
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,140
never seen before or since by anyone in history.

1296
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:08,060
Just fucking holding that small, young, sexy, sex with the young woman in my hands.

1297
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,580
Yeah, I can still fucking picture it in my mind's eye.

1298
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,900
It gives me power in that moment.

1299
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:19,660
In California, a being was created by the name of Munchie, who had all the powers

1300
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,220
of this Christ consciousness.

1301
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,820
That's the origin of the munchie.

1302
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,540
Yeah, that's where it comes from.

1303
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,060
So we were getting real hot and heavy, me and this girl.

1304
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,700
And I was, I was, I was touching that little vagina.

1305
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,420
I was touching those bubies.

1306
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,820
And then I got, I got the blow job.

1307
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,180
I got the bludge people.

1308
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:41,660
Nice.

1309
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,260
The blow.

1310
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,340
I got it.

1311
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,500
I got a nice.

1312
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,300
I got just, just, oh, that, that, that, that, that perfect inexperienced,

1313
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,300
toothy, 17 year old, bloge.

1314
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,220
The best thing that you can experience in life.

1315
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,420
Tray magnifique.

1316
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,380
Yes.

1317
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,220
Oh, it was so cool.

1318
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:02,820
So cool.

1319
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,140
Yeah, so cool.

1320
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,460
So when do you actually get played?

1321
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,260
I'm not there yet.

1322
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:09,460
I'm not.

1323
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:11,940
This story has layers.

1324
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,780
It has chapters.

1325
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,540
It's a saga.

1326
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,260
It's an onion, like Shrek.

1327
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,620
Right.

1328
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,180
My, my, my, this story is like a section of half.

1329
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,860
This story is almost as good as Shrek.

1330
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:22,940
Yeah.

1331
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,860
So we were doing the stuff.

1332
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,260
Somebody once told me.

1333
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,140
Hey, depending on what year this was, that could very well have been playing.

1334
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,060
I know Jesse was a big Smash Mouth fan.

1335
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,860
Shrek is just the story of Jesse's life in the ogre form.

1336
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,340
Taking girls back to my astral lounge and, and sexing with the young.

1337
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,700
And they're fucking swamped, don't you?

1338
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:52,940
No, no, no.

1339
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,620
Back then in my old house, I lived in the upstairs.

1340
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:56,820
Yeah.

1341
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,540
I had like a patio on the roof that I could walk out and do with a door.

1342
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,100
It was awesome.

1343
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,300
It was tops blueby.

1344
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,780
But anyways, you know, I was, we were, first we were at my house and I was

1345
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,060
touching on the vagina there.

1346
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,060
And then we, we went and we hopped the fence over to her house and that's

1347
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,980
where I got the bloge.

1348
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,540
So I got the bloge at her house.

1349
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,460
But, um, but she goes, Oh boy, my dad's going to be home any minute.

1350
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:16,900
You got it.

1351
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,940
You got to get on out of here.

1352
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,940
So I, I fucking left and I walked home feeling good.

1353
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,500
Oh my God, I got a bloge.

1354
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,940
I got a fucking toothy 17 year old bloge.

1355
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,860
Oh my God.

1356
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,420
And I fucking, I went to my fucking house and I went to bed that night feeling

1357
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:33,580
like any day now, any day now I'm going to have the sex, the real sex.

1358
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:41,020
The next day she sends me a long message on my space.

1359
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,140
Oh, we went too far, too fast.

1360
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,220
I'm not ready for this.

1361
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:54,540
Sex with the young sex with the young sex with the young.

1362
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,220
The mistake.

1363
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:55,900
Don't do it.

1364
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,060
Sex with the young.

1365
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,660
It was tragically ripped away from me.

1366
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,820
80 years later, Jesse still crawls the land to this day looking for bloge.

1367
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:12,380
She's crawling through the desert, malnourished, dust on my breath.

1368
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,540
Sex with the young.

1369
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:24,100
Wandering the streets of the city of fallen angels.

1370
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,660
Wandering with my little cup full of spare change.

1371
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,980
Sex with the young, sir.

1372
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,740
Can anyone spare some sex with the young?

1373
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,860
Jesus.

1374
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:40,460
The fucking the sheriff of Nottingham combs and pushes me in the mud and says,

1375
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,460
Get a job.

1376
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,100
He takes all my fucking spare sex with the young out of my cup.

1377
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,180
You almost have a whole one.

1378
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:52,420
There's that that clockwork orange scene where your two old high school buddies

1379
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,820
who were your droogs, they find you out of the street.

1380
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,380
They drag you to the fucking bathtub and just drown you for fun.

1381
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,060
Just to watch you suffer.

1382
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,180
We've got sex with the young.

1383
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,820
Where's your sex with the young?

1384
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,300
My droogs.

1385
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,060
My loyal droogs.

1386
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,580
Every time Jesse comes close to having sex with the young,

1387
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,220
it triggers the memories of the program he went through.

1388
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,420
And he has to be like, he becomes paralyzed and his dick falls off

1389
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,020
and he just can't even do anything.

1390
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,660
I hear the fucking Beethoven.

1391
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,780
No, they play fucking Macklemore.

1392
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,540
No, stop it, stop it, please.

1393
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,140
No, no.

1394
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,940
Yeah, I hear the fuck they gave me the fucking Ludovico technique

1395
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,100
where they fucking played that Macklemore song telling me

1396
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,660
I have too much white privilege and I can play it straight to it.

1397
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,580
Now whenever I try to have sex with the young, I have to read an article.

1398
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,580
Little did they know that would create the greatest white privilege warrior

1399
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,980
the world had ever seen.

1400
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,180
So, Jesse, I gotta tell you.

1401
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,740
Yeah, what the fuck else happened?

1402
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,140
She didn't act three.

1403
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:59,660
So she broke, so she broke up with me and I was fucking devastated.

1404
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,460
Not just because I liked this girl and my heart was broken,

1405
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,940
but also because I was fucking close to losing my virginity.

1406
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,140
And it was ripped away from me tragically.

1407
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:14,220
So, so as a young man would do as like a however the fuck I was

1408
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:18,100
19, 20, 39, whatever the fuck I said, I raped her.

1409
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,180
Yeah, of course.

1410
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:20,940
She owes you.

1411
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,180
She owes you at this point.

1412
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,540
It's time to take what you owe.

1413
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,980
You know, I just I flipped out, I was not mature enough to handle it.

1414
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,660
I was blown away that I had gotten so close.

1415
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:35,260
So, of course, I begged and I pleaded and I did all the, you know,

1416
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,060
the beta cut shit.

1417
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,220
I was very pathetic.

1418
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,140
I didn't beg for sex.

1419
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,020
I begged for her to like to get back with me.

1420
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,260
Oh, OK, of course.

1421
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,500
That was Jay Bauman back in my school.

1422
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,900
I wouldn't blame you, though.

1423
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,420
I beg for sex every day.

1424
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,820
Yeah, so my favorite thing to do.

1425
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:52,580
So the breakup got really ugly and really weird.

1426
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,940
It got really horrible.

1427
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,580
She ended up like telling like all of her friends at school that I was like a

1428
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,980
like a bad guy or like a creeper or pervert or something.

1429
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,220
Oh, God, what the fuck?

1430
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,220
It was fucking terrible.

1431
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,020
Fuck, I remember.

1432
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,420
Buyers remorse.

1433
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,500
Yeah, this one guy who was like a friend of both of ours.

1434
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,540
I'll say his name, Chris Peters, because he's a fucking piece of shit.

1435
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,980
Fuck you, Chris Peters.

1436
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,180
Yeah, I hate him to this day.

1437
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,260
You know, he was like he was like a friend of both of ours.

1438
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:21,220
And he like sent me he sent me this message one day like out of the blue

1439
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,500
like calling me like a sick pig.

1440
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,420
You sick motherfucker.

1441
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,660
You're fucking down.

1442
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,860
All these like made up rumors of the stuff that I supposedly did typical

1443
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,300
orbiter behavior.

1444
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:31,900
Yeah, exactly.

1445
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,540
He's the one who sucked your dick.

1446
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,420
Yeah, exactly.

1447
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,740
She's the pervert.

1448
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,260
You know, he's coerced her, though.

1449
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,900
He was too sexual of a man.

1450
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:39,860
It's his fault.

1451
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,660
Yeah, exactly.

1452
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,660
Doctor.

1453
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,620
Yeah, I was too irresistible.

1454
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:48,460
You know, I, you know, I made her abandon her scruples and she she couldn't take it.

1455
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,860
She had to she had to lash out at me.

1456
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:53,220
So I was like I was like persona non grata.

1457
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,980
I was like fucking ostracized.

1458
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:59,180
My personal and professional reputation was ruined in my hometown.

1459
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,460
Everyone, everyone hated me.

1460
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,980
You know, I was banned from the theater.

1461
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,260
I was banned from I was banned from the high school, even though I had graduated a year earlier.

1462
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,860
I they had to keep me away from all the young.

1463
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,380
I'm sure they were they revoked your key to the city at this point.

1464
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,220
Yeah, they tore down my statue.

1465
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:29,500
So, so at this point, I'm just I'm just like a shell of a man.

1466
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,180
I'm just a I'm just a fucking broken boy.

1467
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,900
I'm walking around.

1468
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,660
I'm just a fucking I'm just I'm just as fucking sad.

1469
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,780
I'm a lost puppy dog boy howling at the fucking moon.

1470
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,220
Bark off, bark off.

1471
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,100
I'm fucking lost in this world.

1472
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,780
I have no one and I'm feeling I'm like this is it.

1473
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,620
I'm never going to lose my virginity.

1474
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,580
I'm going to be I'm going to be like this alone.

1475
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,140
It's never going to happen for me.

1476
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:58,100
You know, I had gone through high school watching all my buddies, you know, one by one, high five each other.

1477
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,980
One by one, they all had that morning, walking in and high fiving each other at the fucking lunch table.

1478
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,940
And every fucking time there were more high fives that I wasn't a part of.

1479
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:11,940
I had to fucking you know, it does something to a boy, you know, watching everyone lose it.

1480
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:16,860
But you and then you fucking and then you get so close and you fucking I was just hopeless at this point.

1481
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:26,300
And I was I was on my fucking rock bottom and I was like that for a whole another year of like when's when's it going to happen.

1482
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,100
And so then, you know, and during that time I kept trying.

1483
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,500
I just kept fucking, you know, when I fucking saw her on Facebook, I'd messenger.

1484
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,460
I'd try so hard to make conversation with girls.

1485
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,420
Oh, God, Facebook came around by this point.

1486
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,740
That's how long it took.

1487
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,100
Yeah, yep.

1488
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:50,620
I think I think the the the dear John letter I got from Adriana was was the end of my space for me as I had to go to Facebook at that point.

1489
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:57,340
You know, and so the year went by and there was all kinds of, you know, more awkward, terrible fucking things.

1490
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,700
There was a fucking thing with a girl that I fucking spooned with one night and it got weird.

1491
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:06,580
There was and she got mad at me and that made me they ruined my reputation even more.

1492
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:11,940
There was like five girls that I that I tried to rape, but they all beat me up because they all knew karate one time.

1493
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:17,580
It was fucking all these karate girls got off a bus and I thought they were regular girls and I could rape them.

1494
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,220
But it turns out they were karate girls.

1495
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,740
If it would any other bus, it would have worked like a charm.

1496
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,740
Fate just it wasn't in the cards in this day.

1497
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,620
And who's just going to try the next bus?

1498
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:31,780
Like at this point, you know, you're all battered and beaten up.

1499
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:35,940
And you just like the wily coyote trying to get sex and boulders keep falling on your.

1500
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,580
Sometimes you just got to know when to call it quits and cut your losses.

1501
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:44,340
All these damn acme broads, they always backfire on you.

1502
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,820
What is the road runner cartoon but an allegory for male sexuality?

1503
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,700
That's really what it is at the end of the day.

1504
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,100
I mean, we all know that a girl's version of karate is to kick you in the balls.

1505
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:57,260
So he probably had like his balls were probably just in pieces at this point.

1506
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,060
That's right. That's right.

1507
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:04,860
So the story is reminiscent of how I met your mother where like eight seasons of the story have nothing to do with what happened.

1508
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,100
And the people are still clamoring for more at the end of it.

1509
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,100
They don't want it to ever end.

1510
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,260
That's so far the weakest last three seasons I've ever seen.

1511
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,340
They said they say, God damn it, Jason Siegel, tell a new story, please.

1512
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,180
Don't abandon us.

1513
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,420
That wasn't Jason Siegel, it was Bob Saget telling the story.

1514
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,180
I never watched that shitty fucking show, I don't know.

1515
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,340
Learn your how I met your mother, Laura, you stupid.

1516
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,540
I would rather fucking die than watch that shit.

1517
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,300
That fucking country.

1518
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,300
It has that Patrick O'Neill of what's his name?

1519
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,100
Yeah, it's not even a real anime here.

1520
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,100
He makes funny meme jokes, dude.

1521
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,620
All right, I need to know the rest of the story.

1522
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,620
Yeah.

1523
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,620
Neil Patrick Harris.

1524
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:41,620
It was Neil Patrick Harris.

1525
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,620
That's the guy.

1526
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:43,620
So surely we're near the climax.

1527
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,620
Neil Patrick Harris.

1528
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:49,500
So I fucking, I desperately tried, I tried for a year still to try and make hours ago.

1529
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:56,460
I finally got a girl to be like responsive to me and it was another girl who had apparently

1530
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,620
had a huge crush on me in high school and never said anything about it because I guess

1531
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,980
girls just think, you know, they don't have to say anything about it.

1532
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,540
It is my fault somehow.

1533
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,540
Fuck you.

1534
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,060
You know, there's another girl who finally is like, okay, I got her to come over, I got

1535
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,740
her to come over to my house.

1536
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:15,500
There's another girl whose name, whose identity that I will protect.

1537
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:21,100
I'll give her fake name, fucking secretariat.

1538
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:32,940
So this beautiful, this beautiful gorgeous young horsewoman comes to me.

1539
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:39,180
Over to my house to hang out and we just started kissing and we just started making out and

1540
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,180
I remember my bed was a futon and it was currently in couch mode.

1541
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:46,500
So we were laying in the couch on the couch in my room with the lights off.

1542
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:51,740
We were just making out and touching each other more and more for hours and hours.

1543
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:55,740
And we, I just, you know, got her clothes off by the way.

1544
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,380
I have a perfect, I have a basically a flawless record except for that first time.

1545
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:04,060
She's always sex on the first date and ever since then, no one will ever stop it.

1546
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,900
We were fucking touching, we were making out and I got it in her.

1547
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:07,900
I got it.

1548
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:08,900
You got it.

1549
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,900
You got it.

1550
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:10,900
You got it.

1551
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,900
Monkey.

1552
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,900
Monkey, you were absolutely right.

1553
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,900
The story had nothing to do with the ending.

1554
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,300
The whole thing was just a big fucking shaggy dog.

1555
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,300
We'll see.

1556
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,300
That's what I was saying at the start.

1557
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:23,220
Well, when you're talking about a man, you're describing the story of a man's entire life.

1558
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,220
That's right.

1559
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,700
You philistines.

1560
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,500
You needed the emotional arc to find out.

1561
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,340
Without the emotional arc, you just get a Ben story.

1562
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,300
It's like, oh, yeah.

1563
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,300
That's right.

1564
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,300
And that's what people want.

1565
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,300
No one wants a Ben story.

1566
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,300
That's what people want.

1567
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,300
No one wants a Ben story.

1568
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,300
They want clear, concise, sterile Ben stories.

1569
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Your story was awful.

1570
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,700
My story has a fucking human element that people can relate to.

1571
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,060
That's why people fucking love me.

1572
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:52,300
That's why I get the patron dollars more than Ben does and always will.

1573
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,300
That's why.

1574
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:57,420
When you began telling your story, I went out to like get some tea and it took two minutes

1575
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,060
and I missed the whole story.

1576
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,180
I understand people.

1577
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:04,340
I know how to connect with people on an emotional level.

1578
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:10,340
And so, you know, as I was saying, Ben wasn't here for Nate's story, which had the entire

1579
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,820
story of him going to Japan and coming back.

1580
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,820
That is super relevant.

1581
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:14,820
That is super relevant.

1582
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,580
I want to say about this story too.

1583
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:22,020
I could have gone on about my life story leading up to like when I went to college and met a

1584
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,140
girl and all that shit, but like it's not relevant to the actual act of how I lost my

1585
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,140
virginity.

1586
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,540
You have to know the fucking emotional arc.

1587
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,660
You got to know about the fucking John Hughes prom.

1588
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:35,580
You got to know about the fucking police cops who took my sword away.

1589
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:39,700
You got to know about the thought of the fence that I had the hop of fence.

1590
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,700
You got to know everything.

1591
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,660
I think Ben might have elaborate more if he had heard the story.

1592
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,460
This is a story that I think I would have.

1593
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:49,020
And now I'm kind of fucking lamenting that I didn't fucking know what I was working

1594
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,020
on.

1595
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,020
Maybe you should be on time to the fucking PCP.

1596
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,540
The story that spans from my space to Facebook.

1597
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:59,540
The greatest expanse in human history.

1598
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:03,100
I'm just, look, I could have, god damn it, I could have spun a yarn.

1599
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,500
I could have spun y'all a yarn, but now it's too late.

1600
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,500
Fuck y'all.

1601
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,500
You don't deserve it.

1602
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,500
I don't care.

1603
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,500
Shut up.

1604
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,500
I'm not even done.

1605
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,500
We were making love.

1606
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:15,660
Me and this fine, this fine young mama's seat, we were making sweet love on that couch

1607
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,660
in the dark.

1608
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,460
We made love for like fucking eight hours, you know, my mom came home and she's like

1609
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:21,460
blah, blah, blah.

1610
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,460
I'm like shut up.

1611
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:26,980
I'm making love to a beautiful young woman in here and ma, get out of here.

1612
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:27,980
Get out.

1613
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:33,740
And I'm fucking making love and it was, you know, it was, it was, it was that very special

1614
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:38,420
kind of, kind of like awkward and terrible, but also passionate and awesome first time

1615
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,140
sex that can only happen that one special night in your life with that, with that one

1616
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,460
special girl.

1617
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,620
And so we did it.

1618
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:49,420
And so then after I took her home, I came home and I was so amped that I just started

1619
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,740
eating everything in the house.

1620
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:52,220
I ate all the food in the whole house.

1621
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:56,380
I fucking opened up a can of beans, like fucking skull monkeys, cold beans, a whole, a cold

1622
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,380
can of beans.

1623
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,980
I just fucking devoured it like an animal.

1624
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:00,980
I was a man possessed.

1625
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:05,660
I was fully in touch with the primal, manimal beast, the ancient thing deep in my lizard

1626
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,060
brain had awoken.

1627
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:13,100
And so then the next day she came over and we, we watched Rambo too.

1628
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:18,060
We watched Rambo first blood part two and then we, we did it a million more times and

1629
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:23,380
then we dated for like a couple of years and it was a good time and that was, it was the

1630
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,580
most important story ever, better than Ben's.

1631
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,580
And that's all that matters.

1632
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,580
Yeah.

1633
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,660
I think everybody's is better than Ben's.

1634
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,660
You fucking, you fucking faggots.

1635
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,660
All right.

1636
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,660
Hey, hey, hey.

1637
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:40,420
Ben was a cliff notes of, of, uh, absolutely gets, uh, hey, but before we move on, I just

1638
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,980
want, I thought it'd be interesting just to point out how, uh, cause you know, everyone

1639
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,940
was saying Jesse went on for a long time before the actual act.

1640
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,100
But I think that that's really what's interesting about it because to everybody out there who's

1641
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:55,220
a virgin right now, it's not like you just miraculously have sex one day.

1642
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:58,380
It is about a real, a real life struggle.

1643
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:03,060
You have to go through like Jesse, both you and I had innumerable, innumerable failures

1644
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,060
on our past.

1645
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,060
That's what I'm saying.

1646
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:09,660
Everyone has to go through that because like you were saying at the beginning, we all have

1647
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:15,700
friends who are virgins, who are late bloomers as we were and who are, who are losing hope.

1648
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:19,820
They're going to, they're going to lose hope as I once almost did, but you can't lose

1649
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,260
hope because it's going to happen.

1650
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:22,900
It's going to happen if you keep trying.

1651
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:23,900
That's the moral of the story.

1652
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,940
That's why I had to tell you about all the failures, all the struggles, all the trials

1653
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:32,940
and tribulations you had to get real, getting a lady is exactly like working out in that

1654
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:37,220
it is an ability that you can start training at any time and get really fit and get really

1655
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,380
swole or get really good at getting girls at any time you can start.

1656
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,660
So if you're 80 fucking years old, just start now and in a couple months you'll have one.

1657
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,980
I guarantee it if you work at it.

1658
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:51,140
Incidentally, I might as well, for the members of our audience who don't also listen to the

1659
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:56,860
dick show, I'll give you dicks, two most important tips for picking up chicks which have worked

1660
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:59,020
for tons of people.

1661
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:04,620
Number one, your opening line, comment about their shoes.

1662
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,620
That's a good tangible word.

1663
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:10,860
It works on all women, no matter what, if you just say, hey, I like your shoes, it will

1664
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,860
be an opener.

1665
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,860
Just talk about their shoes.

1666
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:13,860
Because they're also shallow and stupid.

1667
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:17,060
You just take care about their shoes.

1668
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:23,500
No, let me fucking fix all of your wagon right now and tell you why that line works.

1669
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,740
It's not because women are stupid or because they're shallow, it's because literally anything

1670
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:27,740
can work.

1671
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,740
It doesn't matter what you say.

1672
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,740
It doesn't matter what your opening line is or stupid thing about their shoes.

1673
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,740
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1674
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1675
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:38,660
The thing about the shoes specifically is that all women wear shoes and, well, for the

1676
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:42,420
most part, is that no matter what they're going to be wearing it, but it jungles lots

1677
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,460
I'm fucking do.

1678
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:47,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

1679
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:53,180
If you compliment a girl's shirt, it looks like you're looking at her tits.

1680
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:58,340
If you compliment this or that, there's some things that girls don't want to be complimented

1681
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,700
on or that it'll mean the wrong thing to them.

1682
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,980
But if it's just the shoes.

1683
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:03,980
No, no, no.

1684
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:04,980
Here's why.

1685
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:07,220
It's because men don't think about shoes.

1686
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:11,660
I drew a character design last night and my girlfriend was like, where's the shoes?

1687
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:14,020
And I was like, oh, yeah, I didn't think about shoes.

1688
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,180
I am male.

1689
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:18,500
So girls are not accustomed to men commenting on shoes.

1690
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:23,380
So what you're telling me is that what women want out of men actually being considerate.

1691
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:27,140
So what women want out of men is a woman is what you're telling me.

1692
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,140
All right.

1693
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:32,740
Step one is that a woman is nothing more than a bigger six year old girl.

1694
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,700
And instead of dressing her dolls, she's now dressing herself.

1695
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,700
Of course.

1696
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:37,700
Always with the red pills, Mom.

1697
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,700
Thank you for keeping us safe.

1698
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:45,940
So aside from that, the shoes are the opening line and it's you can find there's other opening

1699
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,220
lines you can use.

1700
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:52,940
I should have the other day when I recorded my my what was it, neurotic stories from real

1701
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:58,380
man where I had my failed story of where if I had just asked the girl about the beer,

1702
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,500
it would have been the perfect opener.

1703
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,500
But I failed miserably.

1704
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,260
If you haven't heard that story, it's on my Reddit.

1705
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:07,020
But so but but shoes are a universal.

1706
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,900
All girls are wearing shoes, compliment the shoes.

1707
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,500
You don't even have to look at the shoes.

1708
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,100
So what's good about it is that it's when you can use any time.

1709
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,980
It's because it's something that women put a lot of thought into is what fucking pair

1710
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:18,980
of shoes they're going to wear.

1711
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,220
And nobody mentions it.

1712
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,780
All they hear all day is you've got a nice rack, you've got a pretty face, but you should

1713
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,100
smile more and your hair is pretty.

1714
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,100
Everybody says the same thing.

1715
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,100
Smile more.

1716
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,100
Yeah.

1717
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,100
Yeah.

1718
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:34,740
And so and then the second important line because you've got yourself in the door with

1719
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,740
the shoes.

1720
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,940
But now you're lost because you don't know what to talk about because you don't know this

1721
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:38,940
girl actually.

1722
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,940
You're just you just started to write a conversation.

1723
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:47,300
So if things seem to be going well, you bust out what's your dad like?

1724
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,100
Ask them about their dad.

1725
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,820
It doesn't matter if they have a good or bad relationship with their dad, either way, they're

1726
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:56,020
going to open up and become more intimate in the conversation.

1727
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,740
And that's what you want.

1728
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:58,740
So yeah.

1729
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,740
No, no, no.

1730
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,740
This is all.

1731
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,740
Follow up with that.

1732
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:05,300
What you're laying here is all a bunch of like secondhand stuff that he's heard.

1733
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,300
Yeah.

1734
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,300
Another man say.

1735
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,300
From the.

1736
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,300
Aren't you going to.

1737
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,300
From many colors.

1738
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,300
I'll give you.

1739
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,300
I'll give people a real tip.

1740
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,140
I'll give people a just tip and this was is tried and tested.

1741
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:19,580
The true way to get women is not with some some magical pickup line that you're going

1742
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,780
to go up to some stranger and talk to someone like that's going to happen.

1743
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,060
It's just a template.

1744
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:27,420
It's not something that's always going to work or that you just guaranteed.

1745
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,580
I think that people know.

1746
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:33,380
I think people really need to quit being bitches and be less afraid to fucking talk to each

1747
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:38,020
other in real life and go and fucking hit on a girl in public because who fucking cares.

1748
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:39,020
You're absolutely wrong, Ben.

1749
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,220
And I'll tell you why.

1750
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,940
Because anyone who fucking approaches any other human being for any reason in public

1751
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,540
is a piece of shit and I want them to die.

1752
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:46,540
Hey, actually, I.

1753
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:49,700
Anyone fucking came up and started talking to me whether it was a man woman or child

1754
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,780
that would snap their head backwards and let them fucking twitch on the floor until

1755
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,740
their life escaped from their eyes.

1756
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:56,740
Hey, it's.

1757
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:57,740
No one should.

1758
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:59,380
I'm giving a fucking just tip.

1759
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,380
God damn it.

1760
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:05,620
This is the only real fucking tip is to just fucking evolve into into a man.

1761
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,100
You have to have that women want to come to you.

1762
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,100
That's the only fucking tip.

1763
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,100
You fucking because.

1764
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,100
Well, yeah, sure.

1765
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:16,660
I have zero respect that's hard for anyone who fucking approaches a stranger and tries

1766
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,900
to fucking hit on them.

1767
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,220
They just look pathetic to me.

1768
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,940
They look like pathetic little weak fuck.

1769
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:21,940
No.

1770
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:22,940
No.

1771
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:23,940
Fuck you, dude.

1772
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:24,940
Searching for women.

1773
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:25,940
Like a fucking caveman.

1774
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:26,940
I'm a hunter gatherer.

1775
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:27,940
What are you talking about?

1776
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:28,940
Picking berries in the fucking jungle.

1777
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:31,980
Like desperately like standing out there like a bullfrog shooting your fucking neck

1778
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:35,460
sack out saying, please, some woman in here, please like me.

1779
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,460
Do you like me?

1780
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:40,940
If you have the balls to go out and try to make a human connection, put yourself out

1781
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:41,940
there.

1782
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:42,940
You're a fucking hero.

1783
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,940
It's not as cool as celebrating.

1784
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:44,940
Talking to girls.

1785
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:48,100
Talking to girls is scary and it's scary and it takes fucking.

1786
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,100
It takes fucking courage.

1787
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,100
It takes balls.

1788
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,100
It takes fucking courage.

1789
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:55,500
I'll tell you what takes courage being a great man takes courage working day in and day out

1790
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:59,700
to be better at your fucking chosen profession than anyone else to where you're so fucking

1791
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:04,660
good to where you're so talented and so inspirational that women everywhere flock to you that you

1792
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,660
don't have to go up to them.

1793
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,660
That's what makes a real man.

1794
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,660
That takes courage.

1795
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:08,660
That's what we should tell.

1796
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:12,060
That's what we should tell every fucking lonely guy out there.

1797
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,060
Don't approach them.

1798
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,060
Yes, it is what we should tell them.

1799
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,060
Don't talk to women.

1800
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,060
Be a better man.

1801
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:19,780
Just whoever you are, no matter what, just stay home and practice your shit or whatever

1802
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:23,700
and eventually you'll be so fucking good that every fucking girl will come and hit on

1803
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,700
you.

1804
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,580
How does this work for people in non-creative positions?

1805
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,580
It does.

1806
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:29,580
Fuck them!

1807
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,580
Fuck people in non-creative positions.

1808
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,580
That's what I thought.

1809
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,580
They're less than human.

1810
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,380
They don't deserve to live on my planet anyways.

1811
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,620
So you know, guys, you know, everyone knows, oh, you just got to get good at talking to

1812
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:42,980
people, but it's like, do you want to go through the whole pressure of failing at that over

1813
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:43,980
and over again?

1814
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:48,180
You're going to have to, but I have a life hack for how to train up those skills in some

1815
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:50,780
regard without as much of the shame.

1816
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:51,780
Omega.

1817
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:55,460
You know, whether or not the person that you're talking to is actually female or is actually

1818
01:18:55,460 --> 01:19:00,380
90 years old, the fact is they're a human and you can use that as sort of like a punching

1819
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:06,060
bag to train your strength of talking, breaking the ice, figuring out what question to follow

1820
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,060
up another question.

1821
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:12,660
Just go on Omega for like hours into the night and just practice because when it goes wrong,

1822
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:16,100
you just pull the plug and you don't feel that much shame because they don't know anything

1823
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,100
about you.

1824
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,100
That's what you've got to do in real life.

1825
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,500
That's what you've got to do in real life.

1826
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:25,420
I honestly feel like that was how I leveled up my ability to fucking like talk to people

1827
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:31,020
and like give off the air of being natural and fluid in the conversation.

1828
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:34,900
I knew how to like progress the discussion without it seeming forced, but still being

1829
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,220
interesting.

1830
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,300
That was how I trained.

1831
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:43,580
What happened to just being like a normal, like a cool person and you know, you hang

1832
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:48,700
out and you talk to people, you get to know people slowly in your circles who grow to

1833
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,740
like you because you're just cool.

1834
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:51,740
And it happens.

1835
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:54,740
Let me tell you, I'll tell you what happened for these cowards, these chicken ship pushy

1836
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,980
men who walk up to strangers.

1837
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:03,860
It makes me sick to think that if you're not meeting strangers, then you're never going

1838
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,460
to fucking expand your fucking circle.

1839
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,460
All right.

1840
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:09,940
That's exactly what what happened, Jesse, is that the real world has changed and people

1841
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,700
spend their days alone.

1842
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:14,220
They need resources that they can use to God.

1843
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,660
Meeple, we don't just work on fucking farms now and you're, you're co-mingly with people

1844
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:18,660
all the time.

1845
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:22,020
I mean, people fucking work IT jobs, they sit behind a computer all day.

1846
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,340
There needs to be things they can do if they're going to meet people because their day-to-day

1847
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,660
life doesn't introduce them to people in a regular way.

1848
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:28,660
It's fucking psychotic.

1849
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:32,620
They have to, it's not like, no, what is psychotic is the lifestyle that we've all been living

1850
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:36,580
as humans in the 21st century where we live isolated, alone lives.

1851
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:41,740
We need to strategize to make our society function so that people have opportunities to have

1852
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:45,380
the real human interactions that you're talking about because they don't arise naturally anymore.

1853
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:46,420
Primitive?

1854
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:50,820
Like, this fucking primitive, like standing around like a peacock, going around fucking

1855
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:54,660
coming up to women like a fucking monkey and fucking approaching strangers.

1856
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:58,700
You know, maybe some people don't want to be approached and talked to by a stranger.

1857
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:02,180
Maybe some people, maybe- SHUT UP, MUNCHY!

1858
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:05,820
Maybe some people- FUCK OFF, HOLY SHIT!

1859
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,820
Maybe some people have social anxiety.

1860
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:10,900
Maybe some people don't want to be fucking talked at by a fucking stranger.

1861
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:14,860
Maybe people shouldn't fucking think it's normal to walk up to someone like a fucking

1862
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:19,060
psycho and start trying to hit on a fucking stranger who might not fucking want it.

1863
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:23,260
It's retarded and psychotic and creepy and it's fucking- it's like a- you're like a fucking

1864
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,260
animal.

1865
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:27,780
Why is everyone a fucking goddamn primitive idiot but me?

1866
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:32,100
So you advocate for never introducing yourself to people and not-

1867
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,740
Never talk to anyone.

1868
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,900
I just want to thank Munchy for coming in and peeing while Jess was screaming.

1869
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:37,900
Yeah, I heard that.

1870
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:38,900
I heard that.

1871
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:39,900
It was not eco-hered.

1872
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:45,900
Holy crap, I advocate being a regular fucking guy and like talking-

1873
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:48,900
No, you advocate being a YouTube star who women approach.

1874
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,900
That's what you said the first time.

1875
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,900
Yeah.

1876
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:52,900
How's that regular?

1877
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:53,900
Yeah, it works for you.

1878
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,900
What about- what about the rest of the world?

1879
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:56,900
Hey!

1880
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:57,900
Hey!

1881
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,900
What about me and my blue collar?

1882
01:21:58,900 --> 01:21:59,900
Hey!

1883
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,900
Yeah.

1884
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:04,900
I fucking- I was able to get girls before YouTube by being a normal fucking person who

1885
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,460
was just cool and funny and you know when I- when I'd go around in my social circles

1886
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,460
and- and I would fucking hang out with people.

1887
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,300
Where do you get these social circles?

1888
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,300
Where are you developing-

1889
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,300
Jesse, Jesse-

1890
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,300
Because fucking friends have friends of friends!

1891
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,300
That's how human beings meet!

1892
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,660
Wait, look, the first friend!

1893
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:20,660
Where does the-

1894
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,660
No, I-

1895
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:22,660
The age of zero-

1896
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,660
What?

1897
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,660
No, you know what?

1898
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:25,660
No, you know what?

1899
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:28,100
Look, I think if you've got a fucking healthy social circle then yeah, you probably are

1900
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,540
gonna be meeting new people in the course of fucking, you know, your circles- your circles

1901
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,140
connecting to other circles and stuff.

1902
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:38,180
Yeah, I think that's legit, but like, I'm talking about what if you don't have that?

1903
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,180
What if you're just fucked?

1904
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,180
Yeah, what if you have no-

1905
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,180
Then fuck you!

1906
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,180
What-

1907
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,260
What matters, what matters is thinking about this question in the context of the audience

1908
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,580
who's hearing it right now.

1909
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:48,940
And these people don't need the kind of advice like, go be a YouTube star.

1910
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:49,940
They need tangible things-

1911
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:50,940
I'm giving them advice!

1912
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:51,940
Go be a regular person!

1913
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:53,940
Go outside and be like a normal, nice guy!

1914
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:54,940
Look, I'm just saying-

1915
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:55,940
Okay.

1916
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:58,740
What if you've got- what if you're- what if you're like a bunch of- what if all your

1917
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,300
friends are like a bunch of nerds who just hang out and fucking, I don't know, play Magic

1918
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,500
the Gathering all the time and you never go out and you never meet anyone?

1919
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,500
Well, you know, there's the-

1920
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,500
Then you're fucked.

1921
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,540
Okay, well, there has been this invention called the World Wide Web and there are like

1922
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,740
trillions of dating sites that- that are free that people go on and they-

1923
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:16,740
Yeah, just in your own system.

1924
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:17,740
I'm not against that.

1925
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:21,220
They came up to you at prom and gave you a fucking blowjob a year later.

1926
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:23,740
If she didn't approach you as a stranger, you never would've got that blowjob.

1927
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,940
There we fucking go.

1928
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:25,940
There we go.

1929
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:26,940
I wasn't a stranger.

1930
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:27,940
I knew her.

1931
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:28,940
We went to fucking school together.

1932
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:29,940
But she's-

1933
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:35,220
Look, I'm sure she- she approached me because she knew me and lied to me and saw me hanging

1934
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:36,220
out.

1935
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,460
Nobody fucking should approach strangers randomly.

1936
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,460
Jesse, Jesse, okay.

1937
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:40,460
I- I agree that it'd be great.

1938
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:43,820
What's wrong with striking up a fucking conversation in public?

1939
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:46,460
Because I don't want a stranger to fucking talk to me.

1940
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,460
Well, listen, you don't want to strike up a conversation.

1941
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,460
You don't want to-

1942
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,460
You don't want to-

1943
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,460
Jesse, Jesse, I'm just a great line once.

1944
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:51,460
No, no, no, listen, listen, I want to say this.

1945
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,460
Okay.

1946
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,460
All right.

1947
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,460
Okay.

1948
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:58,380
People need to fucking- I think people should approach people in public and I also think

1949
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,340
that people shouldn't be afraid to tell others to fuck off.

1950
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,340
And like, I think-

1951
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,340
I agree.

1952
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,340
I agree.

1953
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,500
I think that girls, I don't understand this sometimes.

1954
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:11,260
I feel like girls can get approached by guys and feel scared that, like, they can't

1955
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,620
tell them to just fuck off.

1956
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:16,580
And I- I- I don't know, like, if it's like alone in like a dark alley or something-

1957
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:17,940
Of course they feel fucking scared!

1958
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,620
Guys are stronger and might rape them!

1959
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:22,260
But if you're fucking in public, if you're fucking in a public place, you can just be

1960
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,260
like, leave me alone.

1961
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,260
I don't know.

1962
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,820
I feel like a lot of girls are scared to just be like, I don't want you to talk to me,

1963
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:27,820
okay?

1964
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:30,900
But maybe some guys don't take that well, and maybe it doesn't always work.

1965
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:31,900
I don't know.

1966
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,900
Am I fucking crazy?

1967
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:36,260
I think that the way the world should be is everyone should be feel free to like, go

1968
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:39,620
up and strike up a conversation with anyone else, and everyone should be free to just

1969
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:42,700
be like, fuck off, don't talk to me, and then we should all just respect that.

1970
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,060
That would be my ideal fucking world.

1971
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:48,700
My vision for the world is that nobody should ever have to say fuck off because everyone

1972
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,540
should mind their own goddamn business and be normal.

1973
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:52,540
Jesse, I heard a great line-

1974
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,860
I've heard a great line every week.

1975
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:58,020
I heard a great line once, and I'm going to say it to you now because I think it's really

1976
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:02,180
important for guys to think like this, and for women too, and it's that no woman ever

1977
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:07,020
walks out of the house in the morning not wanting to meet the guy of her dreams.

1978
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:12,020
And if you just think about that, it's the fucking retarded pick-up artist, bullshit

1979
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,020
is that.

1980
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,020
Who gives a shit?

1981
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,020
It's-

1982
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:16,020
What do you mean who gives a shit?

1983
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:19,980
It's making a point that it's never a bad idea to try to introduce yourself to people

1984
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,460
because you never know if your interaction is going to be mutually beneficial.

1985
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,460
I disagree vehemently.

1986
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:26,060
It's very bad to introduce yourself to strangers, it's the worst thing a human being can do.

1987
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,060
Can I tell my story?

1988
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,060
This argument's retarded.

1989
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,060
Yes, my peep.

1990
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,060
It is retarded.

1991
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,380
Everyone is wrong but me.

1992
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:33,380
Okay.

1993
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:38,260
So, unlike some of our predecessors, I'm not going to give any extraneous details that

1994
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,860
aren't important to the story.

1995
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:43,780
So when I was growing up, I lived in a pretty poor neighborhood.

1996
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,780
Oh, okay.

1997
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:45,780
That was the joke.

1998
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:46,780
The joke-

1999
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,620
The joke is that I said I wasn't-

2000
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:49,620
Okay, never mind.

2001
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:50,620
But it really was.

2002
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:51,620
I got it.

2003
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:52,740
But that actually is part of the story.

2004
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:53,740
I was just fucking with you.

2005
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:54,740
Yeah.

2006
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,740
So you're growing up-

2007
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:56,740
So fucking tell the fucking story, Bob.

2008
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,740
I'm confused.

2009
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:58,740
They're wasting my goddamn time.

2010
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:01,740
Where did his truth end and the lies begin?

2011
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,660
When I was eight, I lived in a pretty poor neighborhood and I was actually like the kid

2012
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,860
who got bullied by everybody.

2013
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,780
First of all, I've always been really short.

2014
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:13,980
So I automatically had the nickname Little and everybody fucking called me Little.

2015
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:19,820
And I remember one time, the leader of the bully pack was named Terrell and these fuckers

2016
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:23,700
would just chase me around the neighborhood, like calling me a faggot and stuff and I would

2017
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,700
have to find-

2018
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,700
Jesus.

2019
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,700
I'd have to like find places to like hide like inside like abandoned buildings and shit.

2020
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,700
Got that.

2021
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:30,700
But it was motivation.

2022
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:35,060
Because as I was aging, I wanted to not only one, get taller, which never happened, but

2023
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:40,060
two, prove to them that I am not a faggot and that I can have sex, god damn it.

2024
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:43,500
So I assumed that one day when they were chasing you, they caught you and that's how you lost

2025
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,500
your virginity.

2026
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,500
That's what happened.

2027
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,500
Yeah, right?

2028
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,500
No.

2029
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,500
You're days of the kind of flyer.

2030
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:56,620
Anyway, so yeah, at that time when I was a kid, the only friend I had was named Kevin.

2031
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:01,580
And he stood up for me sometimes, but he was mostly, he ended up getting peer pressured

2032
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,380
by the other guys to also bully me.

2033
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:08,860
But Kevin, he was like halfway there for me, like when it was just me and him.

2034
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:14,940
And then in public, he'd like, yeah, fuck this little monkey bitch, but it's all part

2035
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:15,940
of the story.

2036
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,220
Okay.

2037
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:25,500
I'm 15 and Terrell, this guy I was talking about, he really got me.

2038
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,780
He just fucked with me at lunch one day and I was like, you know, I'd fuck this.

2039
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:34,100
So I left school early and my school was kind of near a lake.

2040
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,180
So there's like a little beach that I would always go to.

2041
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:41,660
And I was sitting just in the sand, just like, you know, maybe today's the day I kill myself.

2042
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:42,660
Fuck this.

2043
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:43,660
Oh, shit.

2044
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,180
But Kevin, he followed me.

2045
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:46,740
That's really sad that you didn't.

2046
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:51,940
Yeah, no, you made the wrong decision that day, monkey.

2047
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:54,180
What happened?

2048
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:56,340
He said, it's really sad you didn't kill yourself.

2049
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,820
Oh, yeah, well, definitely.

2050
01:27:57,820 --> 01:27:58,820
I still believe that.

2051
01:27:58,820 --> 01:27:59,820
Right.

2052
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,820
Okay.

2053
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:03,620
But Kevin saw what happened at lunch and he followed me and he was sitting down next

2054
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,420
to me and we're just like talking.

2055
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:09,940
And then he, um, he like just reached over into my pants and started giving me a hand

2056
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:10,940
joke.

2057
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:11,940
What the fuck?

2058
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:19,140
So like that's the first time anybody had ever touched my dick and Kevin just jerked

2059
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:20,140
me off.

2060
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:23,020
That's the first time anybody had ever had sex.

2061
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,020
Is this real?

2062
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:25,020
Is this a true story?

2063
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:26,020
Yeah.

2064
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:27,020
This is a meme.

2065
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:28,020
This is a meme.

2066
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,020
We're getting memed.

2067
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:30,020
I'm not meming on you.

2068
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,020
So what happened?

2069
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,020
I was taking a piss.

2070
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,020
Did you?

2071
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,020
Did you jerk off a guy?

2072
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:39,140
He's doing a fucking fake story because he's insecure because he's still a virgin.

2073
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:45,380
So after getting my dick jerked off by Kevin, I got the motivation to get revenge on Terrell.

2074
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:49,020
So I went into class and I picked up my fucking chair and I smashed it against the back of

2075
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:50,020
his head.

2076
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:51,020
Instantly expelled.

2077
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,020
I got arrested.

2078
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,020
Fast forward.

2079
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:56,020
Ten years later, I'm a 24 year old gangbanger.

2080
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,900
What story is this?

2081
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,020
He's quoting some story.

2082
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:03,020
What fucking story is this from?

2083
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:05,100
I get a phone call from Kevin.

2084
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,940
Is this a plot of moonlight?

2085
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:08,940
Is that what's happening here?

2086
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,740
This guy must have seen moonlight.

2087
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:14,740
It's funny.

2088
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:17,740
So Kevin calls me and he's like, you're little.

2089
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:19,740
And he's still going anyway.

2090
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:20,740
He's still going.

2091
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:22,740
The fucking jig is up.

2092
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:24,740
I was like, you know what?

2093
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:25,740
I'll go see what's going on with Kevin.

2094
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:26,740
You know, maybe he'll be arrested.

2095
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,740
I'm now a big, muscly black man.

2096
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,740
So I got arrested.

2097
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,780
From the beginning, I almost said at the start of the story, when you said Tyrell, I was

2098
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:35,780
going to joke.

2099
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:38,140
That doesn't sound like a white person's name.

2100
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:42,340
And then I was like, well, I didn't want to bring race into it or anything.

2101
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,940
Well, no, I thought it would be funny.

2102
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:47,540
But then I remembered that monkey told me that he didn't really grow up with any black

2103
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:48,540
people.

2104
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:53,340
So I thought, and that he definitely would have mentioned if the guy had been black.

2105
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,340
So then I was like, well, maybe it's a white guy.

2106
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:56,340
Everyone's going to think I'm racist.

2107
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:57,740
Please don't interrupt the story.

2108
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:58,740
He's still telling the story.

2109
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,740
What else would happen, monkey?

2110
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,340
So yeah, I go to Kevin's restaurant.

2111
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:06,340
He cooks me dinner and he has a wife and kids now and stuff.

2112
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:09,740
Kevin's restaurant called Kevin's dog house by chance.

2113
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,740
Oh my God.

2114
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:15,740
But he was my dog.

2115
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:16,740
That's what we called it.

2116
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:22,240
That's anyway, how my story ends is he takes me back to his house and we have like this

2117
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:26,040
really weird, awkward like moment and then it just cuts to black and we don't know what

2118
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,040
happened.

2119
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:32,340
Man, that story was worth the best picture.

2120
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,040
I would have given it to La La Land, I think.

2121
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,040
See, that's my story.

2122
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,040
Thank you.

2123
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:42,040
If not for the fact and none of it would have happened if Ben St hadn't approached the stranger

2124
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:50,540
monkey in the sand, we never would have figured out what that was if not for the fact that

2125
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:53,040
I've listened to monkeys podcast about moonlight.

2126
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:57,040
That's the only reason I was able to pick up on it.

2127
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,040
Well, this has been a great waste of time.

2128
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:04,040
I don't suppose we're ever going to get the monkey loses his virginity.

2129
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,040
No, that's what happened.

2130
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,040
That's what happened.

2131
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,040
That's what happened.

2132
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,040
Davoo, do you want to tell your story?

2133
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,040
Who do we have left?

2134
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,040
We've got Davoo and just Davoo.

2135
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,040
That's it.

2136
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,040
That's just Davoo.

2137
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,040
Oh man, this is fucking fresh.

2138
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,040
This is fucking fresh.

2139
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:20,040
First of all, I'm going to be coughing during this so I'm going to have to keep muting my

2140
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,040
microphone.

2141
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,040
I have some tea coming up in like a couple of minutes.

2142
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,040
I'm going to get that tea.

2143
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,040
It'll suppress the coughing some.

2144
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:29,040
But yeah, this is going to be a bit disjointed, okay?

2145
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,040
In fact, I'm going to do a small cough right now.

2146
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,040
Okay, I'm back.

2147
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,040
Okay, cool.

2148
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,040
You know that'll still be on the recording.

2149
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,040
No, no, no.

2150
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,040
I didn't mute it on Discord.

2151
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,040
It's way funnier than it was cut out.

2152
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,040
Oh, okay.

2153
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,040
Yeah, yeah.

2154
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,040
I'm a professional.

2155
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,040
Holy shit, that was hilarious.

2156
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,040
Okay, all right.

2157
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:54,040
So I should begin this by saying that I've never been like particularly outstandingly

2158
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,040
interested in sex specifically.

2159
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:01,040
I'm not exactly sure why, but I've been much more of a fetish person, I guess.

2160
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:05,040
I kind of grew up on Deviantart kind of thing, right?

2161
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:09,040
Like, I mean, I started jacking off when I was like 11 or 12, I think, but it was like

2162
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:14,040
when I was 19 when I had this moment of, man, you know what would be really good to fuck

2163
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,040
a girl?

2164
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,040
Yeah, man, I should really like do that.

2165
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:22,040
So I mean, I guess maybe part of the reason why I was like that is I was raised all Christian

2166
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,040
and stuff.

2167
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:28,040
So I was just sort of like in a Christian environment where like all the girls around me, you're

2168
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,040
not going to have sex with.

2169
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,040
I'm sure like the really cool ones are all like, you know, getting it like in some sort

2170
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:38,040
of sub zones away from the eyes of all parents and all pastors and shit.

2171
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,040
I didn't know, I wasn't nearly on that level of cool.

2172
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:44,040
So, you know, this isn't, this isn't a criticism on you at all, but it's interesting that like

2173
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:49,040
the Christianity kind of suppression of sexuality seems to have the result of kind of pushing

2174
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,040
you to the fringes to be into more, you know, outsider.

2175
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,040
Absolutely.

2176
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,040
Yes.

2177
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,040
Yes.

2178
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,040
Without question.

2179
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,040
Well, I mean, I assume that's why I'm like that.

2180
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,040
I don't know.

2181
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,040
It's kind of strange.

2182
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:04,040
It's like growing up, not having anything close to sex, like I hugged a girl once, that

2183
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,040
was the extent of it when I was 15.

2184
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,040
Yeah.

2185
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:11,040
But it was never like me feeling bad about myself because there wasn't this sense that

2186
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,040
anyone else.

2187
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:15,040
It's like not feeling like you're poor because you live in some shitty third world nation.

2188
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,040
You weren't watching the high fives like Jesse was.

2189
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,040
That's the stuff, man.

2190
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,040
I have sex with girls to get to the hugging.

2191
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,040
That's what I value.

2192
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,040
That's what I look for.

2193
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,040
Yeah.

2194
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,040
Me too.

2195
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,040
It's like fucking good.

2196
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,040
That's what they called me.

2197
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:34,040
You know, back in my college days, good old desperate for an emotional connection.

2198
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,040
Jess.

2199
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,040
Yeah.

2200
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,040
Desperate.

2201
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:42,040
I need a hug.

2202
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,040
Yeah.

2203
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,040
Yeah.

2204
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,040
That's the one.

2205
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,040
Holy fuck.

2206
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,040
Yeah.

2207
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:55,040
Like, you know, I've always, I've always wanted a girlfriend for emotional connection so

2208
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:59,040
I can hug something and also so I can do all the kinky stuff with it.

2209
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:02,040
I've bought a lot of pillows to help with that.

2210
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,040
You know.

2211
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,040
I recommend it.

2212
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,040
Yeah.

2213
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:09,240
So, you know, but again, it's just like the idea of getting a girlfriend in the environment

2214
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,760
I was in would be a huge pain.

2215
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:15,320
Like, you know, my parents have a pretty like free form approach to parenting in a way where

2216
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:19,880
it's like, if you can make your own lifestyle happen, then you can do it.

2217
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:25,840
So basically, if I was willing to like completely upend my like shut in lifestyle and like obtain

2218
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,640
social gatherings outside of the purview of my parents over the course of years, I probably

2219
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,360
could have gotten laid like when I was like, you know, 17 or something.

2220
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:38,640
I mean, I am pretty forward with girls, but probably in more of a holding up a sign saying

2221
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,920
have sex with me sort of way.

2222
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:45,120
So maybe not in a successful way, but I don't know Christian method, but I mean, I got like

2223
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,520
a couple of girls who are like, I like you and I got a girl to hug me and who was going

2224
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,080
to like go mini golfing with me.

2225
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,680
But like, this is the hottest story, this is the hottest one yet.

2226
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,680
Yeah.

2227
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,960
But like the girl who was going to go mini golfing with me who I hugged, she was like

2228
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,960
too nervous, right?

2229
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,440
This is the league that I'm dealing with.

2230
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,160
Like she was too nervous to do something as steamy as go mini golfing with me.

2231
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:06,440
You know, like that this was just the kind of girls I was surrounded with or at least

2232
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,520
the kind that are attracted to me.

2233
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:12,800
So yeah, you know, so it was just and then after that, you know, after I'm out of high

2234
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:18,080
school and stuff or rather high home school, you know, the first job I get and the only

2235
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,560
close to regular job I've ever gotten was just working in my family business.

2236
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:25,880
So once again, my dad and my brother are around all the time and the only people we interact

2237
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:30,560
with are our customers who hire window cleaners and they're all in their 60s.

2238
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,360
So you know, that's not going to work.

2239
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,680
So I doubt many millennials are hiring window cleaners.

2240
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,680
Indeed.

2241
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:38,680
Yeah.

2242
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,440
So yeah, we just have an app for windows now.

2243
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:45,120
So what we so yeah, so I go through sort of like the end of my adolescence also just

2244
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:48,000
in this like environment of not having anyone around.

2245
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,280
I do have I did have two friends who I hang out with like once a week, every week, both

2246
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,280
were female.

2247
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,080
Neither were like interested in me and I wasn't particularly interested in them.

2248
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:00,040
But I was around estrogen all the time.

2249
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,160
So it kind of like kept me kept it in my mind.

2250
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,280
I was like, yeah, you know, I really need to get out there.

2251
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:08,960
But like how I don't have a huffing you were huffing the fumes of estrogen in the air.

2252
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,960
Hold on.

2253
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:10,960
Let me let me go get my tea.

2254
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:16,120
Getting from the bleeding pus of all the surrounding dude, I fucking vape estrogen.

2255
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,120
I'm way.

2256
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,120
I get my tea.

2257
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,120
Okay.

2258
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,120
We'll do.

2259
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:24,160
You know, let's talk about this phenomenon.

2260
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:28,920
Let's talk about this phenomenon of being around girls because I find it not at all satisfying

2261
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,160
and mostly infuriating that I'm not having sex with them.

2262
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:37,520
If you're if you're not having sex, then being around girls is infuriating and frustrating.

2263
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,020
I wouldn't know.

2264
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,280
I've never done it.

2265
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:45,200
Speaking of which, I'm I'm recording this from my girlfriend's house right now.

2266
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:49,440
And when this podcast is done, when this podcast is done, I'm going to go lose even more of

2267
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,440
my virginity.

2268
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,600
Oh, that's not okay, dude.

2269
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,600
That's not okay.

2270
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,600
That's been in the corner.

2271
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,600
That's been in the spotlight.

2272
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,600
Losing his virginity.

2273
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,600
Trying to keep a few.

2274
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:09,720
It's it's been five minutes.

2275
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:16,320
So it's not a sudden it's not a sudden one year and it's back.

2276
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,920
It's a slow tick up to 100% virginity over the course of a year.

2277
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,720
Yeah, like Bob Psycho, but it's but it's an exponential growth.

2278
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:31,680
So like halfway through the year, you're 25% back to being a virgin like that, like that.

2279
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,680
You know, it's funny.

2280
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:36,600
We had that argument earlier about approaching girls.

2281
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:42,720
Yeah, I remember I have approached girls and had sex with them who were strangers.

2282
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,560
They're completely a hypocrite.

2283
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,560
It's good.

2284
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,000
It's good shit when it works out, right?

2285
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,080
And I think as long as everyone's cool about it and the guy and like, like you, I think

2286
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,520
you can approach a girl and not be weird or pushy.

2287
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:59,960
And I think that I had a highly condone that I'm still against it morally.

2288
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,760
But Jess, if they weren't YouTube stars, how did you know to ask him out?

2289
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,200
I'm back by the way.

2290
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,760
I don't understand the question.

2291
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:10,520
Okay, let's continue to your argument with a single rhetorical question.

2292
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,520
Go ahead, Davoo.

2293
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,000
Yeah, you know, it was it was tricky.

2294
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,840
It's like how exactly I'm going to have sex.

2295
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,720
Like I have a lot of space in my room, but it's not like quiet.

2296
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,240
Like there's not that much like audio suppression.

2297
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:23,920
So like people could hear what's going on.

2298
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,640
So it's like, who would I bring home?

2299
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,880
Like I don't have any like public social life.

2300
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:31,120
So it's like, who am I going to show up to my house?

2301
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:34,200
Who I've been like, it's just like tricky, right?

2302
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,320
I was trying here and there, but like tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky.

2303
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:39,240
I don't know about you, dude, I want them to hear.

2304
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:43,960
I want them to hear my grunts and my slap sounds and my the dripping of my

2305
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,120
leavings as I as I abandoned this corpse on my bed.

2306
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,600
In the middle of sex, is that what's happening?

2307
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,000
That's not all fluids are being released.

2308
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,200
Let's not gloss over this corpse angle that emerged.

2309
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:02,440
No, no, the thing I look for in a girls, the more people I have living

2310
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,640
in my house, the louder I want her to be.

2311
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,400
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

2312
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:12,120
And well, so, you know, you know, when I then in September of last year

2313
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:16,960
moved into this house, it's like, hey, my parents do not know what I'm doing at all.

2314
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,440
I could like go to the airport.

2315
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:21,960
Did you could drive me to the airport and I could go anywhere now.

2316
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,920
My parents don't got to know shit about fuck.

2317
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:27,840
So now now there's no limitations, really, as long as I can show out the money.

2318
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,800
So I just, you know, I was going to dating websites again.

2319
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,600
And I discovered one for a very specific fetish of mine, and it's like sweet.

2320
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,680
And I looked at the profiles here and it's like the number of incredibly

2321
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:44,400
attractive girls who are who describe themselves in a way that is so perfect

2322
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,840
to me in regards to their kinks.

2323
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,960
I was like, where where are these people been all my life?

2324
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,440
They're just all here.

2325
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:55,360
And this website is particularly scammy with its paid membership thing, right?

2326
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:00,680
Where without a membership, you can't message anyone, right?

2327
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,320
You can't even read the messages from other people, right?

2328
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:11,560
For a like $15 a month membership, you can send messages to other people.

2329
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,080
Don't worry, this is very important, right?

2330
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,640
You can send messages to other people, but they can't read them

2331
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:19,160
unless they are also a $15.

2332
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,760
Yeah, so like the silver membership, right?

2333
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:27,560
But there's like a $80 for three months membership, which is the gold fine.

2334
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,640
But if you get a gold

2335
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:35,280
membership, which is expensive as hell, you can message people and they can read

2336
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,800
it even if they aren't a member at all, even if they don't have a membership at all.

2337
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,840
And I was like, aha.

2338
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,640
And I was like, you know, there's just so many good profiles on this website.

2339
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,040
I'm going to go with the forest.

2340
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,960
So I sank 80 bucks, right?

2341
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,920
And I'm like, well, I got three months.

2342
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,160
I better message everybody.

2343
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,360
No woman is worth that.

2344
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,200
I get the impression this whole story is going to be very expensive.

2345
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,240
Hey, man, you got to do what you got to do in today's fucking economy.

2346
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:04,400
All right, I mean, I spent 400 something for that round trip to Montana.

2347
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,480
That's the road with that.

2348
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,160
Mine was an expensive story already.

2349
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:13,240
Fucking and it had exactly the effect I thought it would have, which is that

2350
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,920
when there's that huge of a paywall, the number of people actually writing

2351
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,160
messages is pretty small, right?

2352
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:24,560
Sure, which meant like an actual, like perceptible percentage of girls

2353
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,080
replied to me like one out of every five.

2354
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:30,200
And I was like, holy shit, this is exactly what I paid for.

2355
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:34,280
Right? Because the girls on this website are not being bombarded with emails.

2356
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,000
Like they are everywhere else, right?

2357
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,480
The system works.

2358
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:42,600
Right. So like I was like, yeah, this this is scammy as hell, but it works.

2359
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,760
Right. So eventually I got a girl that way.

2360
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:51,120
And like very forward, very fast paced, like the like a few hours

2361
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:54,280
into our first conversation on a Facebook audio chat.

2362
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,240
She's like, yeah, great, we're great matches.

2363
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,560
What do you want to do about it?

2364
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:00,040
You know, I'm like, oh, yeah.

2365
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,880
Yeah, you're feeling lucky punk.

2366
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:08,120
I kind of took a while, but eventually, you know, I flew over to her at this point.

2367
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,200
She's just like a wreck waiting for me.

2368
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:14,400
And incidentally, like she was like a car wreck afterward.

2369
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:16,560
She doesn't have a home situation.

2370
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,080
Her house is really tiny and packed.

2371
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,600
So we're like, oh, we can't be there.

2372
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,520
So in addition to a plane ticket to Oregon, by the way, the actual opposite

2373
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,560
end of the country, well, OK, the actual opposite would be Alaska or I guess Indonesia.

2374
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,320
But anyway, fucking in addition to that, I also paid for a hotel.

2375
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,920
So like a lot of my money.

2376
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,520
Well, OK, most of my money.

2377
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,400
But hey, it's it's it's to a good cause, right?

2378
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,360
So lose your virginity.

2379
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,160
No price to high.

2380
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,520
It's got to be done.

2381
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:45,000
Yeah, the first time the first time special.

2382
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,280
Every time after that, you start to come.

2383
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,720
Your nose grows longer and longer.

2384
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,360
And your care gets curlier and curlier.

2385
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,160
What? I don't know what you're getting at.

2386
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,760
David's symbol starts emblazoning itself on your chest.

2387
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:03,320
Oh, God. Yeah, you become more of a juice, what I'm saying.

2388
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,680
Well, I thought it was funny, did you?

2389
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,200
Thank you. Thank you.

2390
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,160
So, yeah, that's that's I flew over to her.

2391
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,840
But yeah, it's in a little hotel, you know, it's it's smaller than it looks.

2392
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,800
This is how I learned that all those like travel websites use

2393
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,280
like wide angle lenses for the interiors.

2394
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,400
So it was a really small room and we go in there and she's just immediate

2395
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,480
because we've been like, you know, just hugging and like smooching each other's

2396
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:31,680
cheeks for like, you know, for like a whole hour now, like in preparation to get there.

2397
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,200
So at this point, she's like, let's fuck, come on, let's do it.

2398
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,160
Just go, just go.

2399
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,640
I'm like, no, I was like, no, babe, we're going to.

2400
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,680
No, babe, no, babe.

2401
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:44,120
Come on, we're going to do hand stuff and eventually we're going to go.

2402
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,560
And she's like, no, come on, just come on, just fuck me.

2403
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,720
Come on. And she's just like, she's just pushing me towards the bed.

2404
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:51,360
I'm like, oh, fine, whatever, you know,

2405
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:55,880
she was like, I was like, it was like fucking pulling teeth in there.

2406
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:58,120
You know, you know, that's pretty fucking alpha.

2407
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:02,800
Davoo be like, oh, whatever, I guess, I guess I'll fuck you.

2408
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,840
If you I guess I'll lose my virginity if I must.

2409
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,080
That's hardcore. I like that. I like that.

2410
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:12,200
I mean, later, like a couple of days ago, she called me and was like,

2411
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,640
I wish we'd taken it slower.

2412
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:14,640
And I said, oh, you wish you.

2413
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:15,600
Oh, fuck off.

2414
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,680
And she's like, yeah, and I'm like, yep, I'm always right.

2415
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:22,600
Well, Davoo, how does she feel about having been absorbed?

2416
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:26,200
And then being right, she's more satisfying than the sex.

2417
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,360
Nate, what did you say?

2418
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:32,960
I said, how does she feel about having been absorbed into the Davoo collective

2419
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,440
to be, you know, to combine her essence?

2420
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,920
So, you know, I mean, like she had sex before, but only like once.

2421
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:42,320
So, you know, fucking she's a member of a few collectives at this point.

2422
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,240
She is like four years younger than me.

2423
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,440
It's like she's like, she's going to turn 19 tomorrow.

2424
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:49,200
So it's like, you know, sex with the young hashtag, of course.

2425
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,720
But like she wasn't like really experienced at all.

2426
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:56,640
But like I was just like, I don't I don't fucking know.

2427
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:59,320
And I had the same issue that did you described, which is

2428
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:04,120
it just wasn't enough pressure to like, like really like get much of a thing going on.

2429
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,000
And I should probably bring up at this.

2430
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,840
Ladies, do your kegels, steer kegels, ladies out there.

2431
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,400
Yeah, she was also on her period, too.

2432
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,600
What an issue. Yeah.

2433
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,920
That's that's an or flight timing or planning.

2434
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,720
Because, well, what can you do?

2435
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,120
You can't regulate. You can't schedule your life around that shit.

2436
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,560
You could. You could.

2437
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,480
I absolutely could have. I absolutely would have.

2438
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:28,000
She had told me that it was an irregular schedule, right?

2439
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:31,440
And it is. But she said, yeah, but it is toward the end of the month.

2440
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:34,160
And I was aware that when you'd scheduled it at the end of the month,

2441
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:37,520
it was probably likely, but I was just so desperate to get you here as soon as possible.

2442
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,680
Why do women choose to make life so difficult for everyone else?

2443
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:43,720
By having periods.

2444
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,640
And as the days went on, she had already been going for like three days

2445
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,600
by the time I got there, but for whatever reason,

2446
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:52,280
she had like this extra long one that lasted the entire time I was there.

2447
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:55,120
That was God trying to stop you, but you've defeated him.

2448
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,480
You didn't let it. He killed God.

2449
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,640
You killed God with your mighty God.

2450
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:03,800
It pretty much didn't allow sex to happen for the most part.

2451
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,320
We only liked it like a few times.

2452
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:07,440
Hey, you got it once, dude. That's enough.

2453
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,480
I made her go a couple of times.

2454
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,280
She didn't make me make me go a couple of times

2455
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,800
because it was just so hard for me to get into the mood to do it

2456
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,800
because I was too squeamish about it.

2457
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,160
You know, I didn't want to make me stay in a couple of things.

2458
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:21,280
The funny thing about that, like the second time I went to visit

2459
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:26,160
my my ex at the time, like she she was on her period.

2460
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:30,160
And like I didn't like she didn't like just say that outright

2461
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,800
that that's why she wouldn't because like it took like two days

2462
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,120
before I could convince her to have sex with me.

2463
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,560
It was driving me fucking insane.

2464
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,160
Like I was like flipping the I was like flipping.

2465
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,920
So that's why it's happening.

2466
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:41,120
Why isn't she was just like, but I'm on my period.

2467
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:42,840
And I'm like, I don't care.

2468
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:43,960
Why would I care?

2469
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,080
She was like, it's gross.

2470
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:47,120
I was like, I don't I don't fucking care.

2471
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,080
You can run your blood all over my body.

2472
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,080
I don't give a fuck.

2473
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,880
I feel I just want to put my dick in my body.

2474
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,080
It's just, you know, there's sheets everywhere, which, you know,

2475
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:01,080
it was doable because related to the kings we were participating in.

2476
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:04,280
We had those bed pads you have for a bedwetting purposes.

2477
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:06,520
So you just put some of those down there on the bed on the mattress.

2478
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,800
That makes it pretty fine.

2479
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,000
But still there was just one time you fucking you don't.

2480
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,960
You don't have to explain what your fetishes are,

2481
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:15,840
but did you at least get to indulge them in this trip?

2482
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,960
Yes, but not a whole lot.

2483
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:17,960
Like it was OK.

2484
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:19,440
It was it's funny.

2485
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,560
You got to confirm whether or not you were like like

2486
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,720
because I feel like with with weird fetishes and stuff,

2487
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:28,320
you always like you you you expect that you're going to be into it.

2488
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,000
But then it's not until it actually happens that you're completely sure.

2489
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,240
You're like, yes, I've confirmed now I was as into this as I thought.

2490
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,800
It's really difficult because your period

2491
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,440
and interferes with the fetishes.

2492
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,680
It just interferes with everything.

2493
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:43,000
And like it was just, you know, it was just a different sort of situation

2494
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,640
where it's like I felt weirdly less horny than usual there

2495
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,480
because it's like I'm meeting a new person.

2496
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,640
Well, I mean, not physically new to me.

2497
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:53,800
I'm in a new environment and I was really more just interested

2498
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,160
in hugging her constantly because I hadn't had someone to hug before.

2499
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,560
And it was just nice.

2500
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:00,800
It was just nice and fun, you know.

2501
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:04,960
Yeah, I by the way, I think a lot of a lot of fetishes are

2502
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:10,280
exists a lot more in the people's minds than actually performing them.

2503
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,640
You know, like a lot of them are the fantasy of it.

2504
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,280
I'm not saying that's necessarily you.

2505
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,360
I'm just saying that in general, I'm sure there's a lot of people

2506
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:19,640
who aren't actually into scat as much as like the porn they like to look at.

2507
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,280
Right. Right. Yeah.

2508
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,480
I don't know. I mean, for example, for example.

2509
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,160
Right. For example.

2510
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,160
Right. Yeah. That's not mine.

2511
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,920
But like, well, not exactly.

2512
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:34,560
But like, yeah, as I said before, I'm more into like a concept type of thing.

2513
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:37,080
So it's more it's not as much about the physicality.

2514
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,880
It's more about the idea of what's happening.

2515
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:43,440
Like, like, by far, the best, the best, the best day that we had was toward the end.

2516
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,160
When we went out and we ubered around town and she had a sippy cup

2517
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:50,160
and she acted like she was like low functioning autistic.

2518
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:52,280
And I was like talking to her all condescendingly.

2519
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,960
That was like the best day.

2520
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,600
An ice cream when we get to her ice cream.

2521
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,680
I was like, here you go.

2522
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:58,560
And I was like, fucking yes.

2523
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,200
Great time. What the fuck?

2524
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:05,240
See, it's not so much about coming.

2525
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:08,840
It's about having it's about having fun experiences of life

2526
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:13,120
where you fuck with the definitions of society in ways that no one knows about.

2527
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,400
I get it. I do get it.

2528
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:18,320
Yeah. So I mean, yeah.

2529
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,000
So like.

2530
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,400
So yeah, we didn't we didn't do a whole lot of I mean,

2531
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,080
like she was never once able to make me come in any way, like directly.

2532
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:26,200
Like she couldn't even jack me off.

2533
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:29,960
She doesn't she doesn't have she doesn't have the fucking endurance.

2534
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,520
Like her arm just isn't capable of doing it.

2535
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:37,400
Like, you know, I had a as I will say, I mean, I've only been with one woman,

2536
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:40,520
but she was completely incompetent at the act of jacking my dick.

2537
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:43,800
I literally like, you know, they don't have the kind of she like wanted to.

2538
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:44,640
And she kept trying.

2539
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:45,960
And I was just like, stop it.

2540
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,560
You don't know what the fuck you're doing.

2541
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,800
I mean, for what it's worth like there was a time

2542
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:52,480
where I was trying to check her off with a little thing of a jig.

2543
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:56,520
And like my fingers were like we're like we're like splitting out

2544
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,560
because they weren't leveled up in the regards of the finger pushing.

2545
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:01,880
But I was able to do finger basically.

2546
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,960
She was way more horny than me the whole time, you know, that that's understandable.

2547
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:09,320
OK, but yeah, I had a great time, just not a whole lot of sex.

2548
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:12,440
So I didn't once come in her at all.

2549
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,000
But, you know, we have plenty of we're going to we're going to see each other

2550
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,600
again somehow sometime, preferably soon.

2551
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:23,560
So yeah, the most important thing is we had a great time even if it's a complete cluster fuck.

2552
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:26,360
Like it doesn't matter if this is a skill to be learned anyway.

2553
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:28,800
So nothing is totally reasonable.

2554
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,120
I had a terrible time.

2555
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:31,840
I guess that's it. Yeah, nightmare.

2556
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,880
Yeah, well, that's all about fetishes yet,

2557
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,520
because I want to hear about this low functioning autism shit.

2558
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:37,800
No, but we should talk about that.

2559
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,320
So we had a porn episode and Davoo wouldn't come on

2560
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,320
because he didn't want to talk about these ones.

2561
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:46,280
That's right. Well, I just felt like it would it's not that I didn't want to talk about it.

2562
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:51,160
It's just that I felt like it would be too far along for anyone to be able to like deal with.

2563
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:57,120
Like you would be like, yeah, you're not like on a level where like I can care anymore.

2564
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,680
But I don't know. I as time has gone on,

2565
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:05,120
I've I've witnessed the extent to which Pete the other PCP people and the viewers are

2566
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,240
are like surprisingly similar to me.

2567
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,320
So I might change my mind. I don't know.

2568
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:11,160
Yeah, that's fair. That's fair.

2569
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,360
Yeah, I'd fuck a retard.

2570
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:20,200
I think it is a it is legitimately offensive to me that people think that retards wouldn't also enjoy sex.

2571
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:21,360
That body in a minute.

2572
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,200
How are we allowed are we talking?

2573
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,880
We're talking full retarded.

2574
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:28,160
Just just just pick your Nate. Just pick your Nate.

2575
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:32,320
As a retarded man, Nate is offended on behalf of his people.

2576
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:38,800
It's a well-known thing that that that like the first thing babies do and you know people with low IQs are like babies.

2577
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,480
They'll dintle themselves. They'll play with themselves. They fuck with their junk.

2578
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:46,320
So why don't they why doesn't society allow me to play with retarded people's junk?

2579
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,480
I thought you were gonna say to play. I thought you were gonna say that.

2580
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:52,160
I thought you were gonna say to play with direction. I thought you were gonna say to play with babies junk.

2581
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,160
I don't I totally change directions in the middle of that, but hey, whatever.

2582
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,160
Yes, I want to have sex with retarded people. That's what I'm trying to say.

2583
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:59,760
All right, let's move on to the questions.

2584
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,760
Okay, let's do it.

2585
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:08,760
I just want to say did she when you were telling your story and when you were trying to do the impression of how your girlfriend couldn't pronounce that phrase.

2586
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,760
I thought she was retarded.

2587
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:15,560
No, she I think she I mean she just was stumbling.

2588
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:18,560
I think she was like playing up the fact that she could pronounce it.

2589
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,760
She was holding me down.

2590
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:26,160
Yeah, she while she's playing it up weird like the fact that she couldn't pronounce the word because she like like I

2591
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:30,560
Think she's like she's pretending to be dumb so that you'll explain it to you know

2592
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,160
It's like exactly like the old saying goes

2593
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:36,600
I would never want to sleep with a woman retarded enough to sleep with me

2594
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:48,280
Very she was something very like redneck mentality about like intelligence, which is like I'm a simple kind of person

2595
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:54,800
I don't want to know these more advanced things. Okay, but then what's attractive about me is that I sound smart and cool

2596
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,800
I don't know. It's it's an odd combination

2597
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:01,960
So sure you're kind of like a fetish the intelligence is like a fetish. She's a savioresexual. Yeah

2598
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:07,400
Yeah, there you go. I don't think she's like exclusively into smart guys or anything

2599
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:13,000
It's just particularly appealing about me is that I use big words and have a good voice, you know, so

2600
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Mm-hmm

2601
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,480
Okay, all right look for the love of God, let's move on

2602
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:41,080
Our first question here comes from our good friend at the hypocrite

2603
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:47,660
Will I ever get a girlfriend sad face? Yes. Yes, you will

2604
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:52,560
This is the public service announcement everyone get out there and date

2605
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,200
I'm not

2606
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:01,200
If you happen to live in England or France

2607
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:07,000
Then and you and you think hippos adorable go suck his dick

2608
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Yeah

2609
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:17,800
Circle don't talk to him. We already found totally we already found PCP guys. So now our next bouncy is

2610
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:27,880
If you want if you want a prize a PCP prize just like in last yeah, you'll get a shout out on the show probably from

2611
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:30,720
I

2612
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:32,980
Should be a

2613
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:38,080
Patreon that should be a patreon reward. Yeah, no cuz that's gonna make it harder for it to happen

2614
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:44,800
But we want it should be given away for free on every street corner. We should be throwing it is his innocence

2615
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:48,280
You know that there's just yeah, there's there's some I think there's a real psychological incentive

2616
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:53,160
If you have to pay for something you you want it more so maybe we could set up some reward system

2617
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:57,560
All right, whatever give us a great guy. I love him more than anyone especially Ben

2618
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:59,880
I

2619
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:06,960
Just say his girlfriend hippo's hippo's short, but he's got big hands and big feet. So that's true big dick

2620
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:13,500
You know, you know what they say about guys with big hands you can trust them

2621
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:20,120
That's right. They're capable men at physical labor. Okay. What else we got going on. Is that a joke from Trump?

2622
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:24,240
It's a joke from Marco Rubio. Yeah. Yeah, Marco Rubio

2623
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:27,960
Yeah, you know what they say about guys with little hands you can't trust them

2624
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,320
Yeah, and if there's any

2625
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:36,280
If there's any young girls in it, there's any sex with the young kind of girls in the audience, you know

2626
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:42,640
Is that still on this out there? I have a really comfortable new bed and I'm not fucking someone on it by the end of this podcast

2627
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,640
I'm gonna shoot up a hospital

2628
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,040
Do you want that on your conscience ladies?

2629
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:55,800
You had the power to stop this. I need that sex with the younger people will die. I'm a man of my word

2630
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,960
I'm a man of my word

2631
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,320
Okay, here we go. And if you're 12 my buddy King Critic is looking. Oh, yeah

2632
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,200
There's a guy we should get on here for the sex with the young episode

2633
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:16,480
There's like a there's like a hierarchy of what everyone's looking for like 12 15 King Critic 15 to 18 endless Jess

2634
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:20,000
18 to to the London hippo

2635
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,700
If you if you like look like you're like

2636
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:29,960
14 but you're actually like 90 then that's where I come in

2637
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:37,680
Yeah, I want I want footage of this event happening to the two anarchy in the UK playing in the background

2638
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:42,120
All right, okay

2639
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:50,640
All right, here we go at Cybershell asks this is a question. I think it's cool

2640
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:54,120
I don't know if you guys have seen this but what do you think about lasagna cats?

2641
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:57,320
And why is it the greatest web series of all time top kek?

2642
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:02,600
It's the greatest. It's fucking it's it's taking you know

2643
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:07,120
It's taking it's taking the shit that is Garfield and just and just out

2644
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:12,720
It's like that scene. It's like that scene in the holy mountain where where Christ shits into the into the bucket

2645
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:18,680
And the guy alchemizes it into gold. That's what they've done with Garfield into lasagna cat. That's right

2646
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:23,800
None of the rest of us have seen the holy mountain. Well, what the fuck?

2647
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:30,360
To the glory that is Garfield

2648
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:35,040
Comic of all time and how dare they mock it in such a fashion

2649
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:40,000
I haven't seen the new ones, but I won't out of principle. Let me let me just say

2650
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:47,480
Garfield for anybody who isn't familiar there was this series that came out like ten years ago and stopped nine years ago called

2651
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,240
You know lasagna cat which just takes like comic strips of the of old Garfield

2652
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:55,520
It's it takes like the worst and most banal

2653
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:01,720
Garfield strips that there are and then enacts them with guys in like in like fucking

2654
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:07,640
What do you call them like fur suits basically first suits basically? Yeah, and and then they enact the strip with like this overblown

2655
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:14,200
Laugh track to it, and then they take what they've just done and they fucking cut it into like this fucking spicy ass music video

2656
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:16,200
And like they fucking just

2657
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,640
jam out to this shit

2658
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:25,280
And and sometimes it just dissolves into absolute mania. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I feel like I'm having a fever

2659
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,760
Suicide is painless

2660
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:32,360
It brings on many changes, and I can take

2661
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:34,360
Oh

2662
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,240
I was just gonna say and the series came back

2663
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:44,920
Miraculously nine years later out of nowhere. I'm just dumped like I'm when he episodes

Odie is wearing a bag on his head. That's my favorite one. I can't remember which one that is but they're all watch them

2668
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:05,500
All guys and he goes to heaven and then he gets get sent to hell

2669
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:11,380
My my personal favorite is the bilamos which is just like a Garfield dancing to spicy

2670
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:17,360
Fucky Ricky by legato by legato. No, no, no, sir

2671
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:22,960
All right, this is this is a fascinating question. Okay, this is a bad question that ruined the whole party

2672
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:29,360
Yes, okay, but this one's great, and this one's really got okay. Just think about this. Okay at out sin asks

2673
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:36,400
Okay, what's this fucking question? What's the worst case scenario for each of the PCP?

2674
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:41,200
And that's it. What's the worst case like what I'm just thinking about

2675
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:49,400
That is the ability skin ripped off one chunk at a time that I die that I die in any fashion ever is the worst case

2676
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:53,040
Scenario best part about that. It's 100% guaranteed to happen

2677
01:59:53,600 --> 02:00:00,320
Finally getting my consciousness put into a computer and becoming immortal except it turns out that it's just torture for all time

2678
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:06,400
I have no mouth, and I must scream that that story. That's the worst case scenario for any of us. That's pretty good

2679
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:11,360
That's a pretty good answer. My worst scenario is just normal immortality in my normal body

2680
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:15,600
Yeah, cuz you love for death. You love for that. Yeah, okay. I'm with you

2681
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:23,800
My worst case scenario is all the all the innocent children at the hospital who are gonna die if I'm not having sex with the young

2682
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:27,880
By the end of this podcast. It's still a thing. That's really gonna happen. I've got my gun

2683
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:33,320
We're on a timer now. I've got like five minutes. I've got my fucking my my ninja daggers

2684
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:36,560
I've got sure kids. I'll kill children with shurikens

2685
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:41,960
I've borrowed. I borrowed some ninja stuff from Shinobi. You know, it's you know, it's really sad

2686
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:45,880
You know, what's really sad is this podcast isn't gonna go up for a while

2687
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:50,600
So by the time it goes up, it's gonna be too late. Those kids are done. Those kids are gone already

2688
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,520
It's a shame

2689
02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:01,640
My worst case scenario is if I have cavities right now because it might just be weird standing on my teeth

2690
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:07,000
Which is what I thought it was but now I'm like, oh, it might be cavities. I've never had cavities before

2691
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:10,320
It's been a it's been an issue. It's been a matter of pride for me

2692
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:15,560
And my cousin once told me many years ago. Don't get cocky with your perfect teeth

2693
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:17,640
I first got a cavity when I was 22

2694
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:24,520
Well, I'm 22 and I might have cavities and that I I just don't like being wrong

2695
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,520
So that's the worst case scenario for me

2696
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:33,200
Fucking I might have another cavity and it might be taking my tally up to literally 30

2697
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:42,760
Well, you know the best way to not get cavities is to never go out of the dentist

2698
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:54,520
Yep, yep, I think you should read the question by monkey Jones. I think now's the time is that was that from the very start of this thing

2699
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,360
Let me scroll back up

2700
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:04,240
Okay, here we go. Oh, that that is a good one. Okay at monkey Jones asks opinion on kicking Ben out of the PCP

2701
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:08,800
Well, I think we just made our case pretty eloquently just I vote for I vote pro

2702
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:11,520
Pro, let's do it. All right

2703
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:17,320
I believe we were once talking about the idea of making the PCP more like zoom where it's a rotating cast of young people

2704
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:20,520
We're like once you turn 30 you're out and it's only 20. Oh, yeah

2705
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:27,160
Yeah, yeah, and then and then you know, I'll I'll have to go inform my own PCP with blackjack and hookers

2706
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:30,920
And then Tom and Jess will will come along shortly. I hope if they'll have me

2707
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,360
Okay, let's do one more because this is a topical question

2708
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:41,160
I'm just I'm curious what you guys would say so at spacko 306 who's actually making a bunch of cool PCP gifts

2709
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:47,960
Keep making those dude. They're they amuse me any thoughts on the Nintendo switch and or the new Zelda you're gonna buy one or not

2710
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:51,840
No, I don't I hate video games. Okay, gotcha

2711
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:58,840
Okay, I have a very very thorough thought which is that I was watching Vic play breath of the wild on the

2712
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:04,240
Broke college students edition the Wii U version and he was like in a little shack

2713
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:07,480
It was like a worn-down check was only a couple of beams of wood here in there

2714
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:11,080
You know and there was just like one like like wall of wooden planks

2715
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:14,280
That was like, you know a few inches higher than links head

2716
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:20,160
And he walked up to that wall and pushed some button and jumped over the wall

2717
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:25,760
And I didn't think he was gonna be able to jump over the wall and I was like, oh, I'm convinced this is a 10 out of 10

2718
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:32,160
Well, I'm not convinced but I do want to play it. Well, I did buy breath of the wild

2719
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:36,440
But I bought the Wii U version for poor people. Mm-hmm. I haven't played it yet

2720
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:39,280
But it's yeah, I mean poor people have a fucking Wii U

2721
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:42,600
about I

2722
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:48,400
Think monkeys say he's too poor to even have a Wii U. Oh, shut up, mom. You've got all that fucking book money you little bitch

2723
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:52,120
One home month a rent, baby

2724
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:56,320
I am going to actually buy a switch just because it looks cool

2725
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:58,720
And I want the games that are coming and I don't have a Wii U

2726
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:01,280
So if I want to play Zelda I got no fucking choice, so I'm gonna get one

2727
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:04,800
They got you by the balls on this one. They do by the balls

2728
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:10,200
All right, and there was another question about why all the questions doing it guys

2729
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:17,520
So they're doing it. I'm having sex with the young here in the past. All those children saved. Yes, it's a miracle

2730
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,520
It's a miracle. Asian wife. Yeah

2731
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:26,360
You all saved the children you saved the children's hospital

2732
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:33,720
Thank God for that girl. I'm so proud of us

2733
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:39,880
Yeah, we really did it. We really this was a this was a wonderful arc that we've journeyed on throughout this

2734
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,500
Podcast

2735
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:46,560
Yeah, we're done. All right. Thank God everybody. Whoo. That was an exhaust everybody say goodbye
