00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Oh my god! We did it! We're back! Max Revive Hyperbolic 1 Chamber! We did it guys! It's

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,280
only been fucking 10 million months, but we're back. We did it! Max Revive Tommy Oliver TV.

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,960
Go check out the link in the description. I put out six, seven videos in two weeks. Fucking

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,480
amazing! Did that and now we're back here for the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber to bitch about

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:40,880
shit! Yes! Today we have a new wine on the wine chamber we haven't had yet. Tis the season

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,960
for this wine. We're going basic bitch and basic bro at the same time. Today we are drinking

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,360
Captain Morgan's Jackoblast Pumpkin Spiced Rum. Mixed with a little bit of Coca-Cola for

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,560
good measure. It's fucking gay and I love it. If you would like to donate to the wine

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,200
funds so I can try more wines on the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber, link to my PayPal is in the

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,120
description down below. I've also decided to try and make the show more frequent since

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't know what to bitch about all the time. You can, in addition to sending some money

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,560
and suggesting a wine, you can also suggest a topic for me to bitch about. So if there's

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,240
something you want to vicariously get off your chest, let me know, send some money, suggest

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,000
a wine, suggest a topic and I'll fucking tear it a new asshole. So with that out of the

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,600
way, I have no one to recommend or thank for donating this wine. I bought it myself. However,

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,240
I still need to give a shout out to someone for this episode and that is going to be Matt

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:57,240
on Twitter at Techtonic Improv because they messaged me about five or so days ago saying

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,760
that they were still waiting for my defense of Dungeons and Dragons because if you remember,

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:10,040
resident shitfucker Ben Sainte has constantly shit on Dungeons and Dragons and told everybody

20
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,760
that it's not fun and it's impossible to have fun playing Dungeons and Dragons. When you

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,680
know what? He's fucking wrong. D&D is a fantastic game. Tabletop is a fantastic medium and it

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:31,120
shouldn't be shit on by this contrarian motherfucker. It's good shit with an asterisk because Dungeons

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,600
and Dragons' biggest strength is also its greatest weakness. It requires people, those

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:44,680
motherfucking shitstains that everybody hates. Yes, people is the key to D&D's appeal and also

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,720
the chink in its armor because it makes it difficult to have the game be in an optimal

26
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,760
condition because you have to understand what makes Dungeons and Dragons a good or a bad experience

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,680
is entirely dependent upon the people you are playing with. D&D's rulesets, D&D's lore,

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,360
D&D's mechanics on its own, not very interesting. Everything is dependent upon the people you're

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,360
playing with and how they play the game and most importantly the Dungeon Master and how creative

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,720
and interesting they are. Finding a good DM is incredibly difficult, especially in this age

31
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,520
where everyone is fucking used to instant gratification and shit. You got to have somebody

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,880
with a little bit, a little bit going on upstairs if you get what I mean. They got to be smart,

33
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,800
they got to be quick, they got to be creative, they got to be able to make shit up on the fly

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,440
because the Dungeon Master, despite being probably the biggest barrier to playing something like

35
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,760
D&D as opposed to any other tabletop or board game where you have a bunch of people like,

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
hey, I want to play the game. You want to play the game? Let's play the game. We sit down at the

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,040
table, we open up the box, everybody picks their dude and you start playing the game. You know,

38
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,320
I got a bunch of games like that sitting on my chauffeur behind me like Mage Wars,

39
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,080
portrayal of the house on the hill, even something more simple like Bunchkin. All you got to do,

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,560
sit down, play the game. The game basically runs itself and you just do the player part of

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,840
the interaction. However, Dungeons & Dragons requires a human on the opposite side of the

42
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,080
spectrum as well. You need someone to be playing the game itself. You know, the game doesn't run

43
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,400
on autopilot and the players just have their interactions. You need the opposition, the

44
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,080
challenge to have a human involved as well. And this makes it very difficult to get into D&D

45
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,040
because finding people want to play D&D is easy. Finding people who want to actually run the campaign

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,800
is very difficult. It requires a lot more. However, when you find a good DM, that's where

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,880
the magic happens, okay? Because the biggest strength of Dungeons & Dragons and other pen

48
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:53,040
and paper role playing games is that they break free of the biggest restraint of games in general.

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:02,160
And that is the mechanics and the boundaries of the game itself. Video games are an amazing medium.

50
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Board games are an amazing medium. Games in general is an amazing medium. However,

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,320
the biggest problem with things like games is that they limit the tool set available at your

52
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:22,080
disposal in order to get things done. When you play a video game, you are limited to interacting

53
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:30,000
with the game to how your character has been pre-assigned to do so. You have a limited move set.

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,320
You can only do certain techniques in the game that the developers have given you to use. When

55
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,400
you want to interact with characters in story segments and something like a role playing game,

56
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,760
you have pre-assigned statements that you can use and pre-assigned actions you can take. And

57
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,600
everything has to be done within the boundaries, within the sandbox that the developers have

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:00,320
designed for you because you're interacting with a machine with a scripted preset of options.

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,600
And you cannot go beyond those options without breaking the game in some way. If you go beyond

60
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,120
the options, that's usually a glitch. That's usually a mistake. It's something the developers

61
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
actively want to prevent you from doing. And the most successful games that feel the most immersive

62
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,560
are when they give you all the options that you can possibly think of wanting to do

63
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,680
because that makes you feel like you have a ton of options available to you. There's two ways

64
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,280
that a traditional game can attack this problem. You want to A, have a world that gives players

65
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,880
options, but at the same time you want to mentally railroad your players as well. You want to put them

66
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,640
in a situation where they feel as if all the options that they would think of are available to

67
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,920
them. And so you put them in a situation where the things they would think of doing are very limited

68
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,760
and then you give them those options. A game type that people never complain like, oh, it feels

69
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,760
limited is something like a fighting game. Because a fighting game is a one-on-one combat system.

70
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,200
And the only thing that you want to do when you sit down and play a fighting game is beat

71
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,640
the shit out of the guy on the other side of the screen. And the game gives you tons of ways of

72
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,480
doing that. So you never really feel like you're starved for options in a fighting game because

73
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,400
the entire game is crafted to only make you want to do one thing. You never play a fighting game

74
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,040
or like, man, I wish I could like talk it out because it's not an option. You know, when you're

75
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,800
in an RPG or something, there are times when you're just like, man, I wish I could have just like

76
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,680
tried a diplomatic option talking to this character. But if the game doesn't give you the option for

77
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,560
diplomacy, you have to engage in combat or you have to do certain things. Or it's like, man,

78
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
I wish I could have done a specific moveset, but I can't do any moves with my character

79
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,480
outside of these five or six different branching combo systems that I can earn through the game.

80
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,040
Games are limited. And that's the biggest problem with them. You have to work within their

81
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:00,800
mechanics. But what makes D&D so amazing, what makes D&D so fantastic is because it is not

82
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,320
constrained in the same way because of the Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master is a human being.

83
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:16,480
So because it's not a pre-programmed system, the DM can respond in real time to anything you

84
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,920
can think up. And this is the strength, the magic of D&D and pen and paper role playing,

85
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:32,240
is that the rules are not set in stone. The mechanics of the game are just a set of suggestions

86
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,360
and you are able to interact with the person. There's an actual person controlling the mechanisms

87
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,000
of the game. And so anything you can think up and do, they can respond to and assign that task

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,920
and push that specific idea you have and implement it into the rule structure of the game, because

89
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,040
everything's done around the D20 dice system. So anything you can think up can be assigned a

90
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:05,680
difficulty on a D20 role or some sort of variation thereof. So you can do anything you want in D&D.

91
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,000
You are not limited by a moveset. You're not limited by mechanics. You're not limited by

92
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,240
anything because you have a human being on the other side working the mechanics of the game

93
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,280
in charge of the system itself, because the system itself has just as much human power

94
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,360
and creativity behind it as the players playing the game, anything can happen. And this is why

95
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,320
the people you play D&D with are essential for having good time. I've played D&D with dumb

96
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,240
motherfuckers and all they want to do is kill shit. All they want to do is run into a dungeon,

97
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,360
roll dice, and slash things. And I'm just asking myself the entire time, why the fuck are we playing

98
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,000
D&D and not something like Dark Souls if you just want to run in a dungeon and slash things?

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,840
There's nothing more fun about rolling a dice and slashing something in D&D than there is

100
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,320
slashing something in a video game. A video game is designed to do that, to be a visceral

101
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,760
combat simulation. There's so many games that let you do that. D&D is so much more than that,

102
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,480
and that's why you need good people. You need players who are willing to think outside the box

103
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,560
and treat D&D as a pen and paper game where they can creatively solve problems as opposed to treating

104
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,240
it like a video game on a table where, oh, I'm just going to use my sword because it has plus

105
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240
three strength and I'm going to roll. And that's what I'm going to do. That's boring. If you're

106
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,160
playing D&D like that, if you're playing D&D with a bunch of people who just want to play a fucking

107
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,760
video game, that's going to suck. And if you're playing with a DM that treats everything very basic,

108
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,320
that's going to suck. To play D&D and have a great time, you need to play with people who

109
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:44,320
understand the strengths of pen and paper and leverage it by never doing things just by the

110
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,960
book and trying to roll dice and approaching everything boring. You want people who really,

111
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,520
who want to literally role play, who want to become this character, think creatively in situations

112
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,920
and always be trying to do different and interesting things. They never just want to swing a sword or

113
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,320
cast magic missile. No, no, no, no. The people who are going to have a ton of fun playing D&D with

114
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,920
are people who want to start shit just to start shit. All right, I've said this story a couple

115
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,800
times on social media, but my favorite thing I've ever done in D&D is when I played a dragonborn

116
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,560
paladin who was a pacifist. He refused to fight anything because it was at a front to his god.

117
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,680
So I put all of his stats into charisma and diplomacy. All he would do was talk to people

118
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,800
and I gave him all of his beats. I just gave him a fuck ton of languages. And so we're on this

119
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,840
pirate ship or we're on a merchant ship and get attacked by pirates. And so everybody's upstairs

120
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,880
fighting the fucking pirates because that's what the DM wanted us to do. All right. And this is why

121
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:52,160
you need a good D&D DM as well so they can handle these situations that the person who's DMing can

122
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,320
respond to these creative things. So I said, I don't want to fight them. My guy would never fight.

123
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,440
He's going down into the cargo hold of the ship. He's going to pray. He's going to pray that the

124
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,680
conflict is resolved. And everyone's like pissing me like, what the fuck dude? You're like a big

125
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,880
fucking giant half dragon guy. Come help us fight. I don't have any weapons. I'm just going downstairs

126
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,600
and my guy's going to pray. So he goes down and he starts praying to his god. So the DM gets mad

127
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,480
at me and wants to force my hand into combat. So it's like the pirates breach the hull of the ship

128
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,440
and the cargo hold and a bunch of giant alligators that are in the water around us enter the cargo

129
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,440
hold. They're trying to kill you. They're trying to eat you. They're giant. They can actually eat you.

130
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,160
So if I just approach this as a video game, I'm like, I'm going to get out. I'll bear hand combat

131
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
them or I'll, you know, I'll do a perception check to see if I can find a sword or something down

132
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,960
here in the cargo hold. But no, I was like, hmm, I tried to fudge it. I tried to like, how can I

133
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,680
creatively think of a situation out of this that is going to keep me in character? My guy is a diplomat.

134
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:02,400
He likes to talk. He has an incredibly high charisma bonus and a stupidly high diplomacy check

135
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,840
and he knows a fuck ton of languages and he's part, he's part reptiles. So I'm like, I want to,

136
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,920
I want to, I want to talk to the alligators and they're like, are you fucking retarded? The DM's

137
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,560
like, looks at me like I'm idiot. Like you want to talk to the alligators. I'm like, yeah,

138
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,400
I want to try and talk to them. I know Draconic. I know a bunch of other weird primitive languages.

139
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,360
I'm going to try talking to them and I roll a natural 20 on it. And while everyone flees the

140
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,880
sinking ship on boats, I surf out on a giant fucking alligator who's not my best friend.

141
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,240
That is why D&D is the best fucking game of all time because you could never do something like that

142
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,960
in any other kind of medium. Pen and paper is magical when you have people who think creatively

143
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,400
and you have a dungeon master who is able to entertain those out of the box thoughts and

144
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,880
not only entertains them, but actively encourages them and wants to think creatively too. D&D

145
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,080
is so fucking good when people actually want to have fun with it. When they recognize and

146
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,640
appreciate the strength of pen and paper, the ability to adapt any idea into a gameplay

147
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,720
mechanic and you're not limited by prescripted tools and explore that to the best of your

148
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,960
abilities. Dungeons and Dragons is amazing if you play with the right people and it's so

149
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,440
fucking boring when you play with dumbasses who only treat it like a fucking video game

150
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,880
with no graphics. So find some people who are fun, play D&D, have a good time, drink some Captain

151
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:38,000
Morgan's Jackoblast, hyperbolic mindchamber out bitch!
