1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,200
What's up motherfuckers?

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:36,880
Welcome to the first inaugural episode of Digibro's Compression Chamber, a podcast

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:45,960
about nothing in which I attempt to relax as relaxing is against my nature.

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,560
You know, I'm one of those guys, you probably hear us talk about our plight all the time,

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,880
I know I hear Jesse talk about it all the time.

6
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm one of those guys who tends to make everything into a project.

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,400
Every time I get an idea in my head, it spirals out of control and becomes a thing.

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,520
And thankfully, unlike Jesse, my projects are never, they're never something that's

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,480
gonna take me a whole month to do.

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,800
It's more like I get constant ideas for little projects and I just burn through them as fast

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,560
as I possibly can.

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,200
And if I don't burn through them fast enough, they just get left by the wayside.

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,920
If a project's too big for those couple of days when I'm excited about it or if it just

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,200
takes a little bit too much mental energy, it's gonna fall by the wayside, you know.

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,680
It's so hard for me to have, to just like, to try to just do things at a normal rate

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,040
to just, you know, take a few days to get something done if it needs it or hold off

17
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,840
on the next idea until, until the time comes, you know, just, instead it's like this constant

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,160
like the second I come up with the next thing, the last thing has to be over so I can work

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,000
on the next thing and then I don't know where I am anymore after a little while, I'll guide

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,680
you through what this is like in a moment.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,120
But just to explain the nature of this podcast, you know, I'm laying on the couch with a beer,

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:22,320
I encourage you to do the same to, to imitate me in this podcast.

23
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,160
And I'm just trying to decompress.

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,640
You know, I used to, I used to sort of do this on Digi Bros, which is a show, my Let's

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,720
Play show, my Let's Play channel that hasn't been very active lately because it used to

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,240
be that me and my brother Victor would get together every week or two and we'd talk about

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,040
all the stuff that was going in our lives over the course of the, you know, the time

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
we'd been apart.

29
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,760
But Victor is almost never around anymore.

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,680
Since our parents moved out at the start of September, Victor has mostly been at his girlfriend

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,200
Hope's house.

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,600
He's probably going to be moving in with their, like, you know, next year at some point.

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
He mostly uses our house as like a studio space.

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,000
He comes here to work on editing and stuff.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,320
Anytime he has like a, you know, he needs to get work done or something, but he barely

36
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,920
ever is just hanging out here.

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,880
So I don't see him a whole lot.

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,760
And you know, we keep saying we're going to do another Digi Bros because we've had like

39
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
a month of nonstop things happening that we could talk about, but it hasn't been happening.

40
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,840
But you know, even then with that show, it's like there's a difference between the way

41
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,600
you talk about something to get it off your chest and the way you talk about something

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,000
to another person, you know, and with Victor, there's a certain security in that I've known

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,960
him my whole life and nothing I could possibly say would surprise him or would make him want

44
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,680
to comment on it, you know.

45
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,120
Victor has a very like standoffish approach to my life.

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
If I tell him something that's going on with me, he doesn't try to give me any advice.

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
He doesn't try to like analyze it in any way.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,160
He's just like, yeah, that sure is a thing that happened, you know, and that makes him

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,000
easier to talk to in that way.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,800
But even then, you know, it's still a person who I'm trying to present things to in like

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,560
the story like way, you know, the way I talk on DigiBros is very heightened, like I'm

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,520
trying to be entertaining or to put a spin on the story.

53
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,040
That's not what this podcast is about.

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,960
This podcast is being recorded in such a way that it's as though there is no audience.

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,680
I've even played with the idea of turning off comments for these videos, but I do actually

56
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,880
want to know how people think of the show itself, you know, if not particularly the topics

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,360
at hand.

58
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,040
But you know, I think that when I do a podcast with another person or even when I do a vlog,

59
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,240
there's a certain like level of putting on airs, there's a certain level of trying to

60
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,480
find the perfect words and describe everything in a way that's going to, you know, make the

61
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,240
most sense to the other person as opposed to just like decompressing.

62
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,120
I don't want to use the word venting because this isn't about being angry or like stressed

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
out.

64
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,000
I actually feel really good right now.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,560
The reason I need to decompress is that there's just so much I'm doing and so much going on

66
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,920
that like I need a moment, you know, and for me, taking a moment is near impossible.

67
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Like how can I possibly take a moment that I'm not like working on anything?

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,640
It's hard to justify to myself.

69
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,680
It's like when I, you know, usually I'll go for a walk or something, but those aren't

70
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,440
really to decompress so much as usually it's because I'm trying to think of more things

71
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
to do.

72
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,460
Like I'll go for a walk because I need the next video to write and I'm trying to come

73
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,360
up with an idea and then like while I'm out on that walk, then, you know, if at some point

74
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,200
I finally come up with an idea, then I'll like rush home to get it done, you know, like

75
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:13,480
I won't walk as long if I come up with something I really want to do before the walk is over.

76
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,000
But like I'm constantly searching for the next idea.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,280
I'm constantly like beating over my, beating myself over the head to come up with something

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,620
as opposed to just like chilling out for a second and like, you know, maybe reveling

79
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,760
in what I have done, you know, I have a tendency I will do things like, you know, a video comes

80
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,000
out, I feel accomplished, I go out and buy something to eat to celebrate, you know, and

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,440
I do have moments like when a big thing happens that I cool off, but I think that there's

82
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,840
possibly some bad behavior being instigated by that and I'm going to get into why when

83
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,280
I describe my past week because I've all, I've kind of been building up to like why

84
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
I need to decompress.

85
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,120
So this past, oh my God, it's almost two weeks actually now that I'm realizing it.

86
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,800
The past week and a half to two weeks has been one of the most productive periods of

87
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,640
my entire life.

88
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:12,280
Now I'm someone who generally bounces between periods of insane productivity and periods

89
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,760
of eh productivity and usually those periods of eh productivity involves a lot of socializing.

90
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,340
Usually if I'm not getting a lot of stuff done, it's because I'm spending a lot of time

91
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:29,800
with other people or I'm trying to set up something, you know, something complicated.

92
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,680
Usually it's, it's because I'm doing something else other than work and I don't have enough

93
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,480
good ideas to drag me back to work, but as soon as those good ideas come, as soon as

94
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,440
I get inspired again, I come rushing back.

95
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,760
So here's what's been inspiring so much in the last couple weeks.

96
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,640
You know, me and DeVu, we were starting to work on, starting to work on videos together

97
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,980
towards the end of September.

98
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,080
We'd taken sort of a long break.

99
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,480
We had Radcon, you know, we had a lot of stuff going on.

100
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,120
We were trying to get ourselves sorted out and then we pumped out these two videos at

101
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,120
the end of September and I felt really good about that.

102
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,160
So then we got to work on the next one, which is Akiyuki Shinbo in the 90s, which is a project

103
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,920
that I'd had on hold for like a whole year.

104
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:21,160
I'd started it in at the end of 2015 and I thought there was no way I'd be willing to

105
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,040
edit it myself because I was going to edit it myself at the time and like just the thought

106
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,880
of how much effort it was going to take, which the kind of editing that it is, is the kind

107
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,480
of stuff that DeVu is just really good at.

108
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,160
I literally don't know how he edits these so fast.

109
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:45,000
He's most of the way through part two after about a day and a half and he keeps assuring

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,200
me, oh, don't worry, I'm almost done and stuff, I'm not worried, I can't believe you're working

111
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,840
this fast.

112
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,800
It's incredible how fast he can find all the specific examples that are needed for something.

113
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,560
What made it possible is that he, because the reason I wasn't going to ask him to do

114
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,200
it, is because there's a lot of stuff you have to watch for this and at the time that

115
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,040
I was working on it, he wasn't on my full-time payroll yet, but the biggest thing is that

116
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,200
he would have to watch all of Yu-Yu Hakusho, which is 112 episodes.

117
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,720
It just so happened that he ended up doing that anyway.

118
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Him and his brother went ahead and just watched Yu-Yu Hakusho for the hell of it and then

119
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,400
I was like, oh my god, if you've seen all of Yu-Yu Hakusho, then you're already halfway

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,960
done with everything you need to watch, more than halfway done, for Shinbo in the 90s.

121
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,760
So I took the project off Hiatus and the two of us jammed it out.

122
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,800
I got the whole thing written, he's almost done editing it, he went on like a weird little

123
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,840
sabbatical for a few days because he went down what he calls a video game hole where

124
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,080
he, every once in a while, he remembers that he's really obsessed with video games and

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,440
then he just doesn't do anything but think about how badly he wants to make games and

126
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,880
then he snaps out of it when he runs out of money or something and so he gets back to

127
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,680
work on anime videos.

128
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:16,040
So while he was doing that though, we had come up with this idea where I was like, actually

129
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,480
he was talking about how in 2014 I put out a video every single day for a month, for

130
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,080
the month of October.

131
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,600
It was a challenge to myself that had a few purposes.

132
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,240
One was because I'd already written most of the 8 Nights of Karinokyokai series and so

133
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,280
I felt like I was already, I had a good foot in the door if I wanted to do it, I wanted

134
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,080
to do some kind of challenge video thing and I also wanted to have more anime videos on

135
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,780
my channel because I was concerned with the fact that, you know, in order to really have

136
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,960
a rapport with a reviewer, you need to really know a lot of their opinions, you can't really

137
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,100
get a sense of how you feel about someone's stance on things if you don't know their stance

138
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
on things.

139
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,700
So I wanted to review a lot of anime in a short period of time so people would get a better

140
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,620
sense of my tastes and just how I write and stuff like that.

141
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,580
So all of that sort of culminated in this thing and in order to make it happen, I made

142
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:19,500
bets with everyone I know, basically, I got everyone to put in money against me on whether

143
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,060
or not I could finish this in a month.

144
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,500
With the caveat being that each video was supposed to be of a level of quality that

145
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,580
it could be patroned if I wanted to, though I did not patron most of them and some of

146
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,860
them were definitely not of that level of quality, but nonetheless I did do it.

147
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,780
I did a video every day for a month in October and it was a big cool thing and it's funny

148
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,500
because I've never really gotten a lot of credit for it because my channel was fairly

149
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,740
small at the time and not so much in subscriber count, but people weren't watching my videos

150
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,620
because I was pretty new to anime and I didn't have a lot of followers who cared about anime

151
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,260
that deeply and I had a lot of stuff that I was talking about that nobody cared about

152
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,020
so I don't think anybody watched every video that month except probably the DeVu who at

153
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,740
that point had just started working for me as an editor and he got done, he got a couple

154
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:21,500
of those videos edited himself, so a couple of my biggest videos came out that month,

155
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:29,380
like back to back what is anime and what isn't and Sword Art Online sucks part one came out

156
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,380
that month.

157
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,980
Anyways, point being he wanted to try to do that again, like with him editing and me writing

158
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,380
which would make it twice as easy to get it done and I was like well a video every single

159
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:46,380
day might be pushing it because the quality definitely suffered in the previous attempt,

160
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,800
you know there's a lot of videos from that month that are not worth going back to really.

161
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,220
So I thought well what if we did one every other day and the concept will be a novel

162
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:03,060
worth of videos because November is coming and November is National Novel Writing Month.

163
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,980
Now I've been trying National Novel Writing Month every year since like 2006, I want to

164
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:17,460
say I've been doing it a straight decade now, I succeeded in 2010, I wrote a novel, I never

165
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:25,220
looked at it again after the month was over, like I wrote on the last day, the last day

166
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:33,940
I wrote 24,000 words, I wrote a thousand words an hour for 24 hours and that's how I finished

167
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,940
my novel because I hadn't touched it in like two weeks and it was way behind and I just

168
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,300
jammed it out in a day and then never looked at it again because it was such a mess, the

169
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:52,420
book was just so like full of plot holes and structural issues and bad writing that I just

170
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:58,180
didn't look at it ever again but all I cared about was that I had won Nano Remo because

171
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,980
I wrote 50,000 words in a month.

172
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:09,500
So then last year I wanted to do a novel in videos but I didn't have any good ideas until

173
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,420
like late into November when I came up with the Asterisk War Sucks series which did end

174
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,740
up being a novel in videos but I started writing it at like the very end of November and ended

175
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,940
around the end of December so I think it might have been slightly over a month and either

176
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,820
way it wasn't, I wasn't keeping track of it basically, I wasn't keeping track of time,

177
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,500
I didn't know it would be a novel length by the end but it was great that it turned out

178
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
that way.

179
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,260
So then this month I thought well what if we just straight up do that and so I wrote

180
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:45,620
myself out a day to day calendar like of how you know the Nano Remo thing is that you have

181
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,500
to write 1,667 words a day in order to hit 50,000 by the end of the month.

182
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,900
Now obviously you can write as much in a day as you want to play catch up if you need to.

183
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,260
Currently I have to catch up, I'm a few days behind but I've been doing pretty well.

184
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:09,660
Now when I came up with this I was like okay well the concept is 15 videos right?

185
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:22,180
So 15 out of 50,000 is something like 3,500 something like that I think maybe even 4,000.

186
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,980
It's a lot of words for one video because 15 videos that would all have to be like basically

187
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,380
between 15 and 20 minutes long is about the length that I would get from a 3,500 word

188
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,780
post.

189
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,980
So in order for that to happen each of these videos would have to be pretty long for it

190
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,100
to have to be a novel worth of videos and so I started writing these posts and very quickly

191
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,820
realized that they're not that long, they're probably closer to 10 minutes so I've been

192
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,100
doing a great job of keeping up with my daily quota of words but I also am quickly realizing

193
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,020
that I'm going to exceed 15 videos that I've written this month.

194
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,420
So whether or not DeVu ends up editing more or less I don't know, all I know is I'm stacking

195
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,580
up a backlog that's pretty fucking nice to look at right now.

196
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:22,020
I wrote 6 posts in 5 and a half days, I wrote 6 posts all of which I love, all 6 of them

197
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,780
I thought were great, I'm proud of all of them, they're all things from my bucket list.

198
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:32,140
Like basically there's certain videos I've wanted to write for a very long time and just

199
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,460
never like got around to it because one reason or another and then finally just like having

200
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,740
the pressure of like alright let's see if we can do it now and each every single day

201
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:49,020
that I've written for this I had started at like midnight like it was like 45 minutes

202
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,660
before I would be out of time for the day and I'm trying to catch up with the word count

203
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,260
you know so I'm trying to crank these things out like a thousand words to 1500 words in

204
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,980
an hour and they're coming out great like because of it because I'm just forcing myself

205
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,500
to actually fucking write this thing that I've been thinking I don't know how it's

206
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,740
going to be I don't know how to structure it and then like once you're in the moment

207
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,180
and it's like alright let's just first sentence that comes to mind fucking throw it down and

208
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,740
we'll go from there you know we'll structure it based on that and that's been a great idea

209
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:29,580
so I wrote six videos that I'm really into then so I'm I've got that going on and I'm

210
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,700
on like you know day six I'm kind of I start a video that I don't really like you know

211
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,420
I wrote a couple paragraphs and I was like this isn't going how I want it to go so it

212
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:44,380
kind of cool it cooling off to that you know just a little bit and then I I'm just this

213
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,340
is what I'm talking about with ideas that come up out of nowhere and then totally change

214
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,260
everything I'm doing so everyone's talking about this music video called shelter right

215
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,100
it's it's this little anime music video put together it's an a1 pictures thing everyone's

216
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,740
like like looking at me like oh do you hate this because it's a1 it's like it's like one

217
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,180
person made this it's like there's the director and then the animator who animated the whole

218
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,220
fucking thing you know and then like the the musician who made the music I don't even think

219
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,660
it's like to think of it as an a1 pictures thing is kind of like besides the point it's

220
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,460
obviously these two people's creation but nonetheless I don't really care for it I think

221
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:34,860
it's it's it's fairly trite and as much movement as there is in the animation the style of it

222
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:43,460
didn't really interest or impress me so yeah I wasn't that into it but nonetheless I saw

223
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,820
all these people talking about it and I thought man this is a great opportunity to talk about

224
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:55,860
anime music videos because one of the reasons that my my number of completed shows on my anime

225
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,940
list is so fucking high is because I watch lots of shorts I'll go through these phases we're all

226
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,020
just like spend a couple days like marathoning tons of music videos or other shorts and I think

227
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,500
they're really cool and like they're great way to see like lots of experimental different stuff

228
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,980
not all of it's good in fact not even most of it's good most of it's pretty middle of the road

229
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,940
usually it's like well that was kind of cool I guess but it was totally pointless and I'll never

230
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,660
think about it again it's pretty rare to get music videos that you actually like want to revisit

231
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:40,340
amazing but nonetheless I watched like all of them and so I thought what if I made a video like

232
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,140
10 cool anime music videos you should all check out since you're so psyched about this one here's

233
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,140
all these other great ones so then of course I think well if I want to do that I should make

234
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:57,620
sure I know every cool music video you know what if I make this video and I totally miss out on

235
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:04,820
like the coolest one ever so I go to my anime list and I sort you know by music video and like

236
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,540
you know show me all the completed music videos out there and there's 10 pages of about 50 shows

237
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:19,860
a page and I look at that and I think I bet I could do that I'm yeah 500 I mean they're only like

238
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:27,300
three to five minutes a piece so what's the big deal you know now I've been skipping I'm skipping

239
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,180
all the ones that that I can't find obviously those there's a there's a lot of them that I just

240
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,820
straight up can't find I'm skipping a lot of the ones that are tie-ins to shows because most of

241
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,500
those are awful it's usually like the opening theme song and they they animated a little thing and

242
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,500
it's always shit um the best ones would be stuff like the love live ones where they just make like

243
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:56,260
a music video but I I hate idol shows and I can't get into it at all I watched the video for um snow

244
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,460
halation and I was like this sure feels like an idol music video I mean it's incredibly well done

245
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,460
but I I don't like it you know I don't like the music I don't like idols uh so did didn't do much

246
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,780
for me but nonetheless um skipping most of those and any video that I'm just like I think is total

247
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:20,020
shit from the start I'll just stop watching it but nonetheless I go down this whole of music videos

248
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,820
and so for like you know this is an idea I've just had on a whim and then 12 hours later I've

249
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,380
been doing nothing but watching videos for 12 hours you know I have forgotten to eat or breathe

250
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:41,860
I'm just sitting there in a chair you know watching music videos non-stop and it's at some point I

251
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:47,620
got to the point where I'm like I'm not sure if I'm interested enough in this idea to keep going

252
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:54,340
like if this takes more than three days then I feel like the the hype from uh what's it called

253
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,780
we'll we'll have died down enough that like no one will be as open to this like it really felt

254
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,820
like something that had to happen now it had to be a flash in the pan it had to be completed all at once

255
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:16,020
so then as I'm working on this as I'm watching all these videos downstairs Davoo

256
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:23,140
is editing akuki shimbo in the 90s part one and he's finishing it up so I come downstairs you know

257
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,500
I think I had him wake me up I was like wake me up when it's done so he wakes me up

258
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,220
you know after I've slept probably eight hours after just a non-stop video music video binge all

259
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,100
night I come downstairs and I watch shimbo part one it's great we we you know workshop it a little

260
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:46,740
bit fix some things I upload it now as soon as I started seeing positive reactions to this

261
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:54,100
now mind you akuki shimbo in the 90s I knew from the start this is a video that's not going to get

262
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,060
a ton of views this is a video that not a ton of people are gonna care about some people are gonna

263
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:05,380
find it boring and stupid I will be shocked if anyone gets a lot out of it but the second there

264
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,740
was even one comment that was like this is the kind of stuff I come to you for or like wow such an

265
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:19,300
impressive amount of research or man I really learned to appreciate shimbo's work so much more

266
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,620
and I'm gonna check out some of these shows it only takes one comment like that to make me like

267
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,460
all right now we got to do part two you know like now we got to do the next one I mean

268
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,020
literal part two was already in the works of shinbo in the 90s but like shinbo in the 2000s

269
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,060
is a whole other animal and I was gonna hold off for a little bit because the project is gonna be

270
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:49,860
unbelievably massive I probably have to watch a hundred shows for this project like there's 70

271
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:58,660
that I definitely have to watch and those are ranging from you know two episodes to 26 at the

272
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:06,900
most so that's yeah that's like 70 shows I have to watch no matter what for this project now I don't

273
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,460
have to watch all of them before starting the project before any videos can come out like the

274
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,420
way I've been looking at it there might I might be able to like gradually put these out over like a

275
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:24,180
long course of time but nonetheless this is a titanic sized project and I was gonna just hold off

276
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:31,060
but the second I got that spark of inspiration it was like I gotta do it I gotta at least make the

277
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:37,140
preparations for it you know because there's a lot of prep work to be done I have to basically mostly

278
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,060
it's about organizing all of the data I have figuring out exactly what I need to watch why

279
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:50,340
who worked on it and what else they worked on that's basically the basis of it so I spend

280
00:24:50,340 --> 00:25:00,900
probably six or seven hours putting together a list of every show that shinbo's been involved with

281
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,940
from the soul taker onwards and everyone who's worked on more than one of those shows so if

282
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,540
there's a name that appears in the credits of two shows that he worked on now I only went for major

283
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,340
credits no one who's just like a key animator or an in-between or something that would be

284
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,940
I mean what I'm doing is already psychotic but that would be next level psychotic I mean

285
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:30,260
that would be psychotic on a literal level like no one would do that no matter how like it's just

286
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:37,460
not even a good idea there's no point to it but um anyone who's a major staffer I made the connections

287
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:46,180
and I put together this fucking huge list and then I spent two days of just straight work

288
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:54,100
turning that into a spreadsheet I have spent two entire days turning it into a spreadsheet

289
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,700
and the funniest thing about it is that it was the easiest most natural thing in the world for me

290
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:06,900
to do there is nothing that comes more natural to me than making lists and just putting data

291
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:14,340
into boxes like I've often thought that if I like if if for some reason I had to get a desk job

292
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,380
I'm gonna go for a data entry job because that shit I don't know if I'll be as into it if it's

293
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:26,900
not about something I care about but like I am just unbelievably good at zoning out

294
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:36,100
and making a list all night long I at no point had the thought like like oh this has to get done

295
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:44,980
it was just I just did it and like the first day it was a natural progression right like I

296
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,780
finished making my list and so then I started making the spreadsheet and then at some point I

297
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:56,900
was too tired to go on and I passed out I woke up at 11 30 p.m or no no what stopped me working on

298
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:02,740
the spreadsheet was I had to record the pcp uh Nate was gathering everybody together he was

299
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,940
really I was like I was too tired I wasn't gonna do it but he he conned me into it I did the pcp

300
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:17,380
and then I read some comics and then I went to bed woke up at 11 30 p.m I sat down in my chair

301
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,060
the spreadsheet was open and I didn't even like ask myself do I want to do something else first

302
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:30,660
I just started working on it and I didn't stop for 12 hours that's just it I just sat down

303
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,940
and I worked on it for 12 hours and it was it was helped as well by the fact that like

304
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:44,260
I've been in sort of a musical slump for most of this year uh you know I'm a big music fan but

305
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,260
I've kind of run out of like music that I that I like that I'm not sick of I listen to the same

306
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,380
shit over and over and over and over again I was getting tired of all the uh all the stuff I had

307
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,660
and I wasn't finding anything new I was I was out there on the prowl you know I ask people for

308
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,540
recommendations all the time but nobody knows what I like so yeah I can never find anything

309
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:12,740
new I haven't liked much of the new stuff coming out this year um so I decided I was like I need

310
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,420
a revolution I need to just go out there and start downloading shit and mass and fill my computer

311
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,220
first of all fill it with all the stuff it's missing because most of my stuff that I have on my

312
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:32,660
computer um is new because like at some point my um my hard drive died at like the start of 2014

313
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:40,740
and I lost all the music I had and I just never got it all back like all that I had on my computer

314
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,300
was stuff that was on my phone so anything that was still on the phone is on the computer and

315
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,540
there's like certain certain albums I've gone and like re-downloaded it or re-burned it to my

316
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,380
computer but there's like whole discographies of bands that I love that I haven't looked into

317
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,300
in you know the last two years and then also there's lots of songs that I've accumulated over time

318
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,780
that like that are like singles by bands that I don't really like any of their albums but I really

319
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,900
like that single but I've never downloaded the albums I just go to YouTube every once in a blue

320
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,620
moon you know and and and listen to it so I thought I'll download all those discographies too so I

321
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:24,340
found a reliable Russian torrenting site and just started mass downloading music and uh that helped

322
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:30,500
a lot with the spreadsheet making because listening to a band's entire discography is hard to make

323
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:38,340
time for unless you're doing a menial task that takes all fucking day and really leaves you with

324
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:46,820
like most of your brain space open to listen to music so I listened to like countless hours of Omar

325
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:54,820
Rodriguez Lopez music that's the guitarist for the Mars Volta who puts out um he he's basically like

326
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:01,620
a light novel artist of music he puts out stuff fucking constantly for ever since like 2006 he's

327
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,380
had at minimum like four albums a year and then this year he's pulling a full-blown NCOE scene and

328
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,620
doing an album a month every month all year the man's crazy he's not as bad as Buckethead but he's

329
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:19,460
crazy so I downloaded like 30 Omar albums and I was listening to a bunch of those then I downloaded

330
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,300
like the whole discography of Bad Religion which is a band who has like like 10 singles that I love

331
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,620
that I never heard an album of theirs so I was listening to their discography and I gotta say

332
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,060
I was surprised that a lot of it is pretty good like I expected it to just pretty much be the

333
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,940
singles but there's other great songs in there those guys are masters of hooks they write the

334
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:46,420
best hooks in the world there's so many songs with memorable choruses I it's it's it's crazy

335
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,860
because all their songs sound exactly the same except that they all have a different awesome

336
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:58,580
memorable chorus um so I was listening to all that um AFI downloaded their discography only to

337
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:04,180
realize that the one I grew up with December Underground is probably their only good album

338
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:10,740
but it is a great album I like I mean it was partly nostalgia for me but that album is fantastic

339
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,740
I like didn't remember it being as good as it was when I listened to it just now and I was like whoa

340
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,860
finally downloaded the fucking mindless self-indulgence discography I haven't had them on my computer

341
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:28,260
since the crash two years ago and immediately I realized mindless self-indulgence might be

342
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,940
my actual favorite band and I just forgotten all this time because I didn't have them on my computer

343
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:41,140
but my god I love them so much and yeah if you haven't noticed I'm mostly like

344
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,460
downloading stuff that I listened to when I was like a teenager or uh or like a young adult

345
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,940
I'm in that phase in my life where uh you know all all like

346
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,420
concept of guilt like guilty pleasures like I mean I don't believe in guilty pleasures anyway

347
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:06,900
but like any sort of shame I might have had about something I liked before is gone I will

348
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:12,980
probably download Linkin Park's discography and give the whole thing a whirl by the end of this week

349
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:20,900
so expect to hear a lot more of me singing because there's some great Linkin Park songs

350
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,780
like there's some songs that come on the radio when somewhere I belong comes on or faint comes on

351
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,380
I still get excited so I know there's gems in that discography I just gotta dig them out you know

352
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,900
really the biggest difficulty of this whole process is gonna be when I have to go through

353
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,700
every album by all these bands and try to like weed out all the songs I absolutely hate

354
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:50,900
because more on that subject I'm also starting to try and adopt a a populist mindset as they as

355
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:56,420
they call it on on mute I don't know if it's a meme or if it's like a thing that people actually

356
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:04,500
study but like uh you know I I was recently introduced to the youtuber Todd in the shadows

357
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,700
I'd heard about him for fucking ever he's a he's a classic that guy with the glasses member

358
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,220
been around the internet for a very long time um I I can't stand that guy with the glasses

359
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,460
stuff so I've avoided him but now that I actually watched him he's actually really good and he

360
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:24,660
does these really interesting videos about pop music and what's most interesting to me about it

361
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:31,060
is that it's pop music and I hate pop music so like hearing someone go really in depth about

362
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:36,980
this genre that I have like no interest or experience with it's pretty interesting like

363
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:42,660
I feel like he's um giving me the opportunity to have opinions about these things or to feel

364
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,780
anything about uh you know a musical genre that I would typically avoid and it's really funny for

365
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,660
me when I watch his like top 10 and top uh bottom 10 of the year because I can't really tell the

366
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:57,860
difference that much in the musical quality I'm like it's all just shitty pop music but

367
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:04,980
nonetheless he can get me to care about it to even like root for a song or artist or something like

368
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,340
that you know um but in any case part of what's interesting about it is that he really goes

369
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,140
by song you know he's like a song reviewer he doesn't have album reviews the way that like

370
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:20,420
Anthony Fantano would and I've always been an album guy I've always been someone who sits and

371
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:26,260
listens to the whole album but in the last couple of years I've felt myself gravitating towards

372
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,060
like shorter and shorter albums because I don't have time to listen to whole albums all the time

373
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:37,940
you know and um part of it was also when I lost all that music because I've always kept just the

374
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,900
tracks I really like on my iPod you know like I'm not going to keep the slower songs on there

375
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,740
because if I'm driving which is why I'm listening to music on my phone then like

376
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,860
I'm not going to want to hear the soft songs so I just leave them all off

377
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,900
but like now there's a bunch of albums on my computer where I only have the songs I really

378
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:04,580
like and guess what I like those albums a lot more now you know like um Sufjan Stevens album

379
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:11,540
The Age of Odds I would consider one of my favorite albums and the album's like almost 90

380
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:18,900
minutes long it's long as shit and I don't think that it would be one of my favorite albums if I

381
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,100
listen to the entire thing every single time because I'm not that into the song like too much

382
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:31,540
or the song uh god even the opening track like there's a there's a few tracks from the album

383
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:37,140
that just aren't on my phone and so like I kind of forgot about them until like the other day I

384
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,980
was listening to the song the whole album on YouTube like to hear those extra songs and I was like

385
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:47,860
yeah I know why I cut these out because this is like an extra 20 minutes of the album that without

386
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:53,780
it the album's easier to listen to and I'm more likely to listen to it repeatedly and you know

387
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:59,380
hear the songs I do like over and over again so I'm really warming up to this idea of like listening

388
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:05,860
to singles especially because my fucking phone has it has this might sound like a lot but my phone

389
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:12,020
only has 940 songs on it and it doesn't actually take that long to end up hearing all of it you

390
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,500
know and because shuffle sucks and every time it restarts it just plays you every fucking song

391
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,580
you just heard again and even when you go through it for a while like you know a lot of those are

392
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:29,460
again whole albums so like yeah 941 songs might sound like a lot but that's really like if there's

393
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:38,420
let's say 13 tracks an album um less than 90 albums that still sounds like a lot when I put it down

394
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:46,260
but let's just say I've heard those 941 songs many many times you know I rarely update

395
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,780
what's on my phone I rarely take stuff off or put stuff on so I'm quite used to hearing all of it

396
00:36:51,780 --> 00:37:01,380
and I drive a decent amount so yeah like I'm really in this mindset of it's time to

397
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,020
totally change my library let's get rid of all the songs I don't care about

398
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,460
let's put all the songs I like on and obviously not every song I like is one that I want to

399
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,420
listen to constantly but they do need to be on there you know like I don't exactly throw on

400
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:22,900
spirit they're gone spirit they vanished by uh animal collective when I'm like in the car

401
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:30,180
driving down the highway it's a very like contemplative alone at night song uh or album rather

402
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,860
so you know that one's going to stay on the computer but not likely make it onto the phone

403
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,380
but still you get what I'm saying and the reason it's called a a populist mindset is like

404
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,540
on mute they talk about how you know there's there's like rockists people who are into rock

405
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,940
music have a tendency to like really put all of their emphasis on the album um whereas people

406
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,140
who are into pop tend to put emphasis more on the songs and I do think that something is lost

407
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,300
by focusing too much on on full albums because I you know I watch Anthony Fantano's reviews

408
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:13,700
and sometimes he'll give like an eight out of ten to an album that is very consistent and very

409
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:20,580
strong in how it sounds but and maybe he feels differently than I do about this anyways but

410
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:26,660
like I'll feel like none of the songs individually stand out it's like a solid album at having the

411
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,900
sound it has but it's not an album I really want to hear all the time whereas there's some albums

412
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:37,620
that if you just take off a couple songs then all the rest of them are like the best song ever

413
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:46,020
you know like um acid rap by chance the rapper every song on it with the exception of smoke again

414
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:51,460
is like the greatest song ever written smoke again sucks I took smoke again off of there like

415
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,740
when I the album for like around when uh when I first discovered the album and uh I've never

416
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,660
had a problem it's always been like my favorite album I just kind of forgot that song is even

417
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:06,820
a part of it so like when you see it up on my my favorite albums list like just keep in mind

418
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,380
the caveat that I have forgotten that smoke again is a song on the album it's not even a terrible

419
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:19,940
song I just don't like it that much um the album lady gaga's art pop like manicure god awful song

420
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:27,860
take that off great album I originally had a few more songs off gypsy is pretty bad too take off gypsy

421
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:36,340
um but I originally had like Mary Jane Holland and uh what's the other one Donatella I originally

422
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,980
didn't have those on there but they worked their way back on you know it's not like I'm not open to

423
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,740
listening to these songs again and re reaffirming whether they belong on my list manicure is really

424
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:52,500
bad though that's an unlistenable song but nonetheless with all that stuff removed art

425
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,660
pops one of my favorite albums so I do think that there's something to this song based mindset

426
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:08,020
and I'd really like to get into it so aside from all that stuff that's been going on I also read

427
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:15,140
some comics yesterday uh consider this a response to Jesse's panel cast because uh Jesse started

428
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:21,300
up a podcast about reading new comics and he recommended some cool stuff and one of them was

429
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:27,380
Gwenpool which I like he was talking about it and he was showing the cover art on screen and I just

430
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,980
thought the character design was super adorable because it's like this just super bright pink

431
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:40,900
um very like anime-ish art style and I really liked it and then in the comments he had linked

432
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:47,540
someone he had he had linked someone a page of a batman comic but it was on this like comic

433
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:53,540
reader website and I was like oh hey a comic reader website I wonder if they have Gwenpool

434
00:40:53,540 --> 00:41:02,260
oh they do oh Gwenpool only has seven chapters so far because it's a brand new comic this all the

435
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:10,180
stars are lining up just right so I read all of Gwenpool and it was really good um it has it has

436
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:17,300
these great it's a it's a comic that plays with the meta of comics in really pretty obvious ways

437
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:27,700
but effective ways where it's it's kind of all about Gwen Gwenpool like basically she she knows

438
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,660
she's in a comic she used to read comics and she she's like you know from our world and she's taken

439
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:39,060
into this world and it's about her constantly like well you know what I won't get too into it

440
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,740
because Jesse talks about it in his podcast but I will talk about what I really liked at the end

441
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:49,700
of volume one is that there's a shit gets real moment that was like really intense and what I

442
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:55,540
liked about it is that it was this villain who is sort of a goofy villain and Gwenpool doesn't

443
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:01,380
take him seriously because she's like ha you know you're you're that guy like why would I take you

444
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:09,620
seriously and then he just like vaporizes like her friend right in front of her and it was shocking

445
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,340
because the tone of this comic is mostly pretty light-hearted and upbeat and this is like right

446
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:21,060
at the end of chapter one and it was shocking but what was cool about it is that it's that

447
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:27,700
villain because like yeah to us who don't have to deal with the consequences of a villain a super

448
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:34,180
villain's actions they can just be goofy but like when you think about what is actually happening

449
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:41,860
in the comic that a person has been vaporized you know then it's suddenly like man even the

450
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:48,580
goofiest super villain is is murdering people you know they are actually murdering people and that

451
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,700
shit is rough you know and that's sort of what the lesson of the comic is it's what Gwenpool is

452
00:42:53,700 --> 00:43:02,420
out there to realize is that you know shit is like for basically she sees it as this is a comic

453
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,620
therefore I can't take it seriously whereas what she has to realize is that for the characters in

454
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:12,260
the comic it is the real world and everything is as serious as it would be in the real world and

455
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,900
you know the comic is constantly drawing attention to how kind of shit it is to live in the comic

456
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:22,660
book world especially to the police force who are all just like they hate living in this town and

457
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:28,980
like why do we have to deal with this every day you know and uh that's the meta part that I really

458
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,260
like about it you know and I think that's really what the core of it is like there's lots of just

459
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,500
meta humor and jokes that aren't really that funny it's just kind of whatever you know it's just

460
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:47,220
kind of filler dialogue in a way but the actual core of the intrigue of it is really good um

461
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:54,100
and it's a lot of fun it kind of reminds me a little bit of the webcomic strong female

462
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,140
except the strong female protagonist is a lot more serious and a lot more like edgy

463
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,340
where a strong female protagonist is like a straight up watchmen thing Gwenpool is just fun

464
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:09,940
and lighthearted and like even though it has these like kind of deep biting messages it never

465
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:16,580
loses its tone of just like whimsical and fun um you know like when big things happen they tend to

466
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:25,060
happen in like pinpoint shock moments that are quickly over with as we get back to the fun um

467
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:33,220
and I like that about it it feels it makes it very easy to read and so yeah I might go and actually

468
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:39,380
buy the first graphic novel because it is out I believe um of the first six chapters

469
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:52,820
so in other news there was that Kickstarter that happened I started it probably over a week ago

470
00:44:53,460 --> 00:45:00,660
it's up to seven thousand dollars an incredible amount of money um I'm extremely paranoid about it

471
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:09,460
because the Kickstarter the income of it is taxable right I I have to pay taxes on it and

472
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,860
everything's in my name with regard to this Kickstarter now the person who's supposed to

473
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:18,820
get most of this money is Jesse but in the process of setting because this Kickstarter

474
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:24,100
kept making more money I kept adding more goals to it and I added all these goals about uh

475
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:30,660
blue rays and like how we'll make and send blue rays and I think it's entirely possible that I

476
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:36,500
have way like grossly underestimated the shipping cost of shipping all these blue rays out and that

477
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:44,020
I also haven't really accounted for how much of this money might get taken by taxes so uh and then

478
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:49,460
like a lot of the money has to go to flying everybody down you know uh and having them all

479
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:56,100
here for a week so I don't actually know if there is enough money in the Kickstarter to fund everything

480
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:03,220
that the Kickstarter promises um so I'm concerned about that but we won't really find out until

481
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:08,900
it's all said and done like I don't know what it's gonna cost to ship all these blue rays until I

482
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:15,380
know what it cost to ship to each of these people's houses um hopefully most of them live in the

483
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:23,620
United States but you never know it's a it's a mystery to everybody you know if it turns out

484
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:30,260
all of them live in Europe then it could end up racking up quite a hefty quite a hefty fee

485
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,700
but it also could be that I actually allocated more money for it than I realize like I don't I

486
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:42,020
don't know it's it's a it's a confusing process I think I had initially set it so that each dvd

487
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:49,300
goal was like $500 and that most of that would be for uh for mailing but I don't know if that's

488
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:55,780
enough so yeah I'm concerned about that but at the same time hopeful because I mean the results of

489
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:02,820
it have been incredible you know that it was such a weird moment of like why didn't we think to do

490
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:11,780
this before you know because we just did radcon one um at the start of september and like radcon

491
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:18,580
getting it organized was a huge ordeal you know because it's it's six people all have to have

492
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:24,900
time at the same time we all have to travel you know everyone had to figure out how they were

493
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:30,100
going to pay for it you know hypocrite costs a thousand dollars for a round trip from fucking

494
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:36,020
england um you know we were pitching in money I paid like $120 to his ticket you know just to

495
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:44,580
help him get over here and none of us ever thought maybe our audience would just want to see this

496
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:49,220
you know maybe now I mean it would have been harder to prove to our audience what we could do

497
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:53,300
you know like what's great about the plebe and the weave is that we already had three episodes so

498
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,900
we could say hey here's exactly what you're getting if you pay for this you know but like

499
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,860
the results were so overwhelming that I really do think like maybe we could have done this for

500
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:11,540
the first radcon you know and we had all been salt like after radcon was over we were all saying like

501
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:16,660
this should not be a once a year thing you know this should definitely happen sooner we've had

502
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,740
too many good projects good ideas and we really want to start talking about getting everybody

503
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:27,220
into one place you know because ben and divu moved in at the time of radcon but every all of us

504
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,340
want to live in the in proximity to each other because we've all been saying all this time that

505
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,980
like if we all lived in proximity we'd get so much stuff done there'd be so many projects we could do

506
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:42,180
together you know we could really make things come to life and like the part the point of radcon

507
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:48,260
was to prove that and we did prove that we got lots of great content out of it you know we got

508
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:54,020
stuff like the potty cast live or ben's uh lecture which is ben's lecture is like a totally different

509
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:59,220
genre of video that none of us have done before or would have thought of but now that it exists

510
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:05,300
it's like this is fucking genius there needs to be more of this you know i'd love to do a classroom

511
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,940
thing you know as often as possible doing the plebe in the weave was something me and jesse

512
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,500
had been planning for years just because we were like it won't be the same if we're in different

513
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:19,220
rooms it just won't be what we're looking for you know and now that we have it it's like this is

514
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:27,700
what we've been looking for so you know jesse said pretty early on into radcon he was like i

515
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,580
clearly need to move down here because this is obviously the best career path you know uh like

516
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,860
if i want to have a successful youtube career i need to be around you people um you know

517
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:44,180
nate has wanted to get down here for as long as as long as i've known him you know but he's trapped

518
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:51,060
by um financial insecurity but he just he's finished school so he doesn't worry about staying

519
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:55,620
there for school he's just trapped at his job and as soon as he can well he's not quite finished

520
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:01,140
with school but he's almost finished with school and like once he finishes school um and then you

521
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:06,740
know has enough money that he could leave his job and he could obviously make more money if it came

522
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:13,380
down here so like radcon too is probably a lot of going to be planning for how we're gonna move

523
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:20,180
those guys down here you know and i would really love if like jesse and nate could get a place together

524
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,980
i don't know how soon we can even get hippo i don't know if he needs citizenship or like a work visa

525
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:33,380
or something but like you know if if we could somehow afford to have to have everybody move in

526
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:39,460
then eventually we'll be able to you know get everybody because i think someone like nate who

527
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:46,980
on his own content he spends so much time it's it's definitely hard for him to turn a profit

528
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:52,740
on the kind of content he's making where every single thing is a six month long project for a

529
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:59,860
45 minute video but he when he works with other people we get stuff out all the time and if we

530
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:06,900
were turning a profit on something like pcp which the pcp as it stands is a goofy little podcast

531
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:13,300
that's you know we we vaguely come up with a topic we all jump into a call we talk over each

532
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:19,380
other and it's a nightmare but like the amount of effort that goes into a pcp would not increase

533
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:25,460
that much if we turned it into a live show with a little bit more production you know if it was

534
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:31,380
maybe three people on a panel and we have a little set and we discuss a more concrete topic and we

535
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,340
do that once a month it might become something that's worth patroning you know if we had a

536
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:42,820
patreon for the pcp uh and if you know if nate had a show that he could patreon i think he'd

537
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:49,060
probably be able to be a lot more quickly successful than he's gonna get with these super long uh you

538
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:54,900
know video projects and so that's why i really want everyone living in one place because i think

539
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:01,460
we will all make a lot more money this way you know ben by all rights should be making more money

540
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:07,700
because i keep offering him uh art things to do but he keeps not doing them um but nonetheless he

541
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:12,820
does have the opportunity divu is obviously gonna make a hell of a lot more money living with me

542
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:17,780
because we can get videos done quicker i mean if he didn't live with me we would not have been

543
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:23,380
inspired for this 15 videos in a month thing of which six are already written so guaranteed

544
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,740
you know next month we are going to make a shitload of money like even if i don't write

545
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:34,900
any more videos after this point i've already got enough um that you know we will have a very

546
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:40,820
successful time ahead of us so yeah i think everything's coming up really well and it's kind of

547
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:46,340
it's kind of like i'm watching a bunch of plans that i've had for so long that have always felt

548
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:55,460
so far away suddenly come into sharp relief you know it's like all at once earlier this year

549
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:02,180
in around like uh the area of july to august like my channel suddenly spiked in growth and my

550
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,980
patreon suddenly spiked in growth and then my parents decided to move out and then we built a

551
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:12,660
studio in my house and then ben and divu decided to move in and it's like these are all things that

552
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:18,820
i always thought were going to happen eventually and then they did and it's like holy shit well now

553
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,460
it's time for all the other things that we've wanted to happen eventually to happen you know uh

554
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,660
when are we going to stop talking about getting nate down here and just get nate down here you

555
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:34,580
know when are we going to stop saying jessie needs to move out of his house and somehow find a way

556
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:39,460
for him to move out of his house you know like it could be happening soon and i feel like this

557
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:44,100
kickstarter really gave us the opportunity to start making those considerations that like

558
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,660
you know after radcon we were all like well i don't know when we'll be able to do this again

559
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:54,420
when will we once again have a thousand dollars to fly hippo down you know that's a crazy amount of

560
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:01,460
money but now we have it all of a sudden we have it now it's just like oh well apparently radcon

561
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:07,620
two is gonna be in january uh let's buy everybody's tickets and get down here and when we're here we

562
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,780
could talk about how we're going to make this happen again you know next time it doesn't need to

563
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:18,980
be a kickstarter it could just be that we have money you know maybe we're not maybe we're not

564
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:26,340
capitalizing well enough on how much like clout we have you know that that that clearly there's

565
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:32,420
some part of our audience who cares a lot about getting us you know getting to see us do things

566
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:41,060
together um and we should be taking advantage of it in a in the best way not in the uh not in the

567
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:50,660
way that that could be taken well i guess that's most of what's been on my mind i felt pretty comfy

568
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:58,340
on this couch this beer has gotten warm in my hand as i've been barely sipping it between long

569
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:08,820
sections of tirade but uh yeah this was a good way to decompress i feel it i feel

570
