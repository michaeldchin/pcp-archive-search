00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,040
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, a podcast

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,200
about internet people talking about stuff.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,360
I'm the best guy ever and we're joined today by Munchy wears tiny hats.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,960
Don't let my mom know I'm here, I'm sneaking out, I went to the, we're in the back of

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,200
a Barnes and Nobles where they sell the porn.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,000
Don't let my mom know or she'll know that I have carnal sins and that she will kick

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,560
me out of my satertium.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,360
Yes, excellent. Hippocrit is here.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,960
I haven't eaten in hours and I have a burger in front of me and if I make a noise I'm sorry.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,720
Okay, good. Tom Oliver is joining us.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,560
You're not supposed to know I'm here, it's a secret.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,880
Oh well now the cat's out of the bag, and Mumkey Jones.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,160
Jon Tron just put up a new video!

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,080
One of you could go. Impressive shrieking.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,200
Didn't I start to feel a riot?

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,400
Alright everybody, let's not fuck around.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,280
Today our topic of discussion is, it's apropos that you mentioned Barnes and Nobles because

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,160
we're reviewing The Secret, the world-famous book that everyone loves that taught the world

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,080
to love again, to feel, to be a real guy.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,440
I thought it was The Secret, like ooze and slime come out of it.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,040
Like secreting ooze.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,600
Yes, yes, that too, it's all these things.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,160
When you said secret, the first thing I thought of was like secreting anal juices and I don't know why.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,760
I don't know why juices are there besides poop or diarrhea.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,120
There's a lot of anal juice you don't know about Nate, that's one of my secrets.

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,400
Got a lot to learn.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,720
Well there you go, okay you know what, let's all scrap that.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,840
The secret topic of the episode.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,120
I forgot Hippo was eating.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,400
Yeah, I was just gonna say.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
Oh fuck you, this is what you get.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,600
Oh, thank you.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,880
I'm into eating fags.

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
So yeah, we're talking about secrets everybody.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,400
We're talking about secrets.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
That's the real secret of this episode.

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,840
And here is the Urban Dictionary definition of secret.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,400
Here it is.

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,160
Can't tell you.

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,520
That's it, that's the whole thing.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,960
Okay, here's definition number two.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,320
Information, you tell someone when you spelled with just the letter you,

43
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,600
when you want it to become public knowledge by morning.

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,000
That's perfect because that's every story I have to tell about this topic.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,360
Oh, that's good, that's good.

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,240
Yes, that is good.

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,800
I like this.

48
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,640
Secret, strong enough for a man made for a woman.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,440
These are all great.

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,040
Urban Dictionary, you're killing it today buddy.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,360
Urban Dictionary is the main success of the PCP, yeah.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,520
Yeah, we owe them everything.

53
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:55,560
So secrets, they are good, they are bad, they are gay across the board.

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,320
What secrets do you have, Munchy?

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm paranoid, just to start out.

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,040
I might be the most paranoid PCP member next to you, Nate.

57
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,240
I am very paranoid.

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
That's a tall order.

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,240
Yeah, yeah, you're more paranoid than I am.

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,840
But needless to say, whenever I look at someone,

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,080
I instantly just assume they want to kill me.

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,480
And therefore, I have to assert my dominance.

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,280
I have to have emotional power over them to ensure that they want to talk to me.

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,400
Therefore, it's in their best interest not to kill me.

65
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,080
I know just how you feel.

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,200
I don't trust anyone.

67
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,120
I don't trust anyone at any time.

68
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,640
And I need to know that I have leverage over them in some way, even if it's just social.

69
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,960
Yeah, that sounds good, man.

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,560
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,160
So, I don't really have a lot of secrets per se,

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,000
but I allow just knowledge.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have knowledge and smarts and wisdom that I keep inside my brain.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,880
And any person, and if you were to look inside my brain,

75
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,760
you'd be like, ooh, tasty, and you would slip it all up, and Jesus, get out of here.

76
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,560
I would say to you, prying into my brain.

77
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,080
Yeah.

78
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
I don't like it when people know things.

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,920
Even, common, I don't like it when textbooks are out.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,920
I don't like it when people are learning.

81
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,040
So, basically, you're against non-secrets.

82
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,400
You think all information should be contained in the form of secrets

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
as no one should have access to it.

84
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,520
I'm against education and learning as a concept.

85
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,360
I'm against self-betterment in any sort of way.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,160
The fake news advocate.

87
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,480
Oh, you're the number one champion of fake news in the world after Hillary Clinton, of course.

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,280
Incredible.

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,400
Let me get some hand sanitizer.

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,320
One not secrets.

91
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
I love hand sanitizer.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
You guys don't have to be my friend to know that.

93
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,640
Everyone knows when I get out my dinner of hand sanitizer, and I just slip you down.

94
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,400
Okay, good.

95
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,440
Is anyone else have any secret story?

96
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,400
I mean, Mom, you were implying that you had a couple stories about secrets.

97
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,360
What do you got for us?

98
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,640
Well, last episode, during the incest discussion,

99
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:08,360
we all heard the great tale of how I got cucked by my best friend and his sister.

100
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,200
And that was supposed to be a big secret that she confessed to me

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,440
and made me promise I would not tell anybody.

102
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,320
And as Urban Dictionary, let us all know.

103
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,360
The next morning was when I pretty much let everybody know,

104
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,840
because here's the thing about secrets.

105
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,880
I would like to think that I'm pretty trustworthy.

106
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,720
I would like to think if somebody gave me a secret,

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,920
they didn't want me to tell anybody.

108
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,200
I would stay true to that.

109
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,680
However, and I think this is a rule that should apply to everybody.

110
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,920
If the secret somebody is confessing to you is something that completely fucks you over.

111
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,720
Like if a girlfriend is telling you, oh, here's the secret.

112
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,600
I cheated on you.

113
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,680
Why in the fuck would I be expected not to tell everybody?

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,480
That's the front page of Facebook tomorrow morning, my friend.

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,040
You know, I forget the name of it, but that reminds me of this great episode of the boondocks,

116
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,280
where like the two, I forgot the name of the two white guys who are played by like Samuel Jackson

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,240
and another guy.

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,680
Yeah, like, it's great.

119
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,400
It's great.

120
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,240
But that, like the episode is about, I forget the name of like the rule or whatever,

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,880
but it's about like Riley gets like his shit stolen by those guys.

122
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,280
Like they're huge assholes that just take his shit,

123
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,040
but like no one will talk to the cops.

124
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,480
Like no one's gonna, what's it called, snitch it, no snitch it.

125
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,840
That's sort of the word I'm looking for.

126
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,520
So it's all about how like these guys are like terrorizing the neighborhood

127
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,360
and everyone's like looking for them because they're just ruining everyone's fucking life.

128
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,400
But Riley insists on not being a fucking snitch.

129
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,320
And because he's like the only one to witness them.

130
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,440
And then I believe actually, okay, so they don't do anything necessarily bad to him,

131
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,360
but at the end of the episode, so they're just in general ruining the neighborhood,

132
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,320
which has a minor impact on Riley's life, which kind of sucks.

133
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,400
But then at the end of the episode, they just steal his bike and like ride off with it.

134
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,400
And he's just like, they just like treat him like a punk bitch and totally fuck him over.

135
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,640
And then the cops will walk up and they're like, son,

136
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,120
does something happen here? Is there, is there anything you'd like to tell us?

137
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,080
And you can see him like, like tears are fucking leaking out of his eyes.

138
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,840
He's like clenching his fists and just screaming at the injustice of all.

139
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,560
He's like, nah nigga, I see shit.

140
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,120
It was fucking great. That, that non snitching rule is,

141
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,760
and then you see like in the background, as you say that to the cops,

142
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,920
they're just joyriding on the motorcycle being like,

143
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,160
yo, this bike is fucking dope dog.

144
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,600
Gonna smash this shit. Gonna fucking wreck that bike pussy.

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,280
Yeah, it was a great episode.

146
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,120
I wreck that bike pussy every single day of my life.

147
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,280
Mom curious to see if you guys agree with this sort of philosophy of the morality of secrets

148
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,360
in that if, if the secret you're holding makes your life worse by not confessing it,

149
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,040
do you have a right to confess it?

150
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,760
If it will improve the quality of your life by.

151
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,840
I mean, I guess if it comes down to like, if you break the promise,

152
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
what happens to your life?

153
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
Do people not trust you?

154
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,320
Or is it just the person that told you the secret doesn't trust you with knowledge?

155
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,760
Because like, you gotta, you gotta weigh the options of what will happen to you.

156
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,000
If your life will become so much better by confessing that it doesn't matter if people

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,800
think you might not be trustworthy, then of course.

158
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,720
Like I don't, I don't see the, I don't see the point in having a pride about being

159
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,280
trustworthy if your life is shit because of it.

160
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.

161
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
That's what, that was Riley's problem, you know?

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,760
He, he fucked his life over by just being too committed to his ideology there.

163
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,280
I, yeah, I think that, I think that the two are kind of discreet factors,

164
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,920
but there's a context for everything and there's, there's a limit to how much you

165
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,840
should like hold any one position like that.

166
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,440
Like truth is really not always the best policy.

167
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,160
If, if your hoe ass look fat, she don't want to know her ass look fat, you know, you just.

168
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,200
Well, sometimes she does.

169
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,040
Well, sometimes.

170
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,400
Again, it depends on the context.

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,200
I don't think it's a secret that that hoe's ass looks fat.

172
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,560
I think she knows it anyway.

173
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,840
But, but here, here's the context.

174
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,160
Like if you're going out for a, for a night on the town with your lady and she says to you like,

175
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
do I look fat?

176
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,880
You say, no, you look beautiful.

177
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,680
You know, you can, you can say that shit and that's not, that's totally fine.

178
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,480
It's a white light.

179
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,520
If she is like in a fitness competition and she's been working and training and her ass

180
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,600
does legitimately look incredibly fat and she's totally unprepared for the competition

181
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,760
and she's like, okay, dude, does my ass look fat?

182
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,960
I need to know for this competition.

183
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,400
I don't want to get humiliated up there.

184
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,040
If you lie and plakie her and tell her like, no.

185
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,720
Exactly.

186
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,520
And then she, uh, well, in her ass does in fact look fat.

187
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,960
And like, like that's you sort of fucking her over through lying that way.

188
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,760
That's like, see, that's the two different ways to treat that particular example.

189
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,320
You know, yeah.

190
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,720
I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's wrong per se, you know, ever.

191
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,840
Well, okay.

192
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,480
Wrong.

193
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,280
Like it's not like against the law to fucking tell a secret.

194
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,840
I guess lying and secrets are two different things incidentally.

195
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,800
Yeah, I was going to say.

196
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,680
Yeah.

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,160
Well, yeah.

198
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,360
But, but, but, well, okay.

199
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,640
But they're kind of linked to you.

200
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,520
They're kind of the same thing.

201
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,800
So they're linked, they're linked.

202
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,680
Well, that there's, there's secrets that you keep the secrets that you keep for other people.

203
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,840
And then there are secrets that you just know and that are, you know, nobody confided in you.

204
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,520
You just know something and you don't know whether to tell anyone.

205
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,240
And when you do, they now have your secret, I guess.

206
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,400
We all have a secret.

207
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,720
It's like having the knowledge that you know that Osama bin Laden isn't the leader of the Taliban.

208
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,520
Like everyone wants to pretend that he is, but you don't want to tell the government because

209
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,640
you know that if they find out the truth that you are actually the leader of the Taliban,

210
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,760
they call that for you next.

211
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,160
It's a situation like that.

212
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,000
To that point about how I am the leader of ISIS, you know, it's like, it's, I do think that those

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,400
are two discrete factors to, to a monkey's point there.

214
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,880
Like if you decide that you want to like, you know, like, okay, for example,

215
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,800
like the common example people bring up for stuff like this is like you're a Catholic priest

216
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,840
and like a murderer confesses, you know, and then like, okay, so like this guy is a murderer.

217
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,600
And let's say he doesn't immediately plan to kill anybody else, but you never know.

218
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,880
You know, he's an unstable kind of guy.

219
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,240
He's like, I'm sorry, father.

220
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
I don't want to do it, et cetera, et cetera.

221
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,160
Like, first of all, I don't care about religion at all.

222
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,800
So I don't give a fuck about any of their like religious oaths.

223
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,120
But in terms of like the social standing there about how these guys like come here just to confess,

224
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,080
like frankly, the whole confession thing to me, I guess I'm going on a little bit of a tangent,

225
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,840
tangent, but like the confession thing is sort of a way that like these guys get to like ease

226
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,920
the burden of the sins that they've done.

227
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,240
And I don't want them to be eased of their burden.

228
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I want them to be crushed under the weight of the crimes they've committed because they deserve it.

229
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,240
At least, I guess not every single time, but you know, with stuff like this.

230
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,440
But in any case, yeah, like if the priest decides that it's, he really needs to like

231
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,240
come forward, that like really does help the world.

232
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,680
It's like a good thing to do if you're like getting a guy like that off the streets.

233
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,040
But you are showing that you are willing to like break your oaths of secrecy and shit.

234
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,800
Just a negative consequence in other ways.

235
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,000
Do you think that there's a delicate balance between justice and secrecy?

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Or do you think justice should always be more important than like keeping an oath?

237
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,280
You know, it's tough.

238
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,120
Since we live in the real world and not a fantasy world where you can like always expect

239
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:05,080
perfect justice all the time, I think sometimes it is appropriate to conceal things that might

240
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,560
help people if it would cause other problems, you know?

241
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,920
Like if you tell someone that like, fuck, I don't know, like if someone's got amnesia

242
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,080
and they used to be a murderer and like they now that like they had amnesia, they woke up,

243
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,520
they're in a new place and they're just like a new person and they're a really good person or

244
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,000
something.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,880
Like does it make sense to then like sentence this person for the crimes that they committed before?

246
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,360
Like I know that's a crazy example, but that's the sort of idea I'm getting at.

247
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,680
But wouldn't it bring like peace to the families because now they know who killed their person

248
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,800
and like all that stuff?

249
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,240
That's true.

250
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,800
But again, like you're weighing a family's satisfaction at a man, you know, being locked

251
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,920
up versus like now there's a guy who, in this one example, who isn't causing any problems,

252
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,000
who you're going to lock up because of, you know, a situation that's basically been resolved on his

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,280
and no one else is going to be hurt.

254
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,920
And you know, it kind of comes down to the whole idea of like, what is the purpose of it?

255
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,720
You're assuming that there's going to be no like resurgence of memories where he's not going to

256
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,960
then go off and kill again.

257
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,480
Like it's very, like you know everything about the situation.

258
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,240
Yeah, by that same logic, like you just be some murder who didn't lose his memory,

259
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,360
but still decides, you know what?

260
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,440
I killed that one guy, I got it out of my system.

261
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,360
Now I'm just going to be an upstanding gentleman and like for the rest of his life he never does anything.

262
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,240
He goes to prison.

263
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,960
Well, hang on.

264
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,480
Okay, there's actually a cool example of this.

265
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,680
There was a guy recently who, fuck, what did he do?

266
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,080
I don't know.

267
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,680
He had done something and he was sentenced to like, I think like 20 years or something,

268
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,280
maybe less than that.

269
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,920
And when he was a kid he committed some crime, got sentenced, whatever.

270
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,440
And so like, so there's a thing when you get sentenced, if you're on bail, like

271
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,480
you get sent like a note to like bring yourself to jail, like report to jail now.

272
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,520
They don't fucking carry you off unless, you know, they like have you the whole time.

273
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,440
If you've been bailed out, you got to report yourself to jail.

274
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,760
Like this guy just didn't go and then nobody ever came for him because like paperwork got fucked up.

275
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,760
So then he spent like 40 years like constantly terrified that like someone was going to come

276
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,240
and nab him because he knew he had done this shit.

277
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,160
And he like started a family, did all this crazy shit.

278
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,600
And the thing is he really turned his life around and became a great guy.

279
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,760
So like did he pay the price of like, you know, committing the crime that he did legitimately

280
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,240
commit?

281
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,240
I mean, according to the law, no, but in the in the grander scheme of things,

282
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,560
the suffering that he went through of like living life on the edge all the time and being so afraid

283
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,240
of fucking anything up and getting his name like in the legal books in that way,

284
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,920
that's a punishment in of its own.

285
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,640
Talk about a secret, secret life and it's funny.

286
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,320
He didn't even tell like his wife and kids.

287
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,760
So like later on when they actually like the paperwork did get sorted and they came for him.

288
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,160
Oh God.

289
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,360
That was, he was like, honey, there's something I need to tell you.

290
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,760
Incidentally, in that case, they let the guy go because like it was such a clear case that he had

291
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,840
just, he had served his sentence basically by making himself a real nigga.

292
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,320
And what's worse, being in prison or having a family, I think he's paying for his crimes.

293
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,520
Yeah, you got a ball and chain on you either way.

294
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,480
Yeah, you're fucked.

295
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,520
Tom, tell me all your secrets.

296
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,280
I want the whole.

297
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640
We got all night, baby.

298
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,440
I don't know.

299
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,640
I don't really, do I have any secrets if I do them?

300
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,000
So they're so innocuous.

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
Tom, tell me what they are.

302
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,920
Tell me this, Tom, you never liked my little pony.

303
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,080
You just did it for that Oculus Rift money.

304
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,880
Yeah, I actually have like seven Oculus Rifts.

305
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,320
I have one for every day of the week.

306
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,880
Oh my God.

307
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, it's fucking great.

308
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,840
Fucking scum.

309
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,720
I even have an HTC Vive for the weekends.

310
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,760
It's fantastic.

311
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,240
I'm going, I'm a fucking ballin' over here now.

312
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,960
He played us.

313
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,080
Anybody had an experience where you shared a secret and that person was not trustworthy?

314
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,240
Yes.

315
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,200
Good question.

316
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,160
I don't know if I have much.

317
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
Muchy, what do you got buddy?

318
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,320
Yes, when I was in fifth grade, there was some sort of a school dance of some sort

319
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,920
where all the little babies would touch their flabby meat against one another

320
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:58,120
and would be a disgusting display for only the depraved and twisted to have any sort of,

321
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,680
you know, illicit reaction to.

322
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,640
Anyway, I went there with my friend, Rocky.

323
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,320
Rocky is like the source of my music for all of my fucking young life.

324
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,520
Whenever I hear the name Rocky, I instantly get like fucking like PDST.

325
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah, okay.

326
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,200
I just want to jump out a window so I can get away from the sound.

327
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,160
Anyway, I go there and I'm ordering, I'm ordering fucking Sprite and Skittles and I'm

328
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,760
fucking going, I'm going all out.

329
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,520
I'm fucking, I'm going on a bender, bro.

330
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,320
I'm gonna, I'm gonna fucking wake up in a ditch after I'm done at this place.

331
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,880
Anyway, so I just, I just fucking, I'm just walking with them and he's like,

332
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,080
fuck it, I love Wii Sports.

333
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,440
I'm like, dude, I know.

334
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,520
Anyway, here's the big secret.

335
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,440
Oh no, you spilled the beans.

336
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,360
No, no, then I forget what happens and, and, and, and I was just like, dude,

337
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,240
what if like girls weren't awful?

338
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,720
And he was like, dude, I'm going to go tell that girl right now that you, oh no.

339
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,880
And then I was like, what?

340
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,920
That doesn't make any sense.

341
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,440
And he went and did it.

342
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,360
And then I was just like, I don't know who you are.

343
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,040
And she was like, it's okay if you love me.

344
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,760
I understand.

345
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,480
I'm beautiful.

346
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,480
And I was just confused and scared.

347
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,560
And I ran to the bathroom because I hate women.

348
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,200
And I, and, and, and, and that fucking Chad was just going to fucking ruin my night.

349
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,440
And I couldn't finish eating my fucking, I accidentally dropped my fucking gummy worms

350
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,160
on the floor so I couldn't finish eating them because they were on the floor.

351
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,240
I just wanted to eat my gummy worms and spray.

352
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,560
I just wanted to eat what I came to the dance floor.

353
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,400
I wanted to eat the gummy worms.

354
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,440
Did you guys ever have, I think they're called like dirt cups or whatever.

355
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,080
They're chocolate pudding with Oreo crumble on the top.

356
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,680
And gummy worms in them.

357
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,800
Snow secret.

358
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,240
Those are the best things ever.

359
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,680
Slam dunk.

360
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,960
All of you.

361
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,160
All of you are beautiful.

362
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,600
F, all of you for the slam dunk, dude.

363
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,880
Yeah.

364
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,200
Okay.

365
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,600
Good.

366
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,080
Good.

367
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,640
Gib.

368
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,880
And I've forgipped him immediately because I had no other friends.

369
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,360
Oh, you did.

370
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,440
That's the way to do it.

371
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,600
Gib, tell me your secret.

372
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:54,920
Okay.

373
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,440
Gladly.

374
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Actually, hang on.

375
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
I just got to take a bite of this, this burger.

376
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,320
It's been sitting here this whole time.

377
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,960
I'm really hungry.

378
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,280
Okay.

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,640
Now's your chance.

380
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,640
While your time to speak has come.

381
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,160
That's the perfect time to make a big fucking bite out of this burger, dude.

382
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,880
Okay.

383
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,680
Don't worry about us.

384
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay, go.

385
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Well, my secret is one slime of the worm and I broke them.

386
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,720
Keep it going.

387
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,040
And God, excuse me.

388
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,400
This is juicy.

389
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,920
And then I tried to eat the other one.

390
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,800
And it just didn't fit.

391
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
You buried the body there?

392
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,200
What the fuck?

393
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,720
Oh, no.

394
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,520
I'm sorry, hippo.

395
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,560
I can barely understand you.

396
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,920
All that anal juice in your mouth.

397
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,440
Oh, yeah.

398
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,080
Yeah.

399
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,720
But yeah, that's basically what happened.

400
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,040
I couldn't understand him because he has a stupid accent.

401
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,120
Look at down below.

402
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,320
Here comes the net.

403
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,680
A slammer come come come.

404
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,880
Go to the hero.

405
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,120
Yeah.

406
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,480
So yeah, that's my secret.

407
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,080
That was a bombshell.

408
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,400
I've got a story of the time a friend betrayed me and did not keep a secret.

409
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,680
Mm-hmm.

410
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,640
It was third grade.

411
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,520
I was eight years old.

412
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,040
I had this friend named Hunter and I lived out in the country.

413
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,440
So whenever I went to go stay the night at Hunter's house,

414
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,560
I could finally be out in the suburbs, baby.

415
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,960
We could raise some hell in a place where there's actually people.

416
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,520
And I'm not just alone in the middle of nowhere.

417
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,760
And Hunter has this checkbook of blank checks.

418
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,840
I don't know where he got it because he's eight.

419
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,920
But we thought, you know what would be funny as hell?

420
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,880
What if we filled out one of these checks for a million dollars?

421
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,680
And we went to our friend Will's house and we put it in his mailbox.

422
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,720
That would be the funniest thing of all time.

423
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,880
And thinking back, I don't know why we thought it would be funny.

424
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,720
I have no idea.

425
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,760
No idea.

426
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,880
So we do it.

427
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,960
And it's this big secret because we know,

428
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,280
we know for some reason that it's the biggest law in the world.

429
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,040
It's some big federal law that you're not allowed to touch anybody's mailbox

430
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,200
for any reason unless you're a mailman.

431
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,400
So we're like, oh man, what a big secret.

432
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh man, we did this big prank.

433
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,360
We put a check in his mailbox.

434
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,560
We're going to get in so much trouble.

435
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,240
We're going to get arrested if they find out.

436
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,840
The next day at school.

437
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,080
The next day at school.

438
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
The special something teacher.

439
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,280
She's not like a special ed teacher,

440
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,000
but she's like a guidance kind of bitch.

441
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,960
I don't like it.

442
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,160
She's the type of feminist bitch where she hyphenates her last name.

443
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,440
So it's like her name, dash, husband's last name.

444
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,160
Disgusting.

445
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,560
I hate it.

446
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,840
Pick a side, you fucking horrors.

447
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,040
One or the other.

448
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't care if you want to empower yourself and just keep your name.

449
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,560
That's fine.

450
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,440
I would prefer that.

451
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,560
I don't give a shit.

452
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,880
But to hyphenate, disgusting.

453
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,360
Fuck you.

454
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,480
This bitch shows up to the classroom that me and Hunter are in.

455
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,040
And she says, Jimmy, Jimmy, come here.

456
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,080
I'm like, uh-oh.

457
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,600
Uh-oh, that's not good.

458
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,360
They're going to interview us one at a time.

459
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,400
That's not good.

460
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,440
So she sits me down.

461
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,480
I'm alone in the room with her.

462
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,840
And she says, classic.

463
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,320
So did you and your friend Hunter do anything yesterday?

464
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,280
I'm like, no, no.

465
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

466
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,760
And she says, you know, I heard this rumor

467
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,880
that you might have put something in someone's mailbox.

468
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,080
Oh, no.

469
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,880
Red alert.

470
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,600
What are we going to do?

471
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,160
I got to make up some sort of crazy lie.

472
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,920
But at the same time, Hunter is also going to be interviewed.

473
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,320
And if he doesn't have the same crazy lie as me, then we're fucked.

474
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,280
That's the classic divide and conquer interrogation technique.

475
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,400
Absolutely.

476
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,800
So I say, oh, oh, that was just a joke.

477
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
We made up a joke that we did that.

478
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,520
We didn't actually do that.

479
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,320
It was just a joke.

480
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,840
And she says, oh, uh-huh.

481
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,120
OK, it was a joke.

482
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,000
So she takes me back to the classroom and says, hey, Hunter,

483
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,720
can you come with me?

484
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
In front of everybody, there's 20 other kids,

485
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,600
two teachers in the room.

486
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
And I say, hey, Hunter, yes.

487
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,120
She wants to ask us about that joke we told.

488
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,000
Remember that joke?

489
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,320
Well done.

490
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,560
Nice.

491
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,120
Yeah.

492
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,280
I thought I was super conspicuous about it.

493
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,480
Like, hey, you know that joke?

494
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,840
Go tell her about it.

495
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,600
About five minutes later, Hunter's back.

496
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,880
And she calls me out again.

497
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,360
Uh-oh.

498
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,280
Fuck.

499
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,560
And of course, she's more mad that I lied to her

500
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,640
than that we put something in someone's mailbox.

501
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,960
Because as it turns out, we're not in trouble for that.

502
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,760
So I don't know why she even called us out in the first place.

503
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,680
So that's the time Hunter betrayed me.

504
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,960
He couldn't keep the secret.

505
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,880
And he didn't know what a joke was.

506
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,680
Fuck you, Hunter.

507
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,120
I hope you burn in hell.

508
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,520
What a shitty teacher to just interrogate them

509
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
on the off chance that you can get in trouble from it.

510
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,880
Yeah.

511
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,360
Yeah.

512
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,080
I mean, what was her?

513
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,320
What was she actually interrogating you about?

514
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,240
Because like, she didn't know about, I mean,

515
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,200
the mailbox thing wasn't a problem.

516
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,360
I just want to see if these kids lie to me

517
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,960
so I can beat the shit out of them.

518
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,600
I don't know.

519
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
You didn't get in trouble for the mailbox stuff.

520
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,160
Like, I have no idea what the point of it was.

521
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,600
But it was over 15, about 15 years ago.

522
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
So maybe I'm missing a detail in my memory,

523
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,960
but I just remember that part.

524
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,280
Monkey, I want to know, in your school,

525
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,840
did every time a single person,

526
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,440
like, can you come to the office, please,

527
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,080
did the entire fucking room go, ooh?

528
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,720
Oh, of course.

529
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,920
And it was me every time.

530
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,480
I was going to go to his office every other month

531
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,360
in elementary school.

532
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,520
Calm down, Mark Simpson.

533
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,320
I remember one time, if we want to tell stories

534
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,400
about how we got in trouble in elementary school.

535
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,760
I definitely do.

536
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
The first time I got sent to the principal's office

537
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,520
was because when I was five, so this is like kindergarten,

538
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,400
recess is over, and we're all lining up to go back inside.

539
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,160
And I don't know what came over me.

540
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,480
But for some reason, there's this girl named Lauren,

541
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,080
who I kind of liked.

542
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,640
In front of everybody, I just fucking yell,

543
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,120
hey, Lauren, take off your pants.

544
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
And I have no idea what came over me,

545
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,520
why I would even say that.

546
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,800
I don't actually want to see this little girl with pants off.

547
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,080
You were just getting straight to the act.

548
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,200
You're getting down to business.

549
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,840
I guess so.

550
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,120
In your instance, yeah.

551
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,720
Next thing I know, I'm in the principal's office.

552
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,880
But luckily, this principal was the type of guy

553
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,480
who would say, so what'd you do?

554
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,160
And then you tell him what you did.

555
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,920
And then he laughs at your story

556
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,080
because you're a stupid kid doing stupid shit.

557
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,360
And then he says, don't do it again.

558
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,480
And then you go back to class.

559
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,720
So at least the principal was a cool guy.

560
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,560
That's good.

561
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,800
My elementary school woes are as long as fucking

562
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,240
scripture verses.

563
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,200
However, however, one that's somewhat related to this

564
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,800
is one time, again, with fucking,

565
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,680
what's his fucking ass, bitch ass name?

566
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,880
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.

567
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,280
There was another friend I knew named Sean.

568
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,360
And he was like this fucking weird sort of like-

569
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,960
He was an audio engineer.

570
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,480
Yeah, he was an audio engineer.

571
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,440
He was like a fucking, he was like a super hall monitor.

572
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,080
Instead of like a hall monitor, he was a world monitor.

573
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,320
He monitored every action to every system.

574
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
And a hero.

575
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,720
Yeah, yeah.

576
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,040
So-

577
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm picturing him as the all-seeing eye of Sauron.

578
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,680
Yeah, yeah.

579
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,480
About the hallways.

580
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:41,880
Yeah, okay.

581
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
Yeah, exactly.

582
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
But with the badge on.

583
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,960
And in a way to show off the badge.

584
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,000
Like, even when he was-

585
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,040
And even when we were in golf school,

586
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,600
he would just put his badge on over his fucking shirt,

587
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,400
just no matter what.

588
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,960
He'd just be like-

589
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,080
A world monitor.

590
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,040
And whenever I said-

591
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,400
And then whenever we got into a fight,

592
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,960
he would just say,

593
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,080
Dude, look at the badge, bro.

594
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,200
Look at the badge.

595
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,240
Look at the badge, dude.

596
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,720
Look at it.

597
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,760
Respect it.

598
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,880
Yeah, respect the badge.

599
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,360
Anyway, so Rocky just makes up this lie

600
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,200
that I've stolen his video game

601
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,720
because he's fucking Rocky.

602
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,120
Because he's fucking Rocky and get away with anyone

603
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,160
because his parents are divorced

604
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,200
and everyone has to be sorry for him

605
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
because his parents are divorced.

606
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
I don't care if his parents are divorced, Rocky.

607
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,120
I hate you.

608
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,240
Me too, dude.

609
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,400
Anyway, he makes up a lie

610
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
because he wants to get me back

611
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,040
because I think I like-

612
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,480
Because I beat him at Wii Sports

613
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,680
and he got super fucking pissed

614
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,480
after his controller.

615
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,600
And as we've established,

616
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,880
he loves Wii Sports.

617
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,920
Yeah, you look at-

618
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,840
He takes this kind of embarrassment, right?

619
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,480
In front of his whole family and clan.

620
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,640
He needs to redeem himself.

621
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,000
So he wants to fuck me over.

622
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,880
And so he gets Sean to interrogate me.

623
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,600
He's like-

624
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,760
And Sean comes over here and he takes me aside

625
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,160
and he's like, dude, I heard a rumor.

626
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,080
Is it true you're a thief?

627
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,880
Is it true that you've broken the law?

628
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,360
Those are some serious aspersions we've heard about.

629
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,960
Jesus Christ.

630
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,200
And I know I'm innocent,

631
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,720
so I just say, what do you think?

632
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,520
And I spit on his badge.

633
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,040
You spit on his badge?

634
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,200
Fuck your authority, world monitor.

635
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,400
And he's just like-

636
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
He's like, you're reckless,

637
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,960
but I believe you.

638
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,560
What the fuck?

639
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,440
Greatest turn of phrase.

640
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,240
Okay, all right.

641
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,840
That's what the policeman says

642
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,680
at the end of the thrilling action movie

643
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,600
where he's been intellectually dueling

644
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,360
with a goal-hearted criminal,

645
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,560
which is you in this case.

646
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,480
Fuck, what was it again?

647
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,360
What was the line?

648
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,200
You're reckless, but I believe you.

649
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,520
Yes.

650
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,760
The moment when respect was forged for a lifetime.

651
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,920
Brothers in arms.

652
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,160
And so what he does is,

653
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,120
me and Rocky are in the same class

654
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,480
and he's like been like eyeing me,

655
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,200
like fucking off,

656
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,400
fucking look at this fucking guy,

657
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,360
look at this fucking guy.

658
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,240
And then I walk back and I'm smiling,

659
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
I'm smiling wisely,

660
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,920
knowing that my superior errant life

661
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,680
has gotten me out of yet another jam.

662
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
And then Sean fucking like is like,

663
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,120
Rocky, we need to talk now.

664
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,880
And so Rocky starts losing his fucking shit

665
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,040
and is like scared that his life has been found out.

666
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,840
So he walks out and I hear,

667
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,760
like I don't know about this during the time,

668
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
but then like I meet up with Sean after school

669
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,840
and he just says, I told him,

670
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,600
I told him that I found out the truth

671
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,040
and that he can't hide the truth

672
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,720
from the world monitor himself.

673
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,720
Yeah, actually, by the way,

674
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,240
he called himself the world monitor, by the way.

675
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,040
That wasn't me making up.

676
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,680
He really did?

677
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,200
He called himself the world monitor.

678
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,920
Wow, you give a man a taste of power

679
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,120
and he wants to take it all.

680
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,040
He wants control of everything.

681
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,680
It's his better, his ill nature,

682
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,440
got a hold of him, his senses.

683
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,680
Anyway, so Rocky was shamed from the entire class

684
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,640
and Sean just said he was untrustworthy.

685
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,240
But after school, Rocky said,

686
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
I don't have anyone play Wii sports with me.

687
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,120
Can you please come over now?

688
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,240
I was like, okay, but I have to have a Smarties.

689
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,360
I have to have a Smarties.

690
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,520
I need to have one of your Smarties.

691
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,560
And he gave me one of their Smarties

692
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920
and I played Wii sports and I beat him again.

693
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,520
He yelled at me and told me to leave the room.

694
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,880
It was a good time.

695
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,280
Wow, it was a good time.

696
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,160
What a journey.

697
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,360
Real quick here, also in middle school,

698
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,960
I was known for picking people up.

699
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,000
That was like what I did.

700
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I was the person who picked people up

701
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,520
because I was just so massive and girthy

702
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,720
that I could do whatever I want.

703
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,200
And so I would pick people up.

704
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,680
And people like line up for like 10 people

705
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,880
would line up for me to pick them up

706
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,120
and just like set them back down.

707
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,120
I was the main attraction to the fucking playground.

708
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,720
Anyway, so this-

709
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,400
Maybe they actually just wanted a hug.

710
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,880
Yeah, maybe.

711
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,320
So this stupid ass fucking punk ass crippled motherfucker

712
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,480
rolls up in his fucking wheelchair and-

713
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,440
Ah, Jesus.

714
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,080
Always causing problems the goddamn disabled.

715
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,720
Fuck off.

716
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,880
A fucking apologizer, right?

717
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,320
Apologize already.

718
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:58,360
Anyway, so he's like, please, let me get a ride on arms.

719
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,640
I need to know it's like to feel young again.

720
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,120
And so I'm like, you know what?

721
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,040
I'll take pity on you fucking disabled, disabled man.

722
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,240
And so I lift him up and immediately he's like spying cracks.

723
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,120
Like he like-

724
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,080
Oh, Jesus.

725
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,600
He gets the wind taken out of him.

726
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,120
And so I set him down in his wheelchair

727
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,280
and I'm like, this is what you fucking get.

728
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,640
And then he rolls off to tell the fucking principle.

729
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,840
What the fuck?

730
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,080
Yeah.

731
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,320
Was this a kid or an actual old man?

732
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,920
No, this is like, you know, this is a child.

733
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,840
What's the difference between a child

734
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,440
who's that weak and an old man?

735
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,000
There is none.

736
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,960
They're basically the same thing.

737
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,600
Okay.

738
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,280
Anyway, so I get in trouble for him wanting me to pick him up

739
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,200
and providing that service for him.

740
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,240
There's no justice.

741
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,760
There's no justice.

742
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,240
I did what he wanted me to do and I got fucking-

743
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,640
Dude, and the worst thing is I would like-

744
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,400
He like went to tell the principle

745
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,280
when it was like end of lunchtime.

746
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,480
So I just went to class.

747
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,880
And then like I heard-

748
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,040
I was like some sort of like computer science class

749
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,840
or some of that effect.

750
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,760
And we were just in the computer lab.

751
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,200
And I heard people looking around me

752
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,960
and they're just like, did you hear so-and-so

753
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,320
who got the fucking Winby down?

754
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,640
Yeah, I heard someone fucking throw him down the ground.

755
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:05,880
Right.

756
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,800
I was like, no, it's not true!

757
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,360
Down on the ground, you fucking cripple!

758
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,120
It's not true.

759
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm a good boy.

760
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,680
And then I went to the principal's office and he was-

761
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
And he-

762
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,680
And like I walked into his office

763
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,000
and he was like looking through the Venetian blinds.

764
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,440
Everything was dark and he was just like,

765
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,800
he was just like, menacing.

766
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,320
What did you do?

767
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,760
And I just like started-

768
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,000
I was like, I provided the service he wanted.

769
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,840
I provided the service he wanted.

770
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,720
I'm a good guy.

771
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,840
I'm a good vendor.

772
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,800
I'm a good host.

773
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,120
And then it was just like, it's not good enough.

774
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,400
And so he sent it to me to detention.

775
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,800
It was a scary time.

776
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,960
That was a big secret, guys.

777
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,400
It was a big secret.

778
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,160
Yeah, good secret.

779
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,880
Good secret.

780
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,000
When I think of secrets,

781
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
a lot of the times I think of gossip.

782
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,160
Because that's usually like-

783
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,120
It's never been said, hey, here's a secret.

784
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Blah, blah, blah, this and that.

785
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,160
It's usually like, oh, I heard from one person,

786
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,720
a friend of a person, that they're going through this.

787
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,160
Did you hear this?

788
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,960
Yeah, you're not really supposed to bring it up

789
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,720
unless you want to be a gossipy person.

790
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,040
I don't know.

791
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,400
I don't really feel like I have any secrets

792
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,840
that I remember holding or getting given.

793
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,120
Because despite being the kid that never said anything

794
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,960
and was known for not doing any words out of my mouth,

795
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,080
like nobody thought, this guy I can confide in.

796
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,680
I guess nobody had anything to say, or at least not to me.

797
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,400
And I never had anything I cared to say to anyone else.

798
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:35,960
Because it's like-

799
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,040
Never under any circumstances.

800
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,080
Because a lot of the time, it's gossip.

801
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,000
It's like, why would you tell someone else about this thing?

802
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,720
Because you want to feel the rush of it going behind someone's back,

803
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,680
or I guess.

804
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,640
And I don't get that.

805
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,360
I don't feel that.

806
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,280
So I never had a secret.

807
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,880
I think gossiping gives people a sense of empowerment.

808
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,840
When they're sharing new information with someone,

809
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,440
that's a gift they get to give out.

810
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,280
And they get to watch the person give them credit

811
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,200
for being the one who shared that.

812
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,160
Something like that, anyway.

813
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,160
I would say I am the duality of man.

814
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,200
It personified.

815
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,160
If I do say so myself.

816
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Dr. Munchy and Mr. Hat.

817
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,240
Yeah, exactly.

818
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,240
Uh, I like am gossipy, I think.

819
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,880
But if you tell me to not say something, then I will not.

820
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,200
Like, I get off on being loyal.

821
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,360
If someone's like, don't do this thing, I'll be like,

822
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,040
fuck you, I'm not going to fucking do that.

823
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm going to fucking-

824
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,240
I'm going to take this to the fucking grave.

825
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,800
I'm going to fucking-

826
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,520
I'm like that.

827
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,520
But if it's like, did you hear that I have fucked a dog before?

828
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,640
What do you think about that, huh?

829
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,040
I'll be like-

830
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,920
Everyone's going to know about this guy fucking that dog.

831
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,600
Why did you tell Ben's secret?

832
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,240
He's like, I guess I'm gossipy like normal,

833
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,000
like a normal human level.

834
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,160
Like, if somebody is brought up in conversation

835
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,840
and it doesn't seem that bad to say,

836
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,640
hey, I heard that they eat shit, like, you know.

837
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,920
Not that bad.

838
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,120
Not that bad.

839
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,200
Like, they're well-known for eating shit.

840
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,640
I just thought, you know, you might like to know,

841
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,000
I want to be part of this conversation.

842
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,280
I got to say something.

843
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,400
But like, I don't know.

844
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,880
Like, I don't-

845
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,920
I'm just like discussing things and like,

846
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,480
I'm gossiping in the sense that like, if there's a problem,

847
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:21,880
if there's-

848
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,480
If like, someone's like working through a problem,

849
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,360
that's like not-

850
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,320
Like, it's not like a secret.

851
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,440
Like, I'm having a fucking clash in my soul.

852
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,320
If it's just like, yeah, I don't know how to fucking do this thing

853
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,880
with this guy, whatever, do-do-do-do-do-do.

854
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,800
Then I'll want to discuss that and like,

855
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,080
like with other people and like, come up with like,

856
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,480
I want to like, task force fucking like, police.

857
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,800
Like, how do I get this person to be happy?

858
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,360
Kind of like a-

859
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,880
Actually, wait, I figured out why I'm thinking.

860
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,240
I figured out why I can't think of any secrets.

861
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,680
It's because I don't think of them-

862
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,640
When I think of a secret,

863
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,320
I think of something you want to tell people.

864
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,640
And I don't care about anything that I'm told.

865
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,280
If somebody says something to me,

866
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,920
I won't ever say it to anyone else, really.

867
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,040
And if they expressly say, please don't tell anyone,

868
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,320
I'll be like, yeah, yeah, of course.

869
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,320
And it won't even feel like a secret.

870
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,280
It won't feel like I'm-

871
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,400
It's just waiting to be unleashed on people.

872
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,480
Like, it's not even part of my brain anymore.

873
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
It's just sort of like, oh yeah, I guess I know that.

874
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,240
I get it.

875
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,000
Calling something a secret can kind of

876
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,160
give it a red flag in your memory

877
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,000
and it'll make you kind of want to talk about it.

878
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,120
So yeah, sometimes you're better off.

879
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,280
It'll make you want to secrete it from your anus.

880
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,560
Hippo, we're trying to eat over here.

881
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,080
Let's discuss in brief.

882
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,000
So this has been coming up a couple of times.

883
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,080
So like, are we all in agreement that honesty is not always the best policy?

884
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,520
Does anyone feel differently from that?

885
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
I would say it's usually the best,

886
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,800
but there are times when you lie and it is just better.

887
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,280
All this has to do with deals and absolutes.

888
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,000
I like being honest and being known as someone who just-

889
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,520
Like, if I say something, I want people to know that that's what I mean.

890
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,680
Unless I'm obviously doing it in a silly voice and it's a joke.

891
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:11,080
But like, I hate people who hope that you understand something from-

892
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,840
like, you know, they want you to get it without them saying it.

893
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,080
I would rather just be a person who says it.

894
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,880
You're talking about women.

895
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,760
You're talking about women, right?

896
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,040
That's my secret.

897
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,920
I'm gay.

898
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,040
In fairness, men do it too.

899
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,160
Oh yeah, yeah, of course.

900
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,040
It's not really a secret after the fetish episode.

901
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,960
I want to know what you think.

902
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,120
I also like being like honestly known as like,

903
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,360
if I say this, then it's like real.

904
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,560
I do like having to not specify this isn't a joke, by the way.

905
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,040
This is a real thing that I truly do believe.

906
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,120
But I never believe anything anyone says to me, almost ever.

907
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,400
I always have to be like, really?

908
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,200
Is that really?

909
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,240
And then like five more rounds and I'll be like,

910
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,960
maybe I believe you, possibly.

911
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,960
So basically, you'll believe things the more times that they're insisted upon

912
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,000
by the person as long as they don't change the story or crack

913
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,640
under the psychological pressure of your interrogation.

914
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I like to believe that everyone is real and that everything they say is completely true

915
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,160
unless otherwise specified because especially on the internet,

916
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,960
thinking any other way is confusing and time consuming.

917
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,440
Just think about like, oh, are they real?

918
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,720
Are they saying that for real?

919
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,040
No, they're completely true because they haven't said,

920
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
by the way, I'm lying yet.

921
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,200
I think you have to take the opposite approach online.

922
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,360
I think you should assume everybody is lying until proven honest.

923
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,360
I basically agree with that.

924
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,240
It's funnier if I just think everyone's real.

925
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,640
Well, even not just online, but in all aspects of life,

926
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,360
I was going to say that I don't think there's a single person in the world.

927
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,880
I mean, it depends what you mean by truth.

928
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,600
But I think that everyone is constantly wearing different masks

929
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,320
and they're presenting themselves differently to different people.

930
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,360
And that doesn't, in a situation like here, recording the PCP,

931
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,640
I behave a certain way.

932
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,000
And then in a different situation, I might act differently

933
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,160
if I'm with a different crowd or like when I'm at work.

934
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,920
You know, when I'm at work, that's me.

935
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,600
Is it me keeping a secret that I don't present myself at work

936
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,960
the same way I do on here?

937
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,280
I don't think so.

938
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,320
I think everybody knows you have to have a professional attitude when you're at work.

939
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,800
I don't think you've, and everybody you know at work,

940
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,840
that's not really them.

941
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,240
That's like them putting on their serious face, you know?

942
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,120
Sure.

943
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,560
And I don't know, I don't really think there's a moral issue with most secrets,

944
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,640
unless there's, you know, some important thing attached to them.

945
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,880
If we're talking about like masks and shit,

946
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,200
I feel like the masks you wear the most often is the true you,

947
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,040
but it doesn't really matter too much whether you're true all the time.

948
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,680
I don't think that's the true you, but okay.

949
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,640
Well, like all of the different masks are you,

950
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,520
but like you can only see a couple of them at a time.

951
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,360
If you want to say as a matter of convenience,

952
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,920
like when you like go, okay, so when you're at work, you're like doing a job,

953
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,400
you're interacting with people, that's you acting a certain way.

954
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,760
Then when you like, when you get out and you go home and you're just like chilling,

955
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,600
like maybe that's the true you.

956
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,280
But here's the, here's a question though.

957
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,480
If you spend like, let's just say your job is incredibly intense,

958
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,320
and you spend 16 hours a day at work with your game face on,

959
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,800
and then you only spend eight hours a day at home,

960
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,360
does that mean the true you is now the work you,

961
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,520
based on the time, the percentage that's been?

962
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,360
I don't know, I just threw that idea out there.

963
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,560
Is it your resting position?

964
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,680
Maybe it's your resting position.

965
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,960
I think it's the true you.

966
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,440
If you have to, if you're at any point,

967
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,080
if you're filtering your thought and actions through like what you believe

968
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,480
is socially acceptable in that situation,

969
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,600
I don't think that's your true self.

970
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,160
Your true self is when like, I'm just going to do what I want,

971
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,800
and I'm not worried about consequences or judgments.

972
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,440
That's who you really are.

973
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah, but then everybody would be a rapist.

974
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,120
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

975
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,520
Like, but the fact that I have never,

976
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,000
well, okay, that's not going to be personally,

977
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,880
but like people.

978
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,480
Yeah, it's not a secret podcast.

979
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,680
It is, that's true.

980
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,080
We all, I mean, you know, we've all had a desire to like,

981
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,440
ooh, that's a nice piece of candy.

982
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,600
It'd be sure nice to pocket that and just walk out.

983
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm not going to pay $10 for this fucking lollipop or whatever.

984
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,160
Yeah, you know, we all do converges.

985
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,320
If you're charging $10, you have a moral obligation to steal that candy.

986
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,520
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

987
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:17,800
Okay, okay.

988
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,480
I would describe your quote unquote true stuff like this.

989
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,560
Imagine a nice roll or ball of slime and gel,

990
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,680
and sort of, you know, delicious meat kiss.

991
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,120
Don't gotta tell me twice.

992
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,960
I have mine here before me, yes.

993
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,440
Yeah, yeah.

994
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,960
Would it be green?

995
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,080
It can be whatever, whatever color you think most represents your soul.

996
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,200
So in your case, it would be a putrid yellow.

997
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,520
Possibly have a blood clots in it.

998
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,160
And since.

999
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,400
Oh, no.

1000
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,560
How am I eating here?

1001
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,320
Anyway, okay.

1002
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,040
So you have that like nice, that nice slime layer.

1003
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,200
Then you get like like on for every context,

1004
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,680
it's like a new like cheese grater you have.

1005
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,640
It has different sized holes and like the shape of the holes are different.

1006
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,720
Sometimes they're really big holes, so a lot of slime gets through.

1007
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,120
And sometimes like only a little bit of slime gets through.

1008
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,400
And then when you grate that slime to like residue that comes out,

1009
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,280
the slime that gets out of it is like the bits of you

1010
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,960
that are still within your mask.

1011
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,200
But the like the mask is the cheese grater.

1012
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,160
You know what I'm saying?

1013
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,400
It's always going to be parts of you.

1014
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,960
It just depends on each context, how much comes out of you.

1015
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,640
But it all is still you.

1016
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,320
Oh, so so so wait.

1017
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:34,440
So wait, what if what if mind meld technology was created and you could you could you could you could

1018
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,880
blow your brains together like digitally and like go into each other's consciousnessness.

1019
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,880
And then you'll be like, I know this guy perfectly truthfully.

1020
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,640
And then you come out and then you're like, hey, I get it now.

1021
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
I get you and he gets you too.

1022
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,080
Would that would that be like knowing the true self?

1023
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,360
Is that what it means to be gay?

1024
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,960
To have a soul mate?

1025
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
Yeah, something like that.

1026
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,560
That would be like literally like fucking the slime, bro.

1027
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,560
You get right up in that shit, dude.

1028
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,440
Straight up.

1029
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
I would just like to say that YouTuber,

1030
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,560
monkey jones has definitely never worn a mask.

1031
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,760
That's ever.

1032
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,280
Never ever.

1033
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,920
I mean, I mean, he's taken it off so far.

1034
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,560
It's like so long ago that the pain doesn't even really get to him anymore.

1035
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,920
No.

1036
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,320
Yeah, it's not even painful at all.

1037
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,520
Pain without love.

1038
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,960
Pain can't get enough.

1039
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,360
Pain.

1040
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,840
Exactly.

1041
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,200
But I like it rough.

1042
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,880
And I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.

1043
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,840
You know, it's interesting that that's my seat.

1044
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,120
That's, I don't know, that self-censorship kind of thing.

1045
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,640
It's not really self-censorship, I guess.

1046
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,560
It's just the stuff, like the fact that I'm not saying all kinds of like racial

1047
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,360
expletives, you know, I could if I wanted to.

1048
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:48,840
Naked.

1049
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,200
I could say, yeah, there you go.

1050
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,240
There you go.

1051
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,560
Naked.

1052
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,640
What you're trying to say is you're a secret racist.

1053
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,200
We get it.

1054
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,600
It's fine.

1055
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,400
That's how I like it.

1056
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,760
Nate, Charlie's Fills.

1057
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,640
Charlie's not there.

1058
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Charlie's not there.

1059
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,520
What's up, kid?

1060
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,640
And Hillary's not actually there.

1061
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,360
It's just cardboard.

1062
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,760
Don't worry.

1063
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,760
What?

1064
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,400
That's not true.

1065
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,200
I don't know what you mean.

1066
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm here.

1067
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,120
I'm here, folks.

1068
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:15,240
I just want to announce me and my betrothal to a big fairy tale fan,

1069
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:22,360
creator of Minecraft, founder of every website in the world, especially neopets.com.

1070
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,480
Hillary Clinton is here.

1071
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,760
I love her.

1072
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,600
And here she is with a quick message to everyone.

1073
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,680
Hello, everyone.

1074
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,480
My name is Hillary Clinton.

1075
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,360
Is that Jeff Foo?

1076
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,480
I love you.

1077
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,840
Yeah.

1078
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,080
All right.

1079
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,480
That's it.

1080
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:33,960
She's gone.

1081
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,520
She's gone.

1082
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,240
Not 50 points ahead.

1083
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,120
I don't get it.

1084
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,320
Dude, did you guys hear that she just came out with a book and audio book

1085
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,720
narrated by herself called What Happened?

1086
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,400
And it's about the election?

1087
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,920
I do actually want to read that.

1088
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,800
Was that?

1089
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,840
I've listed that audio book.

1090
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,360
Is there a question mark at the end of that title?

1091
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,320
Is she asking the question, what happened?

1092
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,640
Is it saying, oh, this is what?

1093
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,680
Is it a declaration or a question?

1094
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,480
I don't know.

1095
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,680
We'll have to look into that.

1096
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,000
A question would be hilarious.

1097
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,560
Hillary doesn't have questions, only answers.

1098
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,000
I have to assume that she's acknowledging all of the reasons why she lost,

1099
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,160
because a lot of it was on her back.

1100
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,920
I mean, if she's just blaming Trump the whole time, then that's not an honest answer.

1101
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,680
You're just going to open up the book.

1102
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,200
There's going to be tons of blank pages.

1103
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,760
You're going to halfway through, and then in big fucking letters,

1104
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,680
take out the whole page, patriarchy.

1105
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,160
And that's it.

1106
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,800
What's happening?

1107
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,000
Oh, yeah.

1108
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,240
I mean, honestly, I think there's no way that this person will not, like,

1109
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,600
she's definitely going to dive into all the excuses.

1110
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,000
Like, what's her goal?

1111
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,440
It's her goal to be like, you know what?

1112
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,880
It's time to do some self-discovery.

1113
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,360
You know what?

1114
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:34,840
It's time to look inside.

1115
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,120
That's what I would hope for.

1116
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,760
That's what I would hope for.

1117
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,040
But I hope that the book, like, chapter one should be called I'm Unlikable,

1118
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,880
but it's going to be called Patriarchy.

1119
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,040
Yeah.

1120
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,400
If she's trying to preserve political capital,

1121
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,120
then she's going to be the dishonest, you know, continue to say that.

1122
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:55,640
In my head, for some reason, it is a bright pink with fluffy pink fluff on the outside

1123
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,680
and a little pen.

1124
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,440
And it's just a diary, but with Hillary's face on every page.

1125
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,200
And you can write it.

1126
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,520
And you decide what happened.

1127
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,520
It's in the Diary of the Wimpy Kid format, but with Hillary instead of fucking Greg.

1128
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,040
Yeah.

1129
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,560
Dude, that should be your next thing, monkey.

1130
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:15,960
Yeah.

1131
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,520
I'll do a Diary of a Losing Candidate.

1132
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,920
Well, I mean, okay, okay.

1133
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,120
It's not even fair to say that, you know, you know, Hillary was serious.

1134
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,120
Well, because everyone just loved Jill Stein so much.

1135
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,200
How was she not supposed to be like it?

1136
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,600
You know, she was just overwhelming.

1137
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,320
Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,160
I believe I tried to vote for Jill Stein and failed in doing so.

1139
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,120
And so I believe that that was my attempt.

1140
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,960
Should we move on to questions, folks?

1141
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,680
Let's let's do it.

1142
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,240
Let's do it.

1143
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:41,720
Yeah.

1144
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,920
That was a fun aside.

1145
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,160
Yeah.

1146
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,120
Oh, it's Jeb Bush.

1147
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,320
If anyone doesn't share their comments, feel free to.

1148
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,080
It's Jeb Bush, the guy I was thinking of.

1149
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,120
I was thinking Jeff Thu every time.

1150
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,760
Every time.

1151
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,600
Same.

1152
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,120
His name is Jeb Bush.

1153
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,560
But his name is Jeb Bush.

1154
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,120
Not the son of Jeb.

1155
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,480
I thought they were like completely different.

1156
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh, no.

1157
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,640
So no one should make like the chart where it's all fucking yellow and Jeb is like doing a power pose

1158
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,240
when they have that with Jeff and the PCP subscribers or something like that.

1159
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,760
That's a good idea.

1160
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,040
Okay.

1161
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,560
Oh, I love Jeff.

1162
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,800
Just note here.

1163
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,080
Tell me all of your secrets, guys.

1164
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,280
Come PM me.

1165
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,400
Tell me how many people you've touched in such a way.

1166
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,720
As Jeb touched the nation during the 2016 election.

1167
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,360
Yeah.

1168
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:24,600
Yeah.

1169
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,960
Good idea.

1170
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,400
Okay.

1171
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,960
Let's see.

1172
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,120
I'm going to Twitter to get some questions.

1173
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,640
And we've also got some, I think.

1174
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,240
I shall get some from the data.

1175
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,960
Wait, wait.

1176
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,200
Before I do questions, I have a secret.

1177
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,800
One time, I touched a girl's hand and I was like,

1178
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,120
No!

1179
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,520
I touched it.

1180
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,760
I was, it was a prolonged exposure.

1181
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,080
No!

1182
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,560
Did you ask permission first?

1183
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,400
Because I'm afraid I've got some boys in blue who are going to need a report to your domicile.

1184
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,680
She grabbed my hand.

1185
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
She was, she raped you then.

1186
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,040
She didn't guess for consent.

1187
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,440
All right.

1188
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,680
Well, she's in jail now.

1189
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,400
Don't worry about it.

1190
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:00,920
Okay.

1191
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,560
Jess has been sent.

1192
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,480
That monster is locked up.

1193
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,920
That woman's name was Hillary Clinton.

1194
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,920
That's why she wasn't available for, yeah.

1195
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,680
It's my fault Trump won.

1196
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,280
Well done.

1197
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,320
Mozilla Fiddick can ask, what is the most powerful bug in all caps?

1198
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,040
Sizer.

1199
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,520
Scissor.

1200
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,240
Whatever you want to call it.

1201
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,920
A beetle possibly?

1202
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,400
Maybe.

1203
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,520
Scissor could just vour a pincer.

1204
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,640
Oh, oh, guys.

1205
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,640
He would just use aerial ace and win.

1206
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,520
Exactly.

1207
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,880
Recently, I was in France.

1208
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,480
And in France, they have hornets.

1209
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,440
There was these hornets.

1210
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:32,920
No!

1211
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,120
And they, yeah.

1212
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,560
But it's, it's weird.

1213
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,360
They're sort of like bigger wasps with long, thick thighs, right?

1214
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,440
That just dangle down next to them.

1215
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,960
But they're so stupid.

1216
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,000
They just hit walls and can't stand on anything.

1217
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,440
They're actually adorable.

1218
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,960
I love, I love hornets.

1219
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,520
What I would say to a scary hornet is like, dude,

1220
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Beedrill isn't even competitive.

1221
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,280
You've got to get the fuck.

1222
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,560
I'm not intimidated by you.

1223
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,720
He has like one speed.

1224
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,160
Have you seen Megabedrill though?

1225
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
He's like the coolest motherfucker in all of them.

1226
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,440
He looks retarded.

1227
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,560
Megas are bad.

1228
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,800
Megas are bad all of them are horrible.

1229
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,800
Beedrill is Gurren Lagoon.

1230
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,760
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1231
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,320
The closest to Gurren Lagoon is without a doubt.

1232
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:15,800
Scissor.

1233
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,600
And I like scissor years before I even saw fucking Gurren Lagoon.

1234
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,480
Okay, well whatever.

1235
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,000
Uh, here we go.

1236
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,880
Question.

1237
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,520
I got one at Jade Moreau, our old friend.

1238
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,920
What are y'all's opinion on love songs?

1239
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,040
Gay.

1240
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,680
Love songs.

1241
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,360
My favorite one is the George Harrison something.

1242
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,960
Something in the way she moves.

1243
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,080
That's a good love song.

1244
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,440
The rest are bad.

1245
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,240
The rest are bad.

1246
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,640
If I remember correctly, shit, who was it?

1247
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,480
Not only is that song, uh, great.

1248
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,280
I believe it was-

1249
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,920
Charlie Ray Jebson with Call Me Maybe.

1250
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,040
Great love song.

1251
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,400
Some, some world famous-

1252
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,520
I actually do like that song.

1253
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,640
Some famous love song singer who I can't fucking remember.

1254
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,880
Oh no, I love song.

1255
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,920
I love songs, that is.

1256
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,960
Wake me up when September ends.

1257
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,800
That's the, the guy from Green Day wrote that

1258
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,640
because his dad, I was really hot in the-

1259
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,600
Yeah, that's not a love song.

1260
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,520
It's like about some guy who died.

1261
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,120
Not about his dad.

1262
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,600
It's about daddy.

1263
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,760
Wake me up inside.

1264
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,640
Wake me up.

1265
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,880
Can't wake up inside.

1266
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,560
Say Jesus.

1267
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,960
Wake me up when pedophilia is legal.

1268
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,280
And also incest.

1269
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,240
I love my dad.

1270
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,240
Uh, he's a question, he's a question.

1271
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,600
He never thought of the song.

1272
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,600
It was, it was, I was just gonna, I can't,

1273
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,640
I can't think of a good song,

1274
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,280
but it was, I was gonna say about, uh, Gibbs.

1275
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,320
Some famous love song singer said that George Harrison's song,

1276
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,280
something of the way she moves,

1277
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,720
was the best love song I've ever written.

1278
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,920
Oh, Frank Sinatra?

1279
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,120
I think it was Frank Sinatra.

1280
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,560
What's new pussycat?

1281
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1282
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,280
That's the greatest love song of all time.

1283
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,240
What's new pussycat?

1284
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1285
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,480
Reg's girlfriend in the PCP patient lounge asks,

1286
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,160
how do you be productive?

1287
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,440
Stop being a bitch and fucking do it already.

1288
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:14,360
Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah, you gotta you gotta remove obstacles from your life. I have I have I have I have a video

1289
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,480
Watched by died. I watched by me about Van Harman

1290
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,440
Who was talking about this a very thing? How do you be productive out here?

1291
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,320
He said that the whole idea of like having deadlines and forcing yourself to do it is okay

1292
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:34,120
It gets the job done, but it's not good for growing yourself at being able to do stuff

1293
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,960
so the the whole it's better to

1294
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,920
Not force deadlines upon yourself

1295
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:46,760
But to just not take anything you do as seriously as you take it and just make shit and make it bad and go and go into it

1296
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:53,360
Wanting it like making sure that it's shit because otherwise nothing gets made and that's that's how you do it

1297
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:59,580
Apparently that I like that a few episodes of the latest season of Rick and Morty. Oh

1298
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I don't know

1299
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:12,720
Okay, here's a question at the Vajita asks hey, that's a just joke. He stole that that's that's true

1300
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,920
There's underscores here. What part of your everyday routine is the worst?

1301
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:24,240
What part of your routine is the worst for me without a doubt it's waking up waking up is by far the worst part of my day

1302
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I

1303
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,680
Hate getting out I said I said literally ten alarms for myself every morning cuz I cannot no no no

1304
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,240
No, I mean, I mean, I know you have a job so you have to but I would have I would advise against

1305
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,720
Alarms because I've never had I've got rid of alarms and I've learned to just wake up at the right time

1306
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,040
It's way better. I feel so much better. I wish I could do that

1307
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,120
I can't trust myself though. If I if I could like guarantee that I went to bed by a certain time

1308
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,640
I'd try that but yeah, I'm just abusing my body every day that I like

1309
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,520
It's not good for you, it's not it's the most it's the most terrible way to begin getting up when I am

1310
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,760
By a loud noise when I'm free for my fucking wage slave job patreon.com slash best guy ever everybody

1311
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,240
Let's hit that $5,000 per month market. I'll be fucking free today. I

1312
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,520
I

1313
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,520
Yeah, I'm hurting myself

1314
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,200
I will wake up at any time I want it'll be great

1315
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,880
Alarms are cool because then you can set your own custom alarm clock sound and then you can like go to your friend at the bar

1316
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,400
You can be like, what's your alarm sound and you just say my dad screaming at me?

1317
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,680
Look at my scars

1318
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:45,880
Also alarms make you hate whatever the alarm is I have PTSD for the default alarm sound from my phone

1319
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,080
If I ever hear it again, I will get so upset that I might shit myself

1320
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,000
Are you ever walking around and then you hear someone's phone rings and it's the noise that you use as your alarm?

1321
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,920
Yeah, oh my god, it's gonna. I'm gonna die. Just thinking about

1322
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:01,920
Obliterated

1323
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,880
That's that's like that's what's like for me

1324
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,720
But even worse because my alarm clock sound is a is a song from Homestuck. So whenever I'm listening to

1325
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,160
ography I just get that sound I just fucking oh

1326
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,880
No, no, no, no, okay

1327
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,880
So you're making a big mistake. You never put a song you actually like as your alarm sound. That's that's you can't do it

1328
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,240
It's not legal can't be done. You know, it's all about

1329
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,800
Cosmetic and duality and your whole

1330
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,400
Right, you know, I used to do that

1331
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,000
I used to use anime songs as my alarm clocks, but then I start to dislike anime and I'm like I can't go down this road

1332
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I can't this is too much of a risk

1333
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,520
I'll die. I'll lose all all identity if I keep this up

1334
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,160
Milady from the PCP patreon Lana asked would you rather know the date of your death or the cause of your death?

1335
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,440
You have to pick one. This assumes that I will die in my life. I would

1336
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:56,400
That's true, I would much rather know the cause than the day I do not want to know the date that fucks you up in all kinds of ways

1337
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,760
Yeah, cause could cause could happen. I know the cause I can train and be ready

1338
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,540
Well, assuming that it's it's always

1339
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,640
I've been ready to die for years

1340
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:15,840
Yeah, but like if you if you hear like the cause of your death is a train crash

1341
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,760
And you're like, okay, I'm never gonna go on a train again

1342
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,920
And then then it's obviously because a train crashes into you like what you you can't avoid it

1343
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,400
But if you do any planning, it's gonna be in vain

1344
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,000
Because like yeah, you just be like scared of knives for the rest of your life or whatever

1345
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,720
But if I know the date I know like okay, well, I have 80 years now to get all these projects done

1346
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,360
I guess I better start doing them. Well, you know, that that that length of term

1347
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,640
I mean, what if you find out it's in let's just say like five years like how are you gonna choose to spend five years?

1348
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,720
You know, that's that's a time you're gonna you're gonna panic, but you're gonna get a lot of stuff done

1349
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,960
Yeah, which could be good if it turns out that the guy who was telling you that you're gonna die is just a crazy man

1350
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,120
Yeah, that's yeah, that's I know I have five years

1351
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,020
Cuz like either way you're gonna die in five years, so at least I can spend those five years being productive rather than

1352
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,100
Because you think about it, I mean none of us are gonna be alive in

1353
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,320
Download myself to the vapor net

1354
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,840
I agree actually I actually

1355
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,560
Is gonna is not it's gonna it's gonna be it's gonna it's gonna be a gonna be a good robot

1356
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,680
I I don't think that consciousness is real

1357
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,360
And I think we're basically seeing like individual frames

1358
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,120
String together like a film that's constantly playing so it gives us the illusion of a sense of self

1359
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,020
In a sense of like continuity to our consciousness. That is a moment to moment. This is too stupid. Can we go to the next question?

1360
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,980
The least stupid thing I have the dumbest thing I've ever heard you say dude, dude

1361
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,900
I have a tangent

1362
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,900
tangentially related to

1363
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,500
What you were saying?

1364
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:12,480
That's just thinking I was thinking earlier in the week about like robots being like the literal

1365
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:20,260
The the the the next evolution of humans not humans with robotic parts, but like literally just robots

1366
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:25,140
We make them and they live much longer than we can so they're literally our children

1367
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,620
They're gonna last longer than they're gonna be able to go and do whatever, but they're not going to be like us

1368
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,300
Preserved they're just gonna be new people

1369
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:38,180
I want to build I want to build a robot daughter and I'm gonna call her risk and she's gonna be

1370
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:43,300
Unbeatable and she's gonna live forever in the universe and it's gonna be like yeah

1371
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:50,340
I should do an episode on transhumanism. That's a great idea. It's a great and there be robot. Penethilia

1372
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,540
Okay, it depends it depends what you mean

1373
00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:00,940
You got to find your terms because like can a man look at a baby looking robot with lust in his heart and be called a pedophile

1374
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,300
I say yes, can a baby robot in fact be the victim of a pedophilic sexual act?

1375
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,660
I say no so that's you know

1376
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,060
Cuz then they could

1377
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:16,380
After wait 18 years to fuck it. I say that's bullshit exactly if you if you got a robot

1378
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,060
You could just turn that crank to to make the whole whatever size you want

1379
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,740
Doesn't even matter. I've imagined like an old steampunk like a big old crank. You got a like

1380
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,620
Over the vagina

1381
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:33,260
I'm gonna make that hole as big as a cave so I can walk inside and I can learn where babies come from finally that makes sense

1382
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,980
That makes sense. Oh, by the way, what's the name of that? What's the name of that ship? Okay? Well, okay, just a

1383
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,540
There's a there's a name a sycophant. No, that's not it

1384
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:50,100
Okay, so like if you if you take a ship and it's out sailing and it gets damaged and you repair a piece and you keep doing that

1385
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,900
Keep going and eventually every single piece has been replaced by something. So it is in fact

1386
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,100
Well, okay, so it's like it's still called like the same thing as it what it was there's a name for this but I forget what it is

1387
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,340
It's not is this a fist is like the hill that the guy puts the rock up, you know

1388
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,180
That's the sycophane thing or whatever. It's got some other name that I can't remember

1389
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:16,340
But the point I'm getting at is like it is theoretically possible that a human being can in fact just become a robot in a sense

1390
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:21,760
If like let's say that you take your brain and you replace one piece of it with an artificial piece and then you okay

1391
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,600
you live already you're dead and

1392
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,220
Why so well that's the question like at what point do you become a robot?

1393
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:33,440
And if there is no clear point where it happens, I think you could maybe replace every single piece and just then be a robot

1394
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,440
Oh, you know what you know what I'm gonna do. What's that? I'm gonna become a robot that is just has a human penis

1395
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:46,880
You're real human real penis. I'll be like oh, it's a real human penis. Whoa real

1396
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
That's just doesn't happen anymore

1397
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,160
And my future robot self will have so much fun

1398
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,280
Oh Christ

1399
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,880
Okay, any other cookies

1400
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,800
I

1401
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:25,360
Yeah, who knows man, I don't know something in some way. I think okay. No, it wasn't let's move on. Yes, okay

1402
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:32,600
Yeah, here's one at Lord Saiba says if you were with Digi what unspeakable acts would you do in his big-ass room?

1403
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
I take a shit

1404
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,360
That's what I would do

1405
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,840
Yeah, of course I did yeah, yeah, yeah, it was great

1406
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,120
It was great on his house. Yeah, you know that's awesome

1407
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,720
And then we pissed on him and then we pissed on his brothers, and it was great. Yeah, you know, don't you dare?

1408
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,880
Yeah, I love Vincent. He's my favorite

1409
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:03,200
