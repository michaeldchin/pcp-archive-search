1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, I am the Nostalgia Critic and this is my host, the best guy ever.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What's up? It's me, the best guy ever.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Turning red should have been about 9-11.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is that a thing?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You must not have been looking at Twitter this week. That was a big funny thing this week.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Was it Mr. Enter's review of Turning Red said it was bad that it didn't properly reflect the fact that it takes place in 2002,

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and that to reflect that, paranoia over 9-11 should have been a big theme of the movie.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What the fuck?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know. I don't know.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I've seen bits and bobs about Mr. Enter being a horrible, terrible idiot.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But I already knew that, so I guess it's not that interesting.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's funny, people lost their minds at him for this unbelievable take,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and on Twitter he responded by being like,

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Jenny Nicholson put it best, his response was basically,

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've had way even worse opinions than this, and I can't believe this is what you're all mad at me about.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's like, I'm literally an anti-vaxxer, and you guys are mad about this at me?

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Fuck you!

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And it's just great.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know what drives a person to do that and be like that.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh yes, and Mr. Enter, one of Nate's aliases.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, I remember.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh shit, did I say that out loud?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, you got, you killed him.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He's Mr, Mr, more like the best guy Enter.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The best guy Enter the building, ladies and gentlemen.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Uh, I, what was it?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So this week, I did something, I just, I just, just as I finished before we started recording,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I finished, putting the finishing touches on what I was working on all this week,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I took a break away from doing the formatting on the Slime and Punishment book,

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
because I was drawing a guest page for Tales Gets Trolled.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh yes.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you can believe, I spent a whole week, I spent a whole week doing that.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How big is the page?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not one book page.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not one book page.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's like, can be huge because it's intimate.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, it's like long, it's like long.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Here, I'll show, I'll show you my, my page.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Or, uh, yeah, mine was 18 panels.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh my God.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, so it's, it's not like one book page.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's, that's more like, like three or four or five pages?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
More four pages.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Probably, probably something like that.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Um, I think, I think this will have been published on the website by the time this episode comes out,

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
so it's probably fine to show it, but I'll link in the description to the page if it is,

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
uh, released on the website.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Um, so yeah, I spent like a whole week drawing this because I wanted to make it really good.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Meanwhile, back to Coyote.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In a great yard.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, um, I had to, I had to catch up.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am caught up on the story of Tales Gets Trolled, by the way.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It has, there's a lot, there's a lot that has happened since, um, like when I did the

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
lecture on it, uh, although they're still locked in battle.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Like Coyote and Demaro are still locked in the battle.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's like the same day.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Uh, but I mean, there's like chapters and chapters and chapters have gone by.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will eventually get around to, to reading it all.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I, at some point, I just sort of stopped because it was, it was getting, I mean, obviously

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
it's like, it's stupid, but like I feel like some of the gut buster, like I can't believe

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
this is a comic moments were very early on.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know if like it continues to be as hilarious as it goes.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It continues to be, it continues to be very like shonen battle anime.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It also continues to be, you know, it has, it has, there's cutaways to like a bunch of

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
like trolls talking about like the ramifications of the battle and like they're kind of pursuing

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
their own side missions and whatever.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And those are like, you know, weird and bizarre and all the trolls look ridiculous and stuff.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Uh, the battle between, the cosmic battle between God and Satan continues to be a central

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
focus of the, of the plot.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Uh, I requested, because on the, on the semi official, um, audio books that one guy is

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
making on YouTube, I was, I was given the voice of Satan.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I voiced Satan in the scene where they, they drink the blood and get the neutral powers.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So I asked, um, I asked Emmergram if he had a page with Satan in it that I could draw.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And he was like, as a matter of fact, I'm like editing one right now.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Uh, so he gave me this page.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What happens in this page?

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So previously, after four reasons that are too complicated to get into, Coyote does some

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
stuff, but he like exhausts himself and he's, and he's going to faint.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So instead of fainting out in the real world, he off screen sort of puts himself into his

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
book world and then he falls to the ground in the book world.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But Demaro, he also put Demaro and the ghost of Gary into his book world.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So now Coyote is unconscious on the ground in the book world and Demaro is there and

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Demaro tries to get to him, but also passes out unconscious while attempting to go and

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
kill Coyote.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Uh, and the ghost of Gary is here and he doesn't like either of them.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Uh, so that's, and then there's a cutaway to Satan.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Uh, and then some, some things happen.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Things.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And that's, and that's my page.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I spent all week drawing it.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Uh, and I'm pretty proud of it.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's very good.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm, I'm very happy.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm very happy with how it came out.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Some, some guest artists, some guest artists try to duplicate, uh, you know, the, the laser

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
bot style of drawing.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And sometimes it works.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And sometimes it, I think it just doesn't, like they can't quite do it.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And it ends up kind of just looking bad anyway.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I decided not to even bother with doing that because I thought, I don't think I could do

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
it.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It would actually be harder to like try and make it look like exactly the way laser bot

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
draws.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I just drew it like the way I would draw.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I was like, fuck it.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Um, although I maintained the, um, the, like the shape, the shape of the text boxes and

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the formatting of the text boxes and like the fonts used for the text.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I used all that the same way, but, um, the drawings are just the way that I would do

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
it.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And, uh, um, I'm very, I'm very, I'm very pleased.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't wait.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't wait for it to go on the website and, uh, I'll be famous finally.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Uh, so that's pretty exciting.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Nice.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That was most of my week.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Although I'm, I'm now behind on the book formatting.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,500
Uh, I've still got a lot, still got a lot to do, uh, with like making the, making the

129
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,500
phantoms revenge scenes into pages for the book is what I got to get back to and do for

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
the rest of this week.

131
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I guess hopefully I can finish that soon.

132
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
What's she been up to?

133
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Um, what I, well, I don't, what I might mostly been up to is playing Elden Ring on stream

134
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
still.

135
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Oh yeah.

136
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh yeah.

137
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Uh, Elden Ring twitch.tv slash Gibbon take if you want to watch.

138
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Oh.

139
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,500
I've been doing a whole lot of stuff, um, and refusing to go to the first major dungeon

140
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,500
and I've explored many, many, many optional areas and it's, it's very fun.

141
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Hmm.

142
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Uh, how far through the game do you think you are?

143
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
It's hard to say at all because you haven't gone to the first dungeon.

144
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Well, you can skip round the first major dungeon with the first main story bus and once you

145
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:59,500
do that, there's a whole like northern area that you can explore and like there's I, I

146
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,060
don't think I can count the number of like little dungeons and little bosses in little

147
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,100
areas tucked away all over the map and it's just sort of like, oh, I go from here to there

148
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,380
and I'm like, oh, there's something distracts me and I get distracted.

149
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,460
I go and fight a bunch of enemies and they're in like standing around some ruins and there's

150
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,340
like a little, uh, you know, hidden staircase down into a place with a treasure chest.

151
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,380
Sometimes it's a staircase down to a dungeon and sometimes those dungeons have bosses most

152
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,300
of the time they do and so I've just sort of been exploring the map, like getting like

153
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,860
the graces, which is like the bonfires and I can teleport to a grace.

154
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,580
So like, I've got like all of these points all over the whole map that I can teleport

155
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,580
to and then explore from there, like, oh, I haven't gone to this little corner, I haven't

156
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,100
gone to this coastline here, I haven't like checked out this weird thing that looks like

157
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,220
a, looks like a hill with a, with a thing on it.

158
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,940
And so I just have been doing that over and over and over and over and over and it's very

159
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,940
good.

160
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Hmm.

161
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
Hmm.

162
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Hmm.

163
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Fascinating.

164
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,140
Give the game a ranking, rank it out of 10 right now.

165
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,900
Um, gosh, I don't do 10 rankings.

166
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Too late!

167
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
Uh.

168
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,900
Now I gotta choose.

169
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
It's a four.

170
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
It's just not that good.

171
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Oh, okay.

172
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Sorry.

173
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I hate this game.

174
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,900
Sorry.

175
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,900
I don't care if you're enjoying it.

176
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Um, yeah, I don't know.

177
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,580
I feel like the combat is like probably the most freeing, feeling combat in any of the

178
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,540
Souls games, the amount of like the freedom you have to play in a certain way.

179
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,780
And then the horse combat is like the funnest thing ever.

180
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,180
It's like, really?

181
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,580
Like you can, sometimes there are enemies on horseback and you can ride by them and

182
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:55,020
like a normal attack with R1 or L1 will like swing your weapon like quickly, like a little

183
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,220
quick slice.

184
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,820
So you run past them, you slice them and you get them.

185
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,140
Um, but you can do like a power attack L2 or R2 and the LOR is like which direction

186
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,580
of the horse you're attacking from the horse.

187
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,140
And then if you do it like a power attack, you can hold it and they sort of hold their

188
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,340
weapon down low.

189
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,020
And then at the end of a certain time, they'd like swing up and it's a big attack.

190
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,220
But you can do that to like, you can hold like a halberd or something and do a power

191
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,820
attack and run past a bunch of enemies and it'll just hit all of them.

192
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
You go...

193
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:35,940
So that's, that's a very fun and the horse double jumps and it's, it's very manoeuvrable

194
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
It's great.

195
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
Good horse.

196
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Good horse.

197
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:48,900
Well, I, on the other hand, despise video games and I would never, and I would never

198
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,500
play one.

199
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,780
I have not been playing much Hades.

200
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,180
I have not made a lot of progress, although I'm getting pretty close to finishing the

201
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,740
fated list of minor prophecies.

202
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,740
I've only got like six of them left and I finished, I finished like the most annoying

203
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:11,820
one, which is to, I think to get every, every combo boon, like every boon that is like,

204
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,780
okay, you need one from Dionysus and one from Aphrodite and if you have them, then

205
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,140
you can get this other one that's sort of like, sort of a buff to both of their things.

206
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,940
I managed to get every combo boon, which is very, very hard to do.

207
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,140
I have some other random ones left.

208
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,580
Oh, you know what I want to mention?

209
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,060
MarinPan has, was asking, and I think we should do it.

210
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,580
He wanted us to shout out, he wanted us to mention again and remind everybody that the

211
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:47,580
PCP Minecraft server, if you are a PCP patron, you have access to the Minecraft server and

212
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,900
if you have any trouble getting in there, you should find MarinPan on Discord.

213
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,820
He will help you out.

214
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,620
And I think he wanted to say, he wanted me to shout out the Pokemon League in the Minecraft

215
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,620
server.

216
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,820
There's a whole, there's like a league, you know, they do once in a while, they do, yeah,

217
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,220
yeah, they do tournaments of like, yeah, stuff you caught.

218
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Wait, tournament?

219
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,220
Well, they've done them before.

220
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,300
I thought they were talking about like, the gym battles, like you have like Major's Gym

221
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,740
and your Gym in Copkill Town.

222
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,020
There is, yeah, there is that, there is the whole like, have we like really mentioned

223
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,860
before that there's sort of like a whole like, set of challenges in there?

224
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,420
There's sort of like, there's almost like a whole like, single player campaign.

225
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,860
Yeah, yeah, there's a Pokemon video game built around the buildings that we make or

226
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,780
MarinPan makes in the world.

227
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,540
Mostly MarinPan makes them.

228
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,860
If you, if you catch the streams, you would know.

229
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,620
If you don't, then you wouldn't know.

230
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,140
So probably most people don't know, but yeah, there is, there are whole, there are big like,

231
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,860
Major's Gyms in there to battle through with your team.

232
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,700
There's Major's Gym was the first one.

233
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,220
There's like, there's like, St. Ben's Cathedral in Copkill Town.

234
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,860
There was, there's like that Graveyard one, that like the Tomb of the PCP.

235
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,700
Oh yeah.

236
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,100
There was some, there was one, there was other ones, I think, but there's like a whole, there's

237
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,660
like side quests and stuff.

238
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,780
MarinPan has like, crafted a whole like, a whole like, a video game, a sort of a whole

239
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,220
video game in there.

240
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
Yeah.

241
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,820
Sort of a whole, sort of a whole little Pokemon region.

242
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,100
I mean, you know, yeah, I mean, you know, that's not, I mean, I mean, more is being

243
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
made all the time.

244
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,100
As much as you could do that, I think the, yeah, but there's areas, there's like themed

245
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
areas and stuff.

246
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
It's great.

247
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
It's wild.

248
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,900
And probably most people don't know about that because most people don't watch the

249
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,220
streams, but it's true.

250
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
Yeah.

251
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,260
There's a lot.

252
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,900
MarinPan has done a huge amount of content, like genuine content.

253
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Is it there?

254
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Yeah.

255
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:02,780
The entirety or like soon to like, very nearly the entirety to scale, basically, of, of Nalacacum,

256
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,620
New Los Angeles city, aka New Milwaukee, is in the server.

257
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,780
It's just a place you can go and it's like the shape of, you know, the actual map.

258
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,260
The map is down.

259
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,500
The map is down.

260
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Not every region is full of like buildings.

261
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,580
There's so many regions that are full.

262
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
There are.

263
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,980
It's, it's, some areas are so rich that actually lags a bit.

264
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,300
The downtown area and Copkilt, yeah, a lot of like the, the more central regions are

265
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,620
like fully built and fleshed out.

266
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,220
And yeah, Rowdy Rough House can be a little tough on your, on your PC performance.

267
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,060
And like, you know, oh, and the, oh, the Rowdy Quest, the, the, the, the, the, what was it

268
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,060
called?

269
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
The Rowdy Marble Quest.

270
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,060
Yeah.

271
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,060
Rough House stuck.

272
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Yeah.

273
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,260
The Rough House stuck based on that, that RFCK comic by Forks.

274
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,700
There's a whole quest where you have to find all of the realist rowdies and battle them

275
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,580
for their magic marbles and get into the, the, the Rough House.

276
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,060
That's a whole, that took me like, took me like weeks.

277
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,740
We don't talk about it on the show that much.

278
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,940
We usually leave it for the streams, but Marin wanted me to mention it and it does in fact

279
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,940
bear mention it.

280
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
We should mention it more.

281
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Mm-hmm.

282
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,940
Mm-hmm.

283
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:21,780
So if you're a PCP patron of five dollars or more, you get access to the server at no

284
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,780
extra cost.

285
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,220
It used to be a separate patron.

286
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,660
If you weren't aware, it's just in the, the procrastinator's patron now.

287
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,700
No, we, we combined it.

288
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:38,740
So I should say this, this week, this week, uh, I, I am going to, uh, I'm gonna get those

289
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,900
bonus episodes that Marin, not Marin, Eleazar made weeks and weeks ago that I never posted

290
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,460
and I'm gonna, I'm gonna post them this week.

291
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:53,580
Um, I will also attempt, I don't, I can't promise it because there may be technical

292
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,980
issues that I don't know about.

293
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,140
I can't promise this, but I will, I will, I will make my best effort to actually get

294
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:06,140
the old episodes up on like Spotify and Apple podcasts and, and whatever.

295
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,420
Uh, I will use Tom's instructions to figure out, uh, all that.

296
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:17,140
Uh, also the final thing I want to say about the Patreon, you know what I'm gonna say.

297
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,140
Oh yeah.

298
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Yeah.

299
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,140
This is a terrible situation.

300
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Terrible.

301
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,660
It sucks so much.

302
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,460
But everybody who's been a patron, everyone who's been a patron got it for free for the

303
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:38,460
last month because we all simply forgot to, uh, post and monetize our usual.

304
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,020
It's not that I forgot, it's just like it's a, it's a part of the presses that I'm never

305
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,020
involved in.

306
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,580
I just assumed that you were doing it or whatever.

307
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Yeah.

308
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,780
You, you never were involved in it.

309
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,700
It was technically Tom's job, although Tom's, Tom simply stopped doing it without saying

310
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,580
anything a while ago and I did do it a couple times, like thinking like, oh, Tom just forgot

311
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
this week.

312
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,700
I, I guess I'll do it.

313
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,060
I guess I'll, I'll back him up.

314
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:10,940
And then I forgot that, um, and then I forgot that it had to, it had to continue to be done.

315
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:17,940
Uh, so, and then it didn't, we didn't get money for the entire month of March and a little

316
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
bit of February.

317
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,060
We charge per episode and we have to post it as a charge thing in order for it to count.

318
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,300
So nothing was charged for March.

319
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,140
So that's, so that's quite a bit of money, uh, that we've lost.

320
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
Terrible.

321
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,140
We missed out on our whole months.

322
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,700
Hey, our loss is the patron's gain, so, uh, you know, you're welcome, everybody.

323
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,740
Uh, yeah.

324
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,980
That means you have to double your pledge now.

325
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,420
I, I, I would say, I wouldn't say that you have to, but I would say that if you don't,

326
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,940
you're a bad person.

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,180
So there you go.

328
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Uh, but I will put, I will put those, those unreleased, uh, bonus, um, what do we call

329
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,500
the ones that are just like, uh, off, off air banter behind the scenes?

330
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,780
Behind this, I guess the behind the scenes, I didn't know there was a main for them.

331
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,500
I don't, I think I call them behind the scenes.

332
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,900
I'm pretty sure Eleazar made two of them and they've just been sitting there and just

333
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
haven't posted them.

334
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,620
I will actually go and post them, uh, this week.

335
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,020
This week I'm going to do it for real.

336
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,860
Like before, like before this episode is out, so they will be out when this episode goes

337
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
live.

338
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,340
Um, so everybody's got homework.

339
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,900
You got, you got to go this week.

340
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,360
You got to go check out my tails gets trolled page.

341
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,020
You got to check out the bonus episodes.

342
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,020
You got to pledge to patreon.com slash the procrastinators and get on that Minecraft

343
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,260
server and build a house and get on the Minecraft server, assemble, get in Pixelmon, assemble

344
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,740
a team, challenge, challenge me in cop kill town.

345
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,660
I will destroy you.

346
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,300
Um, I, uh, the cop kill town, which was really hard.

347
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,980
There were a couple of like gimmick fights in there that had like a like a single like

348
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,900
hunt, like level hundred and fifty legendary or something, like a great or edgy gigas or

349
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
whatever.

350
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,780
That's like, I just don't have the stats for it.

351
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Um, yeah.

352
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,740
The Pokemon's actually quite like a serious Pokemon stuff.

353
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,460
It's not casual and therefore I have not tried it.

354
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,020
I enjoy catching the Pokemon and looking at them and finding like a really big or a really

355
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,420
small version of a thing.

356
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,460
I, I have a team in there that has gotten me through most things.

357
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,620
Sometimes I have to fuck around with it to deal with something or other, but most of

358
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:34,820
the time my team can, can meet, uh, Marin's challenges, uh, it's a lot of fun and it's,

359
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,940
and I mean, we've been doing it for like, for like years now, I guess, like every, you

360
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,740
know, we don't stream that often, but I mean, it's been an ongoing thing where often when

361
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:51,220
we stream, Marin has made some new, some new bullshit for us to cope with.

362
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,340
Some new bullshit for us to gore cat and scope out.

363
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,260
Some new nonsense, some new nonsense to vex us.

364
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
Yeah.

365
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,700
Um, shout outs to Marin for everything he's done.

366
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Yeah.

367
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
That's really incredible work.

368
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,500
Uh, just a huge amount of time and expertise has gone into it.

369
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I don't know how he does it.

370
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I really don't.

371
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,900
Um, hey, let me check it out.

372
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Yeah.

373
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
So just, so just check it out.

374
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Check.

375
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:24,060
So just go to www.nfl.com and just check it out.

376
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,700
Uh, I've got a thing to say.

377
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Yeah, please.

378
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Um, all right.

379
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,980
So Lord of Ghosts, there's like 13, 15 or so more packages I can send.

380
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,100
Uh, it's beneficial that I send because they're all going to America or Australia and I can

381
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:48,700
send those, uh, through Transglobal Express all in one big collection and, uh, that's

382
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,860
better for me if I can do it all at once.

383
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,740
There's a few people who still have not, even though I've emailed them directly, still

384
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,740
not responded about their address.

385
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,380
So I'm just going to read out their names.

386
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,380
I'm going to dox them, uh, hopefully they, they either they like think they've done it

387
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,740
and don't realize, um, or they, I don't know if they'll listen to the podcast, maybe they're

388
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,060
just not paying attention to anything.

389
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,060
They might not be.

390
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:18,220
This is my last, this is my last attempt after this episode goes live for a few days.

391
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,900
I will then send the last big batch of Lord of Ghosts.

392
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,860
And if you're not in that, if you haven't given me your address, I just, I can't do anything

393
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
about it.

394
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,360
Um, so.

395
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,140
Your package goes in the bonfire goes in, I'm going to burn it live on stream, uh, including

396
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,140
the plush, which will be terrible, terrible and sad.

397
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,640
You don't want that happen.

398
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Um, okay.

399
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:47,960
So here, here's the list of, of, of names, uh, Mimi Menzies, O-R-N-O-R-I-N, Panda Pop

400
00:22:47,960 --> 00:23:02,080
Loin, Xtreme, Dag Zagals, James Gottwig, Adam O'Donnell, D dot S, Chromel, R-H-O-M-E-L-L,

401
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,400
James Dollar and Milo Rocks.

402
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,360
Uh, I could put an image actually as well as well.

403
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:15,200
Um, get your things in because I, I want to give you your, your free shit that you paid

404
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
for.

405
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,920
I want you to have the thing you, you, you gave me money for.

406
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,440
I want you to have it.

407
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Yeah.

408
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,720
There were, there were, there were not too many, but there were a few people who, who

409
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:34,080
just simply never got me there, like info from the Vapors Kickstarter, uh, for, for whatever

410
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
reason.

411
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,680
Uh, um, yeah, that happens.

412
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,160
Um, but yeah, I hope everyone gets their fucking shit together.

413
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,280
But yeah, that'll be the ending of the Lord of Ghost thing, uh, hopefully, and then I

414
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,440
can, the, the, the next thing I'm going to be working on is Pumpkin Alley.

415
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,000
And I want to like, I want to do like a, a lot of pre-production before I can, I can

416
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,800
like figure out the, the possible cost of making the game.

417
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,400
And then I'll make a Kickstarter once I know that.

418
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,560
So the pre-production is going to be like, I guess, like thinking about all the levels,

419
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:24,520
what they will require in terms of number of assets, number of enemies, uh, you know,

420
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,640
game mechanics, and then like making a lot of, like an, an exhaustive list of everything

421
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
I would need.

422
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,200
And then, I don't know, ballparking figures of like time it would take to make all of

423
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,920
those assets, uh, for various people and, uh, hourly rates.

424
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,000
So I can figure out like, what's, what's good money for this, this amount of work?

425
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,600
Mostly it's going to be me and Charlie, um, working on it.

426
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,320
So I'll, I just have to ask him, but yeah, Pumpkin Alley pre-production.

427
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,440
And then at some point, Clarissa Gunsmoke, I want to finish, uh, the, the Clarissa Gunsmoke

428
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,240
and the Bandit King.

429
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,800
I want to finish that and make it a real finished thing and maybe even look into like

430
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,920
going to a publisher and saying, Hey, I got a Western cowgirl comic.

431
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,800
What do you think?

432
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,520
You think you can put this on store shelves?

433
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,080
Man, if you figure out how to get a publisher to distribute your book, fucking tell me how

434
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,600
you did it.

435
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,440
I, yeah, I mean, I have, I don't know.

436
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,600
I don't have like, like connections, but I do have some good recommendations of

437
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,000
publishers I could look into.

438
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,920
So I'm just going to, I'm just going to finish the, the, the Bandit King and then

439
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,160
send it out to people and say, what do you think?

440
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,720
And then they say it sucks.

441
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,920
But you got, you got, uh, I like your moxie, but yeah, but yeah, but you got

442
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,520
gumption kid will give you a chance.

443
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,680
And then the Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Bandit King will be like the pilot and then

444
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,080
I'll make a better version.

445
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,720
Hmm.

446
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:04,520
Yeah.

447
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,840
I don't know really what to do with that other than like, it was, it was a cool

448
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,480
idea and I liked the, the character and I want to continue it.

449
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,200
So I will.

450
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,200
Wait, what do you mean you make a better version?

451
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,480
Um, well, you know how like, uh, there's a, the, the pilot version of a thing is

452
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,840
like different and then, uh, if you get a publisher or, or like, uh, people, they'll

453
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,600
say, uh, well, we suggest you do this and that.

454
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,240
And are you talking about like serializing it?

455
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,200
And potentially, I mean, it's a Western.

456
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,320
You could do loads of things with it.

457
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,400
Yeah.

458
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,160
Hmm.

459
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,160
Cause initially for, for a while I was like thinking, Oh, I'm, I'm never going to

460
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,800
get published.

461
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,840
I'm just like an internet content creator.

462
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm just going to draw some things and post them online and get some likes and

463
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,600
hopefully some patrons in this.

464
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,560
That's going to be me.

465
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,800
That's all I can do.

466
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,760
Um, but I got some feedback about it.

467
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,800
Some of my dad's friends were like saying my dad showed it to them and they were

468
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,000
like, Oh, this is really cool.

469
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,600
You should, you should look into getting it published.

470
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm like, really?

471
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,240
This is interesting to me actually.

472
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
You serious?

473
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,680
You, you're giving me like good vibes on this that I made.

474
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,520
That's nice.

475
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
No, no, there's a thought.

476
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,320
Are you telling me that are you telling me that are you telling me that

477
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,040
organized business structures exist for the purpose of creation and distribution

478
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,880
of an artist's output?

479
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,800
Is that what you're saying?

480
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,040
It's, it's more that they thought you fucking with me.

481
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,320
I just felt validated.

482
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,440
You know, like I felt validated that a human being that wasn't online said that

483
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,200
what I drew on was cool and should be made real.

484
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,400
And I'm like, wow, I never really thought about it for some reason.

485
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,240
Sure.

486
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,120
And they're probably right.

487
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,960
I just, that's a thing.

488
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,760
I don't know.

489
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,080
I just, I guess I never really, that's a thing that I thought about.

490
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,880
And I sort of immediately dismissed as like, well, that'll never work.

491
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,440
Like that, that's impossible.

492
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,760
But, but like, well, I don't know why I, that I may, that may be a limiting

493
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,960
belief that I have that now that you say it out loud, that makes me think like,

494
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
that is a good idea.

495
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,320
Could I do that?

496
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,200
How would I do that?

497
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,320
I mean, the way you've done probably so far is

498
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,840
like it's, it's a new way to do comics is to crowdfund the printing of them

499
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,960
and then send them out and it's doable on a small scale.

500
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,680
But if you could get a publisher, so much of that hassle of logistics

501
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,720
and buying and selling and marketing is like taken care of and you can just work.

502
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,480
This is like, this is like, yeah, exactly.

503
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,200
Like when I, when I went around to comic shops to, to ask them like,

504
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,120
hey, would you like to put my book on your shelf?

505
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,000
Some of them were like, yeah, sure, I'll take three copies.

506
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,400
What do you want?

507
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,120
Like, what do you want?

508
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,080
Like $2 for each?

509
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,720
I'm like, yeah.

510
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,120
It's like, well, what's literally not worth the fucking bus fare to like get out

511
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,480
here and ask you in person if you want.

512
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Yeah, they would give me like, they would give me like $3 for each copy

513
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,880
and with the intent to like sell it for five.

514
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,320
I'm like, well, it's simply not worth, it's simply not worth my time.

515
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,360
The only way it would be worth it is if I had a distributor, like if Diamond

516
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,520
distributor were putting my shit in a catalog and like hundreds of stores

517
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,960
were looking at that and being like, yeah, I'll take a copy.

518
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,320
I'll take two copies, whatever.

519
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,280
I'll take 50.

520
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,400
Sure.

521
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,120
Well, sure.

522
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,840
They just, well, they just don't want to, they don't want to stock that many,

523
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,520
especially of an unknown thing.

524
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,560
Yeah, they want to put, they want like one copy, put it on the shelf.

525
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,640
And if it, if someone buys it, like, well, I guess I'll get another one.

526
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,160
Maybe someone will buy that, you know.

527
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,160
So you got to work at scale and I just lack that ability.

528
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,920
So I just gave up.

529
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,440
I was like, well, I guess I'm only selling my shit online.

530
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,120
You know what I got to diversify that portfolio.

531
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,040
Yeah.

532
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,760
What I thought, what I've been thinking occasionally is that I should get an agent.

533
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,840
You know, that's a thing that artists do sometimes.

534
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,120
They get, they get an agent.

535
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,880
What does that mean?

536
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:30,040
Well, what I understand is that an agent is someone who basically knows people in the industry.

537
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,400
You don't, you don't pay them to be your agent.

538
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,800
What they do is they take a, a good day.

539
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,760
Like there are some fake agents that will scam you and ask for money up front, but those are fake.

540
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,560
A real agent will just basically knows people and knows the industry.

541
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:51,040
And when a job comes up and someone's looking for someone, they might be like, Oh, I know a guy.

542
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,480
And then they'll call you and be like, Hey, here's a job I thought you might be good at.

543
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,600
Would you want this job?

544
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,200
And then you go, yes.

545
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,440
And then they take like a, I don't know, 15% cut or whatever of the pay for that job.

546
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
So that's what an agent does.

547
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,320
Just they know talent and they know people that are looking for talent and they connect them.

548
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,880
And I'm like, Hey, I'm talent.

549
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,040
I flatter myself to think.

550
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:27,560
Uh, so it was like, I, I guess sounds like something I should have, uh, but apparently, you know, there's a lot to, that goes into like picking the right agent or whatever.

551
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,360
Like I haven't even really looked at all.

552
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,240
It's just something that sometimes I think I should probably get an agent.

553
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,760
Cause I mean, how would you go for that?

554
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,480
Like agents.com.

555
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,160
Great, great question.

556
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,240
Great question.

557
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,000
I have no idea.

558
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:55,040
I feel like you'd need to go in person to like a comic thing and then like hold a glass of champagne at an after party and say, Yeah, I'm a comic person.

559
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,160
Oh, you should talk to X, Y, Z.

560
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,600
And I'm like, Oh, okay.

561
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,880
Now I have to do this, like all of that socializing.

562
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,680
Then you, you might look around and find the perfect person.

563
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,240
And that's it.

564
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,160
Yeah, I have no idea.

565
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,400
I think that's probably not how it's typically done.

566
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,800
I can't imagine.

567
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,360
I can't imagine most people, uh, could really get much out of something like that.

568
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:29,280
No, there probably are just like, there probably are just like listings and maybe you can like check out an individual agent or like, or not.

569
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,640
Or you wouldn't, you wouldn't have an agent, like an individual agent.

570
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,200
You would probably apply to an agency and maybe they would assign you an agent that works for their agency.

571
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,160
Right.

572
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,560
Maybe you might have one dude and like, you're his responsibility or you go on his list or whatever.

573
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,560
Yeah, I don't know.

574
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,800
I don't really know how it works, but it seems like something I should have or should, I should look into getting.

575
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,280
I would like, I would like to, I would like to do work.

576
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
I would like to do productive work in my, in my field.

577
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,560
Sounds good.

578
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:17,240
It'd be cool just to like, I don't know, transcend from my shitty website that I made that sucks.

579
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,400
Sure.

580
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
And put it into places where I can get a little bit of money all the time.

581
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:31,480
Well, I don't actually know how that works, but like, the, like, I'm not generating any revenue from my comics at the moment.

582
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,560
Yeah, I get Patreon money and people like what I make.

583
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:45,000
And so they patron me, but like that's, there's no like direct link and I don't know if more comics is more better.

584
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,760
I like drawing them, so I'm going to keep doing that.

585
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,880
But God, I got to get money, got to get cash, you know.

586
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,120
I believe me, believe me, I know, I know about the need for cash.

587
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,680
Uh, I was telling, so I went, so I did Easter, right?

588
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,920
This, the Sunday was Easter.

589
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:24,440
So yesterday I went to a little, a little family get together with my parents and some of my, some of my mom's sisters and their husbands and talk to some of those guys that I haven't seen in a long time.

590
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:44,160
And I was telling one, one of them was asking what I've been up to and I started, I didn't go into huge detail about it, but I talked about Slime and Punishment and like how I'd been, I'd drawn this comic and I was hoping to kick, hoping to crowdfund and print it and make, distribute it soon.

591
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:54,200
And I mentioned that I had made a, I had mentioned that I had made a game that I had sort of like dipped my toe into game development and made a little game to go along with the comic.

592
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:00,520
And this aunt told me something that, that astounded me.

593
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,880
By the way, this is, this is not career talk, by the way, this is just an anecdote.

594
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,360
So I'm sorry if I changed the subject out from under you, if you wanted to talk about more.

595
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,680
Um, no, I can, I can talk afterwards.

596
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,400
Okay.

597
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:13,920
Sorry.

598
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,360
Um, but, but the, they told me she was like, Oh, that reminds me.

599
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:30,080
And she said, so I had this aunt, I had this aunt that died, like right around the time that I was born, this aunt died, she was like 30 and she died of leukemia.

600
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:47,720
And apparently, like before she died, she had made a little game, and this would have been in like the late eighties, she had programmed a little like game for her, for her boyfriend and this boyfriend was still like a friend of the family.

601
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,960
He still occasionally shows up to family functions.

602
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:58,240
She had made a little like choose your own adventure or a little like click through pages as like a Valentine's Day present for this boyfriend.

603
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,720
Yeah.

604
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,440
That's cute.

605
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,280
Yeah.

606
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,320
I was like, that's the cutest thing I ever heard.

607
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:10,400
And also you telling me a woman made a video game in the eight, in the eighties.

608
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,360
I couldn't make a video game in the eighties.

609
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,400
I mean, you weren't a born.

610
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:24,600
I know, I guess I feel I feel like you would have to be, I feel like you would have to be a somewhat serious like computer person.

611
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,480
Oh, you mean like in the eighties, most people didn't know what computers were.

612
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,040
Yeah, yeah.

613
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:41,960
Yeah, like today I was like, I feel like an idiot because I boot up Game Maker and like, yeah, there's tools there that I can like use to sort of design a game, but it's all shit that someone made for me, like I'm not, I'm not doing anything novel.

614
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,320
I'm just using shit that someone like laid out for for an idiot like me to use.

615
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:53,240
I feel like to do that in the eighties, you would have to like, I don't know, you would have to like put your own circuit board.

616
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,680
You have to build your own circuit board with resistors on a little cork board and like put the transistors together.

617
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,040
I don't know about quite that, but yeah, it's definitely more difficult.

618
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:19,520
I remember seeing like sketches of like Super Mario Brothers where they drew like a grid with pencil on paper and like, okay, we're going to have a, it looks like this.

619
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,600
And it's got the, they have to type in code what the squares look like and what color they are.

620
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,520
Yeah.

621
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,120
And it's like, wow, you can't just draw with a mouse.

622
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,880
What's a mouse?

623
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,440
They said.

624
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,760
Nothing.

625
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,080
It ain't nothing.

626
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
No such thing.

627
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:42,920
So anyway, I just thought that was a very cute little story, cute little, cute little thing surprised me a lot.

628
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,200
But it was true.

629
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,640
Anyway, were we talking about publishing?

630
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,600
Publishing.

631
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:50,840
Yeah.

632
00:37:50,840 --> 00:38:03,680
Well, I mean, I guess the only other thing was that like my thought process of like how I'm going to to juggle pumpkin alley and Clarissa.

633
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,480
Cause I want to get both of them done.

634
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:17,360
So I'm going to have to like seriously manage my time in the coming months, very, very sensibly and very deliberately in order to get the stuff done.

635
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,160
I don't want to get burnt out on anything.

636
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,160
I don't want to work myself to the bone so that I can't do either thing.

637
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,800
And I don't want to leave one thing for like seven months in the future.

638
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,920
I want to be getting them done at the same time.

639
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,480
Yeah.

640
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,640
And I'm not sure how that's going to work quite yet.

641
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,000
I guess I just like designate a certain day for like this or that.

642
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:58,000
So you're saying, so you're talking about on the one hand, doing like the pre-production stuff for, for pumpkin alley, like in preparation for like kickstarting the full game and also completing the Clarissa comic, right?

643
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,320
Yeah.

644
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:58,840
Or no, wait.

645
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,440
Clarissa Gunsmoke.

646
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,480
You, did you, did you finish that?

647
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:11,360
I posted what I had done for the Tezuka award thing, which was not the finished thing at the very end of that.

648
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,640
She's in prison.

649
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,920
I had written more and I had sketched like, like 35 pages after that, but I hadn't like lined them or anything.

650
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,720
I guess I blocked them out.

651
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:28,000
I didn't really sketch them, but there's like a bunch of pages left to go that I haven't drawn.

652
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And I, I would love it to be finished because I think it's very cool how it ends, like epic.

653
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,400
You might say like, like a showdown.

654
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,600
And then I would, oh, oh, I see how it is.

655
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,240
And, you know, it's just like, oh, what a great thing that nobody fucking knows at all.

656
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,040
I feel like people have sort of forgotten that I drew Clarissa Gunsmoke.

657
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,560
And they don't, it's just sort of like, oh, yeah, yeah, that thing.

658
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,680
No, it's my best thing.

659
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,040
It's my best work, but you haven't seen it yet.

660
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:14,360
So, but that would take like not so much thinking time, at least for the pages that I've already sketched.

661
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,000
I've got to, I've just got to block it out because like there's, there's, there's two types of work.

662
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,080
One's a lot, it depends on who you are, but one is more difficult than the other for me.

663
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,800
There's the creative work where you come up with everything.

664
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:40,480
And then there's the, the, the labor where you, yeah, like you zone out and you just physically move your hand around and do it.

665
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,400
Yeah.

666
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:49,120
And so I need some blocks of like creative work to, to like think how is this page going to be laid out for the rest of the pages?

667
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,840
And then the labor is just sitting down for like six hours and just drawing.

668
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,960
Yeah.

669
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:05,160
And so I want to make it so that I'm not, and then Pumpkin Alley is like a lot of creative work for the pre-production.

670
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,360
That's entirely creative work.

671
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,480
I'm coming up with everything.

672
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:18,720
So I, I don't want to be flip-flopping between creative and labor work too much because then it's like you get,

673
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,440
you get like momentum doing one type of work.

674
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,880
I think creative work is just harder in general.

675
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,600
It takes more brain cells, neurons to fire.

676
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,120
Yeah, I agree.

677
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:39,600
It's more like, yeah, like the grunt work, the like just the busy work, you can kind of just like chug away at it.

678
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,560
And it's like, yeah, whatever.

679
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,240
So I think what I want is I want to be in a position where I've done the creative work for Clarissa Gunsmoke.

680
00:41:49,640 --> 00:42:01,680
So that I can, I can, I don't know, I can do like the labor work for Clarissa Gunsmoke on one day and then the next day,

681
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,880
creative work for Pumpkin Alley or just creative work the whole time.

682
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,400
I don't really know how to properly do it.

683
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,800
I've got to look at a calendar and be like, put everything on the calendar and then say,

684
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,720
I'm going to do that on this day, hopefully.

685
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,880
It's difficult scheduling things.

686
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,240
How does one organize one's life?

687
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,240
There's like 700,000 apps for organization.

688
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,080
And I know why, because it's hard.

689
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,840
I those are both two like really long term projects.

690
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:47,240
And I understand why you would want to be like, well, I kind of want to be making progress on both at once.

691
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,560
I'm trying to, I don't have any, I don't have anything that's like that long term, like that I'm going to be working on for like a whole year,

692
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,160
like like Pumpkin Alley or whatever.

693
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,840
But or not not pump.

694
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,760
Yeah, yeah, Pumpkin Alley.

695
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,720
I'm really trying to just be like, I have a bunch of ideas for things that I should be doing.

696
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,960
I have a bunch of like plans that I've been coming up with that maybe I'll do in the next year.

697
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,240
But I'm really trying to just like cut down and focus on one thing at a time.

698
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,600
Like I was just doing the book.

699
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,440
I was like, not worried about anything else, just finishing the book.

700
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,640
But then the Tales of Gets Trolled page was like, I kind of, I have to do that now.

701
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,560
Like that can't wait.

702
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,760
So it's like, OK, I'm not working on the book at all this week.

703
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,280
I'm only doing the Tales of Gets Trolled page.

704
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,320
Now that's done.

705
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,320
So this week it's going to be just, just the book.

706
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,360
Well, except for, you know, I have to put those fucking podcast episodes up.

707
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,880
I can't wait. So I will have to do that.

708
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,600
But other than that, it'll be only the book and then it'll be just, just the book until that's done.

709
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:56,360
And then, like I said, I have some, I have some, I came up with some, not a scheme.

710
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:03,040
I came up with some, an idea and, and how do I want to say it?

711
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:10,760
I had an idea, I had an idea that I need to somewhat change the approach that I'm using

712
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,760
to my, my online presence, because I feel like I've been mostly just spinning my wheels

713
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,160
for the last, maybe a couple of years even.

714
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,120
And I think I need a new strategy.

715
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,520
And I think I've come up with some ideas for how to do that.

716
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,760
But I don't want to say what they are, but I'm not work, but I'm not.

717
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,360
I don't get it, though.

718
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,760
Yeah. Well, I'm being cagey.

719
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,880
So you mean like your approach to being an online person?

720
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,200
Yes. You're talking about your own like brand of Ben Saint?

721
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,520
Yes.

722
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,000
Okay. I don't know what you're, yeah, I guess I kind of guess.

723
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,480
No, I don't want, I don't want you to know.

724
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,080
I mean, I'll tell you, actually, I will tell you after the show.

725
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,640
I don't want to say it on the show.

726
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,760
Sure, sure.

727
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,320
Because I want, I have some things that I want to do and I think I really should do,

728
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,400
but I don't want to talk about them before they're ready because like, what's the point?

729
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,760
It's, it's, I just like, I was like, this, I don't know.

730
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,000
I have a bit, a little bit of a revelation that sort of hit me like, it's obvious.

731
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,560
Like it's actually kind of obvious.

732
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,240
It's actually kind of obvious what I should have done.

733
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,440
And it's like, well, now that I've thought of it, maybe it wouldn't even be that hard, but.

734
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,120
I've decided to change my name to the Ben guy ever.

735
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:37,560
Whatever, but anyway, the point is I had that idea, but I'm like, now's not the time.

736
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,120
Now's not the time to worry about it.

737
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,120
Got to finish the book before I think about doing that.

738
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,320
Because I don't want to put the book off anymore.

739
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,600
The book should be done.

740
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,880
And then while the Kickstarter's running, you know, maybe I'll have time to, okay,

741
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:59,720
maybe I can start like preparing for anything I want to do in relation to any of that stuff.

742
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,720
So yeah, I'm trying to really, I'm trying to really focus on some,

743
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:14,640
some particulars, but I don't expect anything, I don't expect the book to take more than

744
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,640
maybe like a month.

745
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,880
I would like to have the book ready to go and maybe, maybe I could, maybe I could do

746
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,840
the Kickstarter a month from now, I would, that would be amazing.

747
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,760
I don't know if it's realistic, but I feel like I should try.

748
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,080
Maybe that should be my sort of optimum goal.

749
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:37,120
Yeah, it's working through creative projects.

750
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,720
I sometimes get lost in like working on the one thing.

751
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,200
And then when somebody says, why do you see yourself in five years?

752
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,400
Like that sort of a question.

753
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm like, I don't fucking know, doing more of it, doing a different one.

754
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Yeah.

755
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,320
It's like, I don't know where I want to end up at all.

756
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,400
It would be nice to be like, oh, I've got a stable income now because of I released a

757
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,040
game and people like it, or like, oh, I got a comic published.

758
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:11,480
I mean, that would be a great, like end goal, but like a goal, like a big goal to have to

759
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:19,920
have a goal post to move, and like, but like, I don't know where I want to end up other

760
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,720
than that, sort of, I'm just sort of like, I'm picking one thing that I have in my head

761
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,640
and I'm like, all right, time to make this thing that was in my head for a while, a real

762
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,680
thing.

763
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,680
And there it is.

764
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,120
Then I just pick another one.

765
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:41,160
I've got, I still in my, in the back of my head, I want to, I want to do more red noir

766
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,960
and I want to tie it into slime and punishment in some funny way.

767
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,680
Oh, that would be sick.

768
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,400
It'd be sick, but it would be like a very big distraction from like bigger things that

769
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,840
are probably more of an importance for me today.

770
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:05,200
You, I hate to say it, but that's probably true as much as I, no, no, no, actually, actually,

771
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,520
after the show, let's talk about this.

772
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,320
Let me, let me explain to you why actually making, making slime and punishment adjacent

773
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:18,280
content is probably the most important thing you could be doing for your personal future.

774
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,680
I'd love to know how.

775
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,560
I have some, I have some thoughts about it.

776
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
Yeah, I'll share them with you.

777
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,520
I mean, in a way, like the Lord of Ghosts act three, which will also be a thing I'm

778
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:38,240
going to work on, will, because of all of the things it's like linked to, it will have

779
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,720
to, all right, I don't want to spoil it, but I was thinking the beginning of like the Lord

780
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:52,280
of Ghosts act three would take place in Nalakakam from the perspective of perhaps red man.

781
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,240
And then, and then the, that everyone will arrive and it'll be like, what the fuck?

782
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,640
And that'll, that'll, that'll be like the act three thing makes, makes perfect sense

783
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,760
to me.

784
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:08,520
So if red noir is going on, that could also lead into the events of Lord of Ghosts act

785
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,240
three, and it would just be a whole big fucking thing and it's like cool and based and epic

786
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,960
and like, what, wow, they're going to fight, Flowey's going to slice somebody, there's

787
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,320
the army of the dead, what are they going to do?

788
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:31,640
I have a question, I was, I was watching Oblivionfall, this was, this was after you went to bed

789
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,320
and Oblivion, it did not stream the other day, Oblivionfall played Phantom of Revenge

790
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:42,320
and, oh yes, after you went to bed, he was continuing to look for that, that elusive

791
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:50,440
eighth lizard, which he never found tragically, but he, they were looking at, there's that

792
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,080
part near the end of the game, the end of the demo area, where there's a rock on the

793
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:01,240
side of the hill and it has, it has the flower head triskelion.

794
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Yes.

795
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,440
I was going, and it made me think like, why does, is there a reason, like there's got

796
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,960
to be, like, why does he have that, why does he wear the triskelion?

797
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,080
There is a reason, but I'm not entirely sure what the reason is yet.

798
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,160
I know Flower Head's backstory, I know where he comes from and I know, like, the lore of

799
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:25,040
that location and the reason he's doing what he's doing.

800
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,640
The symbol is like, what symbol could, like, represent this thing and, like, looking at

801
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
things Celtic?

802
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,320
I was like, yeah, that's a cool, that's a cool thing.

803
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,320
Yeah.

804
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,880
The places from, also uses symbols like that, as is the extent of it, it's just, like, finding

805
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,240
a cool thing from the real world that links either thematically or, like, aesthetically

806
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,200
into, like, the fictional world that I'm building.

807
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,200
That makes sense.

808
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,560
I looked it up and I was looking through what it means and it, it had, like, it was like,

809
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,960
it can mean, like, a billion different things and I was like, okay, that doesn't tell me

810
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,960
a whole lot.

811
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,960
Yeah.

812
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,080
It's his, like, backstory iconography or it's related to, like, where he comes from.

813
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,440
That makes sense to me, yeah.

814
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,120
Really it's just that he had, in Canon's story that nobody has read, he just had, like, the

815
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,880
Scorpio sign for no reason.

816
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,480
Scorpio is, is this six and nine?

817
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,480
No, that's cancer.

818
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,480
No, that's cancer.

819
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,880
Scorpio's the VSCO one, the M with the, like, little, little, little, little, little, little,

820
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
little.

821
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,940
Tell.

822
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,800
Why did he have that?

823
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,000
Was it a risqué reference?

824
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,680
It was a risqué reference.

825
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,640
Yeah, of course.

826
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,520
It's nothing more than that.

827
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,720
Fair, fair, fair.

828
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,560
Yeah, I always forget Flowerhead was in Canon's story, Lamal.

829
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,360
Um, what are we talking about?

830
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,720
I dunno, just creative projects.

831
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:11,120
That's all I really had to say is that I want to be working on Clarissa and Pumpkin Alley,

832
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:19,800
and somehow doing both of those at the same time in a way that doesn't ruin me because

833
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:26,640
I would hate to postpone either of them, and I can postpone things like Red Noir and

834
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,920
Lord of Ghosts because they're like, what if I could get a published comic, and what

835
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,040
if I could make a real video game, like those are really cool things that I want to focus

836
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
on.

837
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,600
After I'm done fucking around with Elden Ring for another like 10 weeks.

838
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,320
Right, of course, of course, priorities.

839
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:55,280
I have some things that I have been meaning to do that I've wanted to do and I still want

840
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,040
to do for like probably the two most pressing of which would be finishing Beast Capades

841
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,160
and doing another Nuzlocke.

842
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,000
These are things that I've been saying I would do for a long time.

843
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,240
I definitely want to do those things, but you know, I have the thing I'm doing right

844
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,320
now, which is the book, and then I've had this thought about, I've had this thought

845
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:20,760
about, you know, my how to better, you know, that stuff about my brand and stuff about

846
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,600
like the direction I should be.

847
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:29,120
I've had some ideas for like how I should be spending my time as a content creator,

848
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,800
and I'm like, I think I should look into that.

849
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,400
I think I should try that for a bit, and I don't think it's going to be like, oh, well

850
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,480
now I can't do any of those other things that I want to do, but I do think I'll have to

851
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,960
be like, alright, I'll need to make one thing like a priority, and then the other things

852
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,120
will have to sort of be fit in around that.

853
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,680
I'm being so cagey.

854
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,160
I'm being so cagey just because like if my ideas don't pan out, then I don't ever have

855
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,040
to acknowledge them ever again, and no one will make fun of me because I said I was going

856
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,800
to do a thing, and then I didn't do a thing.

857
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:15,040
You're going to make a, you're going to make, you're going to like redraw Sonichu, and you're

858
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,040
going to call it Benichu.

859
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:21,800
You're going to call it, you're going to horse eat you because it's like horses.

860
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,040
I'm going to do another one of those damn, hey, I redrew Sonichu, but good, I'm going

861
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,960
to start all the way at the beginning, and I'm going to do all like 14 chapters of it,

862
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,800
and I'm sure this time, I'm sure I'll be the one that doesn't get sick of that totally

863
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:41,520
pointless process, and just the whole thing that makes my whole life.

864
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,800
No, never, never, ever again.

865
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,160
Yeah, I was telling my, that aunt I was telling about slime and punishment.

866
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,640
I was explaining to her like, yeah, I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little unsure

867
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,680
about whether I expect to make any money off it because, you know, it's the whole thing

868
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:08,040
is sort of like a big in-joke that like is really hard to understand and like nobody

869
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:17,200
knows what it is and doesn't make any sense, and it's nonsense and it sucks, but I don't

870
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
know.

871
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,560
I just got it, but I can't, I can't not sell it.

872
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,560
I can't just be like, eh, well nobody will buy it, eh, won't make any money, eh, fuck

873
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,720
it, I can't, I can't just give up on it.

874
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:32,080
I have to see it through all the way to the end, just to see what kind of numbers it does,

875
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,640
just to, just so I can tell myself, well, I did my best.

876
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,600
I mean, it's anything you do will probably do more than nothing.

877
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,560
I think, I think, yeah, I think it will sell enough to be made.

878
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:52,280
I, my, my hope, because I put more time into it than I put into like either of the Vapors

879
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,320
chapters, my, my hope is that it gives me a bigger return on investment for time spent.

880
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,440
My hope is that it makes, you know, proportionally more money than those did, basically.

881
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:08,080
If it doesn't do that, if it just does similar numbers, I will be like, I will consider

882
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,320
that somewhat of a failure.

883
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,360
But I mean, that still won't, that still won't be nothing.

884
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,040
Like that'll still be worth doing.

885
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,600
Yeah, that's, that's where it's at.

886
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,560
I just want to, I just want to get it done.

887
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,760
I really want to, I got some paper samples.

888
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,600
I got to choose cover weights.

889
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,320
The, I got to choose page, page thicknesses and stuff, pick a printer.

890
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:38,120
The reality of the situation is that I might have to change printers later on.

891
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,960
Like I might decide on a printer now and then based on the number.

892
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,080
Like if I, if I pick a printer now, I would probably pick the one that is the most cost

893
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,080
effective to print, like the minimum number.

894
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,640
Like if I set my goal, like while I want to sell 100 of them, I'll pick the printer

895
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,160
that's like the cheapest to print 100.

896
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,360
But then, you know, if it were to sell 500 copies, which would be incredible.

897
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,640
But whatever, just for example, if it does that, then I'll be like, well, okay,

898
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,520
actually at that number, there's a different printer that's a more cost

899
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,480
effective price point.

900
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,640
So I should actually switch printed.

901
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,600
So I actually probably shouldn't commit to, I'm definitely going with this printer.

902
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,320
But I want to get at least one test copy made.

903
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,920
And it's like, okay, I can't guarantee this will be the exact, like exact print

904
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,600
quality, the exact, like glossiness, the exact dimensions, but it'll be, it'll

905
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,760
basically be this.

906
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,640
And they're like, okay, this, this is the product being sold.

907
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,120
And that's hard because I got to, got to finish the page layout, got to, got

908
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,600
to pick a printer, got to pick one printer to just to make the test copy with.

909
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,960
And then got to go through whatever process it requires to have that made

910
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,600
and shipped to me.

911
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,200
And then once I have the book in front of me, be like, okay, now.

912
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:57,000
Also, I think I've been thinking, and I think that the way to do it, I think the

913
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,040
way to market the book is to make a YouTube video.

914
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,760
And I think that the YouTube video, it should be, it should be a Kickstarter

915
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,680
announcement, but maybe even more than a Kickstarter announcement.

916
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:15,120
It should be a little bit of a explanation of like what it is and like how it happened.

917
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,640
So I think I kind of want to make a little video that's more of like.

918
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,240
A trailer for a book.

919
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,400
It's not, not just a trailer.

920
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,960
I think that the video will sort of be a little story essay video that's like.

921
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,800
Oops, I accidentally made the last chapter of Sonichu.

922
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,640
Here's, here's how it happens.

923
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

924
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,040
Yeah, tying it into to that.

925
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,200
And then in that video, I will mention that, like, and it's, and I'm, you know,

926
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,520
I'm selling the book.

927
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,040
If you want to buy the book, I made a Kickstarter.

928
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,280
It's going on right now, but it'll mostly be an explanation of like how it

929
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,280
happened and what it is.

930
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,560
And maybe make, maybe try to make a little funny story out of it.

931
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,640
I think that's, I think that's the move marketing wise.

932
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,720
So that's work.

933
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,160
That's work that I don't want to do, but I guess I got to do it.

934
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,600
Haven't made a video in a while.

935
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,960
Imagine making a video.

936
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,120
Yeah.

937
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,080
Imagine scripting out a video and then editing it together.

938
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,320
Like that's something I haven't done in so long.

939
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,160
And I'm actually like dreading it and terrified of it.

940
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,400
Yeah, I haven't scripted a video in a long time.

941
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,400
I've recorded myself like the most like closest I got to making a video recently

942
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,360
was I recorded myself playing wordles where I couldn't figure out what it was.

943
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,080
And I was going to call it, I can't fucking think of the wordle.

944
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,560
Oh, that's good.

945
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,560
Hey, that's good.

946
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,920
And it, and it's mostly when I do a wordle and I was like, oh, I don't know how to do.

947
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,040
Oh, what the fuck is this?

948
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,880
And it's just like me fumbling around for like maybe five minutes, maybe 20 minutes.

949
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,240
And then I'm like, wait, yeah, I did it.

950
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,800
It's like, wait a minute, that's, that sucks.

951
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,600
I don't want to, I don't want to go to the effort of putting that in a video editor

952
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,600
and then like messing around with it and then rendering it and then uploading it.

953
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,080
I mean, it's a funny, it's a funny joke as a reference to I can't fucking

954
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,960
think of the word.

955
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:11,960
Yeah.

956
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,800
So I feel like it, I feel like the same thing could have been done.

957
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,880
Like the same content could be made in like tweets.

958
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,720
But the problem with wordle is that you can't post something the day that it's

959
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,360
the wordle you have to wait until afterwards.

960
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,800
And so like, and it's just sort of nobody posts their wordles like old ones.

961
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,000
So I feel like nobody would care in any event what happened.

962
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,720
So I might, I might, I might leave it.

963
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,600
I think it would make an okay little joke video.

964
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,480
I think it'd be fine.

965
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,000
Yeah.

966
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,200
I mean, I've recorded like five or six of them and I'm like, maybe I could put it

967
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,680
all in one big video where I can't fucking think of the word all.

968
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,320
Yeah.

969
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,400
I think that's from, from months ago.

970
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:53,920
That's good.

971
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,120
I think that's totally fair.

972
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:58,480
Yeah.

973
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:04,040
No, no sort of thing you could like, like do to keep up with the times.

974
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,120
It's just sort of some content that might be interesting later.

975
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:07,840
Sure.

976
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:08,720
Sure.

977
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,600
And what more can you, what more can you ask for?

978
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,440
Um,

979
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,160
there's a, there's a thing, there's a, there's a funny thing that happened.

980
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:22,560
I don't know.

981
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,840
I guess I should bring it up.

982
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,200
Oh, I don't, I just don't want to dwell on it too long, but did you see, uh, I

983
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,160
got in like, I got in some stupid Twitter arguments this week.

984
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,480
Oh, which ones?

985
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,640
About the VTuber.

986
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,480
Oh, yeah.

987
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:44,320
You responded to a VTuber doing some sort of parasocial relationship post.

988
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,880
Yeah, something like that.

989
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,160
And you said, this is disgusting.

990
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,880
And then you refused to elaborate and then muted her.

991
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,880
Yes, that's correct.

992
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,680
Well, I thought it was amusing.

993
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:01,640
Her fans did not think it was, her fans were angry and were like sending me like

994
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,880
threats and like sending me like gore and stuff.

995
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,200
Yeah, threats are not good.

996
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:11,080
But I just thought it was like, like, of course, somebody would not know what the

997
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,240
fuck you mean if you don't say anything.

998
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,680
You just say, fuck this.

999
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,200
Okay.

1000
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,360
Disgusting.

1001
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,760
And it's like, what the hell is that guy's problem?

1002
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,760
Like, it's just sort of like a weirdo thing to happen.

1003
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,440
Sure.

1004
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,160
But like getting threats for it is like, uh, why do you care?

1005
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,120
Why do they care?

1006
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,680
Those, her fans are the VTuber fans in general fucking suck and I hate them.

1007
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,080
I have no respect for them at all, like the hell with all of them.

1008
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,240
Like they're, they're devils, they're monsters.

1009
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:42,560
Um, but more, more than that, um, I just, she, you know, I tell, I said, like,

1010
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,920
hey, fuck this post.

1011
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,800
I, that's not what I said.

1012
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,480
I said this post is horrible.

1013
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,600
Hate this post.

1014
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,480
Horrible.

1015
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,120
Hate this post.

1016
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:49,600
I'm hated.

1017
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,160
Horrible.

1018
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:50,520
Yeah.

1019
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:50,960
That's it.

1020
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,240
Um, and she said, like, why?

1021
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,120
And like, I don't know, when I see that, she's like, why do you not like the post?

1022
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,840
And I think, and I'm like, I don't know.

1023
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,680
I just, I don't, I don't owe you an answer.

1024
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,840
I, I already don't like you.

1025
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,520
I don't like what you do on here.

1026
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:16,000
And you ask me to do the work of explaining to you why I, I, I feel this way about you.

1027
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,640
You don't, you don't deserve that.

1028
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:23,480
I'm kind of offended that you think I would waste my time explaining anything to you.

1029
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,280
No, I won't do it.

1030
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,440
I refuse.

1031
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,640
Um, so that's why I said, no, like I don't, I don't want to explain.

1032
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,680
I don't owe you an explanation.

1033
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,240
I won't do it.

1034
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,160
Um, but yeah.

1035
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:42,960
So she, she was, and then she, she screenshotted these posts and made a little post and was

1036
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,240
like, what is he's bullying me?

1037
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,840
This, this was like a, this, this girl was like a character.

1038
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,480
It was like she calls all her reply guys big brother.

1039
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,280
Like she does, like she pretends to be like a baby.

1040
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,160
She's pretends to be like your little baby sister.

1041
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,320
And like all her reply guys, no big brother, some, some idiot.

1042
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,280
Some freak in the, in the replies is like, oh, I can't believe this guy was rude to you.

1043
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,640
Should I go, should I go do a mass harassment campaign?

1044
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,680
Should I go and get all my friends to down, to downvote his video, his shitty video game

1045
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,600
that looks like shit on itch.io.

1046
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,160
Should I go to his website and fucking, should I have his YouTube channel, uh, uh,

1047
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,640
the reported for harassment?

1048
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,960
And she's like, no, no big brother.

1049
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,160
No, we can't, we can't seek to his level.

1050
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,720
We can't be like him.

1051
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,520
I'll be okay.

1052
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,240
I promise, I promise big brother, I'll survive.

1053
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,320
I have nothing but disdain for all these people.

1054
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,200
But so that, that's what she did.

1055
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,760
And so then I was like, well, OK, she made it public.

1056
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,320
So I made a little post that was like, I just called it gross.

1057
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,440
By the way, I haven't even said what the post was.

1058
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,560
I haven't even explained what the post was for the audience.

1059
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,640
The post in question, it was a meme.

1060
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,560
And it said that it was just a picture of her character.

1061
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:04,160
And it said, um, normalize having a comfort VTuber instead of a comfort person.

1062
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,160
And I thought, what is a comfort person?

1063
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,560
Anyway, well, that's the thing.

1064
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,280
I turned out to be a little bit wrong, because what I thought that a comfort

1065
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,560
person is like someone that you like take comfort in, like, like, like a friend.

1066
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,320
Right.

1067
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,960
So I was like, so I was like relationships with VTubers over having friends.

1068
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,400
That's what you thought they were saying.

1069
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
Something like that.

1070
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,040
And I was like, that's like, fuck, like, fuck this.

1071
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:32,800
This is weird.

1072
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,760
Like, shut up.

1073
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,600
Uh, yeah.

1074
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,160
It's like, it's like, oh, put your, put your emotional, put your emotional

1075
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,840
burdens on VTubers, rely on, on VTubers.

1076
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,680
OK, there's actually a lot.

1077
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,000
There's a lot here to talk about.

1078
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,160
Because, yes, if, if that is what it was saying, it would be an

1079
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:57,840
unacceptably, like, cloying, like, call to parasociality, like, and that would

1080
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,440
be disgusting, and I would hate it.

1081
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,080
So that's what I was initially responding to.

1082
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,160
It turns out it's a little bit different, because I guess what a comfort

1083
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,800
person is, is not like a friend.

1084
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:14,040
It's like a, like a celebrity or someone that you, like, see and feel good.

1085
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,360
A non-VTuber, parasocial relationship.

1086
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,920
It's like, it's like a comfort character, but it's a, yes.

1087
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,240
Yes, it's a not yes.

1088
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,520
So it's, so it's a little different.

1089
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,640
It's not saying replace your real life attachments with VTuber attached.

1090
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,880
It's not quite that bad.

1091
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:35,160
But still, but still, it's a post celebrating, you know, I feel like I

1092
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,680
was misunderstood a little bit, because my problem, like, yes, it is parasocial

1093
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,880
and that's, and that's lame and whatever, but that's not really why I

1094
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,720
didn't like it, because it, because lots of things are parasocial.

1095
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,480
And I don't think, I don't think that a parasocial relationship is in

1096
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,600
and of itself bad or harmful.

1097
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,360
Like it's okay to like a YouTuber.

1098
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,040
It's okay to like a VTuber or to watch them and have an opinion about them.

1099
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,080
And that's a parasocial relationship.

1100
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,640
And that's not wrong or bad in and of itself.

1101
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,960
So it's not, it's not just, a lot of people seem to think that I was just

1102
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,560
saying, oh, this is encouraging parasocial relationships and that's bad.

1103
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,800
And it's more than that.

1104
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:21,440
What, what bugs me about it, because I see VTuber posts on the Endless War

1105
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:27,080
RFCK account on Twitter, I followed a couple of slime themed VTubers just

1106
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,200
because I thought it was funny.

1107
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,720
And now all I see when I log into that account is recommended tweets from

1108
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:38,720
VTubers and they're all, not all, but lots and lots of them have this attitude.

1109
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:45,400
It reminds me a lot of the attitude of, it's like the attitude of the

1110
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:50,440
Baroni analysis community that was all like really into the specific thing

1111
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:54,360
they were doing and they were all just really like focused on this.

1112
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,200
Isn't it cool that we all review my little pony?

1113
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,200
Isn't it cool that we like, look at this, this community that we've built.

1114
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,480
Oh, we all support each other.

1115
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,480
We're all going to upvote each other's videos.

1116
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,120
We're all going to like each other's videos.

1117
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,280
We're all going to make it.

1118
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,960
We're all going to make it guys.

1119
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,040
It really reminds me in a lot, in a lot of ways of like the NFT space where

1120
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,040
everybody's got a fucking ape, everyone's talking about how great their

1121
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:22,240
apes are, everyone's hyping up their apes because they've, because they've

1122
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:26,960
invested, you know, financially or emotionally into this thing.

1123
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:31,640
And they're all there to hype each other up and get engagement from one another

1124
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,880
because they all, they need to feel like this thing they're doing is important.

1125
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,520
And they're all there to hype it to themselves and to one another.

1126
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,600
And they're all there just like, whew, whipping themselves into like a VTubing

1127
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,880
is the wave of the future.

1128
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,600
V, it's VTubing is the fucking, this is the most important thing in the fucking

1129
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,200
world.

1130
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:54,640
I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's the attitude that I, that I see a lot.

1131
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,240
And it really annoys me.

1132
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,880
Isn't that like content creators largely?

1133
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah.

1134
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,120
And whatever like theme or like genre they're in.

1135
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:04,800
Yeah.

1136
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:09,520
I'm not saying it's exclusive to the, it's, it's a thing.

1137
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,720
It's a thing, comics too.

1138
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:17,480
Like when I would go on like the Topastic forums and see like, you know,

1139
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,640
these small comic creators with no, no audience at all, just like all posting to

1140
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:27,520
each other about their, their stuff, asking each other questions about like,

1141
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,040
how do you like to write, you know, your protagonist?

1142
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,000
Like, what's your favorite ship dynamic or whatever?

1143
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,160
They're all talking about, it's fine.

1144
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,520
Like it's fine, I guess.

1145
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,480
This, the, I don't know, this, the attitude of like this, like, they're all being, you

1146
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,400
got to be really positive.

1147
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,040
We're all, we're all posting about whatever, whatever the interest is, whatever

1148
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,120
the field is, like we're all here, we're all posting about it.

1149
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,800
We're all being really positive about it.

1150
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,800
Because we all, we're all hyping each other up.

1151
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,520
Like we're all, none of us are getting anything out of it, right?

1152
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,520
Like the people that do these kinds of posts, they're not successful.

1153
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,720
They're, they're, they're, they're low on the totem pole.

1154
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,320
And they're there because they, they need to convince themselves.

1155
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:13,160
They need to have the sense of community that, oh, sure, I'm not getting anything

1156
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,600
out of this, even though it's an interest of mine.

1157
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:22,080
But, you know, everybody else is also not getting anything, we're all kind of here.

1158
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,480
It's a community, we're doing, it's for the community.

1159
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,840
Uh, I'm not successful as a VTuber.

1160
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,200
I'm not, like, I don't have a big audience.

1161
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,680
I'm not making any money at it.

1162
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:36,080
It is just like a big sink for me, but we have a community and all

1163
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,960
my other VTuber friends are the same.

1164
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,840
We're all just fucking, fucking around and floundering and not getting anything out of it.

1165
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,680
But we're having fun in its community.

1166
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,880
You're saying that they're coping?

1167
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,800
I'm saying it's, it's coping.

1168
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,520
And it, and it's like, that's, that's what's unappealing to you is that they're,

1169
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,280
they're not actually successful, but they're positive about what's going on.

1170
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,200
It's part of it.

1171
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,280
That's part of it.

1172
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
But it, it, I feel like it exists.

1173
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,320
I feel like the attitude, the attitude, I feel like it's an attitude that

1174
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,560
benefits those at the top.

1175
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:13,840
It's an attitude that is like this thing we're doing, this, this field that we're

1176
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,720
all engaged in is important and let's, let's hype it up.

1177
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,560
But the, but like, but they don't benefit from that hype.

1178
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,600
They, they keep themselves engaged in it, but like the, the, only the people that

1179
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,520
are already, the people that are already popular are going to stay popular.

1180
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,760
Everybody's, all right.

1181
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,080
VTubers want to be popular.

1182
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,160
They want to have an audience.

1183
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:34,840
That's what they want.

1184
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,840
That's why they're doing it.

1185
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,760
It's, it's, there'd be no reason to do it unless they wanted attention.

1186
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,640
They want engagement.

1187
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,960
They want an audience and, and they're all, but they're, they're, I feel like

1188
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,280
they're, when they post like this, their audience is each other.

1189
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:53,480
They're, they're appealing to each other and convincing one another about like,

1190
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,880
yes, our feelings are valid.

1191
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,200
We are all going to make it in this VTuber space and we're going to do that.

1192
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,160
And we're going to do that.

1193
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:05,640
It's like shout out, like, where are all my fellow, like male VTubers, all my

1194
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,480
fellow male VTubers, we're all going to follow each other.

1195
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:11,600
Everybody, like, like post below so I can find you and I can follow you.

1196
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,160
That's what you do.

1197
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,080
When you're a VTuber, you post a thing that's like, Hey, where are all my X

1198
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,440
adjective VTubers, uh, uh, post below so I can follow you.

1199
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,040
And the, and I think the unspoken implication there is that you hope

1200
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,640
that they will also follow you back.

1201
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:34,360
And it's, it's just this big incestuous slurry to take a phrase from Homestuck.

1202
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,640
They're all just, they're all just people with no audience, just watching

1203
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,280
each other, trying to get each other to watch each other.

1204
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,440
I don't know, man.

1205
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:49,360
That this is, this is, I, I, I can understand that that is a thing.

1206
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:49,960
Yeah.

1207
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,200
I could, I could see, I can, I can see that.

1208
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,960
I don't know why it makes you so mad though.

1209
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,520
I just would be like, eh, they're not going anywhere like that.

1210
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,880
They got to like think differently.

1211
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,400
And then I just move on.

1212
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,240
I don't really think about them.

1213
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,920
Yeah, like, you see, it benefits those at the top.

1214
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:13,520
I don't really get how exactly if they're all just incestuous in their little group.

1215
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,200
Are they, are they building like a bedrock of like, of VTuber in the public

1216
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,280
consciousness that is benefiting the VTubers that already, already exist?

1217
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,160
Or are they having no effect at all?

1218
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,600
Cause I feel like it's, it's the, it may be the other way around that the big VTubers

1219
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,160
are, are giving them hope that they can do something.

1220
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,760
It just isn't doing anything for them.

1221
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,320
I don't know.

1222
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,560
Maybe it's both.

1223
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,280
Maybe it's neither.

1224
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:51,480
I mean, it's just, maybe it's just a feeling I have.

1225
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,120
Maybe it's not even real.

1226
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,520
Maybe it's just a phantasm.

1227
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,720
Maybe you want to be a VTuber.

1228
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,520
Maybe that's what this is all about.

1229
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,760
I don't know.

1230
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:00,600
Okay.

1231
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:06,240
Ever since you saw the red man VTubing model, you were like, damn, I want that.

1232
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,720
I want that for me.

1233
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:08,520
Okay.

1234
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,640
Well, even, even if they're a little bit incoherent, I've explained how I feel about

1235
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,800
posts of this kind.

1236
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,880
That's, that's why they annoyed me for all those reasons.

1237
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,880
Parasocials thing.

1238
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,320
It's, it's cloying.

1239
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,120
It's like, it's sort of, I don't know.

1240
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:30,240
It's sort of something about it to put one final, it's like, it's like, it's a little dishonest.

1241
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,440
It feels, it, these posts feel to me like they're presented

1242
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,280
neutrally.

1243
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:40,480
But when you make them, when you post about something like that, like, replace, replace

1244
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,120
replace, replace something else in your life with VTubers.

1245
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,800
It's like, you're, you're, you're asking me for something.

1246
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,560
You're posting this as though it's about VTubers in general, as though it's about some

1247
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,200
general thing, but it's about you.

1248
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,080
What you actually want is for me to do it with you, but you won't say that.

1249
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,400
I don't know.

1250
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,640
So I don't like it.

1251
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,240
I didn't like it.

1252
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,400
I called it bad, whatever.

1253
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,680
Her fans went in apeshit in my comments, sent me gore, whatever.

1254
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,280
A couple of people that followed me said that I was being a big meanie.

1255
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,400
Ben, you're being too mean.

1256
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,480
Ben, you've crossed the line.

1257
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,480
Ben, you're a big jerk.

1258
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:23,200
And I think those people are confused because I've been way meaner

1259
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,280
and I've been way more problematic and said more offensive things on Twitter.

1260
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:33,160
To Trixie and, and like, to trick, if you're just worried about the meanest,

1261
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,840
then, yeah, I've been way meaner to Trixie.

1262
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:40,040
If you're worried about me being like, you know, unfair or or cruel or whatever,

1263
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,800
there was that time that I got mad at that black person for saying not to

1264
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,600
draw us off a certain way.

1265
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,240
I think I was a little unreasonable in that situation.

1266
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,280
So so I've so I don't know why this would be this particular one.

1267
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,480
It's just sort of baffling.

1268
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,000
It's not exactly a bad thing.

1269
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,760
It's just sort of like, man, you're you really hate VTubers, Ben.

1270
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,400
I don't. I don't hate VTubers.

1271
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,200
I truly swear to God, I don't hate what you hate that thing that you saw.

1272
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,400
I swear to God, it's not it's not that I have a problem with VTubers

1273
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,040
in specific for any reason.

1274
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,760
It's just this is the thing that some of them do and it's an attitude that I hate.

1275
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,400
And they're not the only ones to do it.

1276
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:24,360
But the was it going to say, yeah, I genuinely think that some of the

1277
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,680
reaction that some people had that were not even fans of this person,

1278
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,400
they just saw this reaction and were like, Ben,

1279
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,080
this is not OK.

1280
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,800
I genuinely think some of them, their lizard brain neurons were activated

1281
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,920
by the fact that this person posts in character like roleplays as a baby.

1282
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,960
Like they reacted as though they thought I was like attacking an actual baby.

1283
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,320
Like maybe intellectually, they know that this is not a baby,

1284
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,600
but they sort of treated it as though I was like beating up

1285
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:57,080
like an actual like small girl child instead of like an adult

1286
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:02,480
who's like roleplaying this, this, this creepy like I'm being bullied,

1287
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,480
big help me.

1288
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,200
So, yeah, as always, I have no respect for those that disagree with me.

1289
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,480
My enemies are all ontologically evil.

1290
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,160
Sounds reasonable.

1291
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,800
But the odd thing is, right?

1292
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,320
So this was this was a bit of a Twitter kerfuffle.

1293
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,720
There was a bit of an argument about it, a bit of a debate happened.

1294
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,320
Whatever, who cares?

1295
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,560
But then, and I don't want to dwell on this too much,

1296
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,680
but a couple of people who I would have considered to be my actual friends

1297
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,920
in real life, a couple of them decided that they hate me now

1298
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,920
and they're not my friends anymore and they like and they've disowned me over it.

1299
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,080
If you can if you can believe that.

1300
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,840
So, yeah, these these people who had been my my friends for years

1301
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,520
suddenly decided that I'm bad and they hate me

1302
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:02,400
and they and they they joined they joined like a new server

1303
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,920
devoted deliberately specifically to to attack me.

1304
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,520
And they started spreading

1305
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,280
they started spreading completely spurious

1306
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,960
lies and accusations and just totally fabricated

1307
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,160
criminally pseudo criminal allegations

1308
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:26,920
against myself and other friends of mine, based in no facts whatsoever.

1309
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,280
So this is just what so I so I found this.

1310
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,640
So I found this to be a very surprising reaction

1311
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:41,000
to me being sort of rude to a stranger on Twitter, like somewhat rude,

1312
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,800
maybe a bit uncalled for idly mean.

1313
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,840
Yeah, I feel like it must have been like that.

1314
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,400
There was something brewing.

1315
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,720
I agree. That's what I was going to say.

1316
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,920
I think this this is this must have been some some

1317
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,600
something was percolating under the surface for a while there.

1318
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,560
And this is just the the the moment that that brought it out.

1319
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,680
I don't think I would.

1320
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,280
I don't think I would actually lose a friendship over something so stupid.

1321
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,920
But so that was like a big thing for me this week is like a lot.

1322
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,320
Actually, it really bugged me because for a couple of days there

1323
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,640
in the wake of this stupid in the stupid VTuber Twitter drama

1324
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:24,200
and this weird fallout with these people, I was like kind of

1325
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,600
sort of fixated on this drama and on like these like, you know,

1326
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,120
these lies that were being told about me and people around me.

1327
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,440
And I was kind of had to like think about that.

1328
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,440
And it almost made me late for my stupid.

1329
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:43,080
Tales gets trolled, a guest page, but it worked.

1330
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,080
It worked out OK.

1331
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,960
Phew. Yeah, kind of my fault,

1332
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,160
because I didn't start working on it early enough.

1333
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,920
But yeah, I don't know.

1334
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,280
It's a bunch of bullshit, a bunch of that bullshit happened to me this week.

1335
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,840
It was a bit of a bummer.

1336
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,320
But, you know what, these people will get through it.

1337
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,280
I mean, the PCP has survived.

1338
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,440
PCP more dangerous bombardments than such such as that.

1339
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,440
Oh, speaking of speaking of.

1340
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,360
Do you see what released on the PCP channel yesterday?

1341
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,000
Oh, yeah, we should definitely talk about this.

1342
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:31,320
Yeah, although I did not watch it because I'm I'm scared of cringing too hard.

1343
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,880
I also had to kind of I didn't want I didn't watch.

1344
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,480
I saw it. I skipped through parts of it.

1345
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,240
I didn't want to watch my own part.

1346
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,600
I don't want to see it.

1347
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,840
So embarrassing.

1348
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:49,240
I feel very validated that some people said my and Munchie's verse was like the best.

1349
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,200
I remember.

1350
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,680
I worked hard making that sound pretty good or like like right rhythmically.

1351
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,240
I was thinking rhythmically.

1352
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:00,760
I remember liking I can't like like I can't actually rap.

1353
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,360
But like, I think I think I wrote something pretty good.

1354
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:04,960
I did not.

1355
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,520
I think I wrote like the first line of mine.

1356
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,400
And then and then I couldn't think of anything.

1357
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,920
So Trixie wrote my verse and that's why it's bad.

1358
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,280
My verse is bad, but it's because Trixie wrote it for me.

1359
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,000
But I mean, the asterisk on that is like,

1360
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,560
I'm sure it would have been even worse if I had written it.

1361
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,320
So, yeah, I mean, I remember distinctly, we were like,

1362
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,320
all right, we got to we got to do the we got to film the rap

1363
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:30,640
because it's going to be good weather today.

1364
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,720
And then we're going to have to do the OVA tomorrow.

1365
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,240
And then the good weather is over.

1366
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,880
Yeah. And we were all rushing.

1367
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:39,720
And I think we were just sitting around waiting for you to write your verse.

1368
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,200
Yeah, I had a pen and pencil and paper.

1369
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,000
I was like, just sat around like all morning just staring at a blank page.

1370
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,280
Just being like, I can't I can't think of anything.

1371
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,000
And Trixie eventually was just like, OK, here, you want me to write it for you?

1372
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,040
I was like, yeah, fine, just just write something.

1373
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,200
And then it was kind of dumb.

1374
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,240
But I was like, it's better than nothing.

1375
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,280
It's better than what I was going to get.

1376
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,080
So, OK, I'll do it.

1377
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,360
Yeah.

1378
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,280
Rack on four, baby.

1379
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,280
The ride never ends.

1380
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,360
It'll never end.

1381
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,080
It'll never end. Two years.

1382
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,000
There's still 2020 in March.

1383
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,160
Still the 2020 will never go away.

1384
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:23,840
The last.

1385
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,960
Yeah. So this video was one of there's one more video that needs to come out

1386
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,440
and it's the OVA, which we have.

1387
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:35,280
So we put we spent real money.

1388
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,680
We spent real money on like producing the OVA.

1389
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,680
Yeah. So I'll be funny when it comes out.

1390
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,920
At this point, it's just hilarious to me.

1391
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,560
Like if these people still are actually coming out.

1392
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,080
Yeah, I mean, it's better like at any point.

1393
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,200
You know, better late than never.

1394
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,560
I mean, I saw a comment on the thing saying, why now?

1395
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,480
And I'm like, OK, yeah, why?

1396
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,920
Why are you suggesting that we should simply never do it?

1397
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,320
Yeah, we got to do it.

1398
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,760
Yeah, we have to do it.

1399
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:18,600
They have to be made if only so that we could say we could put the whole thing to rest.

1400
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,480
You know what that is?

1401
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,800
That's the kind of cowardly attitude.

1402
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,960
That's a cowardly, trixy attitude.

1403
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,120
That's a kind of like, yeah, I promised I'd do a thing.

1404
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,800
Yeah, I took money for a thing, but it's been a while and I haven't done it.

1405
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,320
So nobody cares and whatever.

1406
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,000
I don't have to actually do it.

1407
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,720
It's fine. I'll just pocket it.

1408
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,680
Whatever. Fuck you. Fuck you, fan.

1409
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,280
Die. You love it.

1410
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,680
You love Radcon four.

1411
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,960
Everybody loves Radcon four.

1412
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,200
We're going to make it trend in twenty twenty three.

1413
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,160
Yeah, absolutely.

1414
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,480
When in twenty twenty three, when the OVA comes out.

1415
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:00,800
I'm I'm hoping that it won't take too long.

1416
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,320
Also, the dojin, I know.

1417
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,120
I have not. I have still not heard any word from

1418
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:14,680
Kaiju, Kaiju about him having a time available to do that.

1419
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,480
So I don't know.

1420
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,600
I'm still hopeful that that can happen.

1421
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,480
I just I don't know.

1422
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,720
Kaiju is a hard worker.

1423
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,400
Kaiju is the problem is not and not a flake.

1424
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,040
So it will eventually happen.

1425
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,320
It just might not take a while, I think.

1426
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,520
Kaiju is not flaked.

1427
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,680
Kaiju told me I'd love to do it, but I am very busy.

1428
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,760
I will do it if I can find the time.

1429
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,920
And I said, OK, and, you know, he's he's got other things to do.

1430
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,520
And he just has not been able to do it.

1431
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,680
And I mean, that's what I said when I when I agreed to hit with that.

1432
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,200
I made I agreed with that possibility.

1433
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,640
I would I mean, I would be open.

1434
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,120
He said, like, you know, it might be easier if you find someone else.

1435
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,360
I would I would do that.

1436
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,320
I would be OK with letting someone else do.

1437
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,800
I would just need to see their style

1438
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,120
and like know that they are going to do something good.

1439
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:12,400
And I don't know anyone else who I who I don't know anyone else off the top

1440
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:17,800
of my head or who has the right style and the right, you know.

1441
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,280
If someone if I if someone were to, say,

1442
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,960
at me on Twitter or DM me or something on Discord with an artist recommendation,

1443
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:32,120
it's like maybe this guy kind of has the sort of, you know,

1444
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:36,000
black and white kind of classic anime mango look that you're looking for.

1445
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,040
I would be willing to consider alternatives.

1446
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:41,160
In fact, I think Kaiju would would understand.

1447
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,760
He's told me this, in fact,

1448
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,240
if anyone knows anyone who they think would be a good fit for the.

1449
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,280
I mean, please tell me, I just don't know anyone.

1450
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:54,640
I've looked around on Twitter, but I didn't find anyone who exactly

1451
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,720
matched what I was looking for.

1452
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,280
I mean, there's so many artists.

1453
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,640
I'm sure there's somebody out there.

1454
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,720
I just I just don't know him.

1455
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,720
Help me. OK. Help, help, help.

1456
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,760
I actually kind of think somebody needs to help me.

1457
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,960
Because I have money.

1458
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,520
I have money to pay the artist who eventually does that.

1459
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:22,160
I just need to find someone who will do it.

1460
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,080
I'm I'm I'm mad.

1461
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,520
I'm still mad about that other guy, that other guy, that other guy

1462
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,320
just disappeared and he is still not he is still not returned.

1463
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:37,000
He is still not posted anything anywhere, except on

1464
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:41,800
not my anime list, but that but that anime website.

1465
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,480
What are you saying?

1466
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,400
I was thinking, have you maybe asked

1467
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,280
Maryweather if they know anyone?

1468
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,240
Oh, my God.

1469
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:01,400
You know, Maryweather does, you know, lots of anime style people, you know.

1470
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,320
You know, it didn't it didn't even occur to me.

1471
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,400
It didn't even occur to me, but.

1472
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,760
He might know, actually, he might know someone.

1473
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,560
Yeah, although demo, I wonder how much.

1474
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,600
I mean, his artists are some of his his artists are like big.

1475
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,480
Some of his like 100 100 K follower artists on Twitter

1476
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,840
that like draw his stuff sometimes.

1477
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:32,440
So some of them might be expensive, but they might be.

1478
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,960
I mean, they might be expensive.

1479
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,280
They might know other people.

1480
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:38,080
I think it's just sort of hmm.

1481
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,720
It's it's a good avenue to look at.

1482
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,920
It's actually a great idea.

1483
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,520
You know, he he messaged me.

1484
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:48,120
He messaged me just just like last week.

1485
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,520
Just to see how I was doing, actually, like just to check in on me.

1486
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,200
That's nice.

1487
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:56,800
It is nice.

1488
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,080
I it's it's it's funny, I don't know.

1489
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,840
I it's it's it's it's nice.

1490
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,520
It's nice because like I have like nothing.

1491
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,960
I have like nothing to offer that guy.

1492
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,280
There's no there's nothing he could possibly want from me.

1493
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,320
I can't be suspicious of like any ulterior motive.

1494
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,880
I guess he just I guess he's just.

1495
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,360
Wants to be I guess he's just my friends, which is a nice thing.

1496
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,160
But what what a guy.

1497
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:29,520
Yeah, maybe you should ask him about that.

1498
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,280
He would he would he would be a guy.

1499
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,560
He would be a guy to know about that.

1500
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,600
OK, yeah, there's an idea.

1501
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,920
Still still if anyone has any recommendations,

1502
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,880
I mean, feel feel free to message me about him because I would.

1503
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,680
Like to see options.

1504
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,360
I don't know.

1505
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:55,520
OK, OK, OK, Nate is to do the OVA.

1506
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:01,360
Yeah, and then that'll be the entire thing completely done

1507
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,120
after the after the dojin, yeah, the OVA and the dojin.

1508
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,520
And then we get our and then we get our radical money.

1509
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,720
Truly the longest wait.

1510
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,920
Yeah, it'll it'll partially make up for

1511
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:20,720
for missing for missing out on that on that March Patreon money.

1512
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,320
Yeah, Nate's I've been talking to him about it.

1513
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,680
There's still Radcon for money just in a pile,

1514
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,360
just waiting to be waiting for everything to be completed so we can all just get it.

1515
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,320
I mean, you need to fund Radcon five.

1516
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:45,040
If we were if we were Trixie, if Trixie had the money, Trixie would have just said,

1517
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,320
it's been like it's been a while since the Radcon.

1518
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,320
Never mind. We just won't do it.

1519
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,280
I'll just take it. I'll just take it.

1520
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,760
I'll just take the money and spend it.

1521
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,680
And then I'll say and then when someone says, hey, Trixie,

1522
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,560
what about all that content that was promised to be delivered over the money?

1523
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,680
She'd say, oh, well, you know, I actually couldn't do that

1524
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,800
because I just spend it on like my food and house.

1525
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,240
I just spend it on my personal expenses, you know, sorry.

1526
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,080
But, you know, that's that's just content creation.

1527
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,800
You know, that's just what it's like.

1528
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,200
That's what it's like to be popular on YouTube.

1529
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,280
You just take money from people and just spend it on whatever.

1530
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,800
And then you say, ah, well, I spent it all so I can't do it.

1531
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,600
You see. Oh, I hate it.

1532
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,920
And I hate you. I know all too well.

1533
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,800
Not, not you, Gib.

1534
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,360
I hate you, random commenter that implicitly agreed with that attitude.

1535
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:35,040
Why? Why now? Why now?

1536
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:38,080
Sh, shut the fuck up, you coward.

1537
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,720
You're a fucking coward. You know that?

1538
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,720
You're a, you're a quitter.

1539
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,680
I'll never quit.

1540
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,720
That's true.

1541
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,440
OK, what do you think?

1542
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,200
Um, yeah, I got nothing else to talk about.

1543
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:00,160
Yeah, you want to go voicemails?

1544
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,040
Yes, that's all right.

1545
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,160
What's voicemail? Let's voicemail.

1546
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,000
Yeah, we got. OK, it looks like the.

1547
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,720
Oh, my God, it's a number of pages.

1548
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,640
There's two and a half pages.

1549
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,640
Looks like the first one here is this is this vocaru.

1550
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,280
All right. All right.

1551
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,120
Three, two, one, go.

1552
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,160
Just like in Marvel Cinematic Universe, there exists a lot of parallel worlds

1553
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,360
similar to ours in some ways, but radically different in others.

1554
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,640
Today, we will look at one such world.

1555
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,920
Welcome to the Twilight Zone.

1556
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,040
I am supposed to be taking a break.

1557
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,680
I am supposed to be taking a break.

1558
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,800
Instead, I'm working.

1559
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,720
I'm doing something.

1560
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,640
I'm sending taxes.

1561
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,520
Sending taxes.

1562
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,400
I am a cool guy.

1563
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,360
I am a godlike.

1564
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,120
I've got a deadline already done it.

1565
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,360
Hello, this is the workaholic podcast,

1566
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,920
and I am your host, the most masculine and manly man of all men, Gorilla Gifts.

1567
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:16,000
And today we are joined by the creator of the hit indie game of 2016.

1568
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:20,680
Hyper Light Drifter, the most feminine woman of all women who never drinks

1569
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,920
sparkling water, Jane Devil.

1570
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,680
Unfortunately, Tommy Oliver, the healthiest person who has ever lived,

1571
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:34,320
has died when selecting best voicemails, so he won't be joining us today.

1572
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,240
I am kidding.

1573
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,480
Tom will never die.

1574
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,240
Not in this world, not in any of it.

1575
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,680
I like that that's a universal constant.

1576
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:45,800
Let's start as usual from crowning the voicemail that our commenters decided

1577
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,040
was the best in the previous episode.

1578
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,160
Welcome, the Twilight Sparkle.

1579
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,040
Oh, thank you.

1580
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,800
Thank you, Jane.

1581
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,400
I must ask, did you receive my email?

1582
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:02,800
Yes, we have reviewed your CV and we accept you.

1583
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,880
Welcome to the workaholic podcast.

1584
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,680
But this is only one of the possibilities.

1585
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,760
I will see you next time in the Twilight Zone.

1586
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:15,920
Wouldn't that be fun?

1587
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:22,160
Twilight Sparkle joined the workaholics podcast.

1588
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,360
That would that would ruin everything as far as I'm concerned.

1589
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,920
I would quit watching.

1590
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:31,160
I would cancel my subscription on Hulu.

1591
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,160
OK, yeah.

1592
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:40,080
I like how everything was the opposite, except Tom still never dies.

1593
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:45,080
Oh, Oblivionfall is.

1594
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,080
Hmm.

1595
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:53,080
Oblivionfall is posting some posting some cringe.

1596
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,080
This must be.

1597
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,080
Oh, this was his.

1598
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:05,080
Oh, I think it was his friend Twi-Pi from the stream said that they were drawing Virginia.

1599
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,080
And I guess this must be those Virginia.

1600
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,080
Oh, they're very.

1601
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,080
Why does she have a cock?

1602
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,080
Why does she have a glowing green cock?

1603
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,080
Yeah.

1604
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,080
I mean, why not?

1605
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,080
You could.

1606
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,080
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

1607
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,080
You could reform it using slime.

1608
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,080
Damn.

1609
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,080
Sure.

1610
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,080
Yeah.

1611
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,080
Well.

1612
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,080
No, Virginia, stop fucking that sexy lady.

1613
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,080
I want to fuck that sexy.

1614
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,080
Get off her.

1615
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,080
Let me let me at it, please.

1616
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:40,080
Oh, she's got the she's got the horrifying, the horrifying utter, utter boobs.

1617
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,080
Crotch tits.

1618
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,080
Yeah, the crotch tits that I just my favorite.

1619
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,080
What reaction, Emote?

1620
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,080
OK, here we go.

1621
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,080
An exclamation point and a little phantom horn looking on in approval.

1622
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:01,080
I think that's, I think that's what we're going to be, we're going to be dealing with.

1623
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:05,080
Nice, nice glowing nipples, Virginia.

1624
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,080
You, you nailed it.

1625
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,080
You hit it out of the park.

1626
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,080
All right, we can't show that.

1627
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:16,080
No, we can't show that on the podcast, so we're not going to dwell on it anymore.

1628
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,080
OK, here's a next voicemail is an image.

1629
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,080
Oh, it's the workaholic podcast.

1630
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:30,080
The workaholics podcast, Jane Devil and Gorilla Give.

1631
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,080
These are cool.

1632
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,080
Yeah.

1633
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,080
Deep symbolism of the egg.

1634
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,080
Yep.

1635
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,080
What's that?

1636
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,080
She says that.

1637
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,080
Oh, deep.

1638
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,080
Yeah, that's what.

1639
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,080
Yeah.

1640
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,080
Yeah.

1641
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,080
All right.

1642
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,080
Good, good thing.

1643
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,080
All right.

1644
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,080
Next.

1645
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,080
Next voicemail is called.

1646
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:56,080
Trixie admits she's stupid in recent stream.

1647
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,080
Bird agrees.

1648
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,080
Okay.

1649
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,080
Three, two, one, go.

1650
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,080
You were up to and saw you were streaming.

1651
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,080
Didn't know you rebranded.

1652
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,080
Welcome back.

1653
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,080
And yeah, the rebranding effort.

1654
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,080
It complicated matters.

1655
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:12,080
Not a lot of people really understand what happened or.

1656
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:23,080
So I made this mistake when I rebranded of taking down all of my older videos and then telling people to re upload them and make archives.

1657
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,080
Yeah, that was a bad idea.

1658
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,080
Yep.

1659
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:33,080
It's almost it's almost like everything that I said that made her so mad that she rage quit the podcast and swore me off forever.

1660
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:37,080
It's almost like everything that I said that made her do that was exactly right.

1661
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,080
Almost.

1662
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,080
Almost.

1663
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,080
You might.

1664
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:46,080
I mean, that's one way to interpret the situation.

1665
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,080
Next.

1666
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,080
Next voicemail is called.

1667
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:53,080
Trixie still desperately tries to justify keeping a studio.

1668
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,080
Three, two, one, go.

1669
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:58,080
Are you going to stick to your studio brand?

1670
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,080
IMO as a current fan.

1671
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:03,080
I consider it to not be a very memorable, identifiable moniker for your work, both individually and as a collective.

1672
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:07,080
I feel like a specific name is a lot better than blank studio, which feels more general, but it's supposed to feel general.

1673
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,080
It's supposed to feel like a studio name.

1674
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,080
I'm not supposed to feel like the name from my content.

1675
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,080
I'm Trixie the Golden Witch.

1676
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,080
The ex-studio is the ex-studio.

1677
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:18,080
You know, I understand where you're coming from.

1678
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,080
I don't think YouTube names matter very much at all.

1679
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:25,080
If you look at popular YouTube channels, a lot of them have nonsense names, stuff that just doesn't mean anything.

1680
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,080
Like people aren't looking at the name of the channel except to figure out what it like.

1681
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,080
The only reason my name is confusing specifically is that I had a different name, you know.

1682
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,080
And so it's like, what the hell is this?

1683
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,080
People show up like literally what the fuck is the ex-studio?

1684
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,080
I don't know who this is or what this is.

1685
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:40,080
But like, you know, if the channel had always been called ex-studio, nobody would be questioning it.

1686
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,080
I don't think it would have had a harder time getting popular.

1687
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,080
Yeah, that's their point.

1688
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,080
You changed the name.

1689
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:50,080
It does hurt my YouTube SEO for me to have changed the channel name, but that would have happened no matter what I changed it to.

1690
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:57,080
I think that in terms of, it's not really meant to be as memorable as it is meant to be timeless.

1691
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:03,080
Like I said, I wanted a symbol that will always make sense and that will always be like applicable, you know.

1692
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:07,080
So it's just, it's meant to be very broad so it can last forever.

1693
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,080
It's meant to be something that you can just always recognize and everything can be tied to it.

1694
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,080
And it doesn't have to be, you know, changed to fit a different project or whatever.

1695
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:18,080
Like, everything that's released under the umbrella of the ex-studio is a ex-studio work, you know.

1696
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,080
But that can encompass whatever the people who happen to be involved happen to do.

1697
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,080
Who's involved?

1698
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,080
Most people pronounce it like what does that mean?

1699
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,080
What does that mean?

1700
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:29,080
Okay, well yeah, yig is not, yig is not just for me.

1701
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:34,080
Yig is for everyone who's releasing under the yig name, is yig.

1702
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,080
I mean, you tried that.

1703
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:42,080
You had a bunch of like, stoner idiots making shitty raps.

1704
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,080
You turned it into a rap channel for a while.

1705
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,080
It was a complete failure.

1706
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:57,080
You shunted all those projects off to new channels and then didn't advertise them and just left them there to die because nobody watched them.

1707
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:05,080
And now, it's like, it's like, it's like, I, okay, I'm gonna radically rebrand, right?

1708
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,080
I'm no longer, like, Digibro is dead.

1709
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:11,080
I am no longer just an anime analysis channel.

1710
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,080
I'm more than that now.

1711
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,080
I do, now I do raps.

1712
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:20,080
Now I do shitty vlogs with my friends where I harass strangers at stores.

1713
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:26,080
Now, now, this is the channel and everyone that doesn't like it was never a fan in the first place.

1714
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:32,080
And you're never, and you're not even allowed to talk about my old persona.

1715
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,080
You're a fake fan if you do.

1716
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:38,080
And then a year later, like, oops, everything about that was a failure.

1717
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:42,080
Okay, well, I'm gonna, okay, here's what I'm gonna do.

1718
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,080
I'm gonna go back to doing the exact style of content I did before.

1719
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:52,080
I'm gonna do the exact stuff I did before I rebranded that people used to like.

1720
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,080
Because you're gonna try and do that again.

1721
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,080
But I'm still Yig Studio.

1722
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,080
I'm still not that old channel.

1723
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,080
You're still not allowed, Digibro was still just a character I was playing.

1724
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,080
Not even a real person.

1725
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,080
It was all just an act and you fell for it.

1726
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:12,080
I am going to continue to do exactly what they did.

1727
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:15,080
But it was still just an act.

1728
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,080
I don't know, whatever, it's dumb.

1729
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,080
There's no, there's no studio.

1730
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:25,080
It's just me posting anime reviews again, but I swear, guys,

1731
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:29,080
Yig Studio is still a thing.

1732
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:37,080
One day we'll make low rent, which one day we'll make that original anime drawn by Mint Salad, LeMau.

1733
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:41,080
Okay, whatever.

1734
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,080
Next voicemail, I guess.

1735
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:47,080
It's called B321GO.

1736
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:49,080
Okay.

1737
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,080
Next one is a YouTube video.

1738
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,080
Bitcoin $100.

1739
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,080
Experts are now saying Bitcoin be worth $100.

1740
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,080
Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.

1741
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:04,080
Experts are now saying Bitcoin could be worth $100.

1742
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:12,080
And what this means is basically that if you have $100, you could purchase one Bitcoin.

1743
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,080
Or if you had $1.

1744
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:24,080
That would be the equivalent of something that you would need $100 of to purchase one Bitcoin.

1745
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,080
He's trying so hard.

1746
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:31,080
If a Bitcoin is worth $100, that means it's worth $100 more than $1.

1747
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:40,080
And if you have $100 Bitcoin, then you have that's worth...

1748
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,080
Got it.

1749
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,080
The most brain-working crypto bro.

1750
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,080
Damn, imagine Bitcoin $100.

1751
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,080
Okay, the space between the bit and the coin.

1752
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,080
Okay, I get it.

1753
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,080
Very funny, very droll.

1754
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,080
Imagine if Bitcoin $100.

1755
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,080
I for one can't even.

1756
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:03,080
Alright, next one is called Soul Link Nuzlocs.

1757
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,080
3, 2, 1, go.

1758
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:16,080
That sounds cringe.

1759
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,080
That's why you don't fucking play it that way.

1760
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,080
The point is to play it with a jolly good friend at the same time.

1761
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:25,080
So you can turn the single player game with Pokemon into a cooperative experience.

1762
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:28,080
So that you care about what happens in each other's runs.

1763
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:31,080
And you can go further than just having that one fainting rule.

1764
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:36,080
You can require both players to have each Soul Link Pokemon in both of their parties at the same time.

1765
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:42,080
Which creates a unique team building experience for gems, dungeons, and especially the Elite Four.

1766
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,080
Okay, okay, yeah.

1767
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:50,080
If you were playing it, if you were sitting in the same room and playing the same battles as someone,

1768
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:54,080
then yeah, I guess I can see how that would...

1769
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:58,080
It seems really inconvenient, but I can see how it would be fun.

1770
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:04,080
And I can see how it would be a more unique experience than a regular Nuzloc.

1771
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,080
I guess I would get it, if that's how you did it.

1772
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:12,080
Okay, next one is called...

1773
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,080
It's a YouTube link.

1774
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,080
It's 11 minutes.

1775
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,080
Oh, it's a Yeeg Studio video.

1776
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,080
Who cares?

1777
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,080
We're not watching an 11 minute video as a voicemail.

1778
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:26,080
What's...

1779
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:30,080
Am I supposed to have an opinion about...

1780
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:33,080
Spy X Family is for everyone.

1781
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,080
Maybe it is.

1782
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,080
I don't fucking care.

1783
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,080
Why would you send this?

1784
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,080
Okay, whatever.

1785
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,080
At least it wasn't long.

1786
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,080
Next one is called Casual Gamer.

1787
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,080
Three, two, one, go.

1788
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,080
Hey Ben, I don't know.

1789
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:52,080
I started your game and I couldn't make it through the first hallway.

1790
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,080
I don't know.

1791
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:59,080
I guess I'm pretty casual gamer, but it just made me feel like I didn't want to play anymore.

1792
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:01,080
And that's it. Bye.

1793
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:04,080
What do you mean you couldn't make it through the first hallway?

1794
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:07,080
The game is all one hallway.

1795
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,080
Maybe I assumed it was bigger than that.

1796
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:15,080
You're gonna have to be more specific.

1797
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:18,080
Just use all of the buttons until you win.

1798
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:23,080
Yeah, if you're losing, try shit in the menu.

1799
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:28,080
Explore the options in the menu until you find some stuff.

1800
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:32,080
And then just see what it does.

1801
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:36,080
You gotta just trial and error, fuck around, and find out what stuff does,

1802
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,080
and then you can figure out how to win.

1803
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,080
That's how you do it.

1804
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,080
I don't know.

1805
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,080
I don't want to get more specific than that.

1806
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,080
An idiot like Oblivionfall figured it out.

1807
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,080
Even someone as lowly as Give and Take figured it out.

1808
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,080
Surely you.

1809
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,080
I consider myself a casual gamer.

1810
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,080
Right, so there you go.

1811
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:58,080
Oblivion said he doesn't even play video games, or not much.

1812
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:01,080
So he said on the stream.

1813
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:07,080
So even my mom was kind of figuring it out on the second try.

1814
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:11,080
She just was bad at selecting the Sonichu.

1815
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:15,080
And you know, I gave the game to my dog, and my dog won.

1816
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,080
Right.

1817
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,080
Even quicker than I did.

1818
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,080
He just rolled around on the keyboard, and he won.

1819
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:24,080
So you gotta have better excuses than that.

1820
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,080
I gave it to a zygote, and the zygote completed it.

1821
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:32,080
Like a fucking speedrun time.

1822
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:39,080
I sacrificed the game on an altar to God, and God sent it back, and he had won.

1823
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,080
He had beat it quite easily.

1824
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:45,080
It only took him like two hours, so he was actually pretty good at it.

1825
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:49,080
He understood the mechanics intuitively.

1826
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,080
Next one is called, At It's All So Ugly.

1827
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:53,080
Hey, that's my Twitter handle.

1828
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,080
Three, two, one, go.

1829
01:45:55,080 --> 01:46:00,080
Ben Saint, after relentlessly abusing a drug-addled neurodivergent trans woman,

1830
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:04,080
and now setting your sights on a small, seven-year-old Japanese girl,

1831
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:08,080
is there anyone you want to rest?

1832
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:09,080
Well, Ben.

1833
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:14,080
I swear to God, people were acting as though she was actually like a little baby.

1834
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:19,080
Even though, guys, she was like posting about the thing.

1835
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,080
She was posting about my bowying, ooh-ooh.

1836
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,080
She was doing it in character.

1837
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:28,080
She was staying in character, and she was posting about it.

1838
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,080
She doesn't give a fuck.

1839
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,080
It was fine.

1840
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,080
Nobody cares.

1841
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:34,080
If you care, you're fucking stupid, okay?

1842
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:38,080
You're fucking stupid if you think this was a big deal at all.

1843
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,080
You know, Econ.

1844
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,080
Econ wrote pages and pages.

1845
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,080
He wrote like 30 fucking replies to me about it.

1846
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:50,080
He was like, he would not shut the fuck up about this dumb nonsense.

1847
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,080
That guy's fucking stupid.

1848
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,080
That guy fucking sucks.

1849
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,080
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with him.

1850
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:58,080
This was intolerable to him.

1851
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,080
That guy's full of fucking nonsense, and I can't fucking stand it.

1852
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,080
That guy did me a solid.

1853
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:06,080
That guy did me a solid when I had that breakup,

1854
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:09,080
and he let me crash on his couch for a few weeks,

1855
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:13,080
and I appreciate that so much that I've put up with him on Twitter for this long,

1856
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,080
but I can't fucking stand it anymore.

1857
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,080
He's too fucking much.

1858
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,080
I can't deal with it.

1859
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:22,080
How long do I have to abide by someone's nonsense?

1860
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,080
Just because the game did me a solid.

1861
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,080
Alright, how much?

1862
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,080
How much is too much?

1863
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:29,080
70 times 7.

1864
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:32,080
Turn the other cheek.

1865
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,080
Not anymore.

1866
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,080
You should do him a liquid.

1867
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:36,080
Okay.

1868
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:41,080
Next one is called Lord of Ghosts vs. King Herod.

1869
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,080
Oh, it's a vocaru.

1870
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,080
It's a vocaru.

1871
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,080
Okay, here it is.

1872
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,080
Three.

1873
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,080
You got it?

1874
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,080
Yeah.

1875
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,080
Alright, three, two, one, go.

1876
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,080
God, it's three fucking minutes long.

1877
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,080
I'm gonna kill myself.

1878
01:47:53,080 --> 01:48:02,080
Lord of Ghosts, I am overjoyed to meet you face to face.

1879
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:11,080
You've been making quite a name all around the place.

1880
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:18,080
You've been spooky, not raising from the dead.

1881
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:19,080
What?

1882
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,080
That's stupid.

1883
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:25,080
Now I understand your mayor.

1884
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,080
Taste.

1885
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:36,080
At least that's what they say.

1886
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:42,080
So if your mayor ghost, yes, the sweet lord of ghosts,

1887
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,080
Prove to me that you love slime, let's go do some crime.

1888
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:51,080
That's all you need to, and I won't kill you.

1889
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:55,080
Come on, lord of the ghosts.

1890
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:59,080
I only ask what I'd ask any slimy bro.

1891
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,080
Look, there's a juvie.

1892
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,080
Let's hit the death blow.

1893
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:08,080
Oh, I love killing, as I'm quite a fan.

1894
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:13,080
If you're gonna be mayor, well, you gotta lead by example, man.

1895
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:18,080
So if your mayor ghost, yes, the sweet lord of ghosts,

1896
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:21,080
Let's go and gorge on slime.

1897
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:22,080
It'll simply be divine.

1898
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:27,080
If you do that for me, I will let you go free.

1899
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:32,080
Come on, lord of the ghosts.

1900
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,080
What's this?

1901
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,080
You say you have a comic all about your life?

1902
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:38,080
But will it make me a pog?

1903
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,080
You're saying it will?

1904
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,080
It will.

1905
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:45,080
Well, I guess I gotta read it and support the artist on Patreon.com.

1906
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,080
Slash give or take.

1907
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,080
Yeah.

1908
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,080
Yeah.

1909
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:53,080
Enough haunting, it is time for you to kill.

1910
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:57,080
Slice and maim him, and slurp his slime with skill.

1911
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,080
Oh, I'm slime cooming.

1912
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,080
Yes, I can't wait.

1913
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:06,080
I'm dying to be shown that you can truly titillate.

1914
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:11,080
So if your mayor ghost, yes, the sweet lord of ghosts,

1915
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:14,080
Prove to me that there is no cracks.

1916
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,080
Cleave this juvie's head with an axe.

1917
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,080
Is something wrong?

1918
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:20,080
Lord of ghosts, what do you take so long?

1919
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:25,080
Come on, lord of the ghosts.

1920
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:31,080
Hey, aren't you scared of me, dude?

1921
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:36,080
Mr. Spooky Attitude.

1922
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:37,080
You're a joke.

1923
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:39,080
You're not my mayor.

1924
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:41,080
You're nothing but a spooky surveyor.

1925
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:42,080
I'll kill you for good.

1926
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:45,080
I always knew that I should.

1927
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:48,080
Goodbye, you lord of the.

1928
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,080
Goodbye, lord of the.

1929
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:56,080
Goodbye, lord of the ghosts.

1930
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,080
What's that above us?

1931
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:58,080
That's a mega slime?

1932
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,080
I've never seen that before.

1933
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:04,080
What's going on?

1934
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,080
Wow.

1935
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,080
That's exactly how it happened.

1936
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,080
Huh?

1937
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,080
Yeah, that was great.

1938
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:18,080
That's my favorite song from Jesus Christ, Superstar.

1939
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:21,080
I don't, I can't, I don't think I have anything to add.

1940
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:22,080
No, it was wonderful.

1941
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,080
Wonderful, wonderful.

1942
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:28,080
Thank you, Dusty Dumps, for another masterpiece.

1943
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,080
Yeah.

1944
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:34,080
Next one is a YouTube, it's a YouTube link.

1945
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:37,080
18 minutes long.

1946
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:42,080
Pro-skated to award-winning actor, the Jason Lee story, looking back.

1947
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,080
Who?

1948
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,080
I don't know.

1949
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,080
Oh, this is the guy.

1950
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:48,080
He's a skateboarder.

1951
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,080
I know this actor.

1952
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:50,080
I know he's been in stuff.

1953
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:52,080
Wait a minute.

1954
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:55,080
There's other skaters than Tony Hawk?

1955
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,080
It's true.

1956
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:04,080
No more skating, Tony Hawk, because you're just skating by after all that high impact sport,

1957
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:06,080
destroyed your tendons and ligaments.

1958
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,080
Destroyed your taint.

1959
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,080
Oh, here we go.

1960
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:10,080
Here we go.

1961
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,080
The next one is an Imgirlink, dudes be like.

1962
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,080
Oh.

1963
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,080
Don't reply to me weirdo.

1964
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:23,080
My brother in Christ, you made the reply with a soul utility of provoking a response by being more incendiary than it,

1965
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:26,080
by being more incendiary than it is anything else.

1966
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,080
I don't know, fucking cry about it.

1967
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:32,080
Fucking, fucking cry about it, that I was rude to someone.

1968
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,080
Like, shut up and die.

1969
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,080
Shut the fuck up and die.

1970
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,080
Why are you so upset?

1971
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:38,080
Why are you so upset that I was rude to someone?

1972
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,080
Who fucking cares?

1973
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:42,080
You're literally more upset than she was.

1974
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:45,080
She didn't even break a character, you psycho.

1975
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:48,080
You don't know how upset they were, they just made a meme.

1976
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,080
She didn't break character.

1977
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:52,080
Who didn't break character?

1978
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:55,080
The VTuber.

1979
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:56,080
Oh, yeah.

1980
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:58,080
I'm talking about the person who made the meme.

1981
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,080
Oh.

1982
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:02,080
They seem upset.

1983
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,080
They seem upset.

1984
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:07,080
Well, I know this is a contemporary meme.

1985
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:10,080
This seems like a genuinely meant criticism.

1986
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:14,080
And anyone that genuinely gives me authentic criticism

1987
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:18,080
is automatically mad and wrong.

1988
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,080
Okay, whatever.

1989
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,080
Okay, whatever.

1990
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,080
Haha, very funny, very good meme.

1991
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:26,080
Ah, yeah, love it.

1992
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:30,080
Okay, next page of these fucking voicemails.

1993
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:33,080
Oh, it's another YouTube.

1994
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,080
Oh, it's from smiling friends.

1995
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:38,080
It's from smiling friends?

1996
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,080
It's a Gilbert Gottfried scene.

1997
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,080
It's 30 seconds long.

1998
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,080
Well, whatever.

1999
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,080
I'm not going to watch it.

2000
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,080
Yeah, smiling friends good.

2001
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:46,080
Gilbert Gottfried's dead.

2002
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,080
That's too bad.

2003
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,080
What are you going to do?

2004
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,080
Next one is called Blue Wave.

2005
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,080
Am I right?

2006
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:53,080
Three, two, one, go.

2007
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:56,080
Hey guys, what do you think is going to happen

2008
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,080
during the midterms?

2009
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:00,080
I think they're about to get silly.

2010
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,080
Silly?

2011
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:04,080
Yeah.

2012
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,080
I think they're going to be pretty mid.

2013
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,080
I've been seeing a lot of speculation

2014
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,080
that the midterms are not going to go well

2015
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:16,080
for the Democrats, and that's a shame.

2016
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:20,080
I mean, Biden only barely beat Trump,

2017
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:23,080
which is embarrassing.

2018
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:26,080
And I don't think people have improved

2019
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:29,080
their opinion of him too much.

2020
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:33,080
Yeah, I don't see it going too well,

2021
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:35,080
which sucks, but that's what you get

2022
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,080
with Biden, I guess.

2023
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,080
They have not really done that much.

2024
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,080
They have not really done a lot of the stuff

2025
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:42,080
they said they were going to do,

2026
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:46,080
like student loan forgiveness didn't happen.

2027
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:51,080
So, yeah, I think it might not go so well.

2028
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,080
Also, they're like, I don't know,

2029
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:57,080
like all the stupid, like anti-CRT

2030
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:00,080
and like don't say gay stuff seems like

2031
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:06,080
weirdly popular with fucking

2032
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:09,080
the brainwirmed American populace, I guess.

2033
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,080
I don't know.

2034
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,080
I don't know if that's true or not.

2035
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:12,080
That's just my impression.

2036
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:15,080
Yeah, it's my impression as well.

2037
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,080
I hope it's not true, but maybe it is.

2038
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,080
I think it's just that the Democrats

2039
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,080
are not providing anything of interest

2040
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:24,080
to anyone to oppose it.

2041
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:27,080
The only thing we're hearing about is like,

2042
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:29,080
look at how evil the Republicans are being

2043
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:31,080
and the Democrats say nothing.

2044
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:32,080
It's like, okay.

2045
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:35,080
Well, I guess that's the only political information

2046
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:38,080
going on right now is the bad stuff.

2047
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:42,080
I mean, that's my impression.

2048
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,080
Oh, well.

2049
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:47,080
Next voicemail is this YouTube link to,

2050
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:53,080
this is, I've seen, I haven't watched these.

2051
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:55,080
This guy, the gamer from Mars,

2052
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:58,080
decided in the year 2022 to make a whole

2053
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:02,080
like the story of Chris Chan series.

2054
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,080
Boogie was in it and I fucking hate Boogie.

2055
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:07,080
I know that this, I know that this,

2056
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:11,080
this series does not respect Chris's agenda.

2057
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:16,080
So it's bad.

2058
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:19,080
How many times can one person be documented

2059
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,080
by so many different people?

2060
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:24,080
I mean, that's true, but that's been true.

2061
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,080
People have been calling Chris like the most

2062
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,080
documented person in the history,

2063
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,080
like for a while.

2064
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:32,080
I don't know why this guy decided

2065
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:34,080
that now was the time for another one,

2066
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:36,080
but I saw it going around.

2067
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,080
I guess it got a lot of views.

2068
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:38,080
So I guess he was right.

2069
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,080
I don't know, whatever.

2070
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:43,080
Fuck this guy and fuck Boogie.

2071
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,080
True.

2072
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,080
I don't know, man.

2073
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:47,080
It's just, it's really easy.

2074
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:50,080
It's really easy to just not misgender,

2075
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:53,080
but you chose to do it.

2076
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:57,080
So, I mean, that's on you forever, I guess.

2077
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:02,080
Next one is called A321GO.

2078
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:08,080
It is finally time to review another Paper Mario game.

2079
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:10,080
I reviewed Color Splash when it came out

2080
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,080
and that was pretty early in my channel's life.

2081
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:15,080
Covering the game was what really launched my career.

2082
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:18,080
So it's kind of surreal to be here again.

2083
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,080
Enough time has passed that Nintendo has made

2084
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:24,080
another Paper Mario game and here I am reviewing it.

2085
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:27,080
I barely hear that, but what was that?

2086
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:35,080
It was Arlo reviewing a new Paper Mario game

2087
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:38,080
and saying that, wow, dunking on Color Splash

2088
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:41,080
is what made me popular in the first place.

2089
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:43,080
Can't believe they made a new Paper Mario

2090
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,080
and I'm reviewing it.

2091
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:47,080
So interesting.

2092
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:50,080
Next one is called Slavoj Žižek on VTubers.

2093
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,080
Three, two, one, go.

2094
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:58,080
Ben Sheint is correct about VTubers.

2095
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,080
Thanks, Slavoj.

2096
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:08,080
Community is insular and cringe.

2097
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,080
Thanks.

2098
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,080
Good job.

2099
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:17,080
Someone who was convinced that I am simply

2100
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:23,080
a hater and an anti-VTuber bigot

2101
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:26,080
and just had declared war on all VTubers.

2102
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:30,080
Someone apparently sent Tom a question to do

2103
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:33,080
on his Patreon podcast or whatever and asked him,

2104
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:35,080
I don't know, I didn't hear the response

2105
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:37,080
and I didn't hear the question.

2106
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:39,080
I only heard it secondhand, but my impression is

2107
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:42,080
that they asked him, like, Tom,

2108
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:44,080
what do you think about Ben,

2109
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,080
like cruelly harassing VTubers for no crime

2110
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,080
other than being VTubers?

2111
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,080
What do you think about Ben using his platform

2112
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:54,080
to harass and destroy people who have done nothing

2113
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:57,080
other than be VTubers publicly?

2114
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,080
How do you feel about him going after them

2115
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,080
for their identity like that?

2116
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:04,080
And I assume Tom's response was like,

2117
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:09,080
it's bad.

2118
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,080
But apparently...

2119
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,080
Anyway, the point is somewhere in that question

2120
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:17,080
they said cringe and my problem with the post

2121
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:19,080
was not that it was cringe.

2122
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:22,080
I guess it sort of is, but that's not really...

2123
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:25,080
It's not merely that like, oh, the post is cringe

2124
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:27,080
and so I hate it.

2125
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:31,080
It's not so banal as that.

2126
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:34,080
It's mischaracterizing what I hate about it.

2127
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,080
But whatever.

2128
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:38,080
Okay, next one is a stupid YouTube link

2129
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:41,080
that I'm sure I guarantee we won't watch.

2130
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:44,080
It's Yig Studio again.

2131
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,080
Why would you... Why?

2132
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,080
Yeah, I get it. Yeah, she's putting out...

2133
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:51,080
She's shot gunning out a bunch of stupid little videos.

2134
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:53,080
Who cares?

2135
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,080
I think the person putting all these YouTube links

2136
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:57,080
might be the same person.

2137
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:59,080
We don't watch them, so don't do that.

2138
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:03,080
I would suspect probably so, but I would never...

2139
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:05,080
I don't... I don't even...

2140
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:08,080
I mean, obviously we're not going to watch it.

2141
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,080
Maybe you think that this is like

2142
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,080
suggesting something for us to talk about,

2143
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,080
but no, of course not.

2144
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,080
You should put that in a voicemail

2145
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,080
if you want us to talk about something specific

2146
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:20,080
and then have a YouTube link as like context

2147
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,080
that we can watch later if you really want to,

2148
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,080
but like just putting a link isn't going to do anything.

2149
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,080
Okay, but even if the question is

2150
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:28,080
what do you think about this video?

2151
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,080
The answer is nothing.

2152
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:32,080
Sure.

2153
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:35,080
Next one is a very innocent question.

2154
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,080
Three, two, one, go.

2155
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:40,080
Ben Saint, I have a question.

2156
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:44,080
Does your sister look more like you as a girl

2157
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:47,080
or more like Nate as a girl?

2158
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:50,080
I need to know for my masturbation fantasy,

2159
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,080
kay, thanks, bye.

2160
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:55,080
Oh, okay. Oh, that's why you...

2161
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:58,080
I think my sister...

2162
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,080
I think that my sister and Nate

2163
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:02,080
look a little bit more like our mom

2164
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:04,080
and I look a little bit more like our dad,

2165
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:08,080
so I think Nate Grace looks more like Nate.

2166
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:11,080
That's my opinion.

2167
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:14,080
Like that one picture of Nate with the long hair.

2168
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:17,080
Sorta, yeah.

2169
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,080
Okay, next one is called What's in Your Fridge?

2170
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,080
Three, two, one, go.

2171
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:24,080
Hey guys and gal, what do you keep in the fridge?

2172
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:26,080
Like all the time.

2173
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:28,080
Me, broccoli, goes with everything.

2174
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,080
Ben, you can't say seltzer.

2175
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:32,080
I don't keep my seltzer in the fridge.

2176
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,080
I keep it on a shelf because I don't really care

2177
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,080
if it's cold and I don't have enough space

2178
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:39,080
in my fridge to hold all the seltzer.

2179
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:42,080
I have like 30 bottles of seltzer on my...

2180
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:45,080
maybe not 30, maybe 20.

2181
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:47,080
I put milk in the fridge

2182
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:50,080
because I either have cereal with milk

2183
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:53,080
or I put milk in my tea and I always need milk.

2184
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:59,080
I keep low calorie ice cream in the freezer,

2185
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,080
but that's not what you asked.

2186
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:04,080
In the fridge I keep some vegetables,

2187
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:07,080
some tomatoes and some greens,

2188
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:10,080
like some spring mix greens.

2189
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:17,080
I keep cold cuts, ham, turkey, eggs, cheese in the drawer.

2190
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:23,080
And I keep low carb, bandurita tortillas.

2191
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:29,080
I have several big stack of bags of bandurita tortillas.

2192
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:32,080
And that's like it, that's like most of what I eat.

2193
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:34,080
Oh, sauces, you know.

2194
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:38,080
Caesar dressing, ranch dressing.

2195
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,080
Butter, cheese.

2196
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:43,080
I mean, stuff needs to be cold, I guess.

2197
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:46,080
That is basically all I keep in my fridge

2198
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:49,080
because that's pretty much most of what I eat,

2199
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:52,080
what I just listed off there.

2200
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:56,080
Make a lot of wraps, cook a lot of eggs,

2201
02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:00,080
make egg wraps sometimes if I'm feeling crazy.

2202
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:03,080
We have eggs outside the fridge.

2203
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,080
We have eggs on looker.

2204
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:08,080
We have one of those weird egg spirals.

2205
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:11,080
I guess you don't have to refrigerate eggs.

2206
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:15,080
Yeah, I don't know what they're called.

2207
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:19,080
Egg, we'll type in that egg spiral.

2208
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:21,080
Egg holder spiral.

2209
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:22,080
Oh, yeah.

2210
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,080
Oh, yeah.

2211
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:24,080
Huh.

2212
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:27,080
You know, I guess, I think eggs do keep longer

2213
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:28,080
if you keep them in the fridge,

2214
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:31,080
but like I know you don't have to keep them in there.

2215
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:34,080
I eat eggs basically every day, so.

2216
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:35,080
I see.

2217
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:38,080
You know, heck, maybe I should,

2218
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:40,080
I do need to conserve fridge space.

2219
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:43,080
Maybe I should just start keeping my eggs out

2220
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:46,080
because I share my fridge with like four other guys,

2221
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:48,080
so I'm always like,

2222
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:51,080
you pushed my shit out of the way.

2223
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:53,080
All right, next one is called

2224
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:55,080
vinegar man, vinegar man, vinegar man

2225
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:58,080
from the at rapist.com.

2226
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:01,080
Next one, okay, three, two, one, go.

2227
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:04,080
The Simpsons women stared in amazement

2228
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:06,080
at the saint.

2229
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:09,080
Send the end word three times

2230
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:11,080
without flinching.

2231
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:13,080
Holy shit.

2232
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:15,080
I love Benzane.

2233
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,080
Oh, they made you say it.

2234
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:24,080
Vinegar.

2235
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:27,080
Oh, God.

2236
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:30,080
Dude, you're gonna get canceled.

2237
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:32,080
That's good.

2238
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:36,080
I feel, wow, this guy really got me.

2239
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:38,080
This guy really, really,

2240
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:39,080
he really planned this one out

2241
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:42,080
and the plan worked perfectly.

2242
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:45,080
I tip my hat to you, sir.

2243
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:47,080
I've been bested.

2244
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:49,080
Okay.

2245
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:53,080
Next one is called Killer Prince 930.

2246
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:55,080
Three, two, one, go.

2247
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:58,080
Hey, listen to my speech impression.

2248
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:01,080
Oh, Hannah, my father-in-law.

2249
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:04,080
I can also make

2250
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:06,080
an Obama.

2251
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:10,080
No, let me be queer, Michelle.

2252
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:14,080
No, let me be queer, Michelle.

2253
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:17,080
Your stitch was a lot better

2254
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:19,080
than your Obama.

2255
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:22,080
Which one was which?

2256
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:24,080
Which one was stitch?

2257
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:26,080
You mean? No, you don't.

2258
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:27,080
No, that's not what you meant.

2259
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:28,080
I mean, there's only two things

2260
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:30,080
I could have said that.

2261
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:32,080
Post image.

2262
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:35,080
This one, this is a link,

2263
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:37,080
but it doesn't work.

2264
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,080
Wait, it's got to work.

2265
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,080
It doesn't work? Sorry.

2266
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:42,080
No.

2267
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:44,080
This post image link doesn't work.

2268
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:45,080
Next one.

2269
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,080
You should test it.

2270
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,080
I don't know whether, like,

2271
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:51,080
SpeakPipe shortens titles,

2272
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:53,080
but double check, please,

2273
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:55,080
that your links work before you post it.

2274
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:57,080
Wait, what if I just did the part

2275
02:05:57,080 --> 02:06:00,080
in front of that last slash?

2276
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:02,080
Does this one work?

2277
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:04,080
No, it doesn't work either.

2278
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:07,080
Sorry, it doesn't work.

2279
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:09,080
Okay, next one is called Hi Ben.

2280
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:11,080
What's your opinion on Super Smash Bros.

2281
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:15,080
3, 2, 1, go.

2282
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:17,080
Okay, I think it's just empty.

2283
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:20,080
I'm not...

2284
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:21,080
I like it, it's fun, I guess.

2285
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:22,080
It's fun to play.

2286
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:24,080
Sometimes I'm not very good at it.

2287
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:27,080
The only people who...

2288
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:29,080
Well, I used to play it sometimes

2289
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:31,080
with my roommates, which could be fun.

2290
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:33,080
Nowadays, the only people I would ever

2291
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,080
play Smash Bros. with are the people

2292
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:37,080
at Munchie's house,

2293
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:40,080
and those guys are way better than me

2294
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:42,080
to the point that I just can't play with them.

2295
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:43,080
Yeah, yeah.

2296
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:45,080
They're just playing a different game

2297
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:49,080
than I am, so I don't really play it anymore.

2298
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,080
It's fine, I was never like a huge

2299
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:53,080
fighting game guy anyway.

2300
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:54,080
I was pretty similar.

2301
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:56,080
It was fun when I was young,

2302
02:06:56,080 --> 02:06:58,080
because I could, like,

2303
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:01,080
spam, like, Samus's, like,

2304
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:04,080
be over and over again,

2305
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:06,080
and get them every time.

2306
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:09,080
And then, they got the, you know,

2307
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:11,080
whoever I was playing with, they just grew up,

2308
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:14,080
they learned how to play, and I didn't.

2309
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:16,080
Now I can't play the game anymore,

2310
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:18,080
so I just have not bought the new one.

2311
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:21,080
Remember, remember, if you will,

2312
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:23,080
the slime fest where me and Munchie played,

2313
02:07:23,080 --> 02:07:25,080
we battled in Smash Bros. Brawl,

2314
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:28,080
and it was the least fun thing

2315
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,080
that has ever happened to me

2316
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:33,080
in my entire life.

2317
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:36,080
Because I just, I just don't know the game

2318
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:38,080
at the same level.

2319
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,080
I just don't know what I'm doing.

2320
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:42,080
That's not the game's fault.

2321
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,080
Okay, next one is an Imgur link.

2322
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:46,080
Remember this?

2323
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:47,080
Hey, look at this.

2324
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:48,080
Yeah, yeah.

2325
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:49,080
Remember this?

2326
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:50,080
Well, egg on my face.

2327
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:52,080
Benz, dudes be like,

2328
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:53,080
don't reply to me weirdo.

2329
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:54,080
My brother in Christ,

2330
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:56,080
you made the reply with the soul utility

2331
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:57,080
of being incendiary.

2332
02:07:57,080 --> 02:07:59,080
I've since changed my mind,

2333
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,080
realized I hate this discourse.

2334
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:03,080
So now I'm the one whose message

2335
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:04,080
unprompted an unwanted response.

2336
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:06,080
How rich, Benz St. undefeated once again.

2337
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:08,080
I am genuinely...

2338
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:10,080
That's character development.

2339
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:12,080
I'm genuinely, honestly,

2340
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:14,080
I wasn't, after thinking about it for a second,

2341
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,080
I wasn't that mad about the first one,

2342
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:17,080
although I still disagreed with it.

2343
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:19,080
I'm genuinely impressed

2344
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:21,080
by the level of like,

2345
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:23,080
I thought about what I said

2346
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:26,080
and I've come to a new opinion about it.

2347
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:28,080
I feel like this is an...

2348
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:29,080
What's the word?

2349
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:32,080
An uncommon level of like,

2350
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:35,080
self-reflection has been displayed here.

2351
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:37,080
Um, I...

2352
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:38,080
Yeah.

2353
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:40,080
It kind of is, it kind of is true.

2354
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:43,080
You also said something

2355
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:45,080
to frustrate me.

2356
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:47,080
Anyway, all water into the bridge.

2357
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:49,080
Man.

2358
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:52,080
Good meme, actually.

2359
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:55,080
Fuck that dumb bitch and her stupid baby

2360
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:58,080
talk.

2361
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,080
Let's kill her.

2362
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:01,080
Next one is

2363
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:03,080
the quantifiable PCP member formula.

2364
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:06,080
Three, two, one, go.

2365
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:08,080
Alright, listen up, right?

2366
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:09,080
Yeah.

2367
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:10,080
So, you know,

2368
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:12,080
Ben and Gibbon take,

2369
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:14,080
they have all these sorts of guests

2370
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,080
and they're on all the time,

2371
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:18,080
but they're not members of the PCP,

2372
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,080
so you claim.

2373
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:22,080
Now, how do you quantify a member of the PCP?

2374
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,080
Let me tell you, okay?

2375
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:25,080
You might remember him.

2376
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:27,080
There's a man named Jeff Thu.

2377
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:29,080
And he was at one point

2378
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:32,080
considered a host of the procrastinator's podcast

2379
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:35,080
and he was only on three episodes, okay?

2380
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:37,080
So, I think, quantifiably,

2381
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:39,080
that means that any guest

2382
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:42,080
that's been on the PCP more than three times,

2383
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:44,080
an official member of the PCP now,

2384
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:45,080
you kick them off.

2385
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:47,080
Like, you kicked Jeff off.

2386
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:49,080
We did not kick Jeff off.

2387
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:52,080
Fuckin' cheesy manfredo, PCP.

2388
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:54,080
Gamer's Tavern, PCP.

2389
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:56,080
It's fuckin' all PCP all the time,

2390
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,080
Ben's saying.

2391
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:59,080
It's all PCP.

2392
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:01,080
You can't escape it, Ben.

2393
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:03,080
I'm really fuckin' high right now.

2394
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:04,080
I can't believe it.

2395
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:05,080
Okay.

2396
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:08,080
Oh, boy.

2397
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:09,080
Okay.

2398
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:10,080
Ben's saying,

2399
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:11,080
I hate your guts,

2400
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:12,080
but you have a good podcast.

2401
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:13,080
Thanks, man.

2402
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:14,080
Fuckin' keep doin' what you're doin'.

2403
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:15,080
Woo!

2404
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:16,080
If you're there, hi.

2405
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:17,080
I like you.

2406
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:19,080
I have no problems with you.

2407
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:20,080
Yeah, thanks.

2408
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:21,080
Bye.

2409
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:22,080
Thanks, dude.

2410
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:26,080
We didn't technically kick Jeff.

2411
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:27,080
We basically just...

2412
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:30,080
We and Jeff mutually agreed,

2413
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:33,080
you're not really a part of his podcast.

2414
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:36,080
Yeah, I think he just sort of left at some point.

2415
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:39,080
There was a very brief period where

2416
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:41,080
Blind Skywatcher was in the chat.

2417
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:42,080
What?

2418
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,080
Do you remember that?

2419
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:44,080
No.

2420
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:47,080
Trixie brought them in.

2421
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:51,080
I don't know whether they were to be

2422
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:53,080
a member of the Progress News,

2423
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:55,080
but it was just a friend.

2424
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:56,080
And they were cool,

2425
02:10:56,080 --> 02:10:57,080
but they didn't interact either,

2426
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:58,080
so they left.

2427
02:10:58,080 --> 02:10:59,080
Yeah.

2428
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:03,080
A member is just whoever we say is a member.

2429
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,080
That's it.

2430
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:08,080
We're just...

2431
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,080
We're just not...

2432
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:11,080
That's it.

2433
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:12,080
That's it.

2434
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:14,080
That's the answer.

2435
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:15,080
The member...

2436
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:16,080
To be a member

2437
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:18,080
means you have to have gone to Brony Khan.

2438
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:22,080
Yeah.

2439
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:25,080
And no one has done that, except us.

2440
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:27,080
That's the disqualifier.

2441
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:29,080
Next one is called

2442
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:31,080
This voicemail has lore,

2443
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:32,080
three, two, one, go.

2444
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:35,080
Oh, God!

2445
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:38,080
The name-fuckers are here.

2446
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:40,080
I left a voicemail

2447
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:42,080
saying they were cringe a year ago,

2448
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:43,080
and now they've come for me.

2449
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:44,080
Oh, God!

2450
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:45,080
That's insane.

2451
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:47,080
What have I done?

2452
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:48,080
What have I robbed?

2453
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:49,080
That's insane.

2454
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:52,080
They teamed up with Sotchu.

2455
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:54,080
They have dragons.

2456
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:56,080
They're fucking here, bro.

2457
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:57,080
They have dragons.

2458
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:58,080
Oh, my God.

2459
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:02,080
Yeah.

2460
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:04,080
Well, what did you fucking expect?

2461
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,080
You called the name-fuckers cringe,

2462
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:07,080
and they didn't get to fuck Nate,

2463
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:10,080
so, like, where do you think they're going to go?

2464
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:13,080
Final Fantasy VII.

2465
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:16,080
They have dragons.

2466
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:20,080
And Sotchu.

2467
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:22,080
Man, that is lore.

2468
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:23,080
That's accurate.

2469
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:25,080
Okay, next one is called

2470
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,080
Nate Theory, three, two, one, go.

2471
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:30,080
All right, I've got a theory

2472
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:32,080
about what happened to Nate, okay?

2473
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:33,080
Now, listen up.

2474
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:35,080
Listen up, you fucking sheephole

2475
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,080
that believes the real story.

2476
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:38,080
The real story.

2477
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:39,080
Thank you, Mr. Truth.

2478
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:41,080
Here's what happened, okay?

2479
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:45,080
Nate, the best guy ever, fucking died.

2480
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:46,080
He's dead.

2481
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:48,080
He slipped and fell and hit his head

2482
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:50,080
during a shower speed run.

2483
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:51,080
And that's why he hasn't

2484
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,080
just been on the PCP now.

2485
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:54,080
He's thinking, like, he's streamed, right?

2486
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:55,080
But how?

2487
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:57,080
It's Ben's saying.

2488
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:00,080
He has a weekend at Bernie's saying,

2489
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:03,080
Nate's corpse to spread a narrative

2490
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:04,080
that he is not dead,

2491
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:05,080
but he can't be,

2492
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:06,080
they can't be in the same place

2493
02:13:06,080 --> 02:13:07,080
at the same time,

2494
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:08,080
because Ben is Nate,

2495
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:11,080
so that's why he's not on the PCP anymore.

2496
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,080
Case closed.

2497
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:14,080
Well, I guess he cracked it.

2498
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:17,080
Yeah, I like the shower speed run,

2499
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:19,080
because that's around the time

2500
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:20,080
Nate stopped coming on,

2501
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:21,080
is when that was...

2502
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:23,080
He slipped and fell and died

2503
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:24,080
during a shower speed run.

2504
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:26,080
We can't let this get out.

2505
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:28,080
We can't let this get out anyway.

2506
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:30,080
We've got to retain the sanctity

2507
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:31,080
of the shower speed run.

2508
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:32,080
We've got to keep people doing that.

2509
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:33,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2510
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:35,080
We can't let them know that it's dangerous.

2511
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:38,080
If we let them know that one of our own guys

2512
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:39,080
slipped and fell and died

2513
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:40,080
during a shower speed run,

2514
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,080
then we'll be liable

2515
02:13:42,080 --> 02:13:44,080
when other people inevitably do that,

2516
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:47,080
and we don't want that kind of responsibility, so...

2517
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:50,080
You know, the rest is history.

2518
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:52,080
Next one is called,

2519
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:53,080
Is Gib Dead?

2520
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:54,080
Three, two...

2521
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:55,080
Well, Gib?

2522
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:56,080
I don't know.

2523
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:57,080
Let's see their case.

2524
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:58,080
Let's find out.

2525
02:13:58,080 --> 02:13:59,080
Three, two, one, go.

2526
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:01,080
Hey, Gib...

2527
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:03,080
Did...

2528
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:05,080
Last year you talked a lot about

2529
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:08,080
your mystery illness.

2530
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:10,080
Did you ever get that, like,

2531
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:11,080
sorted out or figure out

2532
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:13,080
what it actually was?

2533
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:14,080
Are you doing better?

2534
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:15,080
Are you dead?

2535
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,080
You don't have to answer

2536
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:18,080
if you don't want to.

2537
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:19,080
I was just worried.

2538
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:23,080
Seagulls in the background.

2539
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:25,080
Seagulls on a pirate ship right now.

2540
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,080
I am not dead.

2541
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:31,080
What it was was...

2542
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:33,080
Well, it was...

2543
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:34,080
It's still a mystery,

2544
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:36,080
exactly what it was

2545
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,080
caused by,

2546
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:40,080
but I was, like,

2547
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:42,080
extremely low on vitamin D,

2548
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:44,080
and I had to take supplements.

2549
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:47,080
I guess because I was inside a lot.

2550
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:49,080
I feel like I'm inside a lot anyway.

2551
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:52,080
My vitamin D was low.

2552
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:55,080
I have a hunch that it had to do with, like,

2553
02:14:56,080 --> 02:14:59,080
like, weird doses of, like,

2554
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:02,080
the HRT I was taking.

2555
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:05,080
I'm taking it still,

2556
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:06,080
but, like, it's fine now,

2557
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:09,080
so I'm not entirely sure what it was.

2558
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,080
At the time I was living somewhere different,

2559
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:14,080
so it could have been something in that place.

2560
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:17,080
I don't know,

2561
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:19,080
but I'm alright.

2562
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:21,080
I'm fine.

2563
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:23,080
Well, I'm glad that's over.

2564
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:25,080
Yeah.

2565
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:27,080
Yeah, weird.

2566
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:30,080
It could also be, like, a number of things,

2567
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:32,080
like, little things colliding.

2568
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:34,080
Like, maybe I was eating badly,

2569
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:35,080
as well as all those other things.

2570
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:37,080
I don't know.

2571
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:38,080
So you're saying you faked it?

2572
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:40,080
I'm saying I faked it for attention.

2573
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:41,080
I got loads of money.

2574
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:42,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2575
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,080
Alright, alright, alright.

2576
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:45,080
As long as you made a turn to profit.

2577
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:46,080
As long as you faked it.

2578
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:48,080
As long as you faked it and made money.

2579
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,080
Okay, next one is called Fuck Trixie.

2580
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:53,080
3, 2, 1, go.

2581
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:55,080
Shut up, man.

2582
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:56,080
No!

2583
02:15:58,080 --> 02:15:59,080
They got you.

2584
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:05,080
Next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder Play Delta Rune Chapter 2.

2585
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:08,080
Okay, some day.

2586
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:10,080
Next one is called Oblivion Fuck.

2587
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:11,080
3, 2, 1, go.

2588
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:16,080
In Episode 295, Oblivion 4 said he'd upload all of his compilations of voicemails

2589
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:18,080
to the ThemSnakes channel by the end of February.

2590
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:21,080
And then the comments he said might take until March.

2591
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:23,080
And now it's halfway through fucking April and they're still not there.

2592
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:24,080
Where are they?

2593
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:25,080
I saw him.

2594
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:28,080
I think they are up now, right?

2595
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:29,080
I think I saw a video.

2596
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:31,080
Oh, did you?

2597
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:37,080
I saw him replying to a YouTube comment this week saying that he would do it soon.

2598
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:39,080
So maybe he did.

2599
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:40,080
I don't know.

2600
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:49,080
I could swear I saw it posted somewhere kind of recently, like within a day or so.

2601
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:53,080
I don't know which chat it was in though, so I can't find it.

2602
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:55,080
I don't know.

2603
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:58,080
I don't remember which channel he said he was going to upload it on to.

2604
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:02,080
It's either up already or he says he's going to put it up like soon.

2605
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:05,080
It was on the ThemSnakes?

2606
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:09,080
Well, maybe it was unlisted on ThemSnakes because it's not public.

2607
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,080
Man, I don't know.

2608
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:15,080
He said he was going to post it.

2609
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:18,080
Like yesterday or the day before, I saw him reply to a comment saying like,

2610
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:20,080
yeah, I'm going to do it like tomorrow.

2611
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:22,080
So probably soon.

2612
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:27,080
He's been saying that he wants to get that up and people have been asking him for it.

2613
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:32,080
Next one is called Ukraine Loves Nazis 321 Go.

2614
02:17:52,080 --> 02:18:12,080
Yeah, I think after that episode finished, I went to look into that particular thing

2615
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:16,080
and I came to the same conclusions.

2616
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:21,080
It was a Russian propaganda thing to make it look like.

2617
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:27,080
And so it was like, that's why the U.K., the U.S. and Ukraine voted against.

2618
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:31,080
And everywhere, the country abstained because they just didn't want to get involved, I guess.

2619
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:38,080
It was not what it seemed as on the tin.

2620
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:42,080
As these things often, they get blown out of the work.

2621
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:46,080
I guess it worked then because now they can show that graph being like C,

2622
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:49,080
only the United States and Ukraine voted against it.

2623
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:52,080
Yeah, that's sort of the point.

2624
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:55,080
Well, I don't know if that's the point of doing it in the first place,

2625
02:18:55,080 --> 02:19:00,080
but certainly a result of it is that people who do not look into it too hard

2626
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:05,080
get the impression that that's what it's saying and then they just use it as a point.

2627
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:07,080
They could just post it.

2628
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:08,080
I see.

2629
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:13,080
Okay, next one is called Slime Times Exposed 321 Go.

2630
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:17,080
RFCK is socket.

2631
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:20,080
RFCK is stinks.

2632
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:21,080
It's endless words.

2633
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:25,080
It's a shitty game, shitty community.

2634
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:31,080
They'll take you and they'll cheer you out and spit you back out.

2635
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:33,080
They'll all betray you.

2636
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:36,080
The game itself isn't even fun.

2637
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:38,080
Killers just fucking cheat.

2638
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:39,080
That's the whole thing.

2639
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:43,080
They just openly love exploiting and abusing.

2640
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:46,080
They're just making the game not fun for anybody.

2641
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:48,080
And then the Raddies are fucking cowards.

2642
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:50,080
They just enable it.

2643
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:53,080
Which bar is this guy at drinking?

2644
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:59,080
He's at the king's wife's son.

2645
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:00,080
Going out there loud and proud.

2646
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:03,080
Like they're king ones, whatever.

2647
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:07,080
Fucking starting an open and honest conversation.

2648
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:09,080
Don't do it.

2649
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:10,080
Don't listen to that.

2650
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:12,080
Literally, your profile comes in every week.

2651
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:15,080
Fucking tells you to play RFCK.

2652
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:16,080
He's just tempting you.

2653
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:18,080
He's literally a demon.

2654
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:22,080
He's a fucking snake.

2655
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:24,080
We just talk like if you don't believe me.

2656
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:26,080
He's literally a demon.

2657
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:27,080
That's true.

2658
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,080
Don't do it.

2659
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:29,080
I've seen him.

2660
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:32,080
Thank you.

2661
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:33,080
Thank you?

2662
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:36,080
Yeah, he's like...

2663
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:41,080
He's crying into his...

2664
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:44,080
Oh, I forget if there's a name for like a slime beer.

2665
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:45,080
There might be one.

2666
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:49,080
But he's crying into his...

2667
02:20:49,080 --> 02:20:52,080
His slime and tonic over about how...

2668
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:55,080
The Raddies just enable the killers.

2669
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:57,080
They just exploit and everything.

2670
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:59,080
Culture death.

2671
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:04,080
I lost all my slime and it sucks.

2672
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,080
That's thematic though.

2673
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:06,080
I appreciate it.

2674
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:09,080
That's in line with the vibe.

2675
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:12,080
You've got to have some losers, you know?

2676
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:15,080
You've got to have some losers.

2677
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:18,080
Mary slime and alia to all.

2678
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:21,080
Even the haters and losers.

2679
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:25,080
If you, if you, listener want to be just like this guy,

2680
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:28,080
a loser, go play RFCK.

2681
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:33,080
Next one is called...

2682
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:37,080
Am I like Ben Hughes autistic for making voicemails?

2683
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:40,080
Three, two, one, go.

2684
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:41,080
Damn.

2685
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:42,080
This Ben Hus person.

2686
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:45,080
You know, Simpsons of Blue Ninjas person.

2687
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:48,080
You said how they waste a bunch of time on this because of their condition.

2688
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:49,080
Ben Hus.

2689
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:51,080
I am spending a lot of time on voicemails too.

2690
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:53,080
I am so on the spectrum, oh god.

2691
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:56,080
But it is pretty fun to see just what you are capable of,

2692
02:21:56,080 --> 02:22:00,080
even if it's not perfect and doesn't even always work out.

2693
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:04,080
There is joy in creating something from scratch, crafting a story.

2694
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:07,080
This guy's standards for a story just slightly lower than mine.

2695
02:22:07,080 --> 02:22:09,080
That's all there is to it, really.

2696
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:12,080
I did actually download Sony Vegas and Vocaload.

2697
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:13,080
Just you wait.

2698
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:16,080
I will learn to write proper music just to mess with you, Ben.

2699
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:17,080
Just you wait.

2700
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:19,080
I won't mess with Gib.

2701
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:20,080
Only compliment.

2702
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:22,080
Then it's funny to mess with.

2703
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,080
Gib is fun when Gib's shy.

2704
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:28,080
Instead of Elden Ring Gib, God, it's Elden Ring Gib cute.

2705
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:32,080
Thank you.

2706
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:34,080
Thank you, Twilight.

2707
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,080
Is there more?

2708
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:40,080
Is that a pig?

2709
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:43,080
Maybe.

2710
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:45,080
Okay.

2711
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:49,080
Yeah, the more time you spend on something, the more autistic you are.

2712
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:50,080
Yeah.

2713
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:54,080
It's a metric for how much you care.

2714
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:56,080
You go to your doctor.

2715
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:59,080
They say, how many autisms am I exuding?

2716
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:02,080
Like in radiation, they get a little machine out.

2717
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:08,080
And they say, how much time this week did you spend on an activity that brings you joy?

2718
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:11,080
And you say, some doctor.

2719
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:14,080
And they'll say, well, then you're somewhat autistic now.

2720
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:18,080
Get out of here.

2721
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:23,080
That'll be $100, please.

2722
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:25,080
So true.

2723
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:27,080
Next one.

2724
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:32,080
Well, there's a Twitter link, and there's also a voicemail to go with it.

2725
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:39,080
So I guess the Twitter link is to, from this at drinking moth, is this animation.

2726
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:42,080
Which is a reply...

2727
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:46,080
It's a reply to teleperte.

2728
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:48,080
There's a teleperte animation here.

2729
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:50,080
Okay, let's listen to it.

2730
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:52,080
Three, two, one, go.

2731
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:57,080
So anyway, did you ever notice how the coolest animation has crazy camera movement?

2732
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:59,080
Talput always has something going from front to back.

2733
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:01,080
Perspective movement is my sexuality.

2734
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:02,080
No, no, no.

2735
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:04,080
Let me try this again.

2736
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:06,080
Perspective movement is my sexuality.

2737
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:08,080
Is my sexuality.

2738
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:12,080
Like this clip is so simple, but those two hushes had so much.

2739
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:17,080
This is why we don't like top-down perspective games, probably.

2740
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:28,080
I mean, they're saying that they really like how the animation includes the box moving in perspective.

2741
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:29,080
Which is true.

2742
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:32,080
Is this person drinking moth, or are they...

2743
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:34,080
I don't know.

2744
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:38,080
I don't think they are.

2745
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:40,080
But they might be.

2746
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:42,080
But they didn't say that they are.

2747
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:49,080
I feel like I've seen that at somewhere before.

2748
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:51,080
Yeah, me too.

2749
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:52,080
Are they following me?

2750
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:54,080
Yeah, no, they're probably drinking moth.

2751
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:56,080
Yeah, probably.

2752
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:58,080
There's a nice little animation.

2753
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:01,080
I mean, I like perspective.

2754
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:02,080
It's good.

2755
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:07,080
You should follow Ululilia, who really likes parallax scrolling.

2756
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:18,080
Sorry, it's our reply on Twitter that I'm going to ignore.

2757
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:22,080
It's not pertinent to what's going on right now.

2758
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:27,080
Next one is called, Are voicemails dead? 3, 2, 1, go.

2759
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:30,080
Okay, the answer is yes.

2760
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,080
That was the last one.

2761
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:34,080
Next one is...

2762
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:41,080
Okay, it's another drinking moth link, which is not embedding.

2763
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:44,080
Whatever, I'll just open it up on Twitter.

2764
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:49,080
I got reincarnated as a Lithuanian girl, but I need to take revenge on Benzane

2765
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:53,080
for stealing the Kawasaki scroll.

2766
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:56,080
This image will be seen by the right person at the right time,

2767
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:59,080
though I believe it will be next week, not this one.

2768
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,080
Is that Mage?

2769
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:04,080
That's the idea, I think.

2770
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:07,080
Yeah.

2771
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:10,080
Funny that you wouldn't make her purple then.

2772
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:13,080
Okay, well...

2773
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:15,080
What's the voicemail?

2774
02:26:15,080 --> 02:26:17,080
Oh yeah, let's listen to the voicemail.

2775
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:20,080
3, 2, 1, go.

2776
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:38,080
Did you translate the name Saint?

2777
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:41,080
It's said like Benzakoni or something.

2778
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:45,080
I think they translated the word Saint, which is dumb.

2779
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:48,080
Benno santo san.

2780
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:51,080
It's Benno santo san, yeah.

2781
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:54,080
Well, I'm laughing.

2782
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:59,080
I'm not sure if this is Mage or just some girl.

2783
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:03,080
Other than being Lithuanian, there doesn't seem much Magey about her.

2784
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:06,080
I think it's not literally Mage,

2785
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:12,080
but the thing they're going for is the reference to Magey's violent childhood.

2786
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:14,080
Yeah, yeah.

2787
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:19,080
Her battle warrior youth in Lithuania.

2788
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:23,080
Yes, I think so, which is fair.

2789
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:27,080
What is this thing she's holding? Is it like a staff?

2790
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:31,080
I thought it was a scroll, not a scroll, a katana that's wrapped up.

2791
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:34,080
Wait, it says, hold on, there's something written on it.

2792
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:37,080
Enhance? Oh, it says at drinking moth.

2793
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:42,080
It looks to me like a gnarled wizard staff that's been wrapped up in leather

2794
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:46,080
and slung across the shoulder like one might sling a guitar.

2795
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:53,080
So, I don't know, that's my best guess.

2796
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:57,080
Good stuff, good stuff, drinking moth.

2797
02:27:57,080 --> 02:28:01,080
Next one is, to give spoilers for Sonic 2.

2798
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:04,080
They show Shadow after the crit.

2799
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:07,080
Three, two, one, go.

2800
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:09,080
Gib and listen to me.

2801
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:11,080
What?

2802
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:16,080
Watch the Sonic 2, the hedgehog movie, whenever, however you can.

2803
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:18,080
Watch a camera or something.

2804
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:25,080
Spoilers, it sort of follows the story of Sonic 3 and Knuckles.

2805
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:31,080
And then, after that, it's going to follow the Sonic Adventure 2 timeline.

2806
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:37,080
And if you know anything about Sonic Adventure 2, Ruge the Bat shows up.

2807
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:41,080
And they're going to have big, old, bouncing titties.

2808
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:43,080
Yeah!

2809
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:47,080
4K on the big screen.

2810
02:28:47,080 --> 02:28:51,080
Wait, you're saying that, does that happen in Sonic 2?

2811
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:53,080
Or is it going to happen in Sonic 3?

2812
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:59,080
Well, if the character of Ruge the Bat is in the next one, because I know that Shadow is a hedgehog.

2813
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:01,080
Isn't it Rogue the Bat?

2814
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:02,080
No, Ruge.

2815
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,080
Is it Ruge?

2816
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:05,080
Oh, fuck.

2817
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:07,080
Ruge is in like femme fatale sort of.

2818
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:10,080
Yeah, yeah, makeup, yeah.

2819
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:20,080
But like, the, I know that Shadow was like hinted at at the credits of the Sonic 2 movie.

2820
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:27,080
So Shadow will be in the next one, and then with Shadow comes Ruge probably.

2821
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:33,080
And then that robot guy, the Eggman robot that goes good.

2822
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:39,080
Oh, E1M1. Yeah, I know the one you're talking about.

2823
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:40,080
Yeah.

2824
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:41,080
The Rogue.

2825
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:43,080
I would be very interested to see...

2826
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:45,080
There's no way they'll put him in.

2827
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:46,080
He's too specific.

2828
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:48,080
He's specifically in Sonic Adventure 2.

2829
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:50,080
They'll never put him in anything again.

2830
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:51,080
They put him in...

2831
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:54,080
He was in Sonic Heroes as well.

2832
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:55,080
Oh, was he?

2833
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:57,080
In the dark trio.

2834
02:29:57,080 --> 02:30:04,080
Each team has a trio of things, and it's like Shadow, Ruge, and the robot.

2835
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:06,080
It was a different robot though, right?

2836
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,080
I thought it was the same one.

2837
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:09,080
I think it was also in Sonic the Six.

2838
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:14,080
I remembered that it was just a similar robot.

2839
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:17,080
But maybe.

2840
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:18,080
Okay.

2841
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:21,080
I feel like he's a recurring enough character to be in there.

2842
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:27,080
And the idea of it like a robot from Eggman going Rogue and being a good guy...

2843
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:28,080
I don't know.

2844
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,080
I think that was...

2845
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,080
Yeah, it's a whole...

2846
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:34,080
Interesting story thing to add in.

2847
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:35,080
It is.

2848
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:36,080
That's true.

2849
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:37,080
It would make sense.

2850
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:42,080
I feel like he's an even more minor character than someone like...

2851
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:44,080
Is it Vex the Alligator?

2852
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:45,080
Is that his name?

2853
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:48,080
I don't know their names, but yeah.

2854
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:52,080
I feel like he's even less important than that alligator.

2855
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:54,080
And that alligator is not good.

2856
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:55,080
He might make a cameo.

2857
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:56,080
I don't know.

2858
02:30:56,080 --> 02:31:01,080
In any case, if Shadow's in there, they'll probably have Ruge.

2859
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:11,080
And I would be interested to see how big the boobies become for a family movie.

2860
02:31:11,080 --> 02:31:14,080
Because her design is so like...

2861
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:15,080
Boob-centric.

2862
02:31:15,080 --> 02:31:16,080
Boob-centric.

2863
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:17,080
That's nice.

2864
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:18,080
Sexually bad.

2865
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,080
A little bit.

2866
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:27,080
I mean, if you look at the original models from the games, they're not like...

2867
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:30,080
They'll probably cover up for a film, I feel like.

2868
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:34,080
But not that much, but will they?

2869
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:36,080
That's the most important thing.

2870
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:38,080
She was an original...

2871
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:39,080
Oh, wow.

2872
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:42,080
Yeah, they're actually really big in Sonic Adventure 2.

2873
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:45,080
They're actually really prominent, I forgot.

2874
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:47,080
Wow, okay.

2875
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:48,080
Yeah, maybe.

2876
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:50,080
Ruge the Bat.

2877
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:53,080
Which one's Sonic Adventure 2?

2878
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:59,080
Yeah, I feel like they'll tone him down a little bit from this.

2879
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:03,080
Next one is...

2880
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:05,080
An image.

2881
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:07,080
No, it's a YouTube link.

2882
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:08,080
Yeah, you're right, sorry.

2883
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:10,080
It's a YouTube link.

2884
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:12,080
I bet this one's gonna suck.

2885
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:14,080
That's just some gay.

2886
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:15,080
It's another review.

2887
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:17,080
It's a review... whatever.

2888
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:19,080
Okay, I'm not watching it.

2889
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:20,080
Bye.

2890
02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:22,080
Next one is an Imgur.

2891
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:24,080
There we go.

2892
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:26,080
Oh, so Beno Saintos.

2893
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:29,080
I'm directing Ben Sento.

2894
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:31,080
Ben Sento.

2895
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:38,080
Because of Ben Affleck's Wikipedia, there are evidence of Ben Shapiro.

2896
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:42,080
Oh, that's very interesting.

2897
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:44,080
Yeah, okay, I guess Ben.

2898
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:46,080
I guess you just say Ben.

2899
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,080
Ben?

2900
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:49,080
Is N the only consonant?

2901
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:50,080
Ben.

2902
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:55,080
Is that the only consonant sound in Japanese that doesn't have a vowel?

2903
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:58,080
Maybe there's not.

2904
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:01,080
Because I thought most of Japanese consonants were like...

2905
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:09,080
Well, they have N.

2906
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:11,080
You can't really...

2907
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:13,080
But is that the only one?

2908
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:17,080
I don't know, I don't speak any language at all.

2909
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:21,080
Okay, we'll fair enough.

2910
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:23,080
We've all learned some.

2911
02:33:23,080 --> 02:33:25,080
I like that it's...

2912
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:29,080
I'm looking at the symbol for no is just that curved line.

2913
02:33:29,080 --> 02:33:36,080
And the symbol for N is a very similar curved line, but with like another dash on top of it.

2914
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:38,080
I find that fascinating.

2915
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:44,080
Next one...

2916
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,080
I lost my place, sorry.

2917
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:48,080
Okay, next one is called Crisis Averted.

2918
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:50,080
Three, two, one, go.

2919
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:53,080
Thank God.

2920
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:57,080
Last week I thought I started HRT on Ben's birthday and like...

2921
02:33:57,080 --> 02:33:59,080
That would have been too cringe.

2922
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:04,080
Could you imagine I would have had to de-transition out of embarrassment?

2923
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:11,080
The only thing more cringe than starting HRT is starting it on Ben's birthday.

2924
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:16,080
Thanks for clarifying, and happy belated birthday, Ben Saint.

2925
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:18,080
Thank you.

2926
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:26,080
Next one is called Re Phantomhorn, one of two, three, two, one, go.

2927
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:30,080
Ben Saint, your game Phantom's Revenge?

2928
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:32,080
That was a lot of fun.

2929
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:34,080
I just have one request.

2930
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:42,080
May I, pretty pleased with the cherry on top, have permission to draw fan art of your OC Phantomhorn?

2931
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:43,080
No.

2932
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:48,080
Thanks for asking, no.

2933
02:34:51,080 --> 02:34:55,080
Ask for permission if you don't want to do it.

2934
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:59,080
Always ask for permission if you hate yourself.

2935
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:06,080
Sorry, the answer was yes by default, but when you ask, it flips that switch.

2936
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:09,080
I'm sorry, these are the rules that I made up.

2937
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:12,080
Next one is Re Phantomhorn, two of two.

2938
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:16,080
We'll listen to it first, three, two, one, go.

2939
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:18,080
Surprise, bitch.

2940
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:22,080
Happy belated birthday, Ben Saint.

2941
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:26,080
Curious Phantomhorn getting squished by a train.

2942
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:29,080
No, no.

2943
02:35:29,080 --> 02:35:31,080
Okay, let's see.

2944
02:35:31,080 --> 02:35:33,080
Oh, no.

2945
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:35,080
Wait, is this post-squish?

2946
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:38,080
He's got stars swinging around his head.

2947
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:41,080
That hurt a little bit.

2948
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:43,080
Yeah, I guess it must be.

2949
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:46,080
Damn, he looks pretty good for having just been run over by a train.

2950
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:52,080
Yeah, he's probably made of that gumu gumu gumu, you know?

2951
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:57,080
Yeah, because Luffy ate the Nika Nika fruit.

2952
02:35:57,080 --> 02:36:02,080
So actually, the real gumu gumu fruit, Phantomhorn, just found it in the trash one day,

2953
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:06,080
and just ate it by accident, as he often does.

2954
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:08,080
I like his hoodie.

2955
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:11,080
I actually gave him a little pink hoodie with a black one.

2956
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:14,080
That looks cool, I like it.

2957
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:19,080
Oh, this is pre-slime, he has the old horn.

2958
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:23,080
I mean, if he had the slime, he would definitely survive being run over by a train.

2959
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:24,080
Yeah.

2960
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:28,080
Obviously, but this is pre-so, it's a little scary.

2961
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:31,080
Okay, next one is...

2962
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:34,080
Oh, next one is...

2963
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:37,080
Thank you, by the way, I like it, I love it.

2964
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:40,080
Next one is Ben's weekly reminder to upload these episodes to Spotify.

2965
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:42,080
I will, I will.

2966
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:44,080
Well, I'll do my best.

2967
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:47,080
I don't know if it will work, because I've never done it before.

2968
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:50,080
Okay, next one is a YouTube link.

2969
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:53,080
It's a link to the garlic house music video.

2970
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:55,080
Okay, cool.

2971
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:57,080
You want us to talk about it? We already talked about it.

2972
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:58,080
We already talked about it.

2973
02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:00,080
It's cringe.

2974
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:03,080
It's cringe, but I'm glad it exists.

2975
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:04,080
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

2976
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:07,080
Watch the garlic house music video, it's funny.

2977
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:10,080
It's painful, but it's funny.

2978
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:14,080
Check it out if you want to have a fucking rollicking good time.

2979
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:17,080
Okay, next one is an Imgirlink.

2980
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:19,080
It's a...

2981
02:37:19,080 --> 02:37:21,080
CHCW.

2982
02:37:21,080 --> 02:37:23,080
Oh, it's CHCW.

2983
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:24,080
Who's that?

2984
02:37:24,080 --> 02:37:27,080
This is the guy who always comments, no Nate, no watch.

2985
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:29,080
See you next week.

2986
02:37:29,080 --> 02:37:31,080
Oh, I see.

2987
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:36,080
Yeah, his name is SHCWVideos, and yet his channel has no videos.

2988
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:40,080
I wonder what the SHCW stands for.

2989
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:42,080
I also wonder that.

2990
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:49,080
Maybe you can let us know in the comments, along with your typical response.

2991
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:52,080
If you feel so inclined, I'd be curious to know.

2992
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:54,080
Thank you.

2993
02:37:54,080 --> 02:37:56,080
Okay, we're almost done.

2994
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:58,080
Wow, we're almost through these.

2995
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:01,080
Yeah, a lot of them are just YouTube links that we're not...

2996
02:38:01,080 --> 02:38:03,080
That's another Yig one.

2997
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:08,080
Why? Yeah, I'm not gonna have anything to say about any particular video.

2998
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:15,080
I am not subscribed to the cultural conversation nor the channel.

2999
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:20,080
Yeah, there's just nothing to say about this.

3000
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:23,080
Next one is called Introducing Poogee.

3001
02:38:23,080 --> 02:38:25,080
Poogee? Poogee?

3002
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:27,080
Three, two, one, go.

3003
02:38:27,080 --> 02:38:32,080
So since you don't hate pigs, I thought formal greetings are in order.

3004
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:34,080
This is Poogee.

3005
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:36,080
Poogee, say hello.

3006
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:39,080
Oh, pig it.

3007
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:40,080
Holy shit.

3008
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:41,080
He whistles.

3009
02:38:41,080 --> 02:38:44,080
Did Upload and Fall just follow me on Twitter?

3010
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:49,080
Oh god, I am dying again.

3011
02:38:49,080 --> 02:38:50,080
Aren't I?

3012
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:52,080
Oh well, better get over with it.

3013
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:58,080
Hello?

3014
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:03,080
Well shit, now what do we do?

3015
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:05,080
It's the pig.

3016
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:08,080
The pig was at the door.

3017
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:10,080
There's a pig at the door.

3018
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:15,080
Damn, that's a horror story for me personally.

3019
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:18,080
I like Poogee.

3020
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:21,080
She said Poogee.

3021
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:25,080
She said Poogee, so I'm gonna assume it's meant to be Poogee.

3022
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:30,080
Unless you typo it in the voicemail.

3023
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:33,080
We have to protect Poogee from the pig.

3024
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:36,080
From the big, from his big evil cousin.

3025
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:37,080
Poogee's good.

3026
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:43,080
Poogee can grow up to be, he can make something of himself, not like that psychopath.

3027
02:39:43,080 --> 02:39:48,080
Next one is a YouTube link, WaitHe'sReal at gmail.com.

3028
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:52,080
Oh, it's a link, it's a video about Brad Garlinghouse.

3029
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:53,080
It's Brad Garlinghouse.

3030
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:58,080
Yes, Brad Garlinghouse is a real human person with real human feelings

3031
02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:02,080
and a real human cryptocurrency that you can buy right now.

3032
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:04,080
It's Ripple, baby!

3033
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:08,080
That's it, that's the last voicemail, we did it.

3034
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:10,080
It wasn't even that bad.

3035
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:12,080
What do you think?

3036
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:15,080
I said that's the last voicemail, we actually did it.

3037
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:17,080
It wasn't as bad as I thought.

3038
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:19,080
Yeah, yeah.

3039
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:22,080
It's a good day.

3040
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:24,080
It's a good day, I'm feeling good.

3041
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:27,080
I got up early to finish my, to finish that Tails Gets Trolled page

3042
02:40:27,080 --> 02:40:30,080
and now we've done the podcast in it under three hours.

3043
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:32,080
Yes!

3044
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:35,080
There's a few people who are crying right now.

3045
02:40:35,080 --> 02:40:36,080
A few people say no!

3046
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:38,080
I saw someone...

3047
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:43,080
I have two more hours to work my shift digging ditches at the graveyard.

3048
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:46,080
I'm sorry about those people.

3049
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:50,080
Yeah, somebody on the last episode, it was four hours long

3050
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:54,080
and they're like, ah, could you please make a five hour episode?

3051
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:57,080
Yeah, come on!

3052
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:59,080
Come on, only four!

3053
02:40:59,080 --> 02:41:01,080
Just, why?

3054
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:03,080
Just keep it going, man!

3055
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:05,080
Yeah.

3056
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:07,080
No, I will, alright.

3057
02:41:07,080 --> 02:41:09,080
I will put those bonus episodes up.

3058
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:12,080
I will attempt to get that shit on Spotify

3059
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:16,080
and Apple Podcasts and whatever else.

3060
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:19,080
Hopefully before this episode goes live

3061
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:23,080
and take out my Tails Gets Trolled page.

3062
02:41:23,080 --> 02:41:25,080
Link in the description, check out my Tails Gets Trolled page.

3063
02:41:25,080 --> 02:41:27,080
I've worked really hard on it.

3064
02:41:27,080 --> 02:41:29,080
Yes.

3065
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:33,080
And we have to keep posting to the Patreon.

3066
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:35,080
We have to remember that.

3067
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:39,080
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to forget again.

3068
02:41:39,080 --> 02:41:43,080
I'm really mad, I'm really fucking mad about that.

3069
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:46,080
But it's too late to do anything.

3070
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:48,080
Yeah.

3071
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:54,080
We were considering like posting all of the episodes individually

3072
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:57,080
and people would get charged for them this month.

3073
02:41:57,080 --> 02:42:00,080
But I feel like that would have scared people

3074
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:02,080
and made them like unpledge

3075
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:04,080
because there's like a bunch of stuff happening at once.

3076
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:10,080
All that would do is a few people would just get charged like eight times for one month

3077
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:12,080
and it would be shitty for them.

3078
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:17,080
And most people would probably, it would just exceed their monthly limits that they place

3079
02:42:17,080 --> 02:42:20,080
and it wouldn't even like get,

3080
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:23,080
it wouldn't make, it would make a little bit of the money back,

3081
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:25,080
but not most of it.

3082
02:42:25,080 --> 02:42:28,080
So like, I don't, yeah, I don't even think it's worth.

3083
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:30,080
We just got, we just got a call.

3084
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:33,080
We just got a call March of March of a lost month.

3085
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:34,080
It's a bummer.

3086
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:36,080
It's a bummer, but hopefully the patrons,

3087
02:42:36,080 --> 02:42:40,080
hopefully you patrons will consider it a gift.

3088
02:42:40,080 --> 02:42:42,080
A lucky strike.

3089
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:43,080
Yes.

3090
02:42:43,080 --> 02:42:44,080
As they say.

3091
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:53,080
And pay us by pledging to the patron at $5 to get access to the Minecraft server

3092
02:42:53,080 --> 02:42:56,080
and have fun in that video game that you love so much.

3093
02:42:56,080 --> 02:42:57,080
I wouldn't say no.

3094
02:42:57,080 --> 02:42:58,080
I wouldn't say no to that.

3095
02:42:58,080 --> 02:42:59,080
Yeah.

3096
02:42:59,080 --> 02:43:01,080
Become a patron, get the bonus episodes,

3097
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:06,080
get all the past bonus episodes including the Radcon 2 documentary.

3098
02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:08,080
Join the Minecraft server.

3099
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:11,080
Marron Pan will help you get it set up and he will,

3100
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:13,080
surely he will be overjoyed.

3101
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:15,080
If you're, here's the thing.

3102
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:18,080
When you're a PCP patron, you're not just getting the bonus episodes,

3103
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:21,080
you're not just getting the Minecraft server.

3104
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:26,080
You're getting a man-servant who will be overjoyed.

3105
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:30,080
You can, you have a 24 hour helpline that you can DM on Discord and say,

3106
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:33,080
Marron Pan, I can't find the next NPC.

3107
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:34,080
Where's the next step in the quest?

3108
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:36,080
And he'll be like, I'm in.

3109
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:37,080
I'm joining the game.

3110
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:39,080
I'm going to walk you there right now.

3111
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:42,080
I'm confident that nothing would please him more

3112
02:43:42,080 --> 02:43:46,080
than to receive queries about his Minecraft server

3113
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:54,080
and be empowered to enable you to appreciate all that's on offer there.

3114
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:58,080
So that's a deal of the lifetime as far as I'm concerned.

3115
02:43:58,080 --> 02:44:01,080
Anything else?

3116
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:05,080
Check out my streams if you're interested in watching me.

3117
02:44:05,080 --> 02:44:09,080
If you need time to fill and the PCP isn't long enough,

3118
02:44:09,080 --> 02:44:14,080
I guess watch my Elden Ring streams on Gibb and Take on Twitch.

3119
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:21,080
Yeah, also, if you want to see Oblivion Fall play both of our games,

3120
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:24,080
Phantom's Revenge and Pumpkin Alley.

3121
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:27,080
You can check out the VOD for that stream he did last week.

3122
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:29,080
It was very fun.

3123
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:33,080
Oh yeah, and check out Pumpkin Alley because there's the pumpkin patch.

3124
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:37,080
It's slightly different and there's more lizards.

3125
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:38,080
I still have not.

3126
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:43,080
I might go and hunt that eighth lizard because he never found that eighth lizard,

3127
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:45,080
but I might.

3128
02:44:45,080 --> 02:44:49,080
If I have some free time this week in between doing all that other shit,

3129
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:51,080
maybe I'll hunt a lizard.

3130
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:53,080
Okay, check it out.

3131
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:55,080
That's going to be it.

3132
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:57,080
That's the episode, baby.

3133
02:44:57,080 --> 02:44:58,080
That's it.

3134
02:44:58,080 --> 02:44:59,080
That's it.

3135
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:01,080
See you next week.

3136
02:45:01,080 --> 02:45:04,080
I love you so much.

3137
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:07,080
And you could do anything you put your mind to.

3138
02:45:07,080 --> 02:45:11,080
Even subscribe to our YouTube channel.

3139
02:45:11,080 --> 02:45:13,080
Okay, goodbye.

3140
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:15,080
See ya later.

3141
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:17,080
See ya.
