00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Today there's

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Gibb.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hi. Hey guys. Read my comic at Gibbontake.site. It's good.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And there's Tom.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey guys. Read my comic at Gibbontake.site.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And there's Jess.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's me.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hey guys. Read my comic at Gibbontake.site.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And there's me. Read my comic at Gibbontake.site. The rarely seen, extremely tired, bestie boy

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
did not sleep last night because I was under the spell of a temptress demon named Factorio.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And when I closed my eyes and opened them again, 12 hours had passed and I'd watched, like,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
of half a season of Star Trek Voyager, which is not as bad as everybody says, and it's

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
no, it's not. It's pretty good.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And Voyager.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Star Trek Voyager, Ben. We're already recording, so I hope you're recording too.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You may have been. You will not be penalized, but you will be chastised verbally by me.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Fuck you.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's a price he's willing to pay.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Anyway, Factorio, you build your little factory and you're doing just fine.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, then you run out of coal.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh god, you run out of coal.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You gotta get more coal.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Your factory loses power.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What are you gonna do?

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, you gotta expand your walls.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You gotta build more concrete walls everywhere.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh god, did you know that in Factorio, when you develop more technology and you increase

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
the level of pollution?

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, the level of pollution is tracked in Factorio.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The monsters in the surrounding area of your base evolve and get stronger.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The more fucking shit you do.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So that means more raids.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
More raids on your base.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This sounds like a made-up game.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a nightmare.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't believe that this is surreal.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What the fuck?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What is Factorio?

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then you get your fucking, oh my god, then you get your laser grid running, but then

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you realize by making your whole fucking laser grid defense system to attach to your electrical

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
system, if one goes down, they all go down and you're fucked and then you've got no defenses

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
whatsoever, so you can't leave.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You can't stop playing Factorio.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It isn't often.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can't.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You guys, I waste my whole night.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Can't you save and quit?

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's literally, it's literally, rape is what happened to me.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It forces you to play the game because if you don't, you lose the game.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's Sisyphus.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's the Sisyphus ball and it's fucked up and it's cruel, but it is very fun and I

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
do like making purple potions to evolve my tech trees and stuff, so it's also kind of

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
cool.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Anyway, I'm tired.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Star Trek Voyager is better than people say it is.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Good topic.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Nate, you know who's cool?

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Tuvok.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Dude, bro, Tuvok, episode's about Tuvok just being sad that he's away from his five children

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and a hot Vulcan wife.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That always hits me right in the right spot.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
God, I wish I had a hot Vulcan wife.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh no, and here comes another episode about how Nelix was traumatized by his home planet

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
being destroyed and his whole family dying.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wham, my whole family died.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Give me a fucking break.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know if you've seen it before, but there is an episode later in the series where

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Nelix and Tuvok go into the transporter together.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That episode was not okay.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That was not an acceptable episode.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They morph into a single entity called Tuvix and he's like, he's all the logic and reason

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
of Tuvok, but with all of the retardation and autism and charm and the resourcefulness

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and embarrassment and humiliating stupidity of Nelix combined into one great but horrible

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
person.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And then at the end of the episode, they have to essentially decide whether to euthanize

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
him by separating him back into his old selves.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And he's all sad about it, like, no, I'm a new entity, please don't kill me.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And they're like, no, we don't like you.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We want Tuvok back.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I really cannot impress upon people, and I think we talked about this in the PCP because

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I just saw that episode.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I could not believe the way that they framed that in the episode as it straight up is like

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Tuvix is like, he's working on the bridge or whatever they're like a Tuvix.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We order you to submit yourself for destruction.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's like, no, I don't care if it's cowardly.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I get to decide if I live or die.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And every member of the crew, like one by one, as if it was a fucking, I don't know, like

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
walking down the aisle or something, they all turn their back on him as Janeway orders

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
him to death as he fights for survival.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And just, it was the most fucked up thing I've ever seen a Starfleet captain do, I think,

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
just order one person to die for the greater good.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What the fuck?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can't do that Star Trek.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can't do that.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They just fucking did.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A captain is not supposed to order people to their death against their will when they don't

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
want to die.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There would be times when my boy Chakote, yo, tum, tum, Chakote, me speak Indian tribe words

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
based, thoroughly based, when truly the strangest alien of all, the Native American.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When a captain does shit that puts the crew in danger and they're acting irrationally

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
or unfairly, there are many people on the ship who have the authority to remove the

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
captain from command, namely the first officer being the main one, but also the medical officer

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and shit.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If he had, like, ordered, if Jan would order, like, the whole crew to, like, you know, commit

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
suicide or something, they'd be like, okay, well, that's not okay, but what if she had

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
just ordered, she ordered one man to commit suicide because she wanted the other two guys

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
back, personally.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That was a personal thing for her.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's, like, there was no, you can't even argue that, like, oh, they're stranded in the

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Delta Quadrant.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She needs a Tuvok back.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She had all the strengths of Tuvok.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That was arguable that Tuvoks was better than both of them individually and had, like,

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
both their strengths combined.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, this was not, like, it's coldly, there was no emergency.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
See, I thought they would frame the episode as there would be an emergency.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They, in this particular situation, they had to force them to defuse.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I guess that would make more sense.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's what they usually do stuff like that.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah, that's what they usually do stuff like that to get by it.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What if the fused person has a very short lifespan, but they just want to live it out?

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think Janeway's philosophy on this decision might have been that they need Tuvok and Nelix

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to be separated in case the opportunity arises to also sacrifice Nelix.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know what?

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It all makes sense now.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, everybody b******s about Nelix.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I haven't even found him particularly annoying.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There's, like, one good Nelix episode where, like, somebody dies

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and he, like, loses his faith in his stupid cat religion.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, yeah, in the Great Forest or whatever.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He personally dies, experiences no afterlife and completely loses his faith.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, that episode was like a-

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That was a tear-jerker.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That was a good episode because he-

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hey, wait a minute.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Nelix, Nelix.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Nelix.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Nelix, Brony Documentary.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Remember that?

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sounds about right.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Damn, I haven't heard that name in a while.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Jesse, did you beat the remake yet?

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I did.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I did.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You did.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It is completed.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm halfway through and I've decided to stop playing it because I don't like it.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't think it's your kind of game, Tom.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Just, even though a lot of people like it, it just doesn't strike me as a Tom kind of game.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So boring.

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Really?

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The side quests are just the worst, the absolute worst.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Absolutely.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We are.

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What do you mean?

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Forgot to see it.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ben, I said before, we're all recording this.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Forgot to see it.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, that's why I said, Ben, we're recording this.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I hope you are too because we started ahead of time.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You know, that's why that was clarified.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, I'm recording now.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You started early.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're not supposed to start before 3.10, but that's fine.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There's no rule that we have to start at 3.10.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't know anyone else was showing up.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We said, okay, if someone shows up, we won't pedal.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There are more guidelines than actual rules.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Sorry.

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, in any case.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
For the six previous minutes that I was in Audible.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay.

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Indeed.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Right.

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Tom.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Final Fantasy game.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The side quests are just so modern game design and I don't like them.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's definitely true.

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But Tom, I was wondering about this.

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why not just not do them?

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why not just skip all the side quests?

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Are they skippable?

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Some of them aren't.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Some of them are not.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There are some places where you have to do at least one, I think.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm in the wall market right now and Arith just got in her dress and it's just like,

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you know, hang out around the town with Johnny Cloud while I just doll Arith up.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm like, oh, this sucks.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I hate this.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think you have to do like one and then you can go back and trigger it or something to

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
progress, I believe.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's pretty gay and I don't like it.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do the squats.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do the squats, bro.

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I did the squats.

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That was the first thing I did.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I destroyed it and I thought it was going to be way harder, but it was literally just

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
hitting a button in order.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yep.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yep.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sick.

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It was fine.

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,200
So the game is kind of set up in a way where you kind of feel like you can't not do the

209
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,160
side quests because it puts you in these chapters that are basically just side quest chapters

210
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,640
and it tells you don't go to the thing until you do all the stuff.

211
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,880
So it like guilt trips you every time you try and like do something and then it like

212
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,720
punks you because you'll do all the side quests and then you'll go to the next part

213
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
of the mission.

214
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,720
Are you sure you want to go inside already, Cloud?

215
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
I'm like, what do you mean?

216
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I did everything.

217
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
It's all checked off.

218
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,600
You know, I wish they would change the dialogue.

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,360
So it's like, okay, wow, you've had a full day, Cloud, time for a good night's rest after

220
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
all that activity.

221
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Yeah.

222
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
That would go a long way for me.

223
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,080
And the way that it's set up like that kind of makes it so that there's no real secrets

224
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,240
in the game because everything that is extra is right there.

225
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,240
It's a side mission that is given to you and you just know about it immediately.

226
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,200
You know, I think like the only actual like secret boss is the Bahamut thing, but that's

227
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
not even secret.

228
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
You just know exactly what to do with the whole game.

229
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Just do all the guys.

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
You know, that's a spoil.

231
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,720
I do think there is one other thing beyond that that I've heard.

232
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
I haven't done it myself, but I'm looking into it.

233
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,720
I think there's one other boss.

234
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,960
Speaking of things that are in the game, it looks like I won that bet from last week.

235
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
What was the bet?

236
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,480
About whether you could have a date with Aretha Tifa or Barrett.

237
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
It looks like yes, you can.

238
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
That's not really a date.

239
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Part two is now.

240
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:19,360
Well, I mean, there's like one scene Slimes send me a link that said Final Fantasy 7 remake

241
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,000
date mechanics and romance scenes and it says date event happens in chapter 14 at the beginning

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
of chapter 14.

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
A dating event will occur where Cloud visits Aretha's garden at night.

244
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,840
Yeah, there's one scene where the part where you're staying at Aretha's house, Aretha's

245
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
house.

246
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm not saying Aretha.

247
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
You can't make me.

248
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,360
No one can do it.

249
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,680
We are staying at our house.

250
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,040
There's a scene where like inside your Barrett or Tifa, Aretha's in the garden and you talk

251
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
to them for like two minutes.

252
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
That's right, that's right.

253
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
It's not really a date though.

254
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
It's more like what are you doing out here in the garden?

255
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Okay, tell you what's bad.

256
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
I will go back.

257
00:11:52,040 --> 00:12:00,280
If it can be Tifa, Aretha's or Barrett, I'm pretty sure that's what I, that's it.

258
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,120
Well, okay, I mean, I'll have to go listen to the exact wording of the agreement.

259
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,920
If it's fair, if that's an accurate representation, we were talking about the gold saucer, but

260
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,400
if this covers that, I'll pay five bucks if I was just wrong about that.

261
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
It was ten.

262
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
You know, that's...

263
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
I mean, the term was that there would be a date.

264
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,200
There would be a date scene between...

265
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
But this isn't even a date.

266
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
It's one conversation.

267
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,480
But it's the same thing.

268
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,480
If there's a thing where you can get either Tifa or Aretha or Barrett with Cloud, that's

269
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,480
the new version of the same thing.

270
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,320
I mean, I thought we were specifically talking about the gold saucer.

271
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,560
Well, viewers, I don't know.

272
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,520
Go back and listen to the audio and draw your own conclusions.

273
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
I mean, I don't think...

274
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Who won the bet?

275
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,240
I don't think in the written up bet that there was like it has to be the gold saucer

276
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
one, but that's what we...

277
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
We talked about it.

278
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
We nailed down our terms.

279
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Exactly what we were discussing about it.

280
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,640
No, who gives a hoot?

281
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,880
I want my ten dollars.

282
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Let's look into it.

283
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,760
You know what's really fucking goofy about Final Fantasy 7 Remake that I write in the

284
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,320
beginning when you're going on like the bombing mission, like the second bomb mission, Reactor

285
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:13,400
Five or whatever, and you're having all those scenes in the subway car, and I don't know.

286
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,760
Maybe it's just me nitpicking, and this isn't really a problem, but I just found it hilarious

287
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,680
that it's like all these normal-looking people in business suits going to work, and then

288
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
Barrett just walks in with a fucking gatling gun on his arm and sword has this giant, and

289
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,040
cloud has this giant fucking sword, and nobody cares, and it's just like, oh man, these terrorist

290
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,400
guys are pretty scary.

291
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,960
I would hate to run into them.

292
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,440
Hi, Mr. Gatling Gunman.

293
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,760
Good to see you going to work today, and it's just like, how am I supposed to take this

294
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
seriously?

295
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,280
You know, to be fair, it was always like that, but I would argue this is one of those things

296
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
that just gets weirder, the more realistic.

297
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:54,080
If this was a PS1 blocky man game, it would just be fine, but because this is so realistic,

298
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,680
I'm just like, these people would notice that there's a man running around with a machine

299
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
gun strapped to his arm.

300
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,120
I've always thought it was very strange that nobody comments ever about Barrett having

301
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,520
a big old gun on his arm.

302
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,520
But he has this photorealistic argument with the Shinra employee, and why would you call

303
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,040
out the man with the machine gun arm in a tiny and closed space?

304
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,520
Are you kidding me?

305
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:24,480
I also like that the Shinra employee looks at the man with the machine gun for an arm

306
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:33,160
who is very clearly obviously a terrorist, and says, I bet you support the terrorists.

307
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,080
As Barrett comes in to defend the terrorists in the conversation.

308
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,720
With a bunch of guys behind him who also have guns and swords.

309
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,760
And then it's like later, after you blow up everything and the big fucking robot guy

310
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,920
and you get back from your actor five, and the guy's like, I've broadcasted you terrorists

311
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,720
all over the fucking world.

312
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,840
Everybody knows who you are.

313
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,560
You just get off the train and walk around as cloud and nobody cares.

314
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm just like, everyone was just paying attention to this epic fight, and they know who the

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
terrorists are.

316
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,680
They expose Avalanche, but then nobody cares.

317
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,480
They were on the TV.

318
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,760
Like what the fuck?

319
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,400
Why is this happening?

320
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,840
These people should realize that the man with the giant sword on his back, the only blonde

321
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,840
person in the entire world apparently, is now among you ridiculous.

322
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,280
I also like how it shattered.

323
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,480
It was really great.

324
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,520
It was a great logical change how the plate falling on sector seven did not matter at

325
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,080
all and absolutely nobody was hurt even slightly.

326
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,120
Everyone was fine.

327
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Every single person made it out.

328
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,760
Were there people on the top of the plate who lived there, the above grounders who maybe

329
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,520
fell onto them and all the bourgeois died?

330
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,160
That's a good question that would have also been a good question in the original game

331
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,720
and is something that we could have seen expanded upon here and you know, I always wondered

332
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,800
because they said so many times, we're going to expand Midgar, we're going to add things

333
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,520
that maybe should have been there the first time.

334
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,280
Like hunting rats.

335
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,560
Like rescuing a little girl's cats.

336
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,320
Are you fucking kidding me?

337
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,800
One has to think, okay, gee, what are the ways in which you could expand a game that

338
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,520
takes place in a massive eight sector city of which we only previously saw sectors five,

339
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
six and seven?

340
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,800
I don't know.

341
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,320
Maybe show me the other sectors of the city.

342
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Maybe let me explore.

343
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,280
Let's just stretch out the areas you've already seen to ridiculous proportions and destroy

344
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,480
the game's pacing completely and make every scene take 50 hours longer.

345
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
That makes a lot more sense.

346
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,640
I've been trying to absorb a lot of the people's reception and I think a lot of people just

347
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,200
love that like, I mean, I don't know man, I'm trying to give people the benefit of that

348
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,680
out here, but a lot of people seem to be like totally fine with just getting like, you know,

349
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,840
the same scenes, but now there's like more dialogue and like more expression and like,

350
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,640
oh, you know, Aris looks prettier now in while she's saying, you know, similar things to

351
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,920
before and then the time Janie show up and carry you out of the room.

352
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,600
The more I think about it, just like the more it totally blows my mind and baffles me that

353
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,600
they made the entire game Midgar and did not let me explore all of Midgar.

354
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,160
That was the last 20 years for, if not for that, we get the one extra area, the above

355
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,600
ground place of where Jesse's parents live.

356
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,720
That's one, I believe that is the one and only actual new area that we explore to any

357
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,840
degree and you know, hey, what is right, I forget, what is the difference between the

358
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,440
sectors that we explore in the original Final Fantasy seven is that like a five is where

359
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,000
Wal-Mart it is, five is Aris, and seven is Tifa's bar.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,600
I just wonder like what the other sectors would be like if you did go to them.

361
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,320
Yeah, I've wondered that my whole life, would it just be the same sort of stuff or yeah.

362
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,760
What you guys don't realize is that Final Fantasy seven remake part two is going to be all the

363
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,480
rest of Midgar and just going to be more fetched by, and we never go back until way later.

364
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Not now.

365
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,360
Now it's going to be totally different.

366
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,240
It's going to be Midgar too.

367
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,200
Yeah, you know, I will happily plant my flag though that like, I understand Jesse, I felt

368
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,120
very similar for a long time, however, I long since have thought that like, even if we did

369
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,080
explore that, that Square Enix would not fill those areas with anything good or satisfying.

370
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,720
So that, I mean, that's been my issue, so I just had no hope.

371
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,920
Another thing about this game that is incredibly silly is that it's trying to like set up these

372
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,920
tense moments, but then it seems to want to add gameplay that undermines those moments.

373
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,520
And I find it very funny.

374
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:06,280
Like the, you know, like you, you rescue Eris, I'm going to keep saying Eris because I'm

375
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,040
playing this game, but forgive me for my sins.

376
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,400
But and you fight the like the Turk guy and like the first, the guy is like, you have

377
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,440
to learn how to use the counter and stuff to beat him.

378
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Yes.

379
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,080
And all the fucking crazy ghost men are in the house and you're trying to escape like

380
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,640
they're chasing you.

381
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,040
And it gets to a point where like you have to knock down a chandelier or something to

382
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,560
like distract them and like get Eris out of there.

383
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,840
And it's like supposed to be this tense scene of like making this one like distracting move

384
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,320
so you can both get out of there and they start shooting at you as you're supposed to get

385
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
away.

386
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,160
But instead of just making it a cut scene, you have to like slowly grapple on the ceiling

387
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,760
and you're just getting shot with bullets and they're doing like two points of damage.

388
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm like, so this just I could just sit here for like 40 minutes and take like a tenth

389
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,520
of my actual HP and damage and they just won't move from this one spot tension deflated.

390
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,800
And it's just like, why, why do it like that?

391
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,000
Just have it be a cut scene.

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,200
There's so many things like that.

393
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,560
Like at a certain point, you get like melee weapons for Barrett and one of them is just

394
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,600
like a big stupid steel ball.

395
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Yeah, I know.

396
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,520
But like in the cut scenes, you still have Barrett like threatening people with a gun.

397
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,320
Like I'm going to shoot you with this big stupid steel ball that does nothing.

398
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Oh, I like this big like scissor hand one.

399
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
He would point.

400
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Oh, he's going to cut you.

401
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Barrett's going to.

402
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Yeah.

403
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,240
I've also always thought it was, I mean, I appreciate that Barrett has some like melee weapons

404
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,600
because it's always been weird that like the biggest hulkenist roided out his boy is

405
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
like gunman.

406
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
They're terrible to use.

407
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
They're so slow.

408
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Yeah.

409
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,680
And like the fun of Barrett is shooting.

410
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,080
Yeah, but yeah.

411
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,440
And in the in the original game, you didn't have that problem because it was all just

412
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,600
to turn base the same battle system for everyone.

413
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,680
So the melee attacks were just as quick and snappy as the gun attacks.

414
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,560
Were you were you disappointed spoilers?

415
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,280
I guess for Tom and other people, not really spoiler that that red 13 was not playable.

416
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,600
I mean, I kind of thought that was reasonable considering a little time.

417
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,200
He would have been playable for like five minutes.

418
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,520
So what would the yeah, who gives a crap?

419
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,320
But Jesse, tell me the ghost, the time, the final battle, you got to tell me what you think

420
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,160
I've been dying to hear your perspective.

421
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,920
I will say this.

422
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:29,360
I am not disappointed, obviously, because Square Enix did exactly what Square Enix does

423
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,000
and exactly what I knew Square Enix would do.

424
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,120
You wouldn't be disappointed if a crocodile bit you because that's its nature.

425
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,640
I'm not, I'm not sad.

426
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,840
I'm not angry at Square Enix.

427
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,720
You know who I'm angry at, Nate?

428
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,600
I'm angry at all the people who are only just now crying foul, who are acting surprised

429
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
by this.

430
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,680
Who didn't see this coming?

431
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,040
If you didn't see this coming five years ago, then it's exactly what you deserve.

432
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,960
I'll admit, I did not expect them to go this far.

433
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I didn't think they would do this.

434
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,440
I don't know what this ending is.

435
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,720
I've heard a lot of people complain about it, but there was one person on my Twitter

436
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,960
feed who just like, man, I just finished Final Fantasy 7.

437
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Love the ending.

438
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Amazing twist.

439
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,400
Can't wait to see what they do in part two.

440
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,880
Did this person play the original?

441
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Yeah.

442
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Okay.

443
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,800
Well, you know, there's a school of thought that I find reprehensible that any change

444
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,720
is good because it's new.

445
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,160
I played the original, you know, cool game, liked it, but now it's time for new things.

446
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,000
I like things that are different, not the same.

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,520
The same is bad and boring.

448
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,400
That's why I bought a game called Final Fantasy 7.

449
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,680
And that really, it opens up a can of worms on like, what was the expectation?

450
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,400
I feel like a lot of people are, you know, I'm so exhausted.

451
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,240
I've been thinking about this so much and like I, last night I was playing factorial

452
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
all night.

453
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
I maybe want to kill myself.

454
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,240
And then I wake up and I go and I watch like one guy's video.

455
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,680
This was the most sober take I've heard from somebody on YouTube.

456
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,440
Maybe I'll, maybe we'll get his name.

457
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,360
And the whole video, he was like, okay, I was, I did not want this remake.

458
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,360
I was scared of it and I knew it would not be good.

459
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,720
I was by the sky name.

460
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,200
Never knows best.

461
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Never knows best.

462
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Yes.

463
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
That's the one.

464
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
And he gets to whatever he's talking about.

465
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,400
And he's like, oh, but actually the game won me over because it was like good at points.

466
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,080
And I was like, okay, like sure, the gameplay is kind of fun sometimes.

467
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
I agree.

468
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
I agree.

469
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,960
But I'm like, okay, but how about he's saving his big point for the end.

470
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,200
And he does get to the end of his point where he's like, okay, yes.

471
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,440
Like the ending is like a nightmare.

472
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,400
The fact that they're like setting us free from destiny.

473
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,920
Like every logical aspect of my body tells me based on knowing these developers and what

474
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
screenings does.

475
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Sure.

476
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,240
They're giving themselves free reign to write new stuff.

477
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,680
These people are not good at making stories.

478
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,120
We've seen for decades.

479
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,240
They don't know what they're doing this team.

480
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,040
So to be excited for a new story is nonsensical.

481
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,560
And yet, and yet I'm kind of excited for new stuff guys.

482
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
I can't wait to see what happens.

483
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,680
Why would you end on that point?

484
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Why?

485
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:14,280
My final point was it will be bad, but there's no getting off this train we're on, which

486
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
is a cheeky little bit of reference.

487
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
I hate that point so much.

488
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
It personally offends me.

489
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,560
Like that's a defense of these choices.

490
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,680
Fun fact about that video.

491
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,320
That guy never knows best commented over the last week on my old Final Fantasy 7, you cannot

492
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,480
remake it will be fucking bad video.

493
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,280
And his comment is comment was damn it.

494
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,400
I wanted to use some variant of Final Fantasy 7.

495
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,840
You cannot remake in a video title, but then thought I'd better check to make sure no one

496
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
has done so already.

497
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
And here I am.

498
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,760
And five fucking years ago to truly ahead of its time really great video.

499
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,480
I loved it to not attend and watch it twice.

500
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,080
So that that review, which I think is still the best review so far that I've seen of the

501
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,920
game from anyone.

502
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,920
It was originally going to be called you cannot remake but he checked out and saw that I already

503
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,720
did that five years ago, which everyone should have checked and seen that I already did that.

504
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,600
You know, I'm seeing yeah, it's making the rounds and I'm even seeing people like attributing

505
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,800
it to people like, oh, how clever for of Pat from two best friends played who have said

506
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
that thing.

507
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,360
Yeah, I kind of said it five years ago.

508
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,600
I kind of predicted all of this and you didn't listen.

509
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,120
I warned you all and you didn't listen.

510
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,800
And now now that I'm right, as usual, every time that I'm vindicated and proven right,

511
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
nobody cares.

512
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,320
Nobody's going to acknowledge it.

513
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
That's all I want.

514
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,360
Just to make knowledge from the world that I told you so just once I've been getting

515
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,240
a couple of comments on my on my video.

516
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,960
Some saying, wow, bro, you were sure we're right.

517
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,680
And others saying this is embarrassing, you know, bet you regret this one now.

518
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,760
And you know, truly it is the duality of man.

519
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,840
I now that I've seen all this, I can't deny that I like had lots of fun playing through

520
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,360
I like, I'm more of a grindy kind of guy in this game was grindy as hell for the side

521
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
missions.

522
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,040
And I enjoyed zoning out and watching Star Trek Voyager while engaging in the gameplay

523
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,080
loop, which is pretty fun.

524
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,360
So I like all that stuff.

525
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,560
But but then the whole question rains is like, this could have been Final Fantasy 16 this

526
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,880
battle system with like new stories.

527
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,240
But the fact that it's a remake, the only thing that's relevant to that is like the

528
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
story.

529
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
That's like the most important thing.

530
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,400
And in my humble opinion, I think some mistakes were made.

531
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,600
So did you find this game to be, I don't know, do you, do you like it?

532
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Is it good?

533
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Are you a fan?

534
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:41,240
I'm just totally split lots that are good.

535
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,920
I mean, it has like moments of fun, I guess, in terms of the combat, even though I think

536
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,440
the game probably should have just been a standard turn based.

537
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,120
I mean, like by the time the game came out, I had been dreading it for so many years that

538
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,920
like I just didn't care anymore.

539
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,520
So it couldn't have possibly disappointed me or let me down because I was I was just

540
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,960
at a point where it's like, you know what, I don't fucking care.

541
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,720
I'm just going to take the fucking ride.

542
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Fuck it.

543
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,600
And so I did and like again, none of the bad stuff surprised me in any way because it's

544
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
exactly what I expected.

545
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,240
So I wasn't like taking a backer like, oh, I can't believe they did this.

546
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,400
I'm like, of course they did that.

547
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,520
That's exactly what they would do.

548
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Yeah.

549
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,800
So I was just kind of like being used by the whole thing.

550
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,440
And I mean, the game was fun.

551
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,320
So I guess everybody was right, but I was the most right.

552
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,680
It's I mean, I generally don't like the mindset.

553
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,600
Of like, you know, I'll accept this, I'll purchase this video game based on the fact

554
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,120
that they they wanted to make money again.

555
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,280
So they just gave it the name of a popular game and then everybody bought it because

556
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,040
it had the name.

557
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,400
And it's, you know, it's okay and it's not great and the original is better in a lot

558
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:03,160
of ways and blah, blah, but you know, overall, I endorse that this this business practice

559
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,960
and I will do it again the next time they come back with some thing that I recognize

560
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,560
I will buy it and say that it's okay.

561
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
And I'll just keep doing that over and over again forever.

562
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
That's what we're doing.

563
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
That's what we're encouraging.

564
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,120
You know, to me, the most the most offensive part of the whole remake, more offensive than

565
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,680
the Time Jannies or the fucking Kingdom Hearts fighting the big black guy for the beginning

566
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,480
of Kingdom Hearts at the end of the game, not not a black guy like Barrett.

567
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,320
I mean, a big black, you know, like a massive goo.

568
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
What's that thing called?

569
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Yeah.

570
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
What's the fuck?

571
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Yeah.

572
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
You know what I'm everyone knows.

573
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
I'm fucking talking.

574
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,320
Literally just that guy is the final boss of the game.

575
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
More offensive than that.

576
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,600
More offensive than like the Sephiroth and his stupid wing and a little sword fight with

577
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,040
him at the end, which completely takes away any mystique or power or, you know, threat

578
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
of him.

579
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,720
Some people are like, oh, I can't wait for them to read Victor.

580
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,600
They cannot do the rest of the game the way it originally was.

581
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
You already kicked his ass.

582
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Now that this has happened.

583
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,400
Claude kicks his ass like in the first part of the game now.

584
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Yeah.

585
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,200
Dude, what about the fucking Advent Children cutscene where he's flying around and cutting

586
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
fucking buildings in half?

587
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm so confused.

588
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
Oh, yeah.

589
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:16,800
I love how like Nomura only has one ending of a game that he can think of.

590
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,320
It's Kingdom Hearts 2 flying through the buildings.

591
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Yeah.

592
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,680
Whether it's a movie or a game, that's all he knows how to write.

593
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,320
It's just, oh, what do I do at the end here?

594
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,000
Oh, they fly through a void and cut buildings in half.

595
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That'll be cool.

596
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,320
Do you put much stock into this thing that like, oh, it's okay that that happened, Jesse,

597
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,400
because it was in like an alternate dimension world where like, you know, it wasn't, it

598
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,040
was like an alternate dimension world, you know, they weren't in like literal Midgar.

599
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,400
They were in like fake wreckage world.

600
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,560
So it's like, okay, that Claude, and like it makes sense that Claude could like fly

601
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
and get what you're saying.

602
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
I fucking, who gives a fuck?

603
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,080
I just don't want to have this conversation is the main thing.

604
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,680
I don't want to have to think about these things.

605
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,520
I fucking like did a backflip off of a motorcycle onto another motorcycle in definitely real

606
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Midgar.

607
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,800
I don't know if that really flies.

608
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,600
You know, it's like, there are parts in the story where it tries to do the advent children

609
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,440
flipping off motorcycle stuff, but there are also a lot of parts where it tries to be

610
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,280
more grounded and have like realistic physics.

611
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,200
And it's just totally clashes with itself because it can't decide whether it's an anime

612
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,960
or like a realistic, you know, cyberpunk dystopia.

613
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,400
It's part in the original, I mean, in the good one when Claude was in a coma and ate

614
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,920
shit and died and fell in a wheelchair into the fucking live stream.

615
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,000
That was now that was advent children shit.

616
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I want to see.

617
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,080
I want to see him tumble, crippled down a fucking hill and his fucking wheelchair get

618
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,760
pushed by Tifa because she's been caring for him for too long.

619
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,800
She's sick of his shit because it's part eight of the fucking remake.

620
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,160
And it's the whole game where you just play taking care of clouds, retarded brain simulator.

621
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,600
And you know, at the bad end is where, oh, fuck, I'm sick of this guy.

622
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,000
He didn't even like me.

623
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
He chose areas over.

624
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,320
He did the era state instead of me.

625
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,720
So she fucking, you know, euthanized them and it's supposed to play.

626
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Yeah.

627
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Hilarious.

628
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
That's.

629
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Oh, right.

630
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
My point.

631
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
More offensive than all that.

632
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,440
Even more offensive than Zach, you know, that whole shit, the cra...

633
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,800
More offense, the most offense, the one part of the game that actually made me yell at

634
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
my TV screen.

635
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:24,200
Oh, fuck you was Rufus Shinra's pants.

636
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,880
The pants, the design.

637
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,800
The whole damn guy.

638
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,840
As soon as I saw those pants, I thought, there's the Nomura I know.

639
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,360
That's my boy.

640
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,560
You know, but he designed Shinra the first time.

641
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Yeah.

642
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
They're, what happened?

643
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,480
Well, I can tell you exactly what happened is he was new to the company and he had no

644
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,560
real authority and someone told him probably Sakaguchi or like the people responsible for

645
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
designing Midgar in the look of the game.

646
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,200
They probably said to him, this is the look of the game.

647
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:05,480
We are going for a Western steampunk, you know, cyberpunk, technological, modern aesthetic.

648
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,800
People have to be dressed like they would fit in the modern age.

649
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,080
The bad guys are not wearing like cleric robes or wizard robes or no one's wearing night

650
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
armor.

651
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,240
We're wearing like suits, like people wear in real life, draw the characters like that.

652
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,680
And the characters to just look like regular people for the most part in regular clothes

653
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
because that's the aesthetic of the game.

654
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,000
And because he was a lowly grunt at the time, he said, yes, boss, this is what I will do.

655
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,320
I will please my bosses and he designed them that way.

656
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,120
But deep down inside, he had a burning rage going, oh God, if only I could make them anime,

657
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,400
I just want to make them more anime.

658
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,000
And so now 20 years later, he has taken the reins of the company in this slow, insidious

659
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,480
hostile takeover, also that he could get to this moment and finally rectify that one mistake

660
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,440
and finally he can turn these characters into anime and have weird cut up pants that look

661
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,600
like they went through a paper shredder.

662
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,200
And so that's what he did now.

663
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,880
He's finally fixed his greatest regret in life.

664
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,480
He's made characters look significantly stupider.

665
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,600
Reno, his whole thing is that he's, you know, he's kind of lazy and slovenly.

666
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,240
So his suit is, you know, like it's open.

667
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,800
He doesn't wear like a tie.

668
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
He doesn't have his coat buttoned up.

669
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,920
That tells you all you need to know about the character.

670
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Right there.

671
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
It's perfectly fine.

672
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,320
All the other Turks are buttoned up and they look spiffy and snazzy.

673
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,360
Don't you love how we've improved the pacing of the game by having Cloud immediately kick

674
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,760
Reno's ass in their first meeting, deflating all tension or narrative weight of Turks?

675
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,360
But it's not enough for him to just have his jacket open and not have a tie on.

676
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,360
He has to have like a weird anime sash around it.

677
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,160
Did you notice the weird sash?

678
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,440
No, I did not notice that.

679
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
I did not.

680
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
I'll take your word for it though.

681
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,920
Like his jacket is not an actual, it doesn't have buttons.

682
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
It's not just unbuttoned.

683
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
It has no buttons.

684
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,040
It just has a weird sash.

685
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,920
It's a small thing to complain about, I know, but really the pants is what just was like

686
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
a step.

687
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
That was crossing the line for me.

688
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,600
That was the point where I finally went, you son of a bitch, those pants are the worst

689
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,520
thing I have ever seen in my life.

690
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,120
How am I supposed to make this guy seriously as a threat when he looks like that?

691
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,200
God, I mean, Rude looks great.

692
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,600
Rude just looks like he always looked, aka good and cool.

693
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,160
He looks like a teenager at prom in 2007.

694
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,400
Yes, Reno does.

695
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,680
Rude is based in Red Pilled and Love.

696
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
Not Rude.

697
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,680
Yeah.

698
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,680
Rude looks good.

699
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Love is black tie.

700
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Black on black, baby.

701
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,600
What was I going to say?

702
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:45,160
The argument around Rufus's design in the remake, I think it really, it's such a great

703
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,440
microcosm of everyone's thought process because obviously this is detail that doesn't matter

704
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,120
that much, but it informs the character it's interesting, right?

705
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,760
It's like you say, oh, God, they changed his design.

706
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
What's that about?

707
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,120
Then the response is going to be like, oh, he looks fine.

708
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
What's the problem?

709
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,160
Okay, well, I'm actually looking at it and I just don't like it.

710
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,000
It doesn't really fit with the character, blah, blah, blah.

711
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,800
Then the response becomes, well, Nomura did it.

712
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,760
He's the one who designed it originally, so what are you complaining about?

713
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,080
It's the same people doing it.

714
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,960
Okay, well, you know, times have changed.

715
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,600
Nomura designed it when he had bosses and people smarter than him telling him what

716
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,800
to do, but now that he doesn't have people higher up telling him what to do, he can do

717
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,120
whatever stupid shit he's always wanted to do, and so now the characters look stupid.

718
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,160
It doesn't even make sense from a character standpoint.

719
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
Rufus is like this silver spoon.

720
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,880
He's the heir to the company.

721
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,840
He's dressed to impress at all times.

722
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,360
He would just be wearing a regular suit, wouldn't he?

723
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
That makes sense.

724
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
It's not a phase, dad.

725
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,280
It's not a regular suit that's white and cool looking.

726
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,240
No, he has to have silly, goofy, paper shredder anime pants.

727
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,320
Rufus Shinra has become Ben St. going to Hot Topic, buying those big ass pants with

728
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,440
straps and shit, going, it's not a phase, mom, goth is a lifestyle, and I will choose

729
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
to live by it.

730
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,120
This will be my governing policy when I take over Shinra.

731
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,480
I do think I would have really liked this look when I was a teenager.

732
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
That's true.

733
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
You would have appreciated it.

734
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
It looks big.

735
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,400
It looks big, bulky, and a skirt.

736
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Does it look like a flowing coat?

737
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,640
To be fair, I want to point out that the original Rufus did not simply have pants.

738
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,800
He did have sort of like a long coat thing going on.

739
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Okay, that's true.

740
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,800
It didn't look like this, but I mean, polygons would not have allowed it.

741
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Indeed.

742
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
I mean, it wasn't this.

743
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,100
It wasn't like this.

744
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
This fuck.

745
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,600
This is some fucking Hot Topic bullshit.

746
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Yes.

747
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Yes.

748
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,120
I mean, his design was a bit silly before, but we've just really taken it to 11 now,

749
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,120
and I mean, it just kind of looked like he was wearing a trench coat, which, yeah, yeah,

750
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
which was cool.

751
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,720
Well, it's like, he's got like a suit jacket over a trench coat, which is a little weird.

752
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
It is weird.

753
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,360
I fully acknowledge his design was kind of strange previously.

754
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:04,560
I just think it's clearly way more so and more Hot Topic-y now than it was before.

755
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
The case.

756
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Indeed.

757
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Well, there you go.

758
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,440
I mean, of course, and eventually, I don't know, the whole thing just comes back to like,

759
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,680
yeah, I mean, you know, you remake something and like you can't encapsulate like every

760
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,960
little detail of a thing in a, you can't just upscale everything and give them all the same

761
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,400
spells and stuff and expect it to be like the same experience.

762
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
You know what?

763
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,120
In that guy, Never Knows Best video, he made a chart that was very educational where he

764
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,080
pointed out that like product is made and then like divergent path, person interprets

765
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,680
product and then there's another divergent path, other person interprets product.

766
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,560
But then that other guy who interpreted it, in this case, the creators or whatever, then

767
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,840
they make a remake and then it is consumed by the viewer and the dichotomy between like

768
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,520
the different interpretations of the thing.

769
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Like I just don't care.

770
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,480
I just don't care what any individual developer thought about Final Fantasy VII when it was

771
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
being developed.

772
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,520
It can be interesting to know, but I don't care.

773
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,640
What I care about is the product that actually came out.

774
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,640
That's the only thing that matters and it was good.

775
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,440
And this is the reason for all the issues that I'm seeing before me right now.

776
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Well, actually, that's not even true.

777
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,240
When you just change the whole story and add literal fate deviation mechanics to a plot.

778
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay.

779
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:28,320
The way that it was handled with the time janitors and stuff and like Sephiroth like

780
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,160
vaguely being aware of Destiny and Eris vaguely being aware, but they don't really say whether

781
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,160
or not they are or not.

782
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
They don't really explain it.

783
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Fuck you, Eris.

784
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Spit it out.

785
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
You fucking bitch.

786
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Just say that you know who.

787
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
It's like that.

788
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,760
It was handled very clunkily and very terribly and badly because Nomura wrote it.

789
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
So of course it was.

790
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,920
Because they want to leave everything wide open because they don't know what they're

791
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
doing.

792
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Right.

793
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,320
The concept of it itself, I don't really give a shit about either way because of course

794
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,600
it was going to be a new canon.

795
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,240
Why would you even expect anything else?

796
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,480
I mean the fact that a remake exists in the first place is itself an indication of new

797
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,680
canon because it's going to be different.

798
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,600
It was always going to be different to some degree and the fact that it's different to

799
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,000
a large degree doesn't change anything.

800
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,360
People are saying, it's kind of getting on my nerves how many people are going, oh they

801
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,000
falsely advertised it as a remake.

802
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,520
They lied to us.

803
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,920
No, they didn't.

804
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,000
You know, you're not going to find anyone more defensive of the original Final Fantasy

805
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,960
7 than me but this argument that they somehow falsely advertised or lied to people doesn't

806
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
hold water for me.

807
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,960
It just sounds like stupid.

808
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
I believe that a little bit.

809
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,760
I'm not one of these people who would sue them.

810
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,320
I just feel cheated by playing the product.

811
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,480
In order to believe that it was going to be an exact representation of the original,

812
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,120
you would have had to not pay attention to Square Enix for the last 20 years.

813
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:02,920
I don't think that, I think you're trying to give them a pass on this issue that just

814
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:09,200
because they've made bad stories, a remake, people have been bringing up the example and

815
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,920
it was a bunch of people like never knows best, whatever, people will be like I love

816
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,000
getting my expectations subverted.

817
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,020
Remember Metal Gear Solid 2 guys?

818
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,520
That was so genius.

819
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,480
This game, it could have been good, it was just done bad.

820
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,800
A sequel is not the same as a remake.

821
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,580
There are things you can do in a sequel that is a totally different situation from calling

822
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,840
something a remake.

823
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:37,240
When they remade Final Fantasy 4 in the 3D models for the DS, that was a remake.

824
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,160
Why didn't they change the story?

825
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,640
Why didn't they do that?

826
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,240
Because it's Final Fantasy 4 a remake.

827
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,400
Why did they change it this time?

828
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,880
I don't know because they don't want to gamble on making Final Fantasy 16 so they put all

829
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,480
their hopes on a remake and they cram all their terrible ideas into this because it's

830
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
what they got.

831
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,000
It's because they know it'll sell.

832
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,320
This is the rationale going on in my mind and I find it deceptive and duplicitous.

833
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,200
I do not think they deserve a pass in the same way that you can give.

834
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm not giving them a pass, I'm just saying.

835
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,280
All this anger and betrayal that people are dealing with now, I have been dealing with

836
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,320
and coming to terms with since it was announced.

837
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,440
Since Advent Children came out in 2005, that's when I noticed that this train was going off

838
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
the fucking rails.

839
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,920
So I've just long since come to terms with this.

840
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,640
I can't muster the kind of gamer rage that so many are having over this because it's

841
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,720
like yeah, what did you expect?

842
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,400
I have been uniquely surprised by the particular way that this has happened.

843
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,200
I did not expect it so perhaps, I don't know, that's why I feel strongly.

844
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,880
There was a good point that never knows best brought up in his video that I agree with,

845
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,560
I think, maybe, and would like to expand on just to see if I agree with it coming out

846
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,600
of my own face.

847
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:08,400
So this idea of we're going to remake a little bit of the game first and then use that as

848
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,320
a springboard to maybe surprise people and tell a new story, okay, I can, you know what?

849
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,000
I can deal, I can vibe with it, that's fine.

850
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,040
Do your silly little fan fiction, do whatever crazy stupid bullshit you want, so go ahead

851
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,800
and surprise me in the next game, that's fine.

852
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:33,560
However, what makes more sense to make this deviation when they leave Midgar or to make

853
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:40,120
this deviation, oh, I don't know, at the part of the game where the disc changed, where

854
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Aris dies, the most important scene in the game, wouldn't that make more sense to be

855
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,840
the point where the story of this first one ends and then you put a little stinger in

856
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,440
there that says, hey, maybe we can deviate a little bit, wouldn't that be better in every

857
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
way?

858
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,840
Well, that just gets back into the issue that is so easy for us to ignore now that this

859
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,440
is a tenth of a fucking game, that this is, you know, like, it's so easy to forget that

860
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,080
with everything going on.

861
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,200
And like, in some way, I guess the way they're doing it, like, okay, they've kind of given

862
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,760
themselves leverage because they are going to be doing just something different now.

863
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,520
But I mean, I just don't trust them, I don't trust the artistic integrity of these people

864
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,440
to like, they sat down like five years ago and said, here's what we're doing, guys, we're

865
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,320
making the first one at the end, we're including a scene where we say Destiny's Change and

866
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,240
this is our plan, we know what we're doing, they don't know what they're doing, there

867
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,480
is no plan, they just know that now they've given themselves the ability to do anything,

868
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,400
so they did not sit down, I guarantee you, and plan anything beyond like, guys, what

869
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,560
if we subverted expectations, what if we did that?

870
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:51,040
This is their guiding star, and they think it makes a good game, and they're wrong,

871
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,760
because there's a lot, there's like meaning, but I guess nothing means anything, right?

872
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,800
Like every story, it doesn't matter how good or what the point of a story is, it just matters

873
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,640
if it subverts expectations, that's all that matters, right?

874
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:10,120
I wonder if they're going to somehow, like, make Sephiroth like, turn good and be like,

875
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,320
we have to stop Genova, guys, she was the bad, Genova was bad, I'm on the team now,

876
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,400
and Sephiroth just joins the party, I'm just, I'm just spittballing ways that it could be

877
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
silly and stupid at this point, because I'm just entertained by it.

878
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,440
I think you're going to save Eris and kill Tifa, I think this motherfucker is going to

879
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,400
do the stupidest possible thing, I mean, hey, it's a new world, maybe, we can do whatever

880
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,920
we want, so let's save Eris and kill Tifa, that is the most obvious thing you could

881
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,360
possibly do, and I would put money, it's going to happen, I would bet, I'll bet anybody

882
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,520
ten dollars right now, Eris lives, Tifa dies, I will bet that happens, who wants to take

883
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,040
me up for ten dollars?

884
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,680
It's certainly possible, anything's possible.

885
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,680
Anything's possible.

886
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:59,120
I don't know, I don't know whether you can kill a woman these days, I don't know if

887
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,120
that's possible.

888
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:06,360
Yeah, I mean, Jesse, you've seen the end now, nobody died, as you said, forget that, every

889
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,480
Avalanche member, oh, sorry, we don't know, the millions of Avalanche members that are

890
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,240
out there, but the ones we're doing now, they're all alive.

891
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,640
Just this once, Rose, everyone lives, everybody, they're all fine.

892
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,360
I don't know, I said this somewhere before, but in Gernlagen, the show, there's an episode

893
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,760
where all the supporting cast from earlier in the show dies, and a lot of people felt

894
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,240
that it was abrupt and kind of cheap and kind of sucked, but they all died.

895
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,480
When they made a movie, it was basically a remake of that scene, like the second part

896
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:45,840
of the series, they just changed that scene, such that all those characters just live now,

897
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,960
they just changed it, and what did it do?

898
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,360
It just made people happy, who didn't want to see them die, and it undid a little bit

899
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,360
of the tragedy that moment, but whatever, they piled it on a ketan.

900
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,120
I think that is like the worst, most hacky decision ever made in the history of things

901
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,960
I like, and I mean, it's just exactly the same thing here.

902
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
You just don't get to do that.

903
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:15,520
It makes you sad when a character dies, but that's the point, you're supposed to feel

904
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,600
sad so that you can feel happy when the victory is achieved.

905
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,720
I'm hearing people make this argument.

906
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,960
I mean, yes, literally stories are, you don't need to defend these fictional people that

907
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,320
only exist in fucking bits and bytes, they literally feel no pain, they exist to serve

908
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,040
a story, but I've been hearing people make the argument that like, okay, okay, in the

909
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,000
original, the point of that story, like sure, Sakaguchi had a theme, it was life, right?

910
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,520
The theme of the game was life.

911
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,240
So it's about like, you know, the fragility of life, and you know, like the difference

912
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,080
that human beings can make with their life, and after death, whoa bro, maybe that can

913
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:55,560
do some shit too, hence the whole heiress dying thing, it was kind of important.

914
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,520
But everyone's like, oh no, no, no, now, see, it's a new thing, it's a remake, right?

915
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,840
It's a totally different story.

916
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,440
The new story is about changing fate.

917
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,440
Okay, well, for a moment I could put on my philosopher's hat, fate literally doesn't

918
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,920
exist in the real life.

919
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,520
So what am I supposed to learn?

920
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,120
What exactly is the point of this story?

921
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,120
There is none.

922
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,640
I mean, point of the story aside, as long as they are actually changing the theme.

923
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, because one theme is good, one theme is bad, changing fate,

924
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,320
he didn't fall in SE 13, it meant nothing, nothing happened.

925
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,200
The thing that's different though is that in the Gurren Lagann thing, the story is exactly

926
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,600
the same, they just saved people to make people happy.

927
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Correct.

928
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,320
Even though like it diminishes some aspect of the tragedy, which is a good thing for

929
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,320
a story to have.

930
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,280
So that was annoying, but far less important than changing something like FF7's deaths,

931
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,120
which are integral to the point of the story.

932
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,880
Yeah, but that's my point, is that if they are actually changing the theme and the story,

933
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,480
then the deaths are not as important as before.

934
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,640
In theory, I see your point.

935
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,720
It's just that when you change it to a theme that I would argue is inherently vacuous and

936
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,640
has no narrative weight to it, or meaning, like this idea of changing fate means nothing.

937
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
It means nothing.

938
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,640
I don't know.

939
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,520
And the fact that the original game is cast as the bad ending, you see that fucking Red

940
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,520
13 clip?

941
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,520
Yeah.

942
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,520
What the fuck is that about?

943
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,520
I was gonna say that.

944
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:31,760
You know, I saw an interview with someone who was working on the remake, and he's like,

945
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,320
well, the original game ended with everyone in the whole world dying and there's no people

946
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
left.

947
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,120
That fucking kinkase that retarded dumbass motherfucker.

948
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,400
First of all, it was meant to be ambiguous, and second of all, it wasn't even that ambiguous

949
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,120
because you heard like the children laughing at the end or whatever.

950
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:53,000
So like it does imply that just Midgar has been abandoned and people are still living.

951
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You know who I know?

952
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,680
I just would 100% know that nobody, the world was not wiped out.

953
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:04,280
It's because if humanity was wiped out by Holy, what the fuck did it matter that Eris

954
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,080
died and any of that should happen?

955
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,720
Why didn't just we let Sephiroth win if the livestream was just going to save everyone

956
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,840
anyway and humanity made no difference anyway?

957
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,240
They're like, of course everyone survived.

958
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,760
It would be literal bad ending of no narrative weight if everyone died.

959
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,600
Of course humanity wasn't wiped out by Holy.

960
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,360
That would be the most nihilistic interpretation possible about how life has no meaning.

961
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,760
And I refuse to believe that was the point of the story.

962
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Just the attitude.

963
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,080
I mean like even them changing stuff and like having a new canon and kind of like a rebuild

964
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:46,360
sort of story from here on out, fine, whatever, you do you man, even that is fine.

965
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:52,120
But just the arrogant attitude, the audacity of saying, like basically directly saying

966
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:58,200
the old ending was bad, the old story was bad, the new one will be good.

967
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh my god, I'm hearing people now saying, oh my god this made me want to fucking explode.

968
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,640
I heard people say the old end, straight up they said like fans are saying the old ending

969
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,960
let's be real guys, the old ending was pretty bad, it wasn't that good, we got to change

970
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,960
it up.

971
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,080
I didn't understand what happened, therefore it's bad.

972
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,520
How can you even try to- Literally, I'm hearing this.

973
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,240
How can you even try to bullshit people and say that the original ending was like objectively

974
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,720
the whole world, everyone died.

975
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,680
Did you forget your own fucking sequel where everyone was perfectly fine two years later?

976
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,760
I try to ignore the continuity of that but you know what another point I was thinking

977
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:46,000
about, you know how in the, it's said in Advent Children that like geostigma, like even putting

978
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,240
aside the fact that Advent Children in order to exist means that humans continue to live.

979
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,760
Okay, but what about geostigma, ooh the planet was mad at everybody, right?

980
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,560
That's why the planet infected everybody with geostigma, literally wrong.

981
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,960
It was literally just Genova cells polluting the life stream and at the end Eris and the

982
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,880
life stream come back to cure everyone because they're good and they're not bad and humanity

983
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,440
isn't evil and toxic.

984
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,800
The point of Final Fantasy 7 is not that humanity needs to die, that's like the attitude Barrett

985
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,000
had at the beginning that he grows out of over the course of the game.

986
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,920
Terrorism is not good, don't kill people for the greater good.

987
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,040
And it's also worth noting that a big part of that development for both Barrett and Tifa

988
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:39,040
is that Avalanche in its first incarnation in Midgar was a complete failure and got all

989
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,880
of Sector 7 killed.

990
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,200
That's kind of important, but now everyone in Sector 7 lives.

991
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,240
Who's gonna argue to me, Maximilian fucking dude, all you fucking people who think this

992
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:57,560
thing is like good writing, it's so obvious that it's just, they just want happy endings.

993
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,920
How can you not see that, have you not been paying attention to the stories these people

994
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,800
write?

995
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,320
There is no 10,000 degree chess going on here, how can you not see that?

996
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,800
Maybe it's because you are invited to every Square Enix developer meetup and they tell

997
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,720
you like wow, your fucking videos influence me so much, they motivate me to keep making

998
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,720
the game.

999
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,240
Maybe that's corrupted your view of the game a little bit, I don't know.

1000
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,240
And it already had a happy ending without being schmaltzier stupid about it.

1001
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:34,880
When they say that the ending was bad, it's not that the ending was like sad, it's just

1002
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,320
that it wasn't overly schmaltzier, the ending was tasteful of Final Fantasy 7.

1003
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:44,000
It was just like, you know, cloud like sort of like overcame his anxieties and overcame

1004
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,760
his trauma and he beat Sephiroth in a battle of wills.

1005
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,000
They saved the planet, Eris's little holy spell got to do its thing, the planet did

1006
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,440
its thing and they go oh, will it kill us too?

1007
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,640
Are we just as bad?

1008
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,640
Who knows?

1009
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,040
But then everyone, and you know, it's just, it's tasteful is my point.

1010
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:08,760
It just goes to show you cannot trust people to formulate a fucking coherent thought based

1011
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,560
on the narratives of a fucking story or they'll just fuck it up.

1012
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,640
They'll just not understand what has been, what was the point of Final Fantasy 7, do

1013
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,280
all this stuff so that everyone dies at the end?

1014
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,120
Do you think that was the point of the story, boys and girls?

1015
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,200
I'm telling you the answer's no.

1016
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,640
The answer is no to that question.

1017
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,800
I mean, yeah, didn't Sakaguchi say a long time ago that he made the game, the whole

1018
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,680
concept of the story was his way of like dealing with grief because like his mother had died

1019
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:46,800
or something and like, and like moving on, like the story is about moving on and like

1020
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,280
it's about life, it's not about death and nihilism and the whole world.

1021
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,800
You want to talk about moving on?

1022
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,040
How about we bring back everybody that died?

1023
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,040
How's that for moving on?

1024
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,040
That's not what I like.

1025
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,280
Man, that's not what I was going to do.

1026
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
You did it.

1027
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,480
Oh, I hate Zak.

1028
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,480
He sucks.

1029
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,480
Zak?

1030
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
I want him to die.

1031
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,480
Is the most...

1032
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,480
I mean, I want him to die again.

1033
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,480
Why is everyone into Zak?

1034
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,480
I don't understand.

1035
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,560
I'm sorry I'm yelling so much, everyone.

1036
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,560
I just got a lot.

1037
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,160
I mean, like, I know that he died to begin with, but I mean, I want the concept of Zak

1038
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,600
to die and go away.

1039
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,760
People just get attached to characters because why?

1040
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,760
Because they're nice.

1041
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Why?

1042
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,640
Because they were eight years old when Crisis Core came out.

1043
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,160
And so to them, that's the end all be all of the series and that's good.

1044
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,160
They think...

1045
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,160
Can you believe that?

1046
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,160
People tell me.

1047
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,000
Crisis Core is good.

1048
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,760
People tell me that like, you know, oh, you know, you like the original, oh, spin-offs

1049
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,760
don't matter, man.

1050
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,200
Like, what does spin-offs matter?

1051
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,200
Like, why are you mad?

1052
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,200
It's just a spin-off.

1053
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,800
It's not like it's fucking with the original game, bro.

1054
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,480
It's not like, look where we're at now.

1055
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,680
Look who we have to deal with.

1056
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,320
Because this virus has been allowed to spread.

1057
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,720
This is Genova polluting the life stream of the public consciousness of this fucking

1058
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,760
game and everyone's thinking wrong things because they weren't in the original because

1059
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,320
Sakaguchi has left the fucking building.

1060
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,480
I'm not even trying to say Sakaguchi was like an angel and everything good left with him.

1061
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,720
It's just that the atmosphere that created the original is gone and we've got something

1062
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,720
else.

1063
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,720
And I don't like it.

1064
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,480
It's a totally different company at this point internally.

1065
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,960
Fuck, what was I just going to say?

1066
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,960
Something about Zack's sucking.

1067
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,960
Oh, yeah.

1068
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:42,960
There was one part, Hojo, at one part of the game, he said the letter G. He said G and

1069
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
I had an ulcer.

1070
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,960
I coughed up blood.

1071
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,000
He specifically said, oh, oh, these soldiers, they're G types, not S types.

1072
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Oh, yeah.

1073
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Oh, yeah.

1074
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And I went, there was blood all over my, gacked his back, baby.

1075
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Oh, I gacked.

1076
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
All right.

1077
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,720
I fucking, did you, did you enjoy the scene?

1078
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,480
Why, what the fuck is the, why would Hojo just say when he meets cloud, oh, I know you,

1079
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,680
you literally weren't a soldier.

1080
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,680
Oh, yeah.

1081
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,560
And then the time Janney's carry him away after he says it.

1082
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Why not before?

1083
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,120
It makes, if you're trying to preserve the timeline, makes no sense because like the,

1084
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:29,720
the idea is that they come and they, they, they prevent people from changing Destiny's

1085
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,720
course.

1086
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,800
They, anytime that a character deviates from what already happened, it does something different.

1087
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,480
The time janitors show up and stop it.

1088
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Okay.

1089
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,040
How are they deviating in the first place then?

1090
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,040
I've been wondering that.

1091
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:48,960
Like the, the answer has to be either Sephiroth is doing something with time shenanigans.

1092
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
That would, okay.

1093
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
Okay.

1094
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,640
Why did Hojo do something different?

1095
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,000
Why did cloud try to kill Reno this time?

1096
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,280
I have been lacking my fucking brain.

1097
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,120
Look, we, people, people are going to ask for 10,000 IQ plays.

1098
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,560
The answer is these people are terrible writers and they don't know what they're doing.

1099
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,120
That's the answer to the question.

1100
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:13,600
You can spend all day searching the stars for the fucking, what does it mean, bro?

1101
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,280
What are the implications of this?

1102
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
None of it's there.

1103
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,640
There is no substance beneath any of this.

1104
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,360
The answer is they don't know what they're doing and they're fucking everything up.

1105
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:28,280
I love how they're supposed to like preserve the timeline as it was.

1106
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,320
As if it's not going to significantly alter the timeline to have everyone in sector seven

1107
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,800
see a giant swirling tornado of cloaked grim reapers around the bar.

1108
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,120
Like that's not going to alter anyone's lives that they saw that shit.

1109
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,120
Okay.

1110
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,280
Like they, Barrett gets stabbed by Sephiroth, right?

1111
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,440
And the time Jenny somehow brings him back or what?

1112
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Yeah.

1113
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:58,400
You know, I almost thought for the briefest of moments, oh my God, they're doing something

1114
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,440
different and interesting and unique.

1115
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,640
And I can't believe this happening.

1116
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,200
I'm actually surprised they're killing Barrett in the first game.

1117
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,200
Oh my God.

1118
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
I can't believe.

1119
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
Oh, no, no, they're not.

1120
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,960
And I don't want to hear you fucking people being all like, did you guys know that they

1121
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,320
were originally going to kill Barrett and like the whole crew?

1122
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,320
Yes.

1123
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,320
I've read the interviews.

1124
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,840
I know that they were planning to kill the entire rest of the cast, except Cloud and

1125
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,360
then Nomura talked them out of it.

1126
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,280
Do not quote the ancient knowledge to me.

1127
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,320
I was there when it was written.

1128
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,320
Yeah, indeed.

1129
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,320
Indeed.

1130
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,280
It's just the time Jannies, man.

1131
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:34,200
They save Barrett, but isn't it kind of important to preserve the timeline that Cloud not know

1132
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:40,360
that he's a soldier or that he was in fact not ever a soldier, but he just hears that

1133
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,360
from Hojo.

1134
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,000
Shouldn't like an appropriate correlate wouldn't be like, okay, Barrett dies and then the time

1135
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,240
Jannies restore him.

1136
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,520
Wouldn't an appropriate correlate be like Cloud hears he was never a soldier from Hojo,

1137
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,520
which he does.

1138
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:57,000
And then the time Jannies like go into his head and like remove that vital piece of lore.

1139
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,880
Instead, Hojo just tells him and he goes, oh crap, oh, well, I'll just pretend I didn't

1140
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,880
hear that.

1141
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,880
It's treated like he doesn't even consider it or think about it, even though that's the

1142
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,560
biggest reveal in the entire game at the, during the fucking Cloud's interest.

1143
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,560
You know what?

1144
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,360
I just, I don't understand why people think this is so good, I am so confused.

1145
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:28,640
This entire third act of the game, I mean, you know, the one good thing about it could

1146
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,560
have been that people who didn't get a chance to play it the first time could experience

1147
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,560
the story.

1148
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,360
If you didn't play Final Fantasy 7, you would have no fucking idea what is going on.

1149
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:43,240
Sephiroth is not explained, Cloud's backstory is not explained, and the calm flashback is

1150
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,520
the next thing that happens narratively, so they could have like somehow done it there

1151
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,360
and put Sephiroth after that or something.

1152
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:54,600
Yeah, you know, I almost, like I was thinking, the whole game I was thinking, oh, I bet I

1153
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,920
know what they're going to do.

1154
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,520
They're telling everyone it's just Midgar, but they're going to go a little bit farther

1155
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,920
and go to calm so that we can do the flashback and that's where it'll end.

1156
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,920
That would make sense.

1157
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,440
But like I thought for sure, surely that is the thing that makes sense narratively for

1158
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,720
the structure of this game, but no, they didn't even think of that.

1159
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:16,240
In my video years ago, I asked, I think the important question, who is this for?

1160
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,560
And I think I have the answer and I think it's basically that like Square Enix, they

1161
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:27,000
think everyone in the world has played Final Fantasy 7 and not only that, but has memorized

1162
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,600
every story beat.

1163
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,280
So they feel they can't do it again.

1164
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,720
They feel that like, they feel like watching the comparison of like Jaws or whatever.

1165
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:41,040
Oh, watching Jaws again, it's not like the pacing and all the subtle hints of the shark's

1166
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,200
body and whatever.

1167
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,200
That doesn't matter.

1168
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,000
The fact that you know there's a shark and you know every story beat means no one would

1169
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,560
enjoy watching that again.

1170
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,960
So you can't remake it or whatever the fuck.

1171
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,960
They...

1172
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,840
Who do you think Sephiroth is if you're a new player?

1173
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,440
Like I can't wrap my head around like how baffled you must be.

1174
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,440
He's a guy.

1175
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,440
That's all I think.

1176
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,440
He's a guy.

1177
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,800
Sephiroth is just this guy, you know?

1178
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:11,960
He's just a guy and he's pretty, pretty badass I guess, but maybe he's gay?

1179
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,960
I don't know.

1180
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,960
He just seems gay.

1181
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,600
He's definitely pretty gay.

1182
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,720
I don't know when that happened, when that change occurred, but at some point he did

1183
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,720
definitely catch the gay.

1184
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,120
Sephiroth is just like sitting in the back of that truck in the column flashback with

1185
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,200
Cloud just like doing squats and Cloud's like, oh, I can't wait to try my new materia.

1186
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,280
And Sephiroth just says, doesn't I shall give you despair.

1187
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,200
He just says, what a green rookie, look at this rookie over here.

1188
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,720
He's just like a dude, man.

1189
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,480
He's just like a soldier who fought in wars, which by the way is still going on.

1190
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,080
Wutai is not a tourist town as famously sung by Jesse in the Shinobi rap.

1191
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,160
It's in fact, you know, a powerhouse.

1192
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,360
Oh god, why are they changing things like this?

1193
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,360
Sick, sick, deep cut.

1194
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,560
That matters for Yuffie's backstory.

1195
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,520
Yeah, exactly.

1196
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:04,440
They should have just used my Shinobi rap as the template for this story because I told

1197
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,320
them what to do and how to do it.

1198
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:11,960
You know, I was very scared when they did the angel of the slum side missions.

1199
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,920
I was sure that it was going to be Yuffie and I was like, oh no, what are you doing?

1200
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,920
Thankfully it wasn't.

1201
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,000
That was the one thing where they showed restraint.

1202
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,040
They have that one girl who is like literally Yuffie basically, but she is, I looked it

1203
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,040
up.

1204
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,800
Not read the spin-off novel, whatever the fuck it is.

1205
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,160
She's from a novel, boys.

1206
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:40,040
So remember that guy working for Don Corneo, Leslie, he's also from the novel.

1207
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,840
You know, he was like the one new character that I didn't hate completely.

1208
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,480
I didn't hate him at first, but then the side mission just kind of dragged with him and

1209
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,680
I was like, I get it, obviously this happened to you.

1210
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,640
So obviously terrible anime writing.

1211
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,920
But then he got to the part where he like stupidly monologued instead of shooting Corneo

1212
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,440
and totally got fucked like an idiot.

1213
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,560
I did like seeing Corneo cuck that guy and I was like, oh, Corneo actually did something

1214
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,560
cool.

1215
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,560
Yeah, good work.

1216
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,560
I like that.

1217
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,320
This is how he became a mob boss in the first place or whatever.

1218
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:19,280
Yeah, so yeah, if you're a new player and you beat the game and you see this guy with

1219
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,180
black hair and he's like walking past Eris and is doing all this like melodramatic sad

1220
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,200
shit with this guy that you've never seen before.

1221
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,520
You have no context for who this is whatsoever.

1222
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,920
Like what are you thinking?

1223
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:39,000
Like they think everyone knows who all these characters, they put themselves like, man,

1224
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,960
you want to talk about like, you know, you know, if you're, Tom, you can relate to this.

1225
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,160
In the past, when I've been making like games and I personally have designed games as a developer,

1226
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:53,480
you spend like tens, hundreds of fucking hours, thousands of hours like working on like level

1227
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,720
design and things.

1228
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:00,520
There are puzzles, for example, that you implement into a game that you can solve because first

1229
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,080
of all, you know things about how the game is designed and even more than that, you have

1230
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:08,680
developed skills far beyond what like an average player might have.

1231
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,880
It's like Square Enix is approaching this game design thinking like, like from within

1232
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:19,720
that box, like, oh, everyone knows every aspect of this game and like every beat of the story.

1233
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,240
Even though you think how many people love replaying Final Fantasy 7 once in a while

1234
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,480
to just be like, oh my God, I forgot how good the atmosphere was here.

1235
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,120
I forgot how good the like, you know, Reno's appearance was here and like the Midgar's

1236
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:36,440
Alarm scene and the fucking, I don't know, meaning sang in the Mithril Caves and everything

1237
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,800
about Rocket Town, you forget these little details, but they just assume you have everything

1238
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:46,920
in your fucking brain and there's no point in being coy about any detail, even when it

1239
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:51,240
was like the point of the narrative, the way you like subtly present Sephiroth throughout

1240
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,080
the game, because spoilers, it's not even Sephiroth until the end of the fucking game

1241
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,240
in Northern Crater.

1242
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:03,640
Why did they make the motorcycle chase not fun this time?

1243
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,320
I don't know, why did they make it bad?

1244
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,600
I'm not going to lie, like I always love the original, you know, it was kind of hard.

1245
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,920
I mean, I like the original, I just had a fun arcadey simplicity to it and now there's

1246
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,760
a boss battle involved where you got to hit the guy's tires.

1247
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,200
I did not like that boss battle.

1248
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,680
That was one of the like, the two times I died in the game against that boss the first

1249
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,680
time.

1250
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,920
Yeah, I guess we'll give everyone else in the show a chance to talk now.

1251
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,920
I guess we've...

1252
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,420
Sorry guys.

1253
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,420
One more thing.

1254
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,460
It's cool that we just did Final Fantasy VII podcast remake.

1255
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,940
We've remade the podcast about Final Fantasy VII.

1256
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:45,940
Yeah, well, I had to redeem myself for erroneously calling it phenomenal the last time I was

1257
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,700
on, because I was only five hours into the game then, and like immediately after that

1258
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:55,260
point it fucking spiraled down into oblivion, into the exact same hell I knew it would,

1259
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,960
but I was briefly lulled into complacency when I saw the graphics, I guess, and I was

1260
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,240
like, ooh, this is nice though, I kind of like it, oh what a fool I was to have been positive

1261
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,240
even slightly.

1262
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,240
When I listen...

1263
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,240
No, I don't care.

1264
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,560
You know, the Genova fight, which by the way wasn't the original or whatever, who fucking

1265
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,080
cares, there's a new Genova fight in Shinra HQ, we are also transformed into like a dream

1266
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,840
dimension, okay, whatever, that's fine.

1267
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,720
I mean, the Genova theme that plays there and like the phase that goes through and that

1268
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,480
whole boss fight was kind of like my favorite part of the whole game, like you're playing

1269
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,120
a video game, it's not like a cutscene, of course.

1270
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,320
They do cuck you by doing the phase transitions where you lose your stagger bar and you have

1271
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,240
to restart, so that's always fucking...

1272
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,080
Oh yeah, the whole entire combat system is bad and sucks, let's talk about that now

1273
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,160
for the next fucking hour.

1274
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,760
It's the worst.

1275
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,080
Once I got into the rhythm, I enjoy it, I do like it.

1276
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,640
I kind of the same way I enjoy Final Fantasy XIII, it's very similar to Final Fantasy XIII.

1277
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,560
It works really well when you're just fighting regular enemies, but like every boss battle

1278
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,800
has some weird gimmick or some other stupid thing you've got to keep track of and also

1279
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:04,560
the bosses are too large so the camera doesn't know what to do and the AI for your companions

1280
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:08,880
is like the worst I've ever seen in a video game, I can't believe that this is in Final

1281
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,880
Fantasy VII.

1282
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,320
I mean, I guess that's kind of the idea to micromanage your party, but like, it's annoying

1283
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,320
and dumb.

1284
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,320
It's uncomfortable mixing though.

1285
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:21,680
And Final Fantasy XII, which came out like 15 years ago, had the gambit system and it

1286
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,440
worked beautifully, you could make sure that you knew exactly what your AI companions were

1287
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,940
doing at all times.

1288
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,240
Why didn't Square make that system?

1289
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,560
Why didn't they just bring it over here?

1290
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,840
The first thing I did once I figured out how the controls work, I know you have command

1291
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,840
shortcuts, you can hold like, it's like Kingdom Art style, you can map moves.

1292
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,840
The shortcuts are helpful.

1293
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,400
The first thing I did once I figured that out was like, oh, I hate going into the menu,

1294
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,800
thank God they put a system where I have to spend as little time in the menu as possible

1295
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:51,120
because it's a really uncomfortable mix of having to stop things every two seconds to

1296
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,760
choose the command or whatever.

1297
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:59,120
I didn't mind the menus too much because I liked being able to just pause and pick targets,

1298
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,360
especially when you're fighting multiple guys to make sure your hit goes to exactly who

1299
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,200
you want it to go to.

1300
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,480
So that was okay because it was kind of like the power wheel in Mass Effect or something.

1301
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,080
You slow things down, you can tactically choose targets and stuff.

1302
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,800
It was kind of similar to that.

1303
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,440
I just don't understand why they even bothered with any of the real-time elements at all

1304
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:25,360
because it was so not substantial in any way, shape, or form, you know?

1305
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,280
We talked about the dodge.

1306
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,840
The dodge is a true nightmare.

1307
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,840
It's so bad.

1308
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,640
I did a vlog on this game and I don't even know if I'm going to release it because I

1309
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:39,000
just shit on the game and I just don't want to pile on with everybody else.

1310
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,120
But it's like, the combat lacks the kind of like frenetic, reflexive nature or something

1311
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,760
like Devil May Cry, but it also-

1312
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:50,000
By the way, Tom, if you need permission, I give you my seal of approval.

1313
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,160
I'm sure you do.

1314
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,040
There is too much positivity about this game going on.

1315
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,760
They need sober cold water.

1316
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
Okay, I'm sorry.

1317
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:02,720
But it lacks that kind of reflexive nature of something like a DMC, like a traditional

1318
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:09,760
action game, but it also lacks the intentional tactility of something like a Souls game.

1319
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,760
It's just like-

1320
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,440
Nice term, bro.

1321
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:19,040
It's just a turn-based RPG with tacked on movement because they were just like, people

1322
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,440
these days are not going to be able to watch a bar fill up, so we got to make them actively

1323
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,440
fill the bar.

1324
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,440
And that's all it is.

1325
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,440
It's so slow.

1326
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,840
The ATB is so slow and the enemies have way too much hit points.

1327
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:36,040
And the fucking, God, the barrier is broken in this.

1328
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:41,120
It's totally so obnoxious and annoying because barrier like halves your physical attacks

1329
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,360
and that's fine.

1330
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,240
And in the old system, that was fine.

1331
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,160
It wasn't too annoying, you know?

1332
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:51,000
But in this one, anytime like an enemy is blocking or has a barrier, you have that feeling

1333
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,720
of like your sword clunking off of them and like stopping you dead in your tracks.

1334
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,720
It's so irritating.

1335
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,720
That's the word.

1336
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,720
Infuriating.

1337
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,720
Did you guys-

1338
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,720
Against the house.

1339
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,720
Against the fucking house.

1340
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,720
That happened constantly.

1341
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,720
Yeah.

1342
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,720
That was horrible.

1343
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,560
You just, I don't, I didn't die against the house actually like was able to beat it,

1344
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,920
but it was just like annoying and slow.

1345
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,640
And it's just like, if it was just doing half damage and I was still attacking, like that

1346
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,720
would be one thing, but it just completely ruins the flow that they're trying to build.

1347
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,720
Another thing that's really annoying-

1348
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,720
Can't build ATB either.

1349
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,160
With the boss fights, like some of them have like certain like attackable weak points,

1350
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,400
like the mechs and stuff, you can like blow off their arms and shit like that.

1351
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:33,920
But like, it doesn't work because the attacks are so clunky, you'll try and hit an arm,

1352
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,280
but you'll just end up hitting the body.

1353
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,880
Like even in the first boss battle, where you have to attack the shield generator, like

1354
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,200
half the time you're not even hitting it because like it's such a tiny target buried in the

1355
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,320
back of the boss and you'll just end up hitting the body.

1356
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,640
And because you have no control over the camera with the way it's set up too, it makes it

1357
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,640
really hard to get in the right position.

1358
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:59,920
The worst thing is that there are no iframes for anything, how many times have you like

1359
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,760
lost your limit break because you get hit by something from off screen while you're

1360
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,280
charging up your limit break?

1361
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,280
How do you fuck that up?

1362
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,280
That's 101!

1363
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,280
How do you charge up my iframes?

1364
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,360
What is the point of a Dark Souls dodge roll without the Dark Souls invincibility frames,

1365
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,320
which is the whole point of the dodge roll in the first place.

1366
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,720
It doesn't fucking function as a dodge roll.

1367
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,200
It's just for basic repositioning for charge ups on boss attacks.

1368
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,600
And it's just, it doesn't, it's so fucking shit.

1369
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:30,040
Just because like the actual like sensation when you connect with something, when like

1370
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,240
you do a braver and it connects, it feels fucking awesome.

1371
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,800
When you do the triangle shot with Barrett and that final charge hit, it feels amazing.

1372
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,080
Just make it be turn based so I can have this catharsis hits that works every time.

1373
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,720
It takes so long to build up the ATP gauge and then you go to do something and it gets

1374
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:51,200
interrupted and you go right back to square one and you have to do it all over again.

1375
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:56,320
You know what is my, I think I'm probably the most positive of any of us about the

1376
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,960
battle system because I do like it in many ways, but I obviously have many grievances.

1377
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,840
And my number one, the most annoying thing is that when battle ends, your limit gauge

1378
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,200
gets reset.

1379
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:12,800
I must have played through the majority of the game using my limit break like three times

1380
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:18,480
and only with cloud because you just don't get a fucking chance to build it up in a fucking

1381
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,480
battle before.

1382
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,480
Oh god.

1383
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,480
I'm sorry.

1384
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:30,160
The more I just can't stop talking about all the bad things, why, why, why, okay.

1385
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:33,760
Why does the right stick control the camera and the lock on?

1386
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,600
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

1387
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,360
Locking on does not feel like it even works half the time and then you're constantly switching

1388
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:46,560
when you don't mean to because you're trying to get the camera back where it goes.

1389
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,480
There's issues.

1390
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,480
There's issues.

1391
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,480
Fuck it.

1392
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:58,960
You know what the thing is, this idea that like an action combat system is like inherently

1393
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:05,800
better and more tactile or whatever than the old turn based system, like the old turn

1394
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:12,040
based system in Final Fantasy 7 felt snappier and more responsive and quicker than this

1395
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:17,360
limp-wristed like half and half abomination that is like sitting in the middle between

1396
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,280
turn based and real time, you know what I'm saying here?

1397
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:24,440
Yeah, I was flipping shit on Twitter when I first started playing the same because I

1398
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,680
just thought the combat was so bad and everyone was like, oh no, it's fucking good.

1399
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,720
I just knew it's different.

1400
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,200
They're going to try and experiment with shit.

1401
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:38,200
I'm just like, but look, you put a dodge in the game, but everybody in the beginning

1402
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:43,240
of the game has guns and they follow you when you dodge roll.

1403
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:47,560
So there is no way to dodge the bullets that everyone is shooting at you in the beginning

1404
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,560
of the game.

1405
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,480
So the dodge is fucking useless.

1406
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,520
How about instead of a useless dodge that doesn't work, how about instead of that you

1407
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:01,720
have a fucking jump button so it's not infuriatingly annoying to fight any flying enemy in the game.

1408
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,720
That's not good.

1409
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,720
Flying enemies.

1410
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,720
It's so bad.

1411
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,720
Give me death.

1412
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,840
Yeah, you have to switch the barret for that.

1413
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,840
You just, there's no.

1414
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,840
Yeah, you have to.

1415
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,840
You have to.

1416
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,120
When it comes to the, when it comes to the dodge, by the way, look, I could accept no

1417
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:19,480
iframes, but what you just need to do is not give me a full like two second cooldown and

1418
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:24,720
give me a bit more fucking distance on the dodge because they're so short and so much

1419
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,720
cooler when you dodge.

1420
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,120
The dodge is useless in the first boss fight when it does that charge up like electricity

1421
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,840
AOE thing and you're like, oh, I got a dodge out of here.

1422
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,880
You can't dodge far enough to avoid it so you get hit every fucking time.

1423
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:42,520
It's just so badly designed and I don't like it and it's dumb and gay and shit and fuck.

1424
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:48,280
You know, I've had a lot of fun with like side missions doing battles, but like the side

1425
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:53,760
mission battles are okay because it works when you fight like mobs and ads and like regular

1426
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:59,200
just enemies because you can like the damage output on your normal attacks is basically

1427
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:05,080
nothing compared to, you know, the ATB attacks and yeah, but, but that small amount of damage

1428
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,960
is enough to cut through like normal guys running around like on side quests and stuff.

1429
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,880
You can play it essentially like an action game and when you're fighting melee guys

1430
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,440
physically getting out of the way with the dodge role allows you to dodge attacks.

1431
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:21,280
But anytime there's projectiles involved, you can't dodge them.

1432
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,400
They're taking hits, especially with bosses firing like multiple missiles at the same time.

1433
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,400
Our arena just turns into a death trap.

1434
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,400
I guess.

1435
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,400
Yeah.

1436
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,400
I think all you do is block.

1437
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,400
I don't know.

1438
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:37,000
But the regular attacks once you're fighting bosses or like even like more of the stronger

1439
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,400
enemies are essentially useless because like they have like 20 or 30,000 HP and it's like,

1440
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,400
oh, I'm hitting them for 15.

1441
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,400
Awesome.

1442
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,920
Like it's just to fill the ATV gauge and it's just dumb and it's wasting my time.

1443
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,920
It's about the stag bar.

1444
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,920
Just be turn-based.

1445
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,920
Just be turn-based.

1446
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:53,920
It'll be...

1447
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,040
I don't know.

1448
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:01,080
You know, that whole boss fight with the house, I know that everyone thinks it's so cool that

1449
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,040
the house is back and everyone is praising that fight.

1450
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:09,840
You know, I hate to give Super Eye Patch Wolf credit because I am deeply jealous of his

1451
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,880
meteoric success, but he brought up a great point in his Final Fantasy 7 video a couple

1452
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:23,600
months ago where he sort of went into the house and how it's kind of a really cool design

1453
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:29,640
that in the slums where everyone is like poverty-ridden and has no homes, that like a monster would

1454
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:34,720
evolve to look like a house, to lure homeless people in, like that's the idea of the house.

1455
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,840
And like that is clearly the idea that they were going for.

1456
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,200
It is a monster that camouflages itself as a house to eat homeless people.

1457
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,200
That is...

1458
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,200
It goes with the themes of the game.

1459
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,640
The themes of the game are like poverty and class and all that.

1460
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,760
It's not that anymore.

1461
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:54,960
It's just a robot monster that Corneo keeps in his stadium for some reason.

1462
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,960
That's dumb.

1463
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,960
That's not good anymore.

1464
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,960
Also...

1465
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,880
Okay, that's the interesting you bring that up because as someone who didn't play the

1466
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,800
original, I'm like, why would you make a robot house?

1467
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,600
It made no fucking sense to me.

1468
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,880
They put it in that part for fanservice without thinking of why he was in the original game

1469
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,920
and where he belonged in the game in the first place.

1470
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,040
How about that part where you're for fucking Hojo just stops the entire game and makes

1471
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:23,960
you switch parties like 50 times for like 4 hours, flipping switches, having to switch

1472
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,920
the materia back and forth every single time you switch?

1473
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:27,920
Oh yeah.

1474
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,600
As soon as I realized that I was like, I need 4 of every materia immediately so I never

1475
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,560
need to switch with anyone.

1476
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,560
Yeah.

1477
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,560
Yeah.

1478
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,560
That's life.

1479
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,560
That's life.

1480
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:43,880
But man, it's really fucking cool when you use it.

1481
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,240
And you hit three guys.

1482
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,920
Oh man, it feels so fucking good.

1483
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,200
Triple slash is so cool.

1484
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,200
Triple slash is so fun.

1485
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,200
I love it.

1486
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,200
Yeah, that's the best part of the game.

1487
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,200
It's triple slash.

1488
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,200
It's the part I like about it.

1489
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,800
Every time I use triple slash, I'm like, maybe I'll play it a little bit more.

1490
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
Yeah.

1491
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,800
Triple slash is pretty good.

1492
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,800
I like Counter Strike.

1493
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,800
Oh my god.

1494
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,320
All of Tifa's moves are so cool.

1495
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,320
It's so fun to play as Tifa.

1496
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,320
You know what they didn't mention?

1497
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:12,880
And I found out on the forums, or on a forum looking it up, you know how you switch to

1498
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,760
Punisher mode with cloud and you hold down block and you'll counter?

1499
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,760
Did you know?

1500
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,760
Yeah.

1501
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,760
Wait, is that true?

1502
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,760
I didn't know that.

1503
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:21,760
It automatically counters by holding down, you hold down guard.

1504
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,240
He'll automatically do a counter.

1505
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,240
What?

1506
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,720
But someone said in the forums, and I mentioned it on Twitter and nobody knew.

1507
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:32,880
If you tap triangle right when an attack hits you, you counter even in operator mode.

1508
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,880
What?

1509
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,880
I heard somebody say that.

1510
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,280
I saw some, like, let's play or doing that.

1511
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,880
This is not explained anywhere.

1512
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:40,880
Yeah.

1513
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,880
And I'm like, oh, there's a little bit of depth here.

1514
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,720
There's a little bit of depth now.

1515
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:49,480
If you time your things right, you can just counter everything with cloud and that's fucking

1516
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,480
cool.

1517
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:56,040
Well, you're not going to counter all those fucking rockets that the fucking house launches

1518
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,040
at you or anything.

1519
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,040
Fuck that.

1520
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,040
Yeah.

1521
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,040
I don't know.

1522
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,040
I don't know.

1523
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,040
I don't know.

1524
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,040
I don't know.

1525
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,960
All right, I have one more thing to say and then I'll be done.

1526
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:05,960
Okay.

1527
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,960
Okay.

1528
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:17,480
So you know that Sephiroth theme that goes like, those chosen by the planet, I believe?

1529
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,480
Yes.

1530
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,480
Yes.

1531
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,120
So right at the end of the game where you're in that little threshold and Sephiroth says,

1532
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,760
hey, cloud, if you go through here, it's the end of the game and we'll have a final

1533
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,760
boss fight.

1534
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,760
Yeah.

1535
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,880
So go to the vending machine and shop first, buddy.

1536
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,160
I'm Sephiroth and I'm evil.

1537
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,520
Go shop at the vending machine, buddy.

1538
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,080
This is a video game and none of it matters.

1539
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,080
Yeah.

1540
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,600
That part where you're waiting at the threshold and it's playing that music.

1541
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,080
You know, I didn't want to go into it right away.

1542
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,080
I was kind of hungry.

1543
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,760
I was kind of peckish.

1544
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:51,720
I went out into the kitchen and there was some leftover asparagus from Dindin.

1545
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:56,200
And so I just started eating asparagus and I just started shoveling this asparagus in

1546
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:02,280
my face and just going mad with power, just ripping into this asparagus.

1547
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:09,560
And in the background, the song was playing and I'm eating this asparagus like a dinosaur.

1548
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,520
And then I just start going and I think you'd appreciate this, Nate.

1549
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,800
I just started going, eat your greens.

1550
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,800
Eat your greens.

1551
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,800
All right.

1552
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,800
I'm done.

1553
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,800
I'm finished.

1554
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,800
Yeah.

1555
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,800
All right.

1556
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,800
That's all.

1557
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,800
That's all.

1558
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,800
That's all.

1559
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800
That's all.

1560
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,800
That's all.

1561
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,800
That's all.

1562
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,800
I'm finished.

1563
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,800
I'm done.

1564
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,800
You're done.

1565
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,800
I don't want to go to him at all.

1566
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,800
Wait.

1567
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,800
What?

1568
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,800
No.

1569
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,800
They can't just be the Final Fantasy fan cafe.

1570
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,800
Why not?

1571
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,800
It could.

1572
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,800
I mean, what else?

1573
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,040
Does anything else interesting happened?

1574
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,040
No.

1575
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,300
Oh, I hate Factorio.

1576
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,300
It's too mean to me.

1577
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,900
Factorio is not even a real game.

1578
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,540
I don't even believe it.

1579
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,540
What happens to him?

1580
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:54,460
Yeah, that in the world, Kim Jong-un is probably dead at LeMell.

1581
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,620
That school...

1582
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,620
Oh, yeah.

1583
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,200
And we could all worship his yes, queen and sister.

1584
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,200
Yeah.

1585
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,480
We can finally start simping for North Korea.

1586
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,480
Ooh, yeah, at last.

1587
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,480
Pretty sick.

1588
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,480
Yeah, pretty good.

1589
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,480
Yeah, you're right.

1590
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,480
There's nothing.

1591
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,480
This is going to Christmas.

1592
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,480
All right, fuck it.

1593
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,480
I got them right here, boys.

1594
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,480
We've only got three.

1595
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,480
We have a lowly three.

1596
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,480
Wait, we're really doing it?

1597
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,480
That's really it?

1598
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,480
I'm fine with this though.

1599
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,480
I got no objections.

1600
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,480
I thought for sure.

1601
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,480
Well, Ben, clean, baby.

1602
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,480
Do you have nothing to say?

1603
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,480
What the fuck do I have to say?

1604
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,480
No, I don't have anything to say.

1605
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,480
I just, I hate my life, and I hate quarantine, and I'm really depressed, and everything sucks.

1606
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,480
I agree with all that, yeah.

1607
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,480
And here I am, and I'm on the show.

1608
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,480
Why not play a beautiful new remake of your favorite game, Ben?

1609
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:39,480
And I come on the show, and then I hear all about this Final Fantasy VII remake bullshit,

1610
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,480
and you think that's doing anything for me?

1611
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,480
No, dude.

1612
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
But no.

1613
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,480
I'm sorry, bro.

1614
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,480
I don't want to spread misery.

1615
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,480
I do not want to do that.

1616
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,480
Well, how's your animal crossing?

1617
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,480
Fine.

1618
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,480
I got more roses.

1619
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,480
Yeah.

1620
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,480
Hey, play the fucking jingle, I guess.

1621
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,480
Show my rose garden.

1622
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,480
I got like 25.

1623
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,480
I don't think we got a jingle yet.

1624
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,480
Pretty cool.

1625
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,480
Did anyone make a jingle?

1626
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,480
Were there no voicemails that were someone submitting a fucking rose jingle?

1627
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,480
Ugh.

1628
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,480
I don't think so, guys.

1629
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,480
Okay, but we need to come up with topics that make Ben feel less sad.

1630
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,480
We got a brainstorm.

1631
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,480
We got to cheer up Ben.

1632
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,480
Wow.

1633
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:16,480
Yeah, it's got to, you got to, you got to eat or me.

1634
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,480
It's like that episode, yeah.

1635
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,480
Yeah, you are going to stick it too.

1636
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:25,480
You got to stuff honey in my mouth, and tie balloons to all my limbs, and I don't know.

1637
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:28,480
Well, so they do fucking like, shoot him.

1638
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,480
I don't remember.

1639
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,480
Shoot him with a gun.

1640
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,480
Put him down.

1641
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,480
Yeah.

1642
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,480
He can't be sad if he's dead.

1643
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,480
Ugh, it's true.

1644
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,480
Oh, we're all going to die, guys.

1645
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,480
We're all going to die.

1646
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,480
It won't even be long.

1647
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,480
Yeah, but Final Fantasy 7 teaches us that we can have meaning in the real world even

1648
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,480
afterwards.

1649
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,480
No, once we're gone, that's it.

1650
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,480
You don't remember anything that happened and none of it matters.

1651
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,480
But the remake teaches us you won't actually die.

1652
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,480
Yeah.

1653
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,480
Yeah.

1654
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,480
No, it's not real.

1655
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,480
You definitely really just die, and then there's nothing.

1656
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,480
Cool.

1657
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,480
Well, then what was the point of the remake?

1658
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,480
What's the remake trying to tell you?

1659
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,480
Well, I guess what's the point of life at all?

1660
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,480
Maybe nihilism is correct, so maybe the remake is correct.

1661
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,480
Oh, no.

1662
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,480
It's way more accurate.

1663
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,480
Yeah, you know what?

1664
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:12,480
I guess I stand the remake now, because that's what it's like.

1665
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,480
It's way more relevant to my real life experience.

1666
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,480
Nothing means anything.

1667
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,480
Consume, consume, consume.

1668
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,480
Don't ask questions, just consume.

1669
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,480
You know, at least it's on.

1670
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,480
At least it's on.

1671
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,480
At least it's on.

1672
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,480
No, it's not on.

1673
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,480
It's to call itself a remake, and it tells me shit on me.

1674
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,480
They're remaking the plot note as well.

1675
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,480
That's all.

1676
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,480
Do you guys put any credence in?

1677
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,480
Okay, let's say.

1678
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,480
Okay, no more.

1679
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,480
Oh, God, I brought it back.

1680
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,480
Oh, fuck.

1681
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,480
All right, damn it.

1682
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,480
I just think this is an epic meme.

1683
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,480
No, it's not epic.

1684
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,480
It's not epic.

1685
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,480
It's not a meme.

1686
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,480
It's not funny.

1687
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,480
You need to die.

1688
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,480
You need to die, mate.

1689
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,480
I'm Japanese.

1690
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,480
I'm Japanese.

1691
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:56,480
I can use English words, and they mean whatever I want them to me, because I'm not English.

1692
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,480
Is this a legitimate legal defense with this pass and a court of law?

1693
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,480
Yes.

1694
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,480
Oh, it was actually Final Fantasy VII, Lee Make, not Remake.

1695
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:09,480
No, it was actually Final Fantasy V, Remake.

1696
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,480
Like those were not neuromanumeral.

1697
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,480
It's Lee Make, not only because they can't pronounce R's, but because they give him some

1698
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,480
Lee Way in the remake.

1699
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:23,480
It's Final Fantasy VII, Remake.

1700
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,480
It sure is.

1701
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,480
It is to me.

1702
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,480
It is to me.

1703
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,480
That's the title of this episode.

1704
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,480
Speaking of...

1705
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,480
Yeah, that makes sense.

1706
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,480
Hey, look at this.

1707
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:37,480
I commissioned Kazi to draw my slime girl from Radiforce's Cop Killers.

1708
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,480
That's pretty cool.

1709
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,480
Not bad.

1710
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,480
Not bad.

1711
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:41,480
I like it.

1712
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,480
I'll just be distracted by it.

1713
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,480
I posted it in the chat.

1714
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,480
Oh, fuck, what's her name?

1715
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,480
I should remember.

1716
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,480
It's Katie.

1717
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,480
Katie, right.

1718
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:51,480
Yeah, just some normal name for a slime girl.

1719
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,480
I wanted that to be the thing, is that she's a freak.

1720
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
Pretty aesthetic.

1721
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,480
But she's a person.

1722
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,480
You know, actually, Jesse, how do you feel about this?

1723
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,480
I learned a tragic...

1724
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,480
No, you're not talking about Final Fantasy VII.

1725
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,480
No, you know what?

1726
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,480
I'm trying to distract you.

1727
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,480
Just go ahead, honestly.

1728
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,480
There's no better week for me to have you guys just go.

1729
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,480
I don't want to...

1730
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,480
You don't want to hear from me.

1731
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,480
Sure.

1732
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,480
Better this way.

1733
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,480
Agreed.

1734
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,480
It's just that I was playing the original Final Fantasy VII a little bit, and I realized,

1735
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,080
I was like, oh, look, they've got mouths.

1736
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:25,480
This must be because of, you know, like, more polys, more fucking pixels on the screen.

1737
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:28,480
Everything else is, like, sharp and nice, because I'm playing on, like, the PC rear-release.

1738
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,080
Which, and by the way, I patched in the correct OG music.

1739
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,080
It has terrible music.

1740
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,980
You have to fix it, but I did that.

1741
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,980
But now they've got...

1742
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:36,980
I was like, wait, what?

1743
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:37,980
They've got mouths?

1744
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:38,980
Wait, was those not in the original?

1745
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:40,480
And I looked it up, and they...

1746
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,480
You talk about a hack remake in the true original.

1747
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,480
The models did not have mouths.

1748
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:50,480
In the horrible PC re-releases, they have mouths on the models.

1749
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,480
And talk about disrespecting...

1750
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,480
Well, I think we've been shitting on the wrong remake this whole time.

1751
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,480
Yeah, that's right.

1752
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,480
That's my point.

1753
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,480
The mouths.

1754
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,480
Just a note to Eleazar.

1755
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:06,480
You guys may not have heard, but I was doodling on my guitar in the background.

1756
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,480
Oh, I heard.

1757
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,480
It was great.

1758
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:13,480
I would like Eleazar, could you please max gain reverb so nobody can hear anything?

1759
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:17,480
I wasn't even playing well, so it would be bad if people heard what I was doing.

1760
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,480
But please do that anyway.

1761
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,480
Side note, this is not about the game specifically.

1762
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,480
Jess, do you know this guy, 4-8 Productions, who makes all these crazy...

1763
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,480
He makes like the in-depth character material.

1764
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,480
I think so, yeah.

1765
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,480
Yeah, it's just that that guy...

1766
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,480
Oh God, wait, I had a point.

1767
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,480
But I completely forgot what my point was.

1768
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,480
He's cool.

1769
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,480
Yeah, he's not a bad boy.

1770
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,480
I mean, that guy's a deep level boy.

1771
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:52,480
He just released a mod that he and his community or whatever made for the original Final Fantasy VII that I maybe will play.

1772
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,480
It seemed pretty cool.

1773
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:57,480
Anyway, I totally forget the point of bringing that guy up, but anyway, shout out to that guy.

1774
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,480
He's cool and I like what he does.

1775
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,480
And if you like the remake, I will come to your house.

1776
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:05,480
And it just won't be a pretty say, it's all there is to it.

1777
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:08,480
Alright, I have one thing to talk about.

1778
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,480
It might not last for too long, but that's whatever.

1779
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,480
Neither do I, while having sex.

1780
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,480
Oh yeah.

1781
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,480
There's a guy I follow.

1782
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,480
He makes a marble machine.

1783
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,480
He's called Martin.

1784
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,480
It's called the Marble Machine X and I was watching his latest video.

1785
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,480
Is that the musical instrument?

1786
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:40,480
He's got an extremely popular video of him playing the Marble Machine X, Marble Machine song with like a prototype.

1787
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:50,480
And he's been spending the last three years or so building the next one, which is like more like stronger and powerful and can do more things.

1788
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,480
It's very, very good YouTube series.

1789
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,480
Probably my favorite thing on the site.

1790
01:27:55,480 --> 01:28:00,480
But the point is he has a latest video.

1791
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:09,480
He talks about this idea of dopamine detoxing as a way to focus, which I have put into practice the last few days.

1792
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:18,480
It's been very helpful for people like me who are dumb and stupid and do not work when I need and want to.

1793
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,480
Tell me more.

1794
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:29,480
The basic premise is that notifications like little plus ones, little comments, little anything is a rush.

1795
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:36,480
It's very addictive as it's social media is designed to be that way.

1796
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:39,480
And all sorts of things in life are addictive by nature.

1797
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,480
You want to do them so that they can sell them to you again.

1798
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:50,480
And that's, you know, it's bad for you generally to get so used to having a high level of dopamine in your system.

1799
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:59,480
The idea he had was in order to focus, he needed to detox this dopamine out of his system so that he wouldn't go back.

1800
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:09,480
So he would be more able to resist the urge and the temptation to like put on a podcast while he's working and distract himself and be slower while he's doing things.

1801
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,480
Because some people, they put on podcasts.

1802
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:25,480
I mean, I know I used to do this before I switched to music, but music is still kind of a bad thing where you can't do anything unless you have somebody's voice in the room being on a podcast saying things that you can't work.

1803
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,480
It's impossible.

1804
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:33,480
And it's not generally a good place to be in because you're going to run out of podcasts.

1805
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:37,480
There's so many of them and not all of them are going to be the best thing.

1806
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:41,480
But it's also just sort of a hassle that you could live without.

1807
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:49,480
And I've been trying to work completely in silence with no YouTube, no Discord, no nothing.

1808
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,480
Because I've done sort of half measures before.

1809
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:58,480
I've like got rid of YouTube and Twitter and stuff and it sort of helps.

1810
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:02,480
But I still feel this urge to be distracted by things.

1811
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:13,480
And so I think the the idea is like on a long term plan basis is to at least while I'm trying to get this fucking Lord of Ghost comic finished is to

1812
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:28,480
deprive myself of stuff for a long period as possible so that I can be used to being bored in a sense to you being used and able to live comfortably without needing to be looking at a media.

1813
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:43,480
And it was pretty effective the last few days before the weekend started where I got like three whole pages done per day as opposed to the zero I have done in the last and since Radcon four ended I've done zero.

1814
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,480
So in the last two days I've done three per day and that's pretty fucking good.

1815
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,480
That's yeah, that's good.

1816
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,480
Minimize distraction always seems like the right way to go.

1817
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:57,480
And yeah, yeah, sounds like you're getting results.

1818
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,480
Have you disabled notifications on your phone yet?

1819
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,480
I did that like last year and it's very effective.

1820
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:11,480
The only notifications I have active on my phone are text messages and phone calls, aka things I would actually care about.

1821
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:24,480
I mean, I turned off notifications as soon as I installed any apps because I didn't like the beep happening and then be looking and it'd be like the sort of thing I would see on desktop and just do a click.

1822
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:31,480
But with a phone you have to pick it up off the whatever surface is on and then sometimes you have to, you know, press the pin just to see that.

1823
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,480
Oh, nothing is happening at all and I didn't need to pick up my phone.

1824
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:39,480
So I've already had that completely turned off but I have now on my phone.

1825
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:52,480
I talked about it before this app called app block, which I can set to limit my ability to use any like apps I desire for a certain amount of maximum time per day.

1826
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:57,480
So I have a thing called, I don't know what it's called, it's just like a group.

1827
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:08,480
It's got all of the possible things including like browsers so that I can't look things up and it just disables them after one and a half hours of use per day.

1828
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:17,480
So I got one and a half hours and it's usually when I'm waking up and I just need something in my front of my face to like a shine a light at me so I can see it like.

1829
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,480
But after that it's gone and I can't use my phone basically.

1830
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,480
It's a very expensive paperweight.

1831
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:33,480
I would do that except I have to be ready for when Gamergate 2 starts and I'm called to drop the bombs so I really can't detach from my social media presence.

1832
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,480
It's not so much detaching from social media.

1833
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,480
I definitely still post on Twitter and stuff.

1834
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,480
You've seen those.

1835
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,480
I definitely am going to be involved in Gamergate 2 guys.

1836
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,480
Don't worry about that.

1837
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,480
I'll make the time.

1838
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:47,480
I've got a pager for that.

1839
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,480
Okay.

1840
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,480
That's right.

1841
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,480
An exclusive dedicated device for Gamergate 2's beginning.

1842
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,480
Yeah.

1843
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:59,480
I just press the button to respond and it makes terrible things happen.

1844
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:03,480
It's like it's like in the end of like Avengers where where the fucking Captain Marvel beeper goes off.

1845
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,480
That's going to be.

1846
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,480
Oh yeah.

1847
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:10,480
The beeper only has one button and what that button does is send sexual harassment to girl gamers.

1848
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,480
That's what it does.

1849
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:13,480
It's the sole purpose of the device.

1850
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:16,480
It's great.

1851
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,480
It's just send harassing tweets to Zoe.

1852
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:20,480
What is it?

1853
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,480
What is it?

1854
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,480
Go home gamer girl.

1855
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,480
It just posts that clip from that episode.

1856
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:27,480
Epic.

1857
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:33,480
The point though is that you can you can maintain a social media presence while blocking everything.

1858
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:42,480
It's just you need to have you need to have like the dedicated time to do it and then you know get away as soon as possible.

1859
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,480
Discipline man.

1860
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,480
Smart.

1861
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,480
So many likes and retweets.

1862
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,480
Reminds me of those.

1863
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:52,480
Those are those are my big money maker even though I get no money from them.

1864
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,480
People like those four commas.

1865
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,480
That's that's what everybody's about.

1866
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,480
They like those four panel easily shareable comments.

1867
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,480
I like them.

1868
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,480
I always like them when I see them.

1869
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,480
Yeah.

1870
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,480
They're a treat.

1871
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:06,480
You should pay wall.

1872
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,480
Huh?

1873
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,480
You cut out.

1874
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,480
I throw up that pay wall.

1875
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:10,480
The big red pay wall.

1876
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,480
Oh I've already got a pay.

1877
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:17,480
I got that pay wall for that fucking punk only fans which more people have joined since I posted the last one.

1878
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,480
It's really funny.

1879
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,480
That's excellent.

1880
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:22,480
You have a bunch of people in my discord saying Izumi needs an only fans.

1881
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,480
Oh lord.

1882
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:24,480
You started something.

1883
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,480
Our daughters are going to be whores of engine.

1884
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,480
Is there like actually content on it?

1885
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:33,480
There are two images that basically two sides of a ducky macro that I drew for fun.

1886
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,480
Okay.

1887
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:40,480
How can I engage with every person individually online and decide which specific content I want to pay wall from this specific person?

1888
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,480
That's what I want.

1889
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,480
I want pure adaptability.

1890
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:50,480
I want to know when I've met a real cash cow and exactly how he'll be willing to give me if I can just squeeze it out of him.

1891
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:57,480
But make sure that other people who I know I can't get any money from, I know that they can have everything for free because it's all good in the hood.

1892
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:01,480
That would be the ideal consumer setup for me.

1893
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:06,480
Alas, I lack the will or the power or the cowardice.

1894
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:11,480
Anyway, onlyfans.com slash punk911, that's the URL.

1895
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,480
Excellent, excellent.

1896
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,480
Incredible.

1897
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:19,480
Punk911 through 910 would take it, I assume.

1898
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:22,480
Is it 911 or 9-11?

1899
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:23,480
911.

1900
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,480
911.

1901
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,480
Just making sure.

1902
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:30,480
Because punk911 is a whole other thing.

1903
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,480
Don't even worry about it.

1904
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,480
Don't give that person their money.

1905
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,480
I want to make my only fan that's punk711.

1906
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,480
It's just punk hanging out of 7-11.

1907
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,480
Just getting a drink.

1908
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,480
Getting a burger.

1909
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,480
What would she drink?

1910
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,480
Probably not liquid because I would put her out.

1911
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,480
Put her out and she'd die instantly.

1912
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,480
Oil, yeah.

1913
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,480
Oil.

1914
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,480
Petrol, fucking explosive liquid.

1915
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,480
Nitroglycer.

1916
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,480
Nitroglycer.

1917
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,480
Picks up a bottle of fucking olive oil.

1918
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,480
That's an energy drink.

1919
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,480
Yes, excellent.

1920
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:07,480
Well, voicemails?

1921
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,480
I got them.

1922
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,480
I got the voicemails.

1923
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:10,480
We could do them.

1924
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,480
We could do them.

1925
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:12,480
We could do them.

1926
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,480
We could not.

1927
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,480
All right, I got them.

1928
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,480
I got it right here.

1929
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,480
Endless War, pin kick starter, still going.

1930
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,480
Link in the description.

1931
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:19,480
Still going?

1932
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,480
Are we cool?

1933
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,480
Are we more?

1934
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:22,480
It will be going.

1935
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:29,480
It will be going until not the Friday you're listening to this, but the Friday after that

1936
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:36,480
and it will end at like, I think like 8 p.m. that Friday and we'll stream like end of

1937
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,480
the campaign on Rowdy Fricker's Cop Killers.

1938
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,480
Those end of campaign streams seem to be where it's at.

1939
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:46,480
I mean, it works pretty well for the frickin' the other Radcon.

1940
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:47,480
It sure did.

1941
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,480
It sure did.

1942
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,480
I'm gonna just do it again.

1943
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,480
Are there new pins to tantalize me bad?

1944
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,480
Do we have more pins?

1945
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,480
Yeah, I think since the last time you may have checked, yes.

1946
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,480
There's a bunch.

1947
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:04,480
I mean, there's a bunch that have been like funded but have not been chosen yet, so there's

1948
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:05,480
like more coming.

1949
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,480
The Coatron is there.

1950
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:12,480
Yeah, Cop Killers, Rowdy Frickers, Smyrg's Negus Slime Ghost, The Challenge Coin, Slime

1951
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,480
Corp.

1952
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:16,480
Another one by Smyrgan Labunguspe.

1953
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,480
I don't know how to say that.

1954
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,480
Oh, God.

1955
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,480
Is that one of the girl on the treadmill?

1956
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:23,480
Is that a reference to that thing?

1957
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,480
You guys know what I'm talking about.

1958
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:31,480
That laser set where the little girl gets all lasered and it's very graphic.

1959
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,480
Is that what that is?

1960
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,480
I don't know what the fun girl is talking about.

1961
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,480
That's Goo Girls Limited in the style of the Portal 2 thing.

1962
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,480
Portal 2?

1963
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,480
Remember that?

1964
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,480
No, great.

1965
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,480
The little paper cut out people.

1966
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:46,480
Is that like a remake of Portal 1 or something?

1967
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,480
Yeah, that's right.

1968
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:48,480
God, I hope so.

1969
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:53,480
They have those little animations on the wall with the paper cut out people at a 45 degree

1970
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,480
angle, like an isometric view.

1971
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:55,480
Okay.

1972
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,480
I don't know.

1973
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,480
The point is it's the Goo Girls Limited logo.

1974
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:00,480
Yeah.

1975
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,480
I see Pizza Chan.

1976
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:02,480
Pizza Chan is cemented here.

1977
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,480
Pizza Chan.

1978
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,480
Excellent.

1979
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,480
The Podron.

1980
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:10,480
An iron-on New Los Angeles City flag patch that one might wear on their arm, for instance.

1981
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,480
Indeed.

1982
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,480
Good shit.

1983
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,480
I'm going to iron it onto my forehead.

1984
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,480
There's a lot of really good shit here.

1985
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,480
I'm going to have huge bags of all this hanging out.

1986
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,480
There's going to be overflow.

1987
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:23,480
I'm going to have hundreds of like, no matter what I do.

1988
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,480
We're going to have hundreds and hundreds of like, undelivered-

1989
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:28,480
When the kids come around for Halloween next year, you'll fill their bowls with-

1990
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:33,480
Stick your hand in this bag and they'll stick it in and they'll get stabbed by the pins.

1991
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,480
As they deserve.

1992
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,480
Sounds about.

1993
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,480
Okay, we can make this work.

1994
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:39,480
But yes, so that's what's up.

1995
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,480
A lot of fucking cool shit up for grabs right now.

1996
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,480
Link in the description.

1997
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:44,480
Had to mention it.

1998
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,480
Can't let a week go by.

1999
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,480
Go pledge for pins, everybody, if you want them.

2000
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,480
And I certainly do.

2001
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,480
You know, I forgot to pledge, but I should do it today because I know I want them and

2002
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,480
I got to do that.

2003
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:57,480
I mean, as more become available, I'm hoping that people will just up their pledges.

2004
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,480
They're like, oh, I want that one too.

2005
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,480
I want that one too.

2006
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,480
And I mean, they get cheaper as you get more.

2007
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,480
At like 50, they're just like five bucks a piece, which is like-

2008
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,480
Oh, and you know what?

2009
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,480
Now, actually, I'm glad you mentioned this.

2010
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:12,480
Now is an excellent time to mention also that so on the Radcon 4 kickstart, you may have heard of.

2011
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,480
Now, by the time you're hearing this, it'll be Friday the 1st.

2012
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,480
So technically a day passed, the guarantee.

2013
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:22,480
But I think we might have a little wiggle room potentially.

2014
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:32,480
If anybody out there backed the Radcon 4 kickstarter and got physical rewards and has not yet submitted their fucking shit to the kickstarter,

2015
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,480
do it now and you might get in under the wire.

2016
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,480
We'll see.

2017
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:39,480
If not, you might be fucked, but do your best.

2018
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,480
Do your best.

2019
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,480
I think most people are in.

2020
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,480
I think there might be a couple of straggles as well.

2021
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:47,480
So you will literally not get the stuff you earned if you just don't respond to that.

2022
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,480
Yeah, we have to know where to send it.

2023
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:51,480
Or else we just can't do it.

2024
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,480
We won't even make it, because we're only going to make as many as we know where to send.

2025
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,480
Right, because we're going to have to place an order soon.

2026
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,480
That's right.

2027
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:00,480
Who knows how long it's going to fucking take to get here.

2028
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,480
So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.

2029
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:02,480
The virus.

2030
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,480
Your fate is in your hands.

2031
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:05,480
Act quickly and decisively.

2032
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,480
All right.

2033
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,480
With that being said, I'm glad somebody mentioned that.

2034
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,480
I was reminded of that.

2035
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,480
I wanted to say that.

2036
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,480
All right.

2037
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,480
Well, anyway, let's do voicemails.

2038
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:14,480
We got voicemails here.

2039
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,480
There's only three.

2040
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,480
A mere pittance.

2041
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:17,480
Wow.

2042
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:19,480
But they are selectively chosen.

2043
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,480
Lot of shit this week, boys.

2044
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,480
Lot of shit to wade through.

2045
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:27,480
But I have chosen the ones that made me feel anything at all.

2046
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:28,480
Very good.

2047
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,480
So here they are.

2048
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:30,480
That's good.

2049
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,480
I like that.

2050
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:32,480
Indeed.

2051
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:36,480
And that still may not be a high bar, but it's something as opposed to nothing.

2052
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,480
And of course, the link to leave them is the speak pipe link down in the description.

2053
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:43,480
Click that and go ahead and leave some message.

2054
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:44,480
All right.

2055
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,480
Make it good, though.

2056
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,480
Don't fuck around.

2057
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,480
All right.

2058
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,480
Here's the first one.

2059
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,480
This is from Joe Pesci.

2060
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,480
Joe Pesci has left us a voicemail.

2061
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,480
Let's hear it.

2062
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,480
Take it away, Joe.

2063
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,480
Hey, bro.

2064
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,480
Great.

2065
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,480
This is Joe Pesci.

2066
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,480
Hey, listen.

2067
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:04,480
My question is, why don't, why come the bread galling out like Serena?

2068
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,480
I fucking, that's my question.

2069
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:10,480
If you don't have an attitude, I'll come down and I'll fucking bust your balls.

2070
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,480
I have a good night.

2071
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,480
Thanks, Joe.

2072
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,480
Well, straight to the point.

2073
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,480
Straight to the point, Joe.

2074
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,480
Well, short answer.

2075
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:24,480
We are in the works with a lot of political negotiation going on.

2076
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,480
A lot of red tape we got to cut through.

2077
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,480
I can guarantee you, though, it is coming.

2078
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:30,480
It is coming.

2079
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,480
It's in the works.

2080
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,480
Won't be too long.

2081
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,480
But I think before that, you'll probably hear a certain song about Brad.

2082
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,480
So it won't come before the song.

2083
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,480
So we'll see when that happens.

2084
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,480
All right.

2085
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,480
That's it, Joe.

2086
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,480
Thank you for your no more contribution.

2087
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:43,480
No more emails from that.

2088
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,480
No more emails from that guy.

2089
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:46,480
Okay.

2090
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,480
Agreed.

2091
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,480
Agreed.

2092
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,480
He scares me.

2093
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:52,480
I fear he's going to bust her balls.

2094
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,480
All right.

2095
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:59,480
Next up, we've got, oh, this is a simply titled Digi Bro interview.

2096
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:03,480
Let's hear how it goes.

2097
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,480
So Digi Bro, thank you so much for coming to this interview.

2098
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,480
I'd like to ask a few questions about what's your inspiration?

2099
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,480
You know, what gives you the drive to live?

2100
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:15,480
If I want to live, I have to go find things to kill.

2101
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:19,480
I have time to think about that now because I'm killing so much more efficiently.

2102
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:20,480
I see.

2103
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,480
I see.

2104
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:25,480
So now that you have time to think about these things, is there a sort of revelation

2105
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:26,480
that you've had with your identity?

2106
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,480
I mean, like, what type of person would you call yourself?

2107
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,480
I'm a caveman.

2108
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,480
I have to hunt to eat.

2109
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,480
Interesting.

2110
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,480
Interesting.

2111
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:39,480
So would you say there was a point in time where you first had this revelation?

2112
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:42,480
Like describe the moment that you realized this.

2113
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,480
What was going on then?

2114
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,480
So I grab a rock.

2115
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,480
I beat this board of death.

2116
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:47,480
I'm like sick.

2117
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:48,480
Ah, yes.

2118
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,480
Now that's what I'm sure we can all relate to.

2119
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,480
But I'm really wondering your anime YouTube channel was going pretty well.

2120
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:57,480
This seems like a big shift in priorities.

2121
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:01,480
Can you detail some of the thought process that has gone into that change?

2122
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,480
Okay.

2123
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,480
This worked out so well.

2124
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,480
What other fucking rocks?

2125
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:07,480
What other kind of fucking sticks have I thought of?

2126
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:10,480
So let's fucking go kill some boars.

2127
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,480
It's better than ever.

2128
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:13,480
Well, you heard it here, folks.

2129
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,480
That's all the time I'll have.

2130
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,480
Thank you so much for stopping by, did you, bro?

2131
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,480
It was a pleasure speaking with you.

2132
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,480
That's literally what I hear from both sides.

2133
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,480
Fine.

2134
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,480
Next.

2135
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,480
All right.

2136
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:31,480
That was less funny listening back to it than I remember it being.

2137
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,480
All right.

2138
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:33,480
Well, thank you for your contribution.

2139
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,480
Excellent interview.

2140
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,480
I could hear the editing clips, so I know you put effort into that.

2141
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,480
Well done.

2142
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,480
All right.

2143
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,480
Next one is our final voicemails from Ajax.

2144
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,480
Ajax, go.

2145
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:45,480
Oh, yeah.

2146
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:50,480
It's about to get real, because it's me, your worst enemy, formerly known as H4Hotboy,

2147
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:54,480
but is now Ajax the Invincible Overlord, the Chad with the most bad, the Deer with the

2148
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:58,480
most milk cure, and after our battle with Terminal 7 clown aides, I've transformed,

2149
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:03,480
changed form into my prime dad, Formation Alpha, and ever regularly begun wearing a belt

2150
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,480
to everyday events.

2151
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:08,480
But I'm not here just to be a survivor or a father figure that you've always wanted.

2152
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:12,480
I'm here to declare that I'm the most linear and lexical of anyone in the PCP.

2153
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,480
Now, that you impressionist lateral fucks don't know the first thing about a woman and

2154
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:19,480
certainly don't deserve the affection of your crush or your anime waifu.

2155
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:23,480
So that's why I'm not here just to red pill you, because we're beyond that.

2156
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,480
I'm here to gold pill you, so you'll be as based in that because of me, because when

2157
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:30,480
I was a grown ass man in the 6th grade, I read a graphic novel called Panhemonium, and

2158
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:34,480
my head was spinning with all the messages of responsibility and loving your fellow

2159
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:38,480
man, that I forgot everything but the main characters, cute, goth twink ass, and the

2160
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:42,480
wacky line on the last page, brush your hair, comb your shirt and iron your teeth, wrang

2161
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:46,480
through my head, and after a vision quest where I was sitting on a sinking ship, I had

2162
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:50,480
to find it again, and only by googling demon twink graphic novel, young adult did I find

2163
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:53,480
it after 45 minutes with the safe search turned on.

2164
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:58,480
It can be done, you can live the dream and be nearly as cool as me, you just have to believe.

2165
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:03,480
And for you, Nate, my worst enemy of all, watch out at the gym where I'll be going

2166
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:08,480
monkey mode so hard your girl will file a divorce to marry someone who's cooler than you,

2167
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:13,480
but not as cool as me, because marriage is wack, but not as wack as premarital sex.

2168
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:16,480
Great, is that it?

2169
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,480
Thank you, that's it, that's it.

2170
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,480
No more voicemails ever.

2171
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:25,480
Thank you, Ajax, for your contribution to this show.

2172
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:27,480
We'll never forget you.

2173
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:34,480
Alright, that's it, leave your stellar voicemails in this vein exactly at the speak pipe link

2174
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,480
down below.

2175
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:39,480
I'm sorry, I don't put you in just to roast you, it just sounded funnier when I was listening

2176
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:40,480
to it before.

2177
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:43,480
And your sleep deprived super before Final Fantasy 7.

2178
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:48,480
I was incredibly sleep deprived before this episode, as I explained at the beginning, but

2179
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:52,480
when you get angry and yell about stuff, it does wonders for the energy levels.

2180
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,480
I will go crash after this.

2181
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:58,480
Okay, but anyway, anyway, right, speak pipe, more voicemails, thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

2182
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:02,480
we will continue to weed the weed from the chaff as we've done so diligently here today.

2183
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:07,480
Hey, go to patreon.com slash theprocrastinators and give us money, because it's the end of

2184
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,480
the show.

2185
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:12,480
And that was a voicemail, and you can give us money to get bonus episodes, which when

2186
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,480
you hear this, there will be a new episode.

2187
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:20,480
Not today, but tomorrow, I think, is when we'll be releasing the next bonus episode.

2188
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,480
That's 37 of them for $5.

2189
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:25,480
Incredible, incredible.

2190
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:26,480
It is.

2191
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,480
Truly.

2192
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,480
It is not, it's not.

2193
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,480
The value never stops from getting more.

2194
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,480
The value only goes up.

2195
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,480
It's true.

2196
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,480
And what else we got?

2197
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,480
At TP Crastinators on Twitter, four more updates.

2198
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,480
We got more rad con stuff, we're working on a bunch of stuff, we'll get it to you in

2199
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,480
time.

2200
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:45,480
There's not a lot of things, some big stuff that's going to take a while, so we'll keep

2201
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:46,480
you posted on how that goes.

2202
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:51,640
But yeah, make sure if you're a backer, you go to the fucking Kickstarter and you fucking

2203
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:54,840
respond to the backer survey so we know where to send your shit and he tells what size shirt

2204
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,480
you are or whatever, all that good stuff.

2205
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:59,480
Beyond that, there's nothing.

2206
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,480
That's the end of the episode.

2207
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,480
We've done everything.

2208
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,480
Nice.

2209
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:07,240
Go to these guys' links, comics and kickstarters and all kinds of good stuff, YouTube's, there's

2210
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,480
links in the description.

2211
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,480
Go check them out.

2212
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,480
And maybe check out, this episode was sponsored by the Final Nights at 7 Remake.

2213
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,040
I've been paid to shill for it.

2214
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:20,360
This is all a sigh up where I make you so mad at me being mad that you buy the game to

2215
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:22,640
prove me wrong.

2216
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,200
And I'm glad to be doing my duty.

2217
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,480
Buy it from the Amazon affiliate link in the description below.

2218
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,480
Indeed.

2219
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,480
Indeed.

2220
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,480
Should they buy it?

2221
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,480
Do you want people to buy it?

2222
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,480
No, right?

2223
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,480
We're firmly anti.

2224
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,480
Are we all firmly?

2225
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,480
Well.

2226
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,840
Last time there was a lot of precarication and uncertainty.

2227
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:43,000
It's too late to be anti, it's happening, so I don't give a fuck.

2228
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,520
I would not, I mean, I don't want to encourage this kind of thing, so no, I don't want people

2229
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:49,520
to buy it.

2230
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:54,120
But I mean, the game already is like the best selling game on PS4 basically, because they

2231
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:59,480
wanted a remake of a game everybody already loved and nobody signed up for this shit

2232
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,200
and they can pretend that they like it now.

2233
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:04,560
No, no, no, no, no, I'm going to cut you off here, you're going to just repeat yourself

2234
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,560
30 more times.

2235
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:10,560
Okay, I will just say, not everybody's pretending, some people legitimately like it, just disagree.

2236
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,560
Okay, there you go, there you go, there you go, there you go, there you go, there you

2237
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:14,560
go, there you go.

2238
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:19,560
And end of episode, we'll see you next week, everybody, more on that bonus side, so don't

2239
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,560
forget to tune in to that.

2240
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,560
Alright, goodbye.

2241
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,560
I'm going to go watch the Star Citizen.

2242
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,560
Good fucking bye.

2243
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,560
Bye.

2244
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,560
Goodbye.

2245
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:28,560
Bye.

2246
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:29,560
Bye.
