1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is a channel of friends who don't know how to talk to one another about our feelings.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And so we just record podcasts indirectly responding to one another. It's the sisterhood of traveling casts.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So this is in response to Digi's Don't Admire Me, Goddamn episode special of his compression chamber show.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Um, I guess all I can say is I disagree that being a constant work person at all times makes you not feel good,

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
or that it has to come from a place of not feeling good in order to pull it off.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I mean, all I really do is I just look at myself. You know, Digi advises Don't Admire My Lifestyle, me and Jesse's lifestyle.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, he's a bit late to tell that to me because I was doing that back in like 2013 listening to like their earliest podcasts together,

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
thinking, man, this lifestyle, both its advantages and disadvantages, both sound really interesting and fun for me to try and figure out.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And so I went into it and I did it and now I've done it and I've succeeded and I feel great.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's kind of weird. I didn't feel that good. I didn't feel like I had a solid direction in life.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And so I took that direction and then I succeeded at it and now I feel fine.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I guess in my own opinion, on my own life, this proves what Digi was saying.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You know, it's obviously not like anyone could make it happen or even a lot of people or even a slim minority.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I might be the only one ever, but it happens.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Like you can have, I mean, Digi even said in the PCP chat that like I feel like if people are going to try and imitate me,

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
they have to be all of me and I don't agree at all.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let me turn the game down. I'm getting way more passionate about this than I thought I would be.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Like Digi's attribute of being someone who works all the time because he can't think of anything else to do with his life.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I guess he sees it as being inherently coupled with whatever depressiveness he also has and or was born with.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And like I don't think that's the case for me.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I feel like I also have that attribute of I can't think of anything else I want to do with my life and create things constantly,

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
but I feel fine about it.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Like I don't like seek anything else. I don't feel unsatisfied. I feel perfectly satisfied.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So there you go.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Like, you know, as even though me and Digi are on such similar wavelengths creatively,

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
like in certain aspects, we have very similar wavelengths.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You know, he can just come up and start telling me his idea for an upcoming video project.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I think I get it more than most people would be able to get it other than I guess Laughlin still,

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
who like, you know, goes out of his way to study Digi's uvra.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But yeah, you know, I get it. We're on very similar wavelengths.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Despite all of that, we're on very different wavelengths in terms of just like being like our aura, if you will,

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is like really different and it's becoming difficult for me.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Like, you know, as you know, Digi's planning on like moving to another city at some point soon.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And you know, I'm going to go with him, assuming we can afford that kind of stuff.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I fully intend to like have my own place, you know, ideally like with my girlfriend and stuff.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That'd be cool.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But even if she wasn't around, like I still kind of wanted to have my own place because like Digi is amazing to be around,

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
but like being around him all the time depresses me.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It like makes me sad because it's like in order to be around him, I kind of as of the last couple of weeks,

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I realized that like the only way to like really talk to him without like risking making him annoyed all the time at me

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
is to like act really down and like talk really quietly and then like have a pained expression on my face half the time.

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm basically like role playing someone who's in constant pain.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And it seems like I'm able to talk to him much more easily with a lot less awkwardness.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I might be wrong, but I think that is the case because it's like by default,

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
my aura is so much different from his that he just doesn't know what to do.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Like I just kind of like show up and like I start saying words and he just gets pissed off at me.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Like, you know, Digi will say that like, you know, oh, in my vlogs and stuff, I'm all lit up and I'm moving around.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And actually, I'll just say this.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I know this from personal experience when Digi is in front of a camera recording a pointed statement.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He's all like, yo, this and that and that anime snob doesn't know what he's talking about.

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But in real life, he's just really slow moving and he just sort of like looks around.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He almost looks like he has a totally different face to me.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's like he has a totally different presence when he's just walking around the house looking at something.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And like every sentence he says it like frightens me that he's about to like like he's about to like explain something terrible.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It like makes me really nervous.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He has a completely different energy.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
For me, I feel like I have the same energy, the same type of feel one way or another.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like the way I'm talking right now, I'm making sure to enunciate better than normal.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I'm not succeeding super well, I still have a cough.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let me go edit out that cough.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay, I just coughed and I edited it out.

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't worry.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Anyway, I'm trying to enunciate better, you know, for the microphone.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But the volume at which I am speaking is the kind of volume I like to talk at with normal people.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But lately when I've been talking to Digi, I like to just go like, okay, this, okay, that, okay, the other thing, okay.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because it just seems more palatable to him.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And it's hard.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I want to live separately with my girlfriend, find some other social circle of people who feel like me,

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
even if I can't relate to like their artistic ideas or their analytical concepts at all.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You know, I just need that energy in my life, I guess.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't know what the difference is, but I just don't feel depressive about things.

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't, I feel fine.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And like, reach.

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You know, I've never had as much like depression weighing down on me as I think most depressed people have been.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Like, when I was a teenager, I thought of myself as being depressed, but like, at the time, even, I called it very mild.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I called it mild depression because I was like, whenever I talk to some other, some peer of mine, they seem a lot more miserable than I am.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So like, clearly, I'm better off.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I still hate how I am.

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I hate that I can't think of anything to do with my life.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's constant crushing, you know, difficulty, but I don't know if I can call it misery because it's like, it just wasn't that bad.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So, if you're in a place of utter depression, then maybe I guess that's the problem.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Like, I guess you can't just pull yourself all the way out.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Like, maybe I'm able to feel great all the time just because I wasn't that low to begin with.

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't fucking know, but like, I don't know if, I mean, I'm not saying that Digi should like, retract anything he said in his, in his, in his special episode.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm just saying that like, you know, take it with a grain of salt.

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can like, totally try and prove him wrong.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're not the same person as him.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You know, like for me, it's like when I'm making a video with, when I'm in the creative heat of it, and when I've released it, when it's only like, been out for like a handful of hours or so.

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I have this really great feeling of like, my fear of mortality is completely gone.

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's really the, the high that I chase is that when I'm like, when I've, when I'm productively making something that is about to come out, and it then came out in this window of time, everything feels fine.

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't even feel like the, the looming specter of death towards me and other people around me.

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, and normally when it does, you know, the rest of the time when I do have that kind of niggling feeling, like it's not, it's not that bad.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It makes me a little bit, you know, every once in a while.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's like a, kind of anxiety, but it's not an, I'm stopping or even slowing down on doing things, anxiety.

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You know, it's not that bad.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Because I don't, like, you know, I had, I had like a phase of feeling, oh man, it's my lifestyle, not very good.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know, like, I mean, particularly when I was a teenager, you know, just in my room all the time, playing video games all the time, being on YouTube all the time.

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Like I felt like, oh no, I could be doing something as much more productive, blah, blah, blah.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But then one day, I kind of had the idea to make like a video and I made the video.

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's on my channel. It's called definitively proven the worth of video games, TV, music, anime, that kind of stuff.

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's a title, something like that.

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And in a way, I think it's definitely the most important video I've ever made in terms of, I guess in terms of understanding my mentality, I guess.

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Which is that where is this so-called happy perfect lifestyle where you don't, where is this lifestyle you can have where you don't look around the corner and think there's a better one you could be having, right?

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What kind of life do you, like when you, when you're having your current lifestyle and you look at like one you'd like to have, you know, and you have it, let's say you accomplish it.

105
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Aren't you still going to look around at someone else's life and think that guy is happy and I'm not?

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And like where can you go? Where can you connect the dots to find this like career, friendship, circle, activity, hobbyist lifestyle where just you don't feel that way, you know?

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Where does it happen? If you're poor, you wish you had money, if you had money, you wish you could have a more simple life.

108
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It always goes in circles, right?

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And so when I like, when I came to that conclusion, I stopped worrying about it.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's like, you know, I can be, I can make friends with people. I can go out and do things.

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I just don't want to at the moment, you know? That was what I told myself like three years ago.

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And today I'm like, yeah, yeah, you know, I mean, I can drive, I can talk to people.

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't care if like people find me annoying. So it's like, I can go out there into the world, you know?

114
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If me and Digi and other people move to some big city with lots of social gatherings, with lots of nerds, then I can, whoa, and I can go around and meet people and do that.

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But like, I'm not upset that I'm not like that right now. Oh, jeez.

116
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, excuse me, getting all burpy.

117
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know, like as recently as six months ago, I had this feeling of not having anyone romantically in my life, you know, not having someone for sexual, not having someone for hug.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You know, I felt lonely, and that was like a constant like ringing sensation in my head like, I want to have that, you know, it's bringing me, it's bringing my mood down, man.

119
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And, you know, it's like, I guess some people would be like, oh man, even when you find a partner, you're still going to have that unsatisfied feeling, you know?

120
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can't fill the void, you can only tend to it. And I got a partner, and at least for now, I feel completely fine.

121
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't have that feeling anymore. I'm like, oh yeah, you know, I have a partner and it's filled the void. I'm fine now.

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You know, if I wasn't like working to anything, then I'd have that feeling of, oh, I'm not progressing, right?

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'd have that feeling of, oh, I'm not moving on. But I am, I am trying to make like more videos per month.

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
For the most part, I'm satisfied with where my YouTube career is.

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's just basically me just sort of standing in like suspended animation for whenever Digi needs me for something and then I make the video, and it's usually three to five videos a month.

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's been like two to three videos a month lately, so we're trying to get it back up to four because I would really like the more money to have, you know?

127
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But like I'm fine with that. And if it were to evolve more and we were to make more videos and like really like grind in more work on that, I'd be totally down for that.

128
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But, you know, Digi just doesn't, you know, it takes him a while to like build up the motivation to do that, I guess.

129
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You know, he just says he has a hard time like pushing himself further or something. I don't know. I don't try to put words in his mouth, okay?

130
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But like in the meantime, whenever Digi is like not giving me more stuff to do, I'm just working on designing a video game.

131
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You know, I'm still like learning how to do Python, how to do the Pi game plugin where you can design video games and shiz, and I'm doing that.

132
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And I feel great doing it, you know? And like I was like, hey, I should like finally get some semblance of how music works.

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So I've been watching like videos on music theory and like how to write sheet music and I'm like, yay, finally I know this stuff.

134
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm learning this stuff. Yay, I feel so excited, you know?

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:41,000
At the skill level I currently have, I could make a functional and boring video game and make every aspect of it except for the music right now with the skills I currently have.

136
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So, and knowing that is really satisfying to me and like knowing that I wasn't like that even one year ago is really satisfying to me.

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So I feel like there's just so much room to keep growing. Like imagine I make some video game and imagine it's really good and people love it.

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And I feel like it really represents what I want video games to be, which is what I'm shooting for, you know?

139
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's a big ambition of mine and I don't know how many years it's going to take to do, but it's like, that's the thing.

140
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's this really great vision I have that's still keeping me going with in terms of like waking up the next day, you know?

141
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
For three years I had this ambition of being a successful YouTube guy or two and a half years, something like that.

142
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I had that ambition and like now that I've like, you know, moved in and now I'm working physically with the dang person who I'm working with on YouTube,

143
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I've basically like plateaued on that in that regard, you know? I can keep going up, but at this point it's like smooth sailing for the most part, right?

144
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So that doesn't give me that sense of like looming ambition anymore.

145
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And so I felt like, ooh, I want a new looming ambition. I'm like, make a video game in your spare time, you know?

146
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Because making the videos doesn't take that much of my time away.

147
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So there you go. I mean, did you says he spends like half of his time, like, just in his room alone not knowing what to do with himself?

148
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't do that. Like, you know, I mean, it's not to say I'm like completely wired and always moving to the next thing all the time.

149
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Like if you were to observe me, it would seem as though I'm spending a lot of time kind of like standing and thinking or like pacing in my room

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
or like, you know, like like like laying in bed, but I'm not really that tired yet or like laying in bed, but I've already woken up like 45 minutes ago.

151
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You know, it's not like I'm always super productive, but I'm every single moment of my life.

152
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm thinking what's the next thing I'm going to be doing, you know, like if I'm like cooking something in the kitchen, I'm like, okay,

153
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm going to finish this food and I'm either going to eat it in the kitchen right now or I'm going to go into my room and like watch the new hypocrite video while I eat it.

154
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Then when I'm done with that, I'm going to push the plate over to the side and I'm going to like watch another five videos on music theory with my notebook and write that stuff down.

155
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And then when I'm done with that, I'm going to put the dishes back in the kitchen or I'm going to throw the dishes away because they're styrofoam dishes.

156
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And then I'm going to do this and that and I'm always readjusting my plans and, you know, things aren't going according to plan all the time.

157
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But my point is I'm always thinking about the next thing I'm going to do, you know.

158
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And you might notice I'm being like really fast talky, being really stuttery.

159
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm making like broken English sentences sometimes because I'm trying to like emphasize like being the way that I feel in my own head.

160
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You know, lately to do my De Vu Hadron Collider series, I've been like deliberately slowing myself down and like feeling more like, you know,

161
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
trying to be to do it more the way Digi does it or the way other people do it where you're much more understandable and it's a much more consumable piece of media.

162
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But for the sake of my point in this episode, I want to like really just like talk the way that I feel.

163
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You know, this is the way that I talk if I don't put any filter on myself.

164
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is the way I feel if I don't put any filter on myself. I just feel good all the time.

165
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And it's like, so Digi saying don't look up to something because it's bullshit.

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Like I don't care if what you look up to is bullshit, you know, like I think that's perfectly fine.

167
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Like if you get something out of it, even if it's based on lies, if it makes your life better than who cares, you know, like,

168
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
if you try to imitate Digi and like, and you're having a fun time doing it,

169
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
but then you end up failing or you end up not liking it, who cares as long as you had a fun time getting there,

170
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,000
as long as you enjoyed the creative process of trying to get good at writing and vlogging or whatever else you want to do in your conquest to rip off Digi, you know,

171
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
it's like who, like what's the loss?

172
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If you're sitting around not knowing what to do with your life, then why not try that lifestyle, you know?

173
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I feel like maybe I'm trying to think like where does my positivity come from?

174
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Maybe it comes from my dad who's always positive. Where does he get his?

175
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You know, he came from a broken family. He came from a family way more broken than like any of my friends talk about.

176
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
He gets his confidence from God. He admires an all-powerful deity who I'm pretty sure doesn't exist.

177
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You can't get more flimsy than that, but he like completely goes for it and it clearly works.

178
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And like that admiration is able to trickle down to me.

179
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Like I'm able to then observe my dad's bullshit happiness and like absorb it into myself and I'm not able to be as positive as my dad is, that's for sure.

180
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But I'm able to be like 85% as positive as he is.

181
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And so it's like I feel like, you know, and then if I have kids, then like they can look up to me and you know, maybe it'll be like a slow decrement of happiness.

182
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But maybe, you know, my dad, their grandpa will just show God to them and then they'll feel God and you know, like whatever, fucking...

183
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
My point is I admired Digi and Jesse's lifestyle and I pursued it and I achieved it and it's working for me.

184
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So, uh, he's wrong.

185
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay, so now that I've gone through and listened to everything that I just recorded, I wanted to add on some additional thoughts.

186
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You know, the number one thing sticking out to me in my mind is, you know, my art is not as good as Digi or Jesse's is.

187
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I never ended up making that many videos, but obviously they were never even able to get close to as good of a body of work as Digi has or Jesse does.

188
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Or other people who I guess are fueled by anxiety and sadness.

189
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You know, I mean, when I think about it, a lot of the art that I love the absolute most comes from very dark places, but like...

190
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So like the question is, does the way that I feel, does my attitude limit my ability to make that kind of stuff?

191
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I guess so, but still, it's not like I don't have dark places within me.

192
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's just that they don't control me, I guess.

193
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I could still like look at them and then convert that into a script if I want to.

194
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So I don't know, like, I think it's more valid to just say I've been doing this for not nearly as long as Digi and Jesse have been.

195
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You know, like, you know, I haven't been writing for nearly as long as Digi has been, and I've basically stopped writing entirely in the last year, so it's like, you know...

196
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm just not as old as either of them, they've had more time to practice on stuff in general, so of course they're way better than me in that regard.

197
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But yeah, you know, I'm thinking of like old guy artists, you know, you get people who are all like, I guess, just constantly crushed with depression all the time,

198
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and I guess they make the best stuff, and then the people who are generally happy are not, like, they tend to make the more...

199
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The people who seem more genuinely happy seem to be the ones working for Disney, making like cookie cutter technically competent stuff, I guess.

200
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know, I'll figure that one out.

201
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And you know, another thing I want to say is that it's not like nothing gets me down.

202
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
If anything, I am brought down way more easily than any of my friends.

203
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like, as I was editing the first 17 minutes of this, and I was hitting the spacebar to pause and play a bunch, the spacebar started getting stuck.

204
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And this is a $55 keyboard, and apparently I've been hammering away at that spacebar so heavily that I'm actually starting to wear it out.

205
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And this keyboard isn't even a year old yet, it's probably like 9 to 7 months old.

206
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And this, and that makes me sad. I really don't want to have to buy another $55 keyboard, I really...

207
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But I also don't want to have to look up, you know, what is, how to fix the spacebar and risk making it more broken.

208
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like, I'm just pressing it lightly now, and that's enough to like make it get stuck, and I don't like that.

209
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I like the spacebar, that's why I push it so hard.

210
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Like, no matter what I'm doing, if it involves pushing the spacebar, I'm pushing it very hard.

211
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You know, it's not like I'm invincible. It's not that I have a thick skin, I don't have a thick skin when it comes to life.

212
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I just have a fast running ability when it comes to running away from problems.

213
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
When it comes to avoiding things that are going to make me sad, I avoid them.

214
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I can't take them. If they are given to me, then I'm going to get pretty down, you know?

215
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And I will spring back, but, you know, I mean, I guess that is just what normal...

216
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I guess that's just what it's like to be normal and not depressed, so...

217
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You know, whatever, but there you go.

218
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The last thing I was thinking of is that, yeah, I really think that my current attitude really was defined, really was set by...

219
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
When I made my video, definitively proving the value or the worth of a bunch of mediums of art.

220
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And interestingly enough, that was when I first drew my purple face with the thumbs up emoticon,

221
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
because I was trying to make a thumbnail for that video, and so I just took a picture of a bunch of...

222
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
One of my favorite video games, one of my favorite cartoons, one of my favorite anime, one of my favorite albums,

223
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and I arranged them in a circle, and I wanted some more aesthetic cohesion,

224
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
so I drew that thing just sort of impromptu to put that in the middle of the icon there,

225
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
to, like, represent how I feel fine.

226
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So, from now on, consider that emoticon thing to represent this attitude that I have explained in this episode, right?

227
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's what it means now. I now retroactively give it that meaning.

228
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Maybe it subconsciously had that meaning, and I never realized, so there you go.

229
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
See you around.

230
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. One last thing I want to say.

231
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I forgot to mention this, and I'm not sure if I should say this,

232
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
because it's sort of me armchair-psychologizing Digi without his permission.

233
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So if you take this idea, be very careful to remember, it is me who said this, Digi, and no one else said it,

234
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I take full responsibility for this, okay?

235
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But me personally, I just feel like Digi is someone who will explain the way his life is,

236
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
with this very, like, firm definitiveness to it, and then, like, five months later,

237
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
he'll have a completely different perspective as to who he is and what he is,

238
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and it'll be a totally different story with a totally different emotional slant to it,

239
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and it'll, you know, he'll feel like a totally different, like, he'll have a totally different life,

240
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and now this is the definitive way that he truly is, and he says that he does that, you know?

241
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He thinks of himself as, like, existing in three-month increments.

242
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So, you know, just keep in mind that, like, I wouldn't be surprised if, like, when we moved to some city

243
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and he, like, finds people to hang out with and stuff to do all the time,

244
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
that someone enters his life or some hobby enters his life, something changes,

245
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and then suddenly he doesn't at all feel the way he did, the way he feels right now, you know?

246
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I wouldn't be surprised at all if that's the case.

247
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I know that, like, when you're climbing up, like, your goals and ambitions,

248
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and they're not satisfying to you and they're not giving you the happiness you wanted,

249
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
that you feel like maybe it just never exists, you can just go up the ladder infinitely and you'll never get there.

250
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't know, like, I feel like maybe for certain people, it doesn't exist in this world, in this timeline,

251
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but, like, hypothetically, there could be.

252
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Like, imagine if the only thing that can make you happy is to play rock and roll, but you were born in the 1400s.

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So, hypothetically, then, there is no ladder for you.

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Maybe that is the case.

255
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You know, maybe if I was born before the internet, I could have never found my vessel,

256
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and maybe for you, you know, whoever is listening,

257
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
maybe what will truly satisfy you won't be invented until long after your time

258
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
or was uninvented thousands of years ago.

259
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You know, maybe you could only be satisfied out in the wild before civilization.

260
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So, maybe for certain people, there is no true happiness out there in the world in which they live.

261
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But I kind of feel like every human brain, except for, like, really massively fucked up ones,

262
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
like, like, ones with actual, like, identifiable, you know, genetic disorders

263
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
where, like, you're uncontrollably banging your head in the wall every 20 minutes, that kind of thing.

264
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Except for those people, I kind of wonder, does every human brain, like, present this puzzle

265
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
of how to achieve happiness, and is the puzzle always theoretically solvable?

266
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I like to think that there is.

267
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I like to think that even if you've gotten to an extent where you think, like, this,

268
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
once I go up the next rung, I will achieve happiness.

269
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But it doesn't, and you think, oh, I guess it must never exist.

270
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I say keep trying. I say keep, keep trying, because I think eventually it will happen.

271
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You know, like, I just kind of, I just kind of think it will.

272
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Like, eventually things do kind of fucking work out.

273
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And I mean, if you go your whole life and it never works out, then, oh well, you're dead now,

274
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000

275
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Na, na, na, na, na.
