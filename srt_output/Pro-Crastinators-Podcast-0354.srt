1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,260
I want to bless that guy, that Son ofé½£.

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,680
How do we start this episode?

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,180
It's already started, by the way.

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,700
But how do we start it?

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,740
By my book, so we can start it.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,760
Yeah, okay.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
I did, by the way.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,280
I did buy the book.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Yes.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Thank you.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
Thank you.

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,440
There's a Gunsmoke Volume 1 on Amazon, and what's it called?

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,480
On Amazon, Paperback, and eBook.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
No, Kofi.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Oh, and Kofi.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,360
Kofi is for people who don't need an eBook Kindle version.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,860
Right.

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,560
Which is potentially lots of people.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,120
And I get a lot more royalties through Kofi than Amazon, but of course, Kofi cannot print

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
stuff.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
I mean, I want the physical.

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Yeah.

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:08,960
I think the majority of orders I've got, at least the ones I can see, are physical prints.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to ask about numbers.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,240
It seems a bit rude, almost.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
No, I've got some numbers.

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,600
The one thing I can tell you is that it's not showing me current up to the minute numbers

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
for all the orders.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,080
I don't know the process by which it decides, okay, this order has definitely gone through.

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,280
It's been finalized, and now we can put it on the spreadsheet.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,680
But it's taking like one to two days for an order to appear.

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,360
So I'm getting things from yesterday this morning, and it's only a few.

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,400
And I know it's more actual sales have happened than are being shown to me, because of the

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
amount of people who have said they're buying one.

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,880
Do you not get a notification every time you sell one?

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,480
No, I don't know why it is.

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,800
I think that there's a grace period.

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
This is a conjecture.

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,840
I haven't actually read this from Amazon.

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,480
I've tried to find an explanation.

41
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,120
And there seems to be third-party software that can track it more closely.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,200
But it seems to be like the reason is there's a grace period for if somebody wants to refund

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,440
it before it actually gets shipped out.

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:36,960
So they don't want to give me the information until the money has actually been finally transferred

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,640
and cannot be refunded.

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,040
I guess that makes sense.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,160
Yeah, so I don't have a cool number or a cool graph to look at.

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,800
I think I'll look into third-party stuff just so I can look at the number go up, because

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,160
I am excited about that.

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:02,880
So far, it has counted eight orders, and I know there's more than that, but eight, six

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,480
physical prints from United States, one from here at UK, and a Kindle version that my

52
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:17,840
mom bought to try it out on her iPad, which was useful, because I didn't know what it

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,320
looked like on a phone or an iPad through the Kindle.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
It looks great.

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm sure there's more people listening that want a copy of Clarissa Gunsmoke Volume 1.

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes, I didn't really really talk about what it is.

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,240
Get those orders in, folks.

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,840
It's the first volume of my comic Clarissa Gunsmoke and the Bandit King, which contains

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,720
the three currently out chapters, plus the unreleased currently, as of recording unreleased

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,520
fourth chapter, the fourth one.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
The fourth one.

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
The fourth one.

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
The fourth one.

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,760
Hey, may the fourth be with you.

65
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,160
It's March.

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
It's March the fourth.

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
Pardon me.

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Excuse me.

69
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Yeah.

70
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Cinco de Marcho.

71
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Cinco de Marcho.

72
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:20,920
You said you were, I was amazed when you told me the profit margins.

73
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,840
You said, you told me it was like $7.

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
You make like $7.

75
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
That's like almost half.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Yes.

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,960
And that's like on a $15 book sale, like that's, I would expect, my expenses for printing

78
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,880
a book like this would be at least, I would probably, including like printing the book,

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,560
getting it shipped to me and then mailing it, even inside the US, I would expect that

80
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,720
all to cost me at least $10 maybe more, which would leave me with only like $5 or less in

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
profit.

82
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Yeah.

83
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,400
And on like foreign, on like international shipment, forget about it.

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Shipping would be $20.

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Yeah.

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,520
It's a whole big fuck.

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Yeah.

88
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Yeah.

89
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,600
I have for ebook.

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
It just makes me so jealous.

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,080
I just want Amazon, I just want Amazon's infrastructure.

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,080
I just want to have access to the fucking means by which they ship things so cheaply.

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Why do they get to do it and I have to freaking go to the post office and pay $25 to send

94
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,840
six ounces of packaging to the UK?

95
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
It's evil.

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,600
Because they bundle up their packages and then they have it like lashed together with

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,000
rope and then they have a slave driver and he's does his whip thing and it's like in

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,280
the pyramids of Giza, they roll the packages on logs into the post office.

99
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,240
Why didn't I get a slave?

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
I don't know.

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
They got slaves.

102
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
You should have worked harder than you would have done.

103
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,440
Maybe I should have pulled myself up by my bootstraps if I wanted a slave.

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:56,240
They ship them in the big metal containers like the ones in the dock and in Disco Elysium.

105
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,400
The one that freaking Everard has his office in.

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Yeah.

107
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Yeah.

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
One of those.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
But yeah, the royalties.

110
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,520
The royalties are a little interesting.

111
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,760
For paperback, quite simple, there's 60% royalty minus printing fees and for printing

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,160
this book, it's like two bucks.

113
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Yeah.

114
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Really?

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,320
So how many pages is it?

116
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,240
74 pages.

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
That's really cheap.

118
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,600
That's really cheap printing.

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,440
That's cheap as fuck and that is because it's like non-color.

120
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,520
I think if it was a color book, it'd be a little bit more expensive, but not prohibitively.

121
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,960
I think I'd look to the tables, it'd be like three to five dollars depending on how many

122
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,520
pages and if it was hardback and stuff like that.

123
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
When you...

124
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Okay.

125
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,600
I mean, so the buyer doesn't have to pay for shipping because I bought one and it went

126
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
into my...

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,880
I assume if you have Prime, you get free shipping, you get on everything if you have Prime.

128
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,600
I don't have Prime, so I usually have to...

129
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,720
As long as I buy more than $25 worth of stuff on Amazon at a time, I get free shipping on

130
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
most things.

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,480
So I put it in my cart and I got free shipping on it because I added $10 worth of other stuff.

132
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,760
So I effectively paid nothing for shipping.

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Yeah, it's great.

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
So...

135
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Wait a minute.

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,820
It's finally a way I can send merchandise of my artwork out into the world without it

137
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,400
being too expensive for people to say, oh, I don't know about that.

138
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:35,520
I actually can't believe this because like $2 for...

139
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,000
I mean, I assume it's because the pages are black and white.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,120
So I assume that that would cost more if it were in color.

141
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,440
But for $2, I mean, I would pay more than that to print, for example, a copy of the

142
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:59,800
Radcon Paradise Dojin, which is only 32 pages, black and white, cost more than $3 per copy

143
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,320
to print.

144
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
So that's...

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
It's almost...

146
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,840
Oh, God, I'm going to make myself sick if this is true, but it would be almost cheaper

147
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,600
to simply buy print-on-demand copies one at a time in bulk from Amazon and ship them

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,280
to myself than it is to buy a bulk order from Kaplan.

149
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,200
No, that can't be true.

150
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, you haven't even heard the best part.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,520
Well, it's not the best part, but a cool thing about that is I, as an author, as the

152
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,600
author of this book, I can request Amazon send me a bulk order physical that I can then

153
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,440
sell by myself in person.

154
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,320
So if I want to go to a convention, I can pay just the price of printing, not like the

155
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,960
actual cost of the thing, send it to me, and then I can have like 100 Clarissa Gunsmokes

156
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,520
printed by Amazon at that price.

157
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,720
Do you get a discount or same price?

158
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,120
I think it might be a discount and check, because I didn't need that.

159
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,520
Because if there's additional discounts for printing in bulk, then that's just gravy.

160
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Yes.

161
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
It's already cheap.

162
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,600
I would imagine there might be, but didn't check that exactly.

163
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,760
But that's cool, because if I ever need, like, oh, I'm going to maybe see if I can get a

164
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,480
table at a convention, I need a bunch of my book.

165
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Yeah.

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Amazon can just send it to me.

167
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Yeah.

168
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
It's great.

169
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Wow.

170
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,640
And you can have it, too.

171
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,720
It ships everywhere in the world, everywhere.

172
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Can I, the consumer, order 100 copies and get a bulk discount?

173
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,520
No, I don't think so.

174
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,360
I guess you can get a shipping discount.

175
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Nice.

176
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
If you buy two enough things.

177
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Hell yeah.

178
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,440
But yeah, I'm going to have to look into this.

179
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Damn it.

180
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
I was hoping I wouldn't have to look into this, but I guess I do.

181
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
It's so good.

182
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,960
Okay, so there's 60% royalty for paperback, but they have an extra thing that I checked.

183
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:08,040
So in addition to that, expanded distribution networks, so like Amazon can have the book

184
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:16,040
listed for schools and libraries and bookstores to purchase and put in their store.

185
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,880
And I get a 40% royalty on that.

186
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,400
So if Barden's a noble, know that Clarissa Gunsmoke's hot shit and they want it in their

187
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,440
store all over the world, all over the country, I guess, they can order it from Amazon.

188
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,240
And I get money through that.

189
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,920
So it's even less work I have to do for, not likely to happen because Clarissa Gunsmoke

190
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,080
is like a complete nobody right now, but that's cool.

191
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,640
If that were to happen, if you were to get copies ordered for libraries or bookstores

192
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,960
or anything, I mean, I would want to know about that.

193
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,760
That would be awesome.

194
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:58,480
I guess I understand how that Amazon could offer that as a possibility, but I'm sure

195
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,520
you have to promote it yourself, like they're not going to promote it for you.

196
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,360
No, well, they don't promote it.

197
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,600
The marketing is all on my end.

198
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,040
But they put it in a catalog or something.

199
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
They put it in a catalog and it can be listed.

200
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,720
So like if a librarian is just scrolling through and I see Clarissa Gunsmoke and they're like,

201
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
ah, that looks like something we need in the library.

202
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,640
So just download a copy.

203
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,200
I mean, yeah, order a copy or three.

204
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,480
You wouldn't download a copy of Clarissa Gunsmoke.

205
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,720
Oh, wait, yes, you would from Kofi.

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:35,080
Yes, you would from Kofi, where I get that only takes 5% of the sale for a Kofi store,

207
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,200
Kofi store.

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
I looked at Gumroad, by the way, Gumroad takes 10%.

209
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
So like Kofi is just better.

210
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
I didn't actually know you could sell stuff through Kofi.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,120
It might be relatively new, but yeah, it's quite easy.

212
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,920
You just take 5% of every sale.

213
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:01,040
And if you're like a special member of Kofi, it's like you get 100% of the sale goes to you.

214
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Are you a special member?

215
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,120
No, I'm a free user.

216
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,080
But 5% is so low, that's great.

217
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:17,320
Yeah, I made a Kofi for the PCP, sort of as like a secondary support alternative to Patreon,

218
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,000
the idea that we would advertise it in the perfect comic party.

219
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,160
You know, I think it's Kofi.com slash the PCP.

220
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
I think that's the URL.

221
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,600
Wait, what's your Kofi?

222
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,640
Oh, yes, my Kofi is Kofi.com slash Gibbentake, same as everywhere else.

223
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Right, right, right.

224
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,920
Oh, and Amazon, Amazon has given me, let me check, because it was a little glitchy, but

225
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,800
like if I search Clarissa Gunsmoke,

226
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,200
and it comes up, Hell yeah, it comes up, that's so fucking cool.

227
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,680
And then I click my name.

228
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,120
It's my name.

229
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,400
Oh, it doesn't work.

230
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,440
It doesn't work in the UK.

231
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,320
I think in the US, I have like an author page in US, Amazon.

232
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,280
So if I switch to, switch the fucking,

233
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,760
oh, whatever.

234
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,320
But I have an author page, so I can put like a profile picture and say, oh, I'm an author.

235
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,120
This is about me.

236
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,720
Hmm.

237
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,040
Learn more about Louie Batten.

238
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,400
That's my full name.

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,240
I was not sure whether I was going to do my full name or an internet pseudonym.

240
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,320
I saw you put it as Ms. Louie Batten.

241
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,520
Yes.

242
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:49,000
Ms is such a funny, such a funny, such a hype, such a specific use case for an abbreviation, Ms.

243
00:13:49,160 --> 00:14:00,360
But yeah, I think just because it maybe seems more professional and more like legitimate to have

244
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,320
a person's name and everyone does it.

245
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,120
Everyone does it.

246
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,000
So it's like, I don't know, if on the off-chance that Enormy is learning about my comic,

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
they won't be slightly put off by Gibb and take internet name.

248
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,080
Right.

249
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,400
Yeah.

250
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,520
Maybe.

251
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,080
They'll think of it as, oh, it's a glorific novel.

252
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,560
Who made Scott Pilgrim?

253
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,240
It's not like whatever username.

254
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,040
Not Radio Maru.

255
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,320
Yeah.

256
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,160
It was Brian Lee O'Malley.

257
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,680
You see.

258
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:34,920
All right.

259
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,560
That was his Tumblr handle.

260
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,840
Lol.

261
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,160
Yeah.

262
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,280
So yeah, I'm jazzed.

263
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,240
I was very-

264
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,600
Pretty jazz worthy.

265
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,040
I was very frustrated last week.

266
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,240
It was difficult to get everything working.

267
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,600
I bought a paperback for myself and it looks great.

268
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,800
And there's no problems anymore.

269
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,920
I can't wait to see mine.

270
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,320
Oh, it's so good.

271
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,160
It's like, what if you made something?

272
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,680
You, what if you drew something on a computer screen and then you have it in your hand?

273
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,440
No way.

274
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,560
Shit.

275
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,840
I think I'm going to have it on Friday.

276
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
I think mine's arriving on Friday.

277
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,440
So it'll be the day this goes up.

278
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,960
I'll have it hopefully, maybe even sooner.

279
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,600
This is the beginning of my girl boss CEO arc.

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,880
I'm starting it.

281
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,920
I'm starting an industry.

282
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,960
I'm starting an empire.

283
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,760
It'll be Clarissa Gunsmoke to start.

284
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,880
And then I'm going to put, I think I might,

285
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,360
the next thing I put on Amazon will be the Belle Jape book.

286
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,240
And that'll be like, you can get a paperback or a hardback,

287
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,800
because that's going to be like hundreds of pages, I think.

288
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,720
Do you have that made or do you?

289
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,640
It's half made.

290
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,440
It's like started.

291
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,040
I started it back a while before even the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.

292
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,440
Because like, you know, I love those home stuck and problem sleuth books

293
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,800
with the little commentary at the bottom.

294
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,080
What if I did that?

295
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,680
With my silly little thing.

296
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,240
Yeah.

297
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,720
So I have the beginnings of something.

298
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,960
But yeah, translating it takes a long time with all the gifts

299
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,280
and posting multiple versions of, you know, the different frames

300
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,760
and completely different experience.

301
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,960
Well, now I have two potential segues into topics of conversation.

302
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,640
I could go, I could branch off of, oh, translating something

303
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,520
from digital onto a page, or I could go like print on demand

304
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,880
versus like backlog print runs.

305
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,960
Do the second one.

306
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:52,920
Okay.

307
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,760
So I have changed the, I ordered the PCP Radcon Paradise Dojin.

308
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,160
I ordered, I think I ordered like, I only ordered like 30 copies,

309
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,440
because like I wanted to give copies to all the artists and to the writers.

310
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,320
And I only got a, I only got a handful of other orders,

311
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,000
but like it's not that hard for me to order more.

312
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,640
If like, I get, if I get like 20 more orders tomorrow when I run out,

313
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,960
I could just order like a dozen more copies.

314
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,680
And it, it, it costs me like 10 extra dollars in shipping.

315
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,160
It's not that big a deal to just, to just get like a few more.

316
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,880
So I ordered a bunch of those and I have offered on St.

317
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,000
Comics store page.

318
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,840
I have offered, I've, I've offering a combo.

319
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,360
I call it the Rad combo.

320
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,120
It's for the, the, the, the Rad, the Dojin and the Road to Radcon for like,

321
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,240
I think it's like eight or nine dollars off the whole thing.

322
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,520
If you buy both as a combo.

323
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,760
And the reason I did that is cause I have like 30,

324
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,640
I have like 30 leftover copies of Road to Radcon.

325
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,480
And I really just like to get rid of them.

326
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,120
I don't need, I don't need 30 copies of that in a box.

327
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,640
Please buy my Rad combo.

328
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,480
It's, it's, it's a combo deal.

329
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,280
Super size it.

330
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,840
Road to Radcon is good.

331
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,080
You shouldn't, it actually, it actually is pretty

332
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,480
funny. If you, if, if, just a reminder, if you haven't read it,

333
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,440
you can read it for free on the new PCP website at theprocrastinatorspodcast.com

334
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,520
slash stuff.html.

335
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,520
It is pretty funny.

336
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,400
And the cover art by Michi is gorgeous and it's a nice little novella.

337
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,120
Yeah, a little doodles on the inside.

338
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,360
The doodles on the inside are nice.

339
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,680
The cover is a, is a, is a real masterpiece.

340
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,840
But I don't need 30 of them.

341
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,560
Please buy them.

342
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,120
Yeah, that's another great thing.

343
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Don't have to do any shipping at all.

344
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,160
Amazon will do.

345
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,200
Yeah, that's, that's.

346
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,200
International shipping is so expensive.

347
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
I never have to have a bunch of crap, a bunch of stuff in my room.

348
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,520
It's, it, I feel so clean.

349
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,720
I feel so cool.

350
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,000
Having, and having to go, having to go to the post office is such a,

351
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,040
such a freaking, such a freaking drag.

352
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,640
I hate, I hate that shit.

353
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,040
Oh, I gotta, my PO box is about to expire.

354
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,880
I have to like renew my PO box soon.

355
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,040
The other thing.

356
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,840
Okay, I want to say it.

357
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,440
On the store page, the plebenweed blu-rays.

358
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,720
I think I might have mentioned this last week,

359
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,320
but I'm going to be discontinuing them.

360
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm not going to be making any more

361
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,920
because it's not worth it to make more.

362
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,960
So the, the lat, those will be, those will be coming down

363
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,760
probably sometime in the next week.

364
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,560
After the, after this episode goes live.

365
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,800
There's simply, there's simply not enough demand to, to justify

366
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
continuing to order the stuff I need.

367
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,720
Don't want to buy any more DVD boxes or anything like that.

368
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,320
So what I got is going to be the last, the last of it that I make.

369
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,000
And then, you know, sorry if you miss out,

370
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,280
but like you should have, you should have bought it earlier, guys.

371
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,280
So I don't know, jump on that if you want.

372
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,920
Uh, there's no blu-ray for Clarissa Gunsmoke yet.

373
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,560
We should put, we should put the rad content on the blu-ray.

374
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,440
We should, we should put the garling house lecture

375
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,800
and the garling house diss track.

376
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,320
And we should put all that on, on its own blu-ray.

377
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,000
Everything should, everything should be on blu-ray.

378
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,280
Everything should be, you know, the OVA, everything should be on blu-ray.

379
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,160
I don't put blu-ray discs in my blu-ray player.

380
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,320
Physical media only.

381
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,440
I mean, I don't even, I like physical comics

382
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,120
because you can pick it up off the shelf

383
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,560
and you're already reading it.

384
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,320
Yeah. A DVD, you've got to like put it in your freaking machine.

385
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,440
A DVD, you need one, all of the material,

386
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,680
all of the technology required to make it work

387
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,040
to be currently functioning and the disc itself to be undamaged.

388
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,560
And then even then after that, it's like, I don't know, it's fine.

389
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,400
StComics.

390
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,480
Try to watch a YouTube video again.

391
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,440
StComics.com slash store.html for that while supplies last.

392
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,760
Time is, time is running out.

393
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,320
You will be gone soon, no longer available.

394
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,200
Or here's the thing I forgot to say.

395
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,760
Oh, sure.

396
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,280
So royalties, the ebook on Kindle, the royalty is odd.

397
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,120
There's two versions I could have chosen.

398
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,000
One of them is like 30% royalties.

399
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,440
And I don't know why it's like so low.

400
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,040
But the other one is 70%.

401
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:32,040
But they reduce the money you get for the size of the file of like the ebook.

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,760
So if you've got a big ebook, the megabytes weigh it down and you get less money.

403
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,800
Really?

404
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,960
Yes. I think it's just like people don't want huge files on their Kindle.

405
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,680
Just to incentivize like lower.

406
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,560
Yeah, compress compression and like, I mean, usually you would have text,

407
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,680
so it'd be small anyway.

408
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,280
So if you're doing a print book or a color, like a book with images,

409
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,240
you want to compress that as much as you can without it being shitty looking.

410
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,840
Is there like a threshold and like as long as you're under this threshold,

411
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,000
the royalties are better?

412
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,720
No, no, I think.

413
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Well, I chose 70% because like, I still get more money that way,

414
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,080
even with the size of my ebook.

415
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:32,280
As opposed to the 30% of the sale, which is just flat and the megabytes doesn't get involved.

416
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,440
I mean, yeah, 70% is better than 30%.

417
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,920
But how did you qualify for that?

418
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,440
What did you have to do?

419
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,640
What do you mean qualify?

420
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,440
Well, you said.

421
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:49,640
Well, you said, I mean, the choice between 70% and 30% seems like a no brainer.

422
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,520
So like, what's the catch?

423
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,360
Well, the catch is that if you have a big file size,

424
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,400
I think there's something else for the 30% that I didn't really understand when I read it.

425
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,400
It's something, something, something, I'll have to go back and check.

426
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,200
But it's some technical thing that is like maybe good.

427
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,520
But like, I just want more money.

428
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,440
I don't give a shit.

429
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,600
Maybe it would like convert it into different types of Kindle things

430
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,840
and more people could read it on different places.

431
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,120
Well, I don't, well, I don't use, I don't use a Kindle or like ebooks or anything.

432
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,440
So I don't know how any of that works.

433
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,160
But sure, I do understand why they would want low file sizes.

434
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,360
Definitely.

435
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:40,280
Yeah, but I still get like from this, the 999 ebook on with that stuff,

436
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,240
minus the file size is $3.11, obviously, that's not bad.

437
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Obviously we'll put a link in the description to where you can purchase Clarissa Gunsmoke

438
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,360
volume one.

439
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Oh, speaking of links with, I put the link on my website.

440
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,560
I have a little button underneath Clarissa Gunsmoke that says buy like a paperback or buy digital.

441
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,920
They're links to the different stores.

442
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:12,520
But the Amazon one goes to theamericanamazon.com instead of .couk or like .de or whatever.

443
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,720
And it doesn't automatically adjust.

444
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,640
I think there is a way to have a link to Amazon automatically adjust to your region.

445
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,120
Because if I click on that, it goes to amazon.com and then it says it doesn't ship to me.

446
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,160
But if I switch regions, it will say that.

447
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,400
So I've got to update that.

448
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,800
I've got to find that link and I'll send that link and that should be the link under the description.

449
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,160
But if you search Clarissa Gunsmoke on Amazon, you will find it.

450
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,240
And it'll be in your region if you do it like that.

451
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,960
Yeah, yeah.

452
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,880
So it's all good.

453
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,120
But it should ship to everywhere.

454
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,640
Yes, anywhere that Amazon has a website version, which is many countries in the place in the world.

455
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,760
You've gone global.

456
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,200
I'm global.

457
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm a global published author.

458
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,360
I was reading.

459
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,800
Oh, you know who sent me an interesting document?

460
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,800
It was those guys from the Cato anthology.

461
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,440
Remember them?

462
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,520
We had them on when they published.

463
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,440
They kickstarted their anthology comic.

464
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:29,080
Hoodie from Cato sent me their document, which was it was because they had heard us talking

465
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,880
about copyright stuff for the perfect comic party.

466
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,000
And they sent me their agreement for inclusion in their stuff.

467
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,760
And I read through their document and it was interesting.

468
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,000
And then I looked up a bunch of terms that were in it and I was googling around,

469
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,800
trying to learn more about copyright stuff.

470
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:55,560
And I found out there's a lot to it.

471
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:01,160
You can sell the rights to all different kinds of things with your work.

472
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,800
When you publish something, you can sell someone the right to be the first to publish.

473
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,280
You can sell someone the right to be the first to publish in a given country,

474
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,160
which means you can sell the same rights to another country.

475
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,480
You can give someone the rights to be the first to publish in a certain language,

476
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,160
which means you can then do it in a translated language with some other publisher,

477
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,600
and you can sell those rights to them.

478
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,680
The right to be the first to publish is its own thing.

479
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,000
Sometimes it comes along with a stipulation that you will not publish elsewhere for a certain

480
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,800
period of time.

481
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:43,080
There's archival rights, which are ongoing rights in perpetuity to host and publish

482
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,840
the digital rights.

483
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,840
The electronic rights are separate from both from all kinds of printing rights.

484
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,200
So I don't know, it was pretty complicated.

485
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,240
And I came away thinking, I think what we got to do is just worry about the digital version

486
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,280
for now.

487
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:09,160
And I think the agreement should just give us permission to publish and archive

488
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,440
your submission electronically.

489
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,560
We will host it for free, and you will give it to us for free, and we will host it for free.

490
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,760
And that's the agreement.

491
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,840
And there's nothing else to it until, if we ever want to print in the future,

492
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,880
we'll contact you and we'll work something out for that.

493
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,640
I see.

494
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,200
I think that's probably how we should move forward

495
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,200
with the digital PDF version.

496
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,240
There's lots of different publishers.

497
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:50,040
So what's hypothetically, if we wanted to do printing, what's the complications?

498
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,960
Well, it's basically a separate agreement.

499
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,880
I was kind of hoping that we could have it all ironed out.

500
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:06,360
If someone submits their comic, they are giving us the right to publish it in whatever form we

501
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,600
want, and maybe there would be certain monetary compensation involved.

502
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,560
If we decide to take it to print and print it as an anthology, maybe we would have already

503
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,320
agreed to compensate them a certain amount ahead of time.

504
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,080
I would like to have gotten all the agreements out of the way upon submission,

505
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,400
and there's no more need to worry about it.

506
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,200
I think that that was a pipe dream.

507
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,840
I think it's too complicated for that to be possible.

508
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:45,160
Is it like, it sounds like a weird, bad, sneaky contract thing, but what if we want to contact

509
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,680
you about, we're going to try and print it, but certain people just never get back to us?

510
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,760
Yeah, that's what I was worried about.

511
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,960
Do we have to put in a thing saying, if you do not get back to us upon our initial thing,

512
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,120
but within a certain amount of time, then we're just allowed to do it?

513
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,600
I feel like that's a little bit of a sneaky small print thing.

514
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:19,160
Yeah, I think, I was worried about that too.

515
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,920
It's like, well, once we have it in the publication, what if we then can't get them

516
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,440
on board, or we can't contact them again, or they disappear, and we want to publish

517
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,200
their stuff in a print anthology?

518
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,280
Maybe just leave them out of the printed version?

519
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,040
My gut says, okay, it's probably putting the card before the horse to be worrying

520
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,400
about print rights when we're not even thinking about printing anything yet,

521
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,800
when we're just worried about a digital publication.

522
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,120
Maybe we need to worry about the digital and electronic archival rights right now.

523
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,120
And yeah, I think it's just going to be probably if we want to print and we reach out

524
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,800
to the author and we say, hey, let's license us to print your stuff and sell your stuff

525
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
as part of an anthology, and they don't answer us.

526
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:13,880
I think we're just going to have to be like, well, we can't do it, which would suck.

527
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:22,360
But I mean, I don't know if there's anything else for it.

528
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:30,840
I guess. I mean, for any individual person who has a comic,

529
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:42,840
I would assume they would want the ability to do print their own thing, archive their own thing

530
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,120
in addition to whatever the perfect comic party will be.

531
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:57,080
So I guess the perfect comic party being unprintable is not a terrible tragedy in my eyes,

532
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,520
as long as, I mean, I'm going to be printing my comments.

533
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,800
I'm not saying it's unprintable.

534
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,400
I'm just saying.

535
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,840
Well, it would be difficult.

536
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,440
Well, I'm just saying we wouldn't.

537
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,240
But certain issues would be unprintable if we just can't get the person.

538
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,520
Well.

539
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,880
Or if it's people don't agree.

540
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,440
Well, yes, true.

541
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,640
But I think that's not too big of a problem, because I'm still going to be able to print

542
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,360
my comic.

543
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,440
It's not going to prevent other people from printing the comics on their own terms.

544
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:27,880
Yeah.

545
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,360
Yeah.

546
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,680
The collective will not be able to be printed.

547
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,240
I'm not interested.

548
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,320
I'm not interested in stipulating anything for submissions that are like,

549
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,240
if you submit, you agree you will not publish this in any other.

550
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,440
Oh, no, no.

551
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,480
That's not what I mean.

552
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,720
Yeah.

553
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,280
Yeah.

554
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,360
Yeah.

555
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,160
Of course.

556
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,960
I mean, if I was going to stipulate that, I would expect that we would be paying money.

557
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,120
And I don't want to pay anyone money.

558
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,720
We're doing this free.

559
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:03,400
Unless if we're not selling the book, then I feel like it's OK to ask people to submit for free.

560
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,240
But I wouldn't feel that way if we were like, well, if you give it to us,

561
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,360
then you can't publish anywhere else.

562
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,680
No, of course not.

563
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,040
That would never be part of the thing.

564
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,440
Because I mean, the idea of having a printed version of the perfect comic party is just like,

565
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,240
oh, that'd be nice.

566
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,600
Would that be nice?

567
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Well, it's nice.

568
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
That's about as far as it goes.

569
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,720
Well, no.

570
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,240
No, you idiot.

571
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,480
It's not just nice.

572
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
It's about staying in the black.

573
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,520
It's about the dollar-dollar bills.

574
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,040
It's about stacking Benjamins.

575
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,520
It's about.

576
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:44,120
Then if that's the case, the contract needs to be a little more like it can handle that.

577
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:53,720
I just think potentially print copies are an avenue to turn this venture into

578
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
something that generates revenue.

579
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:07,480
But for that, yeah, we would need additional agreements with submittees.

580
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:16,840
But since the idea then would be that we're selling it, I feel like I don't think it would

581
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:23,240
be sustainable to expect people to submit their stuff for free for us to then sell.

582
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:32,840
We would have to draft up some standard licensing contract, but then in the here and now,

583
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,120
we would be paying people money for content that we would then be publishing for free.

584
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,960
We'd have to operate at a loss in preparation for potential future revenues.

585
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,560
Oh, so you would pay them like a flat fee when they submit it?

586
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,480
For example, yeah, for example.

587
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,680
And not when it gets sold?

588
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:06,760
Well, we could stipulate something like future compensation before print.

589
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,160
Yeah, I mean, we could do it in like a, we promise to pay you a certain amount

590
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:20,200
at such time as we make them available for physical sale, that seems reasonable.

591
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,560
Okay, you know what, you know what, Gib, that's not bad.

592
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,960
That's not bad because I would rather promise to pay someone in the future than pay them now.

593
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:39,400
Yes, the only thing is then when we're like, okay, let's print.

594
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,440
Oh, we've got to pay this many people this much money.

595
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,640
Oh, we can't afford that law.

596
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,920
Well, sure.

597
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,240
In which case, maybe we do pre-orders of the physical version.

598
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,200
It's a whole bunch of crunch.

599
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
It is a whole bunch of crunch.

600
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
I couldn't have said it better myself.

601
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,960
I hope this isn't, you know, I started talking about this stuff on my stream the other day

602
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,360
and my viewership like cratered.

603
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,720
So I hope this isn't boring, but I mean, I think it's really interesting.

604
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,400
I think it's a fascinating puzzle to try and solve this,

605
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,680
put these pieces together in a way that forms a money-making machine.

606
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,720
For me, it's like the curse cloud from Okami.

607
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,280
Every moment I stand in there, my health bubbles are going a little smaller.

608
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,720
I got to jump out of there and run around in the dirt.

609
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,440
No, I'm in there.

610
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,800
I'm in the cloud.

611
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,920
I am the cloud.

612
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,200
I am the cloud, baby.

613
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,640
Okay, okay, okay.

614
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,040
You know what?

615
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,680
I like that idea.

616
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,120
So let's just let's explore it.

617
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,960
Let's explore it for another minute or two.

618
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,440
When, if we stipulated some of the...

619
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,680
Okay, you submit, you give us the rights to electronically publish for free

620
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,640
and we will make it available for free.

621
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:17,160
However, you also agree, you agree to not necessarily first publishing rights,

622
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,600
but you agree to allow us, you know, print rights.

623
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,840
Okay, I feel like we might have to stipulate some kind of time frame.

624
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,680
Like, I feel like it might not be okay to just be like,

625
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,080
say that and be like, at some point in the future, like maybe 50 years from now,

626
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,320
we just said, oh, well, we still got the rights.

627
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,880
Maybe we can.

628
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,920
I mean, if it's not an exclusive deal, maybe we can just be like, yeah,

629
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,440
we're allowed to do it.

630
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,480
There's no exclusivity deal, but we're allowed to do it.

631
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,760
Okay, okay.

632
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,600
So maybe we say, it's free electronically.

633
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,680
At such time that we make it available for publishing,

634
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,920
you will be entitled to some amount and we could do it some flat amount per submission

635
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
or we could do it, we could do it like per page.

636
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,640
We could do it on a per page basis as well.

637
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,280
Oh, but that means verbose people get the big cash.

638
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,920
Yeah, that would, that would draw really small.

639
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:21,160
That would perversely incentivize you to like stretch your content out over as many pages as

640
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,160
possible, which is, I mean, other publications have operated on such a business model in the

641
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,560
past.

642
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,920
It's not untenable.

643
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,120
But yeah, is it, is it incentivizing the kind of creator behavior that we want?

644
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,600
Maybe not.

645
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,720
Maybe not.

646
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,000
I mean, I think most people submitting are just going to do it because there's like, oh, cool.

647
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,240
Maybe my comic will be seen.

648
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,960
Maybe this isn't a good excuse to start drawing my comic.

649
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,880
You're absolutely right, Gib.

650
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,000
We should pay an exposure.

651
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:51,960
Yeah.

652
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
We own the means of production.

653
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,760
They have to give us a website.

654
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,920
A website to host what files on.

655
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,280
They give us some, some, some dirt on themselves.

656
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,720
And we expose the dirt if they don't comply.

657
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,560
That's the paid in exposure.

658
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,000
You have to tell us one.

659
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,480
You have to one.

660
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,440
Cancelable secret.

661
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,040
One dirty little secret.

662
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,520
All right.

663
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,480
You can submit your comic, but we will only accept submissions if you record yourself

664
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,640
saying the n-word and you submit a pen.

665
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,680
We will, we will release it if you break your contract.

666
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,040
This is part of the standard agreement.

667
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,920
Standard agreement.

668
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,600
This is standard industry procedure.

669
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,040
This is how, this is how the world works now.

670
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,160
It's all about that cancelable currency.

671
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,160
Cancel coins.

672
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,560
That's right.

673
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,680
Cash your cancel coins.

674
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,200
Get this person off the line.

675
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,240
Off line.

676
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,760
Get him, get him hiding.

677
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,760
It's, it's a, it's a, it's a trust based economy.

678
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,360
There's nothing more valuable than the ability to destroy some of credibility.

679
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,640
Based economy.

680
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,160
Oh, right.

681
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,200
Liz, that cutie.

682
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,320
Okay.

683
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,640
Okay.

684
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,600
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

685
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,280
I'm stinking.

686
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,760
What do, what do we offer?

687
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,360
I don't know.

688
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,000
What, what's a reasonable amount to offer in such an agreement?

689
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,400
Like you give us, we will pay you 50 bucks.

690
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,920
That seems low.

691
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,440
Do I get 50 bucks?

692
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,760
Will we, will we pay ourselves 50 bucks to put our own comics in our own?

693
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,200
No.

694
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,440
No.

695
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,120
I mean.

696
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,480
Why would I even be a part of this?

697
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,080
Why would I be doing all that?

698
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,160
I'll just sell my own comics.

699
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll give myself 50 bucks every day.

700
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,240
I, okay.

701
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:53,800
Look, here's, I, there's, I feel like there's going to be submissions.

702
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,640
Some, some, we, here's, here's what we get in particular.

703
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,680
Some submissions are going to be worth more than others.

704
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,560
Like some will be more substantial, more professional, you know.

705
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:14,760
So, so I, a, a, a, a one, a one size fits all standard, you know, contract remuneration

706
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,560
amount seems a little weird.

707
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,000
Well, that's why we have like a, we, we decide who gets in.

708
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,520
Sure.

709
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,360
I mean, yeah, that, that does kind of.

710
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,880
That's sort of how it works in general.

711
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,080
But what if they're all bad?

712
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,280
But what if they're all bad?

713
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Like the idea in show and jump is, or yeah, any comic, the show and jump has multiple

714
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,040
different, I guess Marvel does, but they sell individual, whatever.

715
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,680
Right.

716
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:46,040
The idea is that they have an artist say, can I please have this marketplace?

717
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,880
Can I please have eyes on my art?

718
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,920
Platform, please.

719
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,960
Platform, please.

720
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,320
And, and show and jump is got a big platform.

721
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,800
So it's, it's attractive to artists.

722
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,680
It could be a career maker to get on there.

723
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,160
Perfect comic party is not that.

724
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,520
That's certainly not at the beginning.

725
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,800
No.

726
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,840
So there's no incentive other than wouldn't it be nice?

727
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,000
I mean, there is a little bit of incentive because there's.

728
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,440
We have a very, we have a, we have a tiny little, we have a little, we have a tiny little.

729
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,320
We have a tiny little.

730
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,080
We have a little platform.

731
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:20,840
Yeah.

732
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,640
It's one of those platforms that if you stand on it, it'll fall into lava.

733
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,640
Yeah.

734
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,600
It starts to shake.

735
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,720
It starts shaking a little bit and you got like one second.

736
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,560
Yeah.

737
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,240
So my screen, my screen just turned off.

738
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,640
Okay.

739
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,040
I'm back.

740
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,400
I forgot where I was going with that.

741
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,280
But show and jump says, we need you to keep our reputation high.

742
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,320
So you can't suck.

743
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,840
So you have to be very good.

744
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,600
And all the artists, they say, okay, try their best.

745
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:57,880
Here's, I think that in concept, the idea of free for now, we might print later,

746
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,000
but we'll pay you if we do.

747
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,480
I think that's a sound idea.

748
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,080
It's a sound basis for an idea, but you have to look into how to actually draw that out.

749
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,800
It's a, it's a sound basis for an idea.

750
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,520
And just the balancing act there is like, what's the, what's the amount that is,

751
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:25,720
that like incentivizes quality submissions and doesn't like bankrupt us to offer it as like a

752
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:33,720
standard submission, you know, accepted submission contract and isn't like insulting

753
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,000
to people that made like real comics.

754
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,480
And I like, and I like, for us, for us to, for us to like print them.

755
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:52,760
Also, I don't know, I feel like if we print, there might be, I mean, I, you know,

756
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,280
I would like the ability to print in perpetuity.

757
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,800
And if it's not exclusive, I feel like that would not necessarily be unreasonable.

758
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:02,840
Yeah.

759
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,880
But also that seems, it seems like that would be expensive.

760
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,560
I don't know. It seems like maybe it'd be more affordable to offer people like,

761
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,360
well, we can print your stuff like for a year, but I don't want to have time limits.

762
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,000
I want it all.

763
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,520
I don't want the exclusive rights, but I want the perpetual rights.

764
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,120
I, give me your content.

765
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,320
Give me your content, people.

766
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,200
Let me gobble it up.

767
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,920
I put it into my, into my money making machine.

768
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:33,000
I feel just a little weird about the whole idea of just of, of like

769
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:41,960
contracts and, and being an arbiter of quality to be on this potentially lucrative enterprise.

770
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:49,640
Like the idea for me initially was just an excuse to, to get work in, you know, a motivating tool.

771
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,680
Ah, shit.

772
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,240
And, and you're thinking of it as like a, as a, you know, a money making venture.

773
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,120
Yeah.

774
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,440
And I don't feel like I'm qualified to be like an arbiter of quality for a comic thing when my

775
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,000
comics are, you know, they're fine.

776
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,600
But like, I don't know.

777
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,360
I don't feel like I'm the right person for that sort of a job.

778
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,080
I ain't no publisher.

779
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,080
I ain't no market analyst.

780
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:22,440
Maybe, maybe it's, maybe it's best to just think about, to just worry about the electronic rights

781
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:22,840
for now.

782
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,080
I think so.

783
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,560
All right.

784
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,800
At least just for now.

785
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,320
Like I need to get my foot in the door of, you know, making money off my art.

786
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,560
That's where my mind is at.

787
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,400
True.

788
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,240
Oh, speaking of, I started, I started working on Obescapades again.

789
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,560
I'm on it.

790
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,360
I'm on the case.

791
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:47,720
Nice.

792
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,840
It's getting, it's getting there.

793
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,080
How many pixels?

794
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,720
Hang on.

795
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,200
Let me count.

796
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

797
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,960
Very, very, very low res images.

798
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,280
Oh, should I?

799
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,600
I lost count.

800
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:00,760
Hang on.

801
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,400
I guess I'm right.

802
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,120
One, two, three, four, five, six.

803
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,160
The images are only like, they started like, I think it's like 190 by 270.

804
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:11,960
And then I blow them up.

805
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,120
I'm sort of laying them out.

806
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,520
It's actually really hard and kind of annoying to like fit them to like a page.

807
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,680
It's because they, okay.

808
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,840
I had a couple of, I had like a handful of images that I had put on my Twitter,

809
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,840
but that I had not published on my website.

810
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,840
So I started there and I tried to take those and like just put them to a page

811
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,240
and be like, how do they look on the page?

812
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,840
And I managed to figure it out.

813
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,920
I managed to get them looking like, okay, this is readable.

814
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,280
It's, it's very, it's very annoying.

815
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,080
It's very annoying because there's not like a standard way to do it.

816
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,400
I kind of have to like size every image and be like, how big should it be?

817
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,040
Where should it be?

818
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,800
What order should they go and where should the words be?

819
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,360
I kind of had to just figure that out as I go every time.

820
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,160
And it took a while.

821
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,120
And so I did a bunch of that with those existing updates.

822
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,080
And then I started drawing a couple more new ones.

823
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:17,400
And I don't know, I hope, I hope that I can sort of streamline the process

824
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,920
and it'll get a little faster as I get a little more used to doing it this way.

825
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,320
But I'm glad to be drawing again, even though I've only really just started,

826
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,560
but I did start and that's the hardest part is starting.

827
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,120
Yes.

828
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,920
Yes.

829
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,400
Yes.

830
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,280
Well done.

831
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,760
Thank you.

832
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,400
You put the pen to the paper.

833
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,440
And I, and you know what?

834
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,760
I remembered that Biscopades is cool, actually.

835
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,800
And yes, that's how it was always how it happens.

836
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,520
Yeah.

837
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,640
And nobody actually go back and you're like, oh, I would read this.

838
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,440
I did read this.

839
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,080
I made this.

840
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,640
You know what?

841
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,040
Well, you know what?

842
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,840
You know what the thing is?

843
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,000
I don't know if I, well, some of Biscopades as it currently exists,

844
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,600
I think is good and I would read some of it is bad and looks like crap.

845
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:12,440
But where Biscopades, I might have, I might have gone on this spiel already.

846
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,960
So I won't belabor it.

847
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,080
But Biscopades has not revealed what it is actually about yet.

848
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:26,120
Biscopades has not showed its hand and the ideas that I had for when that happens.

849
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:27,720
I don't know.

850
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,240
I find them really fun and cool.

851
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:37,000
So when I'm excited to get there and then I'm excited to right now, I'm like,

852
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,280
it's all, it's all set up.

853
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,000
It's all set up.

854
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:40,440
Nice.

855
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,360
Yeah, I'm just very excited to make that happen.

856
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,080
And I don't know.

857
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,080
I don't even know what I don't know exactly what it's going to look like.

858
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,680
But I am, I look forward to finding out.

859
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,320
I had some ideas about.

860
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,760
I'm fucking around right now.

861
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,440
And I stop finding out.

862
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,080
Yeah.

863
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,520
I had some, I had some ideas about,

864
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,120
I had some ideas about what gluttony could be used for.

865
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,400
I almost don't even really want to talk about why I thought my ideas were good.

866
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:18,040
Because they sort of figure into like the real, like what, like the actual like purpose

867
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:23,080
and concept behind Biscopades, which is sort of not even really apparent yet.

868
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,960
So I won't even go into them.

869
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,160
But I had, I was walking the other day, I was walking here and I was like,

870
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,120
oh, it could do that.

871
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,400
Oh, that fits perfectly.

872
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,200
Oh, yes.

873
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,720
That makes perfect sense in the future.

874
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,200
In the story concept, as I understand it.

875
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,040
And I'll sure I'll do that soon.

876
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:43,800
Okay.

877
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,360
You know, when it comes to story concepts, I've been, I've been really deep.

878
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,720
Well, not really deep, but I've been very excited about using this program called obsidian

879
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,560
to write all my notes down.

880
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,840
Isn't that like a, isn't that like a planning app or like a scheduling?

881
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,360
It's a planning and schedule, but it has this great feature where

882
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:14,760
if you do, if you make a note, whatever, and then you put two square brackets and some text inside,

883
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,600
that creates a new note that links from that word.

884
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,000
So it's a hyperlink to a different note document.

885
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,520
And I've been doing that to build up the world of my comics of bell,

886
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:32,920
jpe, and, and Lord of ghosts and stuff and adding like character entries and then a link

887
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:38,840
to what other characters they know, things they've done, and like places they're from.

888
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,760
And I've started to build all graph.

889
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,280
And the great thing about obsidian, let me get a picture,

890
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,960
is this graph view that shows the links you've made between notes

891
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,920
in a little thing like this.

892
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,760
And I've colored them based on whether they're a character, a location, a comic,

893
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,200
or a jewel, an endless ruck.

894
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,720
What, what the fuck?

895
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,240
So you got here, you can see like bell jpe has like

896
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,520
all the characters from bell jpe and the places involved and things.

897
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:18,280
I go into like, if I go into the jewel of the jewel of splish is an endless rock.

898
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,960
Did I know that already?

899
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,240
I might have, I might have heard that.

900
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:28,600
I've definitely explained that, but like, I don't think it's been like well understood.

901
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,480
It's part of my big lore, you see, but if I click on the ostrich cathedral,

902
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,280
this is the note and it contains things like this.

903
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,560
A big, oh, this is cool.

904
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,880
And it's just sort of, I, I, I, I sprawl it out from there.

905
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:49,640
It's like building, building the wiki, but in such a simple way that I can easily add pages and,

906
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,080
and stuff.

907
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:56,280
This is just like, this is just like the, the freaking,

908
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,400
I don't even remember what it's called.

909
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,640
The thing in outer wilds that lets you like track the things, the things you found.

910
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,480
This is the thing I was playing out to wilds doing the DLC.

911
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,440
And I was like, ah, this is just like that program I saw like a few weeks ago.

912
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,720
Because my brother told me about it.

913
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,080
I'm like, I got to do it.

914
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,600
I got to do it for my thing.

915
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:23,400
And so I'm doing an outer wilds connect the dots database of all the stuff that happens in the

916
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,280
comic and all of my ideas for different things that have not currently been shown.

917
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,520
So for bell jpeg two, that'll be instrumental in figuring out where it goes.

918
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:33,560
Yeah.

919
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,240
And Clarissa gun smoke and whatever adventures she has after that.

920
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,720
And anything else.

921
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,200
It's great.

922
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,240
This is very interesting.

923
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:49,240
My, my dad always used to try to get me to use like, not stuff like this, but like,

924
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,800
he would always buy me like little like calendars and like notebooks and like planners and stuff

925
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,720
and try to encourage me to like write down notes and stuff and like keep track of things.

926
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,640
And I always and I always spurned them.

927
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,600
I like always hated that shit.

928
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,440
I like this is just a cool.

929
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,200
This is I mean, this is more interesting than than that.

930
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,800
Is another another trying to try and try and try to load a ghost's

931
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,000
comic.

932
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,200
Oh.

933
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,080
So it's gotten the secondy and like a calm over there.

934
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,920
I'm trying to, I'm trying to decide.

935
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,400
I'm trying to decide if this would be useful for bescapades or not.

936
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:40,120
You know what's going to be very useful for is figuring out how red noir fits into the Lord of Ghosts.

937
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,320
Red noir.

938
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,440
I'm glad I'm glad to hear you mentioned red noir again.

939
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:45,880
Yeah.

940
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,040
Such a good name for such a short lived little project.

941
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:52,920
Yeah, glad.

942
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,560
Glad that's not completely forgotten.

943
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:55,880
Yeah.

944
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,600
Yeah, I reread it in the process of putting it on my website.

945
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,000
Give and take dot site, newly revamped.

946
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,240
And I was like, wow, this is good.

947
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,680
This is a good little red man comic, but a noir.

948
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:16,520
Somebody somebody commented and said like nice job, Ben, nice job on the website.

949
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,720
It's very, it's very, it's like, I think they said it was like simple and clean or it's like nice and

950
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,040
simple.

951
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,400
And I was like, thank you.

952
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,760
Yes, that's what I want.

953
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,120
I just want a freaking easy to use website with a couple of pages to find the stuff you're looking for.

954
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,760
That's all that's all it is.

955
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,080
And that's all I was trying to do with it.

956
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,440
And I think I succeeded.

957
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,880
And reminder, if you want the episode MP3 is a lot of people use like the podcast apps.

958
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,440
If you want, if you just want to download the MP3 is and listen to them on an MP3 player or

959
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:54,360
something, they are all except for the last like two up on the PCP website, perfect comic

960
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:00,120
party dot com, the procrastiners podcast dot com slash episodes dot HTML, I think.

961
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,080
And you can also get there's I have zipped collections.

962
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,360
You can download zip files and then unzip them.

963
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,680
And it'll have like every episode of the podcast that was on the PCP channel.

964
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:17,480
Every PCP episode from a certain year, all of the Digibro decompression chambers, etc, etc.

965
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,680
I hope those are convenient for people.

966
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,080
There's a lot of work.

967
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,480
It was a lot of work just putting that all together.

968
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,840
And if I missed it, and if I missed anything, let me know in the comments if I missed if

969
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,440
there's any collections you'd like to see or stuff that I didn't didn't get.

970
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,920
There might be other like random crap from the channel that I just totally forgot about.

971
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,480
They got the panel casts.

972
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,640
We got the Nauru cast.

973
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:50,680
We've got I don't even remember what else we got guys isolation training.

974
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,800
You know, what the hell was that?

975
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:59,400
It was one time Nate did a did a decompression chamber and he called it isolation training.

976
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,080
Yeah.

977
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:05,080
Oh, you said panel reminded me of one other thing that's cool.

978
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:12,280
The Kindle create is like the program you use to turn like a PDF into a Kindle ebook.

979
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,080
And what it does, there's this fundal function.

980
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:25,480
If it's, you know, graphic novel, you can auto auto generate panels.

981
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,800
And so when you're reading on a phone or a Kindle or whatever,

982
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,880
you can double tap on a panel and it'll zoom in and full screen that particular panel.

983
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,760
So you can switch, you can flip through the panels rather than full pages if

984
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,320
if the pages are like too small on a phone or something.

985
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,520
Instead of having to zoom, you can look at a panel and it was like scroll to the next one.

986
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:56,120
And I did that for Clarissa and it like pretty well like I only had to edit a few of them matched

987
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:03,240
the panels on the page to little little rectangles that it would zoom in on.

988
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,360
Wait, so it so it like auto finds the panels and like makes them their own thing?

989
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,160
Makes them their own like individual image that you can scroll left and right through

990
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:13,720
if you want to.

991
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,760
And then you double tap the panel to go back to full page view, which is a pretty cool.

992
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,960
That's actually very interesting.

993
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,080
That actually sounds pretty cool.

994
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:30,840
Yeah. You don't really need it for Clarissa because the text is quite big for that.

995
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,480
But if it's like a traditional comic book with tiny little text, then it's quite useful.

996
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,480
But yeah, I've learned so much about Kindle.

997
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,440
I've never used it.

998
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,160
I don't think I will use it, but it's cool.

999
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,440
But also by the PDF, if you don't care about that because I get more money.

1000
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,600
And then by the paperback because it's cooler to have something on your shelf.

1001
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,640
And then by the Kindle as well.

1002
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,040
I can't stop. I can't stop consuming.

1003
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,000
I want to consume all forms of the content.

1004
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:11,480
I'm the chef and you better eat your greens, which is my work.

1005
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:19,960
I have been trying to create twizzlers.

1006
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,960
I'm trying to duplicate the twizzlers recipe in my candy making workshop.

1007
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,680
And it's hard.

1008
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,280
It's hard.

1009
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,200
And I bought a jug of glycerin.

1010
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And I'm going to try putting that in there and see what happens.

1011
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,800
Oh, is that licorice you're trying to make?

1012
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,560
I am also.

1013
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,320
I also got some stuff for licorice.

1014
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,560
I was just talking about cherry twizzlers, just the consistency.

1015
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,120
Yeah.

1016
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,040
I am going to get some licorice extract and like once I know how to make them,

1017
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,000
I will like make that with them because I like that.

1018
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,600
But I got this stuff.

1019
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,360
Okay, I found this stuff.

1020
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,400
This was so amazing.

1021
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,760
There's this stuff.

1022
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,360
Apparently it's a naturally occurring salt.

1023
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:11,240
It's called sal ammonia or it is ammonium chloride.

1024
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,440
And I guess they put it in certain licorices.

1025
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,080
It's like salty licorice flavoring.

1026
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,080
And listen, listen to this.

1027
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,680
This is the second paragraph from the Wikipedia article on Sal Ammoniac.

1028
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:33,480
Pliny in book 31 of his natural history refers to a salt produced in the Roman province of

1029
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:41,880
Sirenica called Haman, Hamaniacum, Hamaniacum is so called because of its proximity to the

1030
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,440
nearby temple of Jupiter Amun, Greek Amon.

1031
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,040
However, the description Pliny gives of the salt does not conform to the properties of

1032
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,320
ammonium chloride.

1033
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:57,160
According to Herbert Hoover's commentary, in his English translation of George's

1034
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,160
Agricola's Deire Metallica, it is likely to have been common sea salt.

1035
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,880
In any case, that salt ultimately gave ammonia and ammonium compounds their name.

1036
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,080
Herbert Hoover, the president of the United States,

1037
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:21,160
translated this ancient fricking Roman book about the nature of metals and salts.

1038
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,120
And he's excited here in this Wikipedia article.

1039
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,760
And I did a double take at that.

1040
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,040
So wait, ammonia because it's close to a temple?

1041
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:42,440
Okay, yes. This salt that Pliny describes was called Ammoniacum because it was near

1042
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:47,400
to the temple of Jupiter Amun, like that's where the Amon in Ammoniacum comes from.

1043
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,720
And that name for that particular salt that Pliny describes is where, yeah,

1044
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,880
the chemicals Ammonia and ammonium get their names.

1045
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,400
It's so funny how words are just used.

1046
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,600
Even though it literally is not what he was talking about.

1047
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,880
He was talking about something else.

1048
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,520
He was just talking about salt, regular salt.

1049
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:16,520
It's fun when you realize how human history is so much.

1050
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,000
All these names, it's like, oh, that doesn't sound like anything.

1051
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,760
They're all derived from just like looking at something and saying,

1052
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,440
what's that, the big hill?

1053
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,640
But you say it in your language and that becomes the name of a mountain.

1054
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1055
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:29,640
Isn't that?

1056
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,880
And it's like, that's how world-building is.

1057
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,280
I should do that for my world-building thing.

1058
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:39,000
I should come up with the reason people call them certain things the way they is.

1059
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,320
It's just cool.

1060
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,000
Because they just saw a place and they called it the big place.

1061
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,480
It's just-

1062
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,480
That's why I called my town something town.

1063
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,000
It wasn't because I couldn't think of anything.

1064
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,920
It was because they just-

1065
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,000
That's just how you name things.

1066
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:58,680
And then it sounds cool in another language when someone calls it

1067
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,240
that in your language, but they don't know what it means, to them it's just a fancy word.

1068
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,160
And that's where names come from.

1069
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,840
Honestly, I always felt like really dumb when I was trying, when I was younger

1070
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,160
and trying to come up with like fantasy names for things.

1071
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,840
I'd be like, okay, just throw some vowels in there, some consonants,

1072
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,760
like lots of consonants, more than usual.

1073
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:26,440
And an average ratio of consonants to vowels will simply not suffice.

1074
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,000
Yeah.

1075
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,760
For the fanciness, for the fanciness of the concept I'm trying to convey here.

1076
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:38,920
It's like Lord Blu Targoth and the Kingdom of Smyr Skalosh.

1077
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,280
Got it.

1078
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:40,920
I mean, that's funny.

1079
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,400
Got it in one.

1080
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,520
I like Smyr Skalosh.

1081
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,680
Yeah, it's not bad.

1082
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,720
But like, you know, you would try and copy Lord of the Rings and come up with things

1083
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,240
that sounded a little too close to everything else, Elven stuff.

1084
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,200
Right, right.

1085
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,360
And you didn't have any basis for the reasoning.

1086
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,880
You're just like, what sounds like a place that isn't a real place?

1087
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:05,240
You ever watch, you know, oh God, what's his name?

1088
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,280
Krusty the Clang.

1089
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,400
No, it's that Jan Misali.

1090
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,000
You ever watch Jan Misali?

1091
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:15,720
Yes.

1092
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,640
Have you watched any of his older, what are they called?

1093
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,680
The ones where he takes a conlang critic.

1094
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,680
A conlang is like a fake language that somebody made up.

1095
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:34,360
And he has a series of videos from like a few years ago where he like goes through

1096
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:39,480
various popular ones and like analyzes them and like ranks them on like how good or shitty they are.

1097
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,000
And some of them are really weird.

1098
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,800
I've not seen those.

1099
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,600
Jan Misali is the guy who did that video about the

1100
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,560
anime song that everyone knows, but it was actually Swedish.

1101
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,120
Yes.

1102
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:54,920
He did do that.

1103
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:55,880
Yes.

1104
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:00,040
He did do that one about the not Numa Numa.

1105
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,520
Caramel Dancin.

1106
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,080
Right.

1107
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:14,280
I had to go through the lyrics in my head to get to the end to be like Caramel.

1108
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,000
That's the name.

1109
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,400
Got it.

1110
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,760
Yeah, he did do that video.

1111
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,760
I had found his channel a little bit before that because he did one about

1112
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,880
how many Mario games, how many Super Mario games are there.

1113
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,040
That video blew up as well.

1114
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,280
And then the Caramel Dancin video really blew up,

1115
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,560
especially because there was like a big like legal thing about it.

1116
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,200
Is it still taken down?

1117
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,640
I think that's sorted out.

1118
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,640
I don't know.

1119
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,920
Well, it's a good video.

1120
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,640
It is a really good video.

1121
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,440
Find it if you can.

1122
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,560
But yeah, the conlang critics are interesting and he does like,

1123
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:59,480
you know, he does ones like from Tolkien and he does ones from Song of Ice and Fire.

1124
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:06,360
And he does other like weird ones that were like made by like various people in history

1125
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,760
as like a genuine attempt to create a universal language.

1126
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,960
And those are all terrible.

1127
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,680
Well, a lot.

1128
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,320
Most of them are.

1129
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,320
There's that one.

1130
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,920
There's that one that's like it doesn't even have letters.

1131
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,840
It's made of like knots.

1132
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,480
It's made of like lines that like tie into knots.

1133
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:29,880
And like the number of like twists in the knot is like what determines what it means.

1134
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,600
That one's awesome.

1135
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,400
Like like a like a like a piece of rope or like a drawing.

1136
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,040
Well, it's a draw.

1137
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,120
I mean, you maybe could do it with.

1138
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,120
OK, it's called Kellen with with a line over the first E.

1139
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,560
And it looks like this and I don't know how to read it.

1140
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,080
Oh, that's like that looks Celtic.

1141
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,200
It does look Celtic.

1142
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:01,240
It might be like Celtic inspired, but only in like visual design.

1143
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:03,960
So what's this word?

1144
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,040
I don't fucking know.

1145
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,080
Yeah, I've no idea.

1146
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,080
Is that like an actual end and start like it starts like that?

1147
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,360
Look, then swirls all the way around.

1148
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:22,280
Look, I I I couldn't I can't explain anything about this to you.

1149
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,920
Other than that supposedly this is what Kellen looks like.

1150
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,640
Well, I'll choose to be offended by it.

1151
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1152
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,000
Yeah. You can also write it.

1153
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,400
You can write it fancy and then it looks like this.

1154
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,880
It mostly just looks cool.

1155
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,760
Like I think it's not.

1156
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,440
I think it's not like that useful as like a language for communicating.

1157
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,960
It's like an art language.

1158
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,160
It's like a language that's made to it's made to look pretty.

1159
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,800
And it does communicate something, but it's like it's it's art first and foremost.

1160
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,240
Yeah, that's cool.

1161
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:03,480
I think that there is like obviously for humans, this is incomprehensible at a glance.

1162
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,240
No, you well, yeah, yeah, because you don't under because you don't know it,

1163
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,120
but you could learn it.

1164
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,400
Could you though?

1165
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:10,520
Yes.

1166
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,360
But you said you couldn't figure it out.

1167
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:21,480
You're so stupid because I didn't you have to you would have to learn it like a language.

1168
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,840
You have to I don't know.

1169
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:27,080
There's a freaking code you got to I just think I just think when it comes to like

1170
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:34,760
knots, that's one of like the hardest things to understand at looking at it.

1171
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,680
Like when you see a tangled mess of cables,

1172
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,320
you think you think that knots are the hardest thing to understand?

1173
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:45,800
No, I mean like for a person, a letter or like a kanji or like a thing

1174
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,240
is easier because each one is like by themselves.

1175
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:55,000
You know, that's why like right joined up writing or like whatever is it's harder to

1176
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,520
read and things that are like, where do you where do you begin with that with this line?

1177
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,800
And that's why you can't untangle the Christmas lights.

1178
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,760
And that's why learning how to do knots is difficult and tying your shoes.

1179
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:14,200
I'm just saying lines, big long strings are like the enemy of human thought.

1180
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,440
That's an interesting.

1181
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,880
That's my hypothesis.

1182
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,240
Interesting way to look at it.

1183
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,840
I feel you, I agree with you.

1184
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,800
Obviously, listen, I'm not going to I'm not going to argue that obviously

1185
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:32,680
this is not the most intuitive way to put to put concepts into like into like writing.

1186
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,800
But I feel like that they took a non-standard initial conceit of how to do it and ran with it.

1187
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,240
I feel like that's no, I do.

1188
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,000
I do like I think it's pretty neat.

1189
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,520
It is pretty neat.

1190
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,640
Where I was going with it, though, is like, what if there's an alien that finds this a lot easier

1191
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,800
to comprehend than single like separated elements like letters?

1192
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,600
What if they can be like, oh, yeah, I know what that is.

1193
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,240
Like even if they don't know the language, they can learn it real quick.

1194
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,520
But if they try to learn like if the alien was like a worm and like they had to like

1195
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,520
Yeah, a little worm aliens.

1196
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:11,640
They understand things like length and like getting tied up and twisted around and stuff.

1197
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,080
They get twisted every day.

1198
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,160
I don't know why that was so funny.

1199
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,760
Yes, they get you.

1200
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:25,880
Oh, you mean like they get they smoke weed and they drink and they get they get twisted.

1201
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,200
No, no, I mean they tangle themselves up because they're wormies.

1202
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:30,760
Oh, sure.

1203
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,400
Yeah, would you still love me if I was always a worm?

1204
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:40,200
Would you still would you love me if I was a worm and I was like an alcoholic and a stoner and like

1205
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:44,440
I couldn't and I was all disoriented all the time and I kept tying myself up in knots

1206
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,840
and the knots said offensive things in in Kellen just by coincidence.

1207
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,880
No, and then you get canceled on worm Twitter.

1208
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,680
That would be the line.

1209
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:57,080
Listen to submit the line to submit your worm comic.

1210
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,160
You have to submit a photo of yourself saying the N word in Kellen.

1211
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,440
Let's ask him easily how you write it.

1212
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:06,760
I bet.

1213
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,680
Yes, a YouTube comment.

1214
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,960
That'll be that'll work.

1215
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,560
Hey, hey, hey, Jan.

1216
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,080
Big fan got a got a question for you.

1217
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,080
Say I wanted to write a certain word in Kellen.

1218
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,280
Here's here it is.

1219
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,320
All right, let me know.

1220
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:21,640
Bye.

1221
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,400
Why did you even get on this topic?

1222
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,960
I something about I don't know.

1223
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,360
You brought up Kellen for some reason.

1224
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:33,880
I don't even remember.

1225
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,560
We're talking about world building ammonia.

1226
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,160
Oh, it's not name and stuff.

1227
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,200
Name and stuff.

1228
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,440
Name and stuff and Tolkien and yeah,

1229
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,600
the sound and like Elvish and whatever.

1230
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:44,920
Whatever.

1231
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,560
I just like those.

1232
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,520
I just like those videos.

1233
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,840
That's all my notes, by the way.

1234
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,440
I have I have no more subject.

1235
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,720
I was reminded of something.

1236
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,680
I forget why.

1237
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,000
But I wrote it down.

1238
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,360
Turkey 2000s.

1239
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:58,600
Okay.

1240
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,200
Oh, because we talk, we talk, we talk about Turkey Twizzlers.

1241
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,720
I saw this tweet of yours, by the way.

1242
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,720
Yeah, you said Twizzlers.

1243
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,880
And I was like, oh, Turkey Twizzlers.

1244
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,560
That was a famous school lunch cafeteria food

1245
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,000
that was really bad for you.

1246
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,720
And it's famous because Jamie Oliver got it banned

1247
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,600
and everyone was mad.

1248
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,920
Cringe, I want one.

1249
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,560
I think they look good.

1250
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,760
They look all right.

1251
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,240
Well, they look like meat in a swirl.

1252
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,680
And I don't think I ever really liked the taste

1253
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,040
more than like normal nuggets or normal.

1254
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,240
They had turkey dinosaurs.

1255
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,120
That was the other thing.

1256
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,320
Turkey nuggets in the shape of dinosaurs.

1257
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,840
And those were better.

1258
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,520
And then they had like the potato smiley faces

1259
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,280
and spaghetti hoops and, you know,

1260
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:50,120
all sorts of these like kid friendly processed foods.

1261
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:51,960
I had smiley fries.

1262
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,000
We had smiley fries.

1263
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,280
I walked over to my refrigerator

1264
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,400
to get one of my attempts at a Twizzler out of the fridge.

1265
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,280
Not successful, much too soft.

1266
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,360
But yes, I remember and because I hadn't thought about it in years

1267
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,680
and my brother was over for the weekend and he mentioned it.

1268
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,640
And I was like, oh my God, I remember those Turkey 2000s.

1269
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,520
Turkey 2000s was a turkey nugget.

1270
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,280
I don't know why so many things were made of turkey.

1271
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,280
I think maybe it was just a it was a recipe

1272
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,040
for really cheap like bullshit.

1273
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:33,640
But like Turkey 2000s was the number 2000 connected, you know.

1274
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,920
So there was like a big long thing with holes

1275
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,840
so you could see the O's and the two.

1276
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,880
And it was around the turn of the millennium.

1277
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,720
They would have these in school dinners

1278
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,520
because it was like it's the millennium, you know.

1279
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,760
They just made them in the shape of the number 2000.

1280
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,280
They made turkey nuggets in the shape of the number 2000.

1281
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,200
They were called Turkey 2000s.

1282
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,960
Why wouldn't they just make them in the shape of twos and zeros?

1283
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,000
Because that's too many different parts.

1284
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,800
I don't fucking know.

1285
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,720
They wanted to make one mold instead of a billion.

1286
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,360
I mean four or two.

1287
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,120
I guess one mold instead of two actually.

1288
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,320
Yeah, yeah.

1289
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,640
But then you could make 002.

1290
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,760
You could make 020.

1291
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,400
You know, you couldn't actually, it wouldn't be 2000

1292
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,080
unless the child placed them in the right orientation.

1293
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,320
Well, you just make three times as many zeros

1294
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,000
and then it'll work itself out.

1295
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,840
No, but what if one kid doesn't get a two?

1296
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,080
Like they get like a ladle full of fucking-

1297
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:35,800
Of zeros?

1298
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,080
Of zeros.

1299
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,120
Then he gets what he deserves.

1300
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:38,520
I'm sorry.

1301
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,480
Some people just don't deserve the two.

1302
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,400
I know these existed.

1303
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,520
My brother remembered them.

1304
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:52,280
And then we went on a nostalgia, like find this stuff.

1305
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,720
We found some other things.

1306
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:57,080
We found like school dinner cake, which I will find an image of.

1307
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,480
Think of like Google the exact phrasing.

1308
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,440
Yes, school dinner cake.

1309
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,880
It was a sponge cake with sprinkles and like white icing.

1310
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,360
And apparently it was just called school dinner.

1311
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,400
It was just school cake.

1312
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,720
School cake.

1313
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,640
And they would have it and they would have custard or nothing.

1314
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,120
But that was like a cafeteria like staple of primary schools

1315
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,480
and secondary schools, I guess.

1316
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,200
I definitely remember those a lot.

1317
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,160
It was always nice when for the dessert,

1318
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,640
they had those because they were tasty.

1319
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,360
We found other things.

1320
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,880
We found the turkey dinosaurs.

1321
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,520
And we found a forum where somebody mentioned Turkey 2000s,

1322
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,560
that exact phrase.

1323
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,760
So we know that there's at least three people in the universe

1324
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,840
that remember Turkey 2000s.

1325
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,280
But I could not find a single image on Google

1326
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:59,800
or any listing in like top 38 most nostalgic school dinner items from the UK.

1327
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,640
And I'm like, why is it not there?

1328
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,240
That's such a weird thing.

1329
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,120
You would think there'd be.

1330
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,440
Yeah, like I Google that and I can't find any pictures of it.

1331
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,160
There's no there's no simple way to get it.

1332
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,640
Because like I type in Turkey 2000s, I get all of the knowledge,

1333
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,840
all of the articles about Jamie Oliver and Turkey Twizzlers,

1334
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,920
which were more popular and they weren't just about the year 2000s.

1335
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:28,760
And there's plenty of people who are nostalgic for post Turkey 2000s, I'm sure.

1336
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,880
There's only a certain amount of people who are at school

1337
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,640
in the right age bracket to even know about Turkey 2000s.

1338
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,800
And it's like, this is the biggest mystery of our generation.

1339
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,240
I'm determined for someone else to please tell me the information

1340
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,360
because I couldn't find it.

1341
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:49,960
Anyone out there in the audience, if you remember Turkey 2000s,

1342
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,040
might have just been a UK thing.

1343
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,840
I would assume they didn't have like a worldwide thing with this.

1344
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,280
It's very silly.

1345
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:04,040
But like maybe any other countries, any other people from other countries

1346
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,480
know about the Turkey 2000.

1347
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,080
I think it's probably a UK thing because we didn't even have,

1348
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,200
we didn't have Turkey Twizzlers.

1349
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,440
We had smiley fries.

1350
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,120
Could be other European countries.

1351
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:15,720
But yeah.

1352
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,720
Anyone else remember that?

1353
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:22,920
Because it was so frustrating trying to Google it

1354
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,920
because there'd be Turkey dinosaurs.

1355
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:30,760
Nostalgic things would come up with buzz feet articles about lists of bullshit.

1356
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,200
It's just like, oh, remember this from when you were a kid?

1357
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,480
School cafeteria.

1358
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,760
Beans, sure.

1359
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,400
Potatoes and beans.

1360
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,680
Oh, smiley faces.

1361
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,360
We all like those, the smiley potatoes.

1362
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,960
Because they have mashed potatoes inside.

1363
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,080
I want some of those still.

1364
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,680
Yeah, they're still good.

1365
01:15:52,680 --> 01:16:03,320
They had like potato waffles and just bad food, but cafeteria food

1366
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:08,040
and old food, nostalgic food, and it's just too specific.

1367
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:13,400
And there's too many things that are similar to that search result,

1368
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:19,800
but not the same thing that you just get led off in the wrong way over and over.

1369
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,680
I couldn't find it.

1370
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,760
I searched for a whole 20 minutes.

1371
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,400
It's impossible.

1372
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,160
I mean, I can't find it either.

1373
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,680
And it seems so visually bizarre and idiosyncratic

1374
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,120
that you would think there'd be pictures of it.

1375
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:41,560
But what I need is some sort of lead that I can follow up on.

1376
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:48,120
Some sort of like, what were the company's names, the branded company's names,

1377
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:54,040
that sold all of this stuff to school cafeteria's in the first place?

1378
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,240
Is there a name for a company?

1379
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,760
Is there a series of companies?

1380
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,400
I don't know where to start looking for that information.

1381
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:03,160
But if I can find that, then I might be able to get a product list.

1382
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:11,880
I might be able to search a way, like avoid searches for nostalgic image board

1383
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:18,120
article bullshit that is distracting and filling up my search results with nothing.

1384
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:20,840
I know they exist.

1385
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,640
This is my white whale.

1386
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,000
This is my Turkey 2000.

1387
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,040
Are you sure they weren't Turkey 2000?

1388
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:28,920
Just such a funny name.

1389
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,280
Are you sure they didn't have a different name?

1390
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,880
Maybe like, I don't know, Millennium Turkey?

1391
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,440
I typed in different things like Millennium Turkey.

1392
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,720
But then I came up with the Country Turkey and something about the Millennium.

1393
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,720
Turkey 2K?

1394
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:49,960
No, 2K was a much, that referring to a year as K is such a 2010 thing.

1395
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,640
It was, I've never heard that before, like more recently.

1396
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:03,400
What about Turkey Twizzlers 2000?

1397
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,080
Well, it wouldn't be a Twizzler.

1398
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,280
It wasn't a Twizzler.

1399
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:10,520
But it sounds like it might have been the same company that made them.

1400
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,240
Honestly, it could be.

1401
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,000
It might have been processed in the same factory.

1402
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,640
It could be, but they tasted different.

1403
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,400
They tasted more like the Turkey dinosaurs.

1404
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,720
If I know who made the Turkey dinosaurs, I could probably be like,

1405
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,680
you know, that company based in like Germany made,

1406
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,200
squished Turkey stuff for the whole of Europe.

1407
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,520
And it was great.

1408
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,600
Well, it was the best of times.

1409
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:45,800
Google tells me that the first result from Google is like a brand called Bernard Matthews

1410
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,680
Turkey Dinosaurs made by Sainsbury.

1411
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,600
Sainsbury is okay.

1412
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,480
That is a UK.

1413
01:18:53,880 --> 01:19:00,520
Sainsbury Turkey 2000.

1414
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,040
But then it would be like, oh, buy a Turkey at Christmas from Sainsbury.

1415
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,400
It's like, no, it'll never, it'll never show up.

1416
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,080
Is it a supermarket chain?

1417
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,200
It's a supermarket, yeah.

1418
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:14,840
Buy this, buy that.

1419
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,200
Yeah.

1420
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,920
Like, how do I search for the archives?

1421
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,320
Sainsbury's archive, they don't have that.

1422
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,080
I think you hallucinated it.

1423
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,320
No, I absolutely did not hallucinate it.

1424
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:30,200
I think there would be pictures online if this was real.

1425
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,480
I think everyone's forgotten, except for the people on the forum.

1426
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:39,640
I think you are abusing your platform to try and spread a false rumor.

1427
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,320
Bring back Turkey 2000s.

1428
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,160
You're trying to start a Mandela effect in it.

1429
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,520
If we need Turkey 2000 and 23s, we need Turkey 2000.

1430
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,400
There's no way.

1431
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,320
It can't possibly have happened.

1432
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,200
It can't be real.

1433
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,560
It's too stupid.

1434
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,360
No, it's so stupid that it has to be real.

1435
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,240
I remember eating them.

1436
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,280
I'm like, wow, this is fun.

1437
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,800
That's a pretty, that's weird.

1438
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,680
Why do they make it?

1439
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:01,080
Because it was like, it's a millennium.

1440
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,840
Nobody has seen a millennium ever.

1441
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,960
Nobody has seen a millennium.

1442
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,560
I remember eating them and thinking,

1443
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,120
hmm, I love living in a goofy alternate timeline

1444
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,240
where we make stupid Turkey shapes like these.

1445
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,600
They made Turkey dinosaurs.

1446
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:18,200
They could make a number 2000 for like a brief marketing stint for a millennium.

1447
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,760
They haven't had a millennium for a thousand years.

1448
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,640
They were excited.

1449
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,040
I wonder if they made 1000 turkeys for the first millennium.

1450
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,800
They didn't even have turkeys back then.

1451
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,080
They might actually not have.

1452
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,920
They might have had the one or two.

1453
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,200
They had, is Turkey like an American bird?

1454
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,960
Like in the Americas?

1455
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,280
I want to say yes.

1456
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,960
I want to say, yeah, it might be.

1457
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,480
It might be a native North America.

1458
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,600
They may not even have had chicken in the year 1000.

1459
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,760
They would have had no nuggets whatsoever.

1460
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,760
Yeah, they probably didn't have.

1461
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,360
Well, maybe only in like China.

1462
01:20:54,360 --> 01:21:00,280
They had the, or whatever the commonly domesticated breed of chicken.

1463
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:05,240
I am absolutely 100% certain this is the most certain I've ever been.

1464
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,400
Turkey 2000s are real.

1465
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:13,160
I might have a name wrong, but they were a breaded chicken or turkey nugget

1466
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,000
that was shaped in the year, in the number 2000.

1467
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,880
What if I just go 2000 nuggets?

1468
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,280
You'll get McDonald's menu.

1469
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:29,160
No, no, actually I get the basketball team, the nuggets.

1470
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,560
There's too many things called the same thing.

1471
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,000
The Denver Nuggets.

1472
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,800
Denver Nuggets, god damn it.

1473
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,360
I assume it refers to gold nuggets.

1474
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,640
It might be a college team?

1475
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:42,920
Probably.

1476
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,560
Denver Nuggets.

1477
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,000
Did you see the college hockey team?

1478
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,080
I forget what city, like the San Jose Sharks tweeted this like

1479
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:59,080
a very like informative thread about like alternate gender identities in like other

1480
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:05,320
cultures around the world, like various Native American tribes and like Mesoamerican and

1481
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:12,680
stuff and like cool, but like why did the San Jose, there was no explanation for why

1482
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,760
the San Jose Sharks were tweeting, they just did.

1483
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:22,040
Uh, and yeah, I still don't, I don't understand it, but cool, I guess.

1484
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,600
I just want other people to be like, oh yeah, I remember those.

1485
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,000
It's weird that I can't find them on Google.

1486
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,480
Please comment that if that's the truth.

1487
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,080
Don't lie.

1488
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:38,040
Chicken nuggets, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1489
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,440
I'm going to solve this.

1490
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:45,400
I think it was just because chicken 2000s doesn't ring a bell and turkey 2000s really does.

1491
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,040
Are you, are you ready for me to solve this conundrum?

1492
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:48,840
I'm going to do it right now.

1493
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,600
Oh my God, please hang on, you're going to have to give me a second.

1494
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:00,840
You're just going to download an image of a metal finger and show that to me.

1495
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,800
That's what you're going to do.

1496
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,680
Here's your fucking turkey 2000s motherfucker.

1497
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,160
There's minions shaped turkey nuggets.

1498
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:21,240
See, I think the fact that it's, they could shape nuggets into shapes brings credence to this.

1499
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:21,880
Here we go.

1500
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,840
Chat GPT.

1501
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:27,640
In the UK, were there turkey nuggets in the shape of the number 2000 made to celebrate the new millennium?

1502
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:33,400
Yes, it is true that turkey nuggets in the shape of the number 2000 were made in the UK

1503
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,600
to celebrate the new millennium.

1504
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:39,000
The product was called Millennium Turkey Nuggets and was produced by the Bernard Matthews Food

1505
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,320
Company. They were made available for sale in the UK in the lead up to the year 2000,

1506
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,920
and the idea was to create a novelty food item that would appeal to consumers looking for something

1507
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:51,080
special to mark the occasion. However, the product was not very successful and was eventually

1508
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,560
discontinued. So it was Bernard Matthews.

1509
01:23:53,560 --> 01:24:01,320
Bernard Matthews is the turkey dinosaur person. There's no images on Google. This is a travesty.

1510
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:06,520
Did nobody take a single picture of the whole time when it was happening?

1511
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:12,440
Okay, it could be lying. Yeah, if we can't corroborate it with proof, then the fact that

1512
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,080
Chat GPT says it's true doesn't mean anything.

1513
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,480
I believe the AI when it agrees with me.

1514
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:19,400
Yeah, yeah.

1515
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:25,400
I think it's just that Google can't find the image. I think it'll be on a website that's

1516
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,560
outside of Google. It'll be on the dark web. The dark web will have what I need.

1517
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:35,080
Yeah, I mean, if it was real, there must be proof somewhere. What about? Okay, what about?

1518
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:36,360
Um.

1519
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,320
Millennium turkey. Bernard Matthews, a millennium.

1520
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:51,000
It's just that they have like turkey nuggets and minions, a turkey dinosaurs and minions.

1521
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,360
Listen, I appreciate that turkey nuggets can come in any shape that one can imagine.

1522
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:03,720
And anything the mind can dream, a turkey can embody in their nugget form.

1523
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,400
But damn, if you can't freaking find it on Google.

1524
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:15,960
Wait a minute. The free library. Okay, here's link page citation. Can I go to that link?

1525
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,240
Page URL. Oh, this is the page. Okay.

1526
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,600
Uh, identifying a children's product to signify the millennium was difficult for Bernard Matthews,

1527
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:32,920
Fugu's limited. But for the, but from their research, Turkey 2000 was born. Turkey 2000 is

1528
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:38,040
a frozen shaped product with chopped turkey made into 2000 shapes and then covered in crispy

1529
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:46,040
crumb. The 360 gram pan, which contained on average six very large shapes is already available

1530
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:54,040
for sale. This is from September 1st, 1999. I don't know how. So it contains an average

1531
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:58,200
six free large shapes is already available for sale in a metalized film pack. And Bernard

1532
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:02,680
Matthews believes this is the first time such film has been used within the children's sector.

1533
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:08,680
Well, tasty toasties is the name of their anytime snack. These are two ready to cook sandwiches

1534
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:13,000
filled with cheese sauce and turkey ham. Okay, this is just information, but where is it from?

1535
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,320
Okay. Chachi BT says they were called millennium turkey nuggets. This article says they were

1536
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:25,880
called Turkey 2000. I remember 2000. We're getting to the bottom of this. No portion of this article

1537
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:34,040
can't be reproduced. So copyright, copyright 1999, food trade, press limited. So this is an excerpt

1538
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,840
from that in a website called the free libraries. I'm just going to link that.

1539
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:47,960
I'm going to link that shit. Okay, hang on. So this is from a library that has saved this

1540
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:56,360
information, which I am sure is gone. Otherwise, unless they made print versions of that magazine

1541
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:06,520
and somebody saved one. No. Okay. Wait, Bernard Matthews.com. Maybe they have.

1542
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,000
Maybe they have. I doubt it because they're not selling them anymore.

1543
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,600
Product range about us. Contact us. Will I contact them? I might. They made turkey twizzlers.

1544
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:21,400
They made turkey twizzlers. That makes sense. You're right. I knew it. I knew it must be the

1545
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:28,280
same guys. Can we get Bernard Matthews on the podcast? Does he do guest appearances?

1546
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:38,840
Oh my God, the Bernard Matthews among us. They do turkey unicorns, turkey teddies, turkey minions,

1547
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:45,320
turkey sandwiches, turkey balls. Okay. Well, great. Good for them.

1548
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,920
They have sliced turkey. Like a little nugget in the shape of a sandwich.

1549
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:57,800
I think there's stuff inside it. What was that? Hamwich. Cheesy hamwich. Okay. It's not turkey.

1550
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:07,400
Ham boys? It's a ham boy. Okay. ChatGBT does not have anything help, any helpful advice on me

1551
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:12,840
for where to find pictures of the millennium turkey nuggets? This is... We could try Bing.

1552
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:19,560
I'm going to try Bing. I've never Binged anything before. Oh my God. I hope you don't cring.

1553
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:27,960
No. Wait, what? Oh, yeah. Me too. Bernard, Matthews, Millenia.

1554
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,000
Maybe I'll go to their Twitter. I will go to their Twitter. Bernard Matthews food.

1555
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,760
At them on Twitter, Bernard. Where are the turkey 2000s? Right. Yes.

1556
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:43,240
No, Bing is returning largely the same.

1557
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,520
Largely the same image results.

1558
01:28:51,800 --> 01:29:00,360
See turkey twizzlers, turkey twizzlers, turkey dinos. I see... Ew. This has got to be a joke.

1559
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:07,080
I see chicken twizzlers, but they're branded the same way as twizzlers the candy,

1560
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,120
so I don't think that's real.

1561
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:18,280
Was there... I wonder if there was a licensing conflict between turkey twizzlers and the candy

1562
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:24,920
twizzlers, which is... I learned that they are owned by a company called Young and Smiley.

1563
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:34,280
All right, I've added Bernard Matthews on Twitter. Please confirm the existence of turkey 2000s.

1564
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,640
Cannot find any images on Google, but I know they existed.

1565
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,840
Exclamation point. I'm very serious.

1566
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:49,560
What if, hang on, what if we just use the Google, the Twitter search function and like

1567
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:56,520
search for like turkey 2000 and just filtered by images.

1568
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:02,920
Okay, I see your tweets are the latest results for turkey 2000s. Okay, and this is not...

1569
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:11,400
Of course, I'm the biggest. I'm the turkey queen. I'm the 2000s queen. I'm both of those things.

1570
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:16,440
Turkey millennium nuggets. No photo results for turkey millennium nuggets. Jesus.

1571
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:24,680
It's more... It's like... Somebody disappeared it. Somebody disappeared the millennium nugget.

1572
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:28,040
Like that picture of Stalin with Trotsky. Yeah, yeah.

1573
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,080
Somewhere out there is like just a picture of like a plate with nothing on it.

1574
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:41,160
Or maybe some peas. Peas to the side.

1575
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:48,040
Well, that's a mystery. It would be so funny if they actually get back to you about that.

1576
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,880
I would love it. I would love nothing more. Let me see.

1577
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,360
From top results.

1578
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:04,440
Yeah, yeah. A bunch of results about the country turkey at Bernard Matthews. Wait.

1579
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:10,280
Bernard Matthews on Twitter only has 500 followers?

1580
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:17,960
I mean, it's a turkey product. Okay, but it's like a corporation. Okay, it's not even verified.

1581
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,840
Oh, I mean, they don't give a shit about Elon Musk. I can respect that.

1582
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:27,640
Wait. Oh, did they get rid of... Well, no, they haven't gotten rid of legacy notifications yet.

1583
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,960
I got their Twitter from their website, so it is the correct Twitter.

1584
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,800
I mean, they've posted it. Okay, they post like once a year.

1585
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:41,400
They'll see my tweet. I don't know. They'll see it eventually. I maybe.

1586
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:46,120
I don't think it doesn't seem like they maintain a Twitter presence.

1587
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:51,240
The one guy who's in charge of the Twitter will log on to like promote the new Christmas turkey

1588
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:55,320
something or other. Oh my God. And then they'll see my plead.

1589
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:01,400
They'll get excited. They'll finally have someone to talk to about it. Oh, the latest?

1590
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,560
Okay, the latest tweet. I can see why they're not on Twitter.

1591
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:11,240
Their latest tweet in January 2021, they brought back turkey twizzlers,

1592
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:14,840
but they're like different. They're like a different recipe. And all the comments are like,

1593
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:19,880
fuck you. We hate the new turkey twizzlers. Like bring back the old recipe, cowards.

1594
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:31,240
Oh, it's sad. Yeah, people are evil. I mean, I get it.

1595
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,040
These look completely different. And I yeah, they don't look.

1596
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
They're probably are worse. They probably are worse. I don't want to I don't want to.

1597
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,160
I don't want to Kate for Bernard Matthews food is limited.

1598
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:48,680
No, I don't care either. But I never liked the twizzler. So I could imagine the people just have

1599
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:54,520
rose tinted taste buds for that. Yeah, well, I just think it was the best thing ever when it was

1600
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:58,680
actually just filled with salt and fat and they like that. It was and you were and you were a kid.

1601
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,680
It was it was full of salt and grease and you were a kid and times were good.

1602
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,720
And you like that. And that's fair enough.

1603
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,760
Yeah, great quality, honest prices since 1950.

1604
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:17,240
It's respectable. What a legacy. Oh, man.

1605
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:24,200
Contact. Oh, they got a they got a physical address. I should go see them.

1606
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:30,040
Wow. Yeah, like they they tweet like a couple times a year and all the replies are just like

1607
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:37,640
people that hate them. They just don't like what they're doing. Oh, this is odd or no or no replies

1608
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:41,800
more often at the very bottom first site. They've got navigation. They've got about us terms and

1609
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:49,000
conditions 2021 gender pay report. And then something something slavery and human trafficking

1610
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:56,520
statement 2022 Bernard Matthews. No. Are they gonna say what are they gonna say? Introduction

1611
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:02,520
to the new new and improved Turkey Twizzlers. They're back now with 75% less slave labor.

1612
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,320
Yeah, it's basically we're proud of the steps we've taken to combat slavery and human trafficking.

1613
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:15,320
Oh, God. No, our supply chains. We get majority of our protein from UK farmers

1614
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:19,720
with additional supply from Europe, South America and Asia. Okay.

1615
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:28,440
How are you going to human traffic? We remain committed to minimizing the risk of modern slavery

1616
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:35,000
or human trafficking. It's so bad. It's so bad when your press statement has to talk about slavery.

1617
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:41,000
And it's in caps at the bottom of the website. It's very funny. Nothing else is in all caps.

1618
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:45,640
We're so anti slavery guys. I can't believe you think slavery is funny,

1619
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:48,280
Gib. I can't believe you think that's something to laugh about.

1620
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:56,680
Hey, I'm an Amazon author. All right. I think it's funny now. I'm I'm I'm only the only thing I'm

1621
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:03,400
a slave to is the grind is the is the grind is the sigma grind is the rhythm is the rhythm of the

1622
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,840
jungle bees. I don't know what that means.

1623
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:14,440
One day, no, I'd like to try an old Turkey Twizzler, but maybe I'll never get the chance.

1624
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:20,600
No, I think they'd gone. Just get a regular Turkey and twizzle it.

1625
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:27,560
Just twizzle that these these these this is this first attempt at recreating a

1626
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:31,720
Twizzler was not even close. I don't know exactly. I don't know what it's missing.

1627
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:39,240
There are there's the main ingredients in a Twizzler are corn syrup, wheat flour, sugar,

1628
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:46,120
and corn starch. And then past that, there's like a couple other things. There's like,

1629
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:51,720
there's palm oil, there's glycerin. There's, you know, flavoring, obviously, citric acid.

1630
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:55,880
So it might be the palm oil that gives it that like

1631
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:01,400
rubbery consistency. I don't I don't know how you get that. Like I'm not I use the

1632
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:06,440
first the four top ingredients, and I didn't get anything like that at all. So I don't know.

1633
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,520
I don't even know what's going on there.

1634
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:16,520
It's a smooth like a like a Twizzler is like perfectly smooth surface and it's and it's rubbery.

1635
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:20,040
It's mellow and sweet. And boy.

1636
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:29,960
Well, we got close, but I still want people to send letters, physical letters to Bernard Matthews

1637
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:36,920
to us them where the Turkey 2000s went, bring it back. We need to go back.

1638
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:43,000
The 2000s was the best time because I was small and I didn't have to do anything.

1639
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,440
Soy lecithin. Why is there soy lecithin in Twizzlers? That doesn't make any sense.

1640
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,120
What? What do they need to emulsify?

1641
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,880
What? Explain this to me. Explain this shit to me.

1642
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,800
I'm not a Twizzle master. I don't have soy lecithin. You think I do?

1643
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:04,120
You think soy lecithin just grows on trees? I think I have soy lecithin lying around in

1644
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:08,440
this economy. No, I have sunflower lecithin. I have soy like a normal like a normal person.

1645
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:19,240
God. Soy. Maybe we should get mad. Maybe Bernard Matthews should introduce some soy Twizzlers.

1646
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:26,680
What do you think about that? I think it'll be hard for soy on its own to maintain that shape.

1647
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:34,440
I can use the bathroom. Let's break for a minute. Okay.

1648
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:40,760
Okay. It's time to crack into a diet birch beer.

1649
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,200
Birch beer. Yeah. Like the wood?

1650
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:51,240
Yeah. It's kind of minty. It's kind of licorice.

1651
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:59,560
It's delicious. It's my favorite. It's delinci. It's a Leonardo delici.

1652
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:07,880
Is it too early to jump into one piece discussion?

1653
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,680
I mean, I don't have anything else to talk about by my book. I don't have anything else to talk

1654
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:19,640
about. That's basically what I've been doing. I made my book real and I've been happy.

1655
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:26,520
And now next week, I think it's chapter five. I'm going to start drawing.

1656
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:36,600
Oh, I think I should make also a little video for advertising the book. Maybe.

1657
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:42,120
Oh, yeah. You should announce it on whatever platforms you got.

1658
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:48,280
Yeah. I've sent it to all the discords. So next thing is video.

1659
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:52,440
So. You should definitely make a video announcement on

1660
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,560
Hippo, Cread, and Give and Take, I would think. Yeah.

1661
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:09,000
Yeah. Good. That's a good idea. But yeah, one piece. Unless you have anything else to talk about.

1662
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:09,720
Oh.

1663
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:19,960
Trying to freaking feel. Did I take any notes? Did I take any freaking notes on my week?

1664
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:28,520
Hang on. Hang on. PCP weak. Weak notes. What do we got here?

1665
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:31,160
The pretty weak notes. Pretty, pretty weak notes.

1666
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:38,600
Oh, God, I can do my freaking taxes. That's like soon. Fuck.

1667
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:46,600
Okay. That's not a that's not a thing I want to talk about. That's just a thing I have to

1668
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,040
be wary of in my life.

1669
01:39:48,760 --> 01:40:01,080
Um, PCP topics. No. No, those are notes from last week. Ah, fuck it. Never mind. I'll think

1670
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:08,040
whatever. Let's talk about one piece. Chapter 10 79. No, where's Luffy?

1671
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:12,280
Where's Luffy? Where's Luffy? Not even once did Luffy appear.

1672
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:19,960
Except in the in the opening and the whatever you call the that one page at the beginning.

1673
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,560
The title page. Yeah.

1674
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,880
Those are great. I don't I never really think about it, but like having a little like the

1675
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:31,880
logo and then a little thing with a chapter name. I don't have chapter names really for

1676
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:37,320
my comics. Maybe I should be nice. Yeah, I think they're nice. I think they're good.

1677
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:43,240
Um, the Vapors has chapter names of all three chapters.

1678
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:49,960
I think it's because I initially drew it and wrote it without the thought of chapters. So

1679
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:55,240
I guess whenever whatever comic I start next, I'll try and do that.

1680
01:40:56,200 --> 01:41:07,240
So, uh, yeah, no, what was it? Luffy cover request by Sunflower Shop from Tokyo. Luffy

1681
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:17,080
watering a lion mistaking it for a sunflower. Very, very cool. Very nice. Yeah. So, okay. So we see.

1682
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:22,600
So we see. What's your name? York. I couldn't remember her name all week.

1683
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:33,080
So York is, is got a plan. So she wants to become a Tenri Bito as she conspired with or, you know,

1684
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:38,200
against Vegapunk. And she was the one who gave the orders to all the seraphim

1685
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:47,560
to kill everyone except her and pretend to kill her for to keep her cover pretend to kill her.

1686
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:52,360
It's okay. So she said, don't kill the Stella. Why does she not want to kill the Stella?

1687
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,520
Is it because she'll die if Stella dies?

1688
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,040
Yeah, I don't know about that. Because like, I think

1689
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:06,280
that she would not have gone through the whole thing of like, yes, marines, yes,

1690
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:10,920
Goro say, I will help you kill Vegapunk because then she'll die.

1691
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:17,080
Yeah. Why, why, like, I think that isn't a thing. I think that there's just like a

1692
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:21,160
give him to us alive stipulation that she's trying to abide by.

1693
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:24,520
I mean, weren't CP zero there to kill him?

1694
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,320
So yeah, so the government wants to kill him.

1695
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:34,760
Oh, maybe it's because yeah, the government isn't just after Stella, they're looking to

1696
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,240
eliminate her. So that's what she's talking about to these guys. Don't kill Stella.

1697
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,280
Maybe she wants to use it him somehow.

1698
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:48,600
Maybe. There must be, there must be some reason. It's either of its,

1699
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:55,000
it, I feel like it might, it might be like if, like there one being and if he dies,

1700
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,240
she dies, but it might not be that there might be some other reason.

1701
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:05,720
I do, I do like that the order she gives to, there's an area of the lab, I don't want you to

1702
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:10,760
damage and it's, I don't know what type of what area of the lab, it might be the secret area where

1703
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:17,880
the papa data. No, I think it would be, it's either a place we don't know about yet or

1704
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:22,360
the place where she currently is with her gun and she shot checker in the head.

1705
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:26,920
Oh yeah, the place that she's storing all the agents. I mean, that would be a sense.

1706
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:32,200
Yeah. It's either that or another place. But what I'm, what that means to me is that later,

1707
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,840
in order to defeat the stellar, the seraphim, if they stand in that location,

1708
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:43,800
they won't be able to fight back because they don't want to damage anything.

1709
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,360
And they'll be like, oh, I realized that you don't want to damage anything.

1710
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:50,440
Now I can kill you. Now I can get you. That's what I think will happen.

1711
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:55,720
That's, that's, yeah, that makes sense. They, I mean, they would then,

1712
01:43:55,720 --> 01:44:00,040
I suppose they would just have to engage solely in hand-to-hand combat and not use their,

1713
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:02,440
and not use their beemo. True.

1714
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:07,000
That would just be what the, what they have to do there because those,

1715
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,480
it's the laser beams that they fire in like a fraction of a second or like the really

1716
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:17,240
scary part. They can get you from anywhere in like no time at all. Yeah.

1717
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:25,480
So the evacuation of egg head is continuing. And people are getting out since tomorrow is just,

1718
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:31,800
just chilling with wounds. And then we see, we see a ship approaching.

1719
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:36,060
First first first I want to say look at look at this look at kuma's chin

1720
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,900
Yeah, since when is his chin like that?

1721
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,300
forever

1722
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:47,260
It's like I thought he had like a big. I don't know. I didn't think it was that pointy

1723
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:53,060
Well, maybe this this particular particular one is pointy because it's a robot. Oh

1724
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:58,700
It's like they like enhanced his chin. Yeah, they gave it some armor plating hmm

1725
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:05,900
You know anything is possible science technology share is amazing. What do they what do they think of next? I?

1726
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:13,760
Actually, I actually didn't catch I actually skimmed over this panel this next one that it's blackbeard coming to egghead

1727
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,940
I didn't catch that I didn't even notice that that's so bad

1728
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:20,000
Yes, all right. I have a big like

1729
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:24,400
Is he gonna steal the know me know is he gonna steal the know me what if he steals the know me know me know me

1730
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,460
Lamal I

1731
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:31,500
Think it's more interesting than just that okay. I have a big reveler

1732
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,540
I

1733
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:36,900
Realized something seeing blackbeard here, but let's continue the chapter and I'll tell you afterwards

1734
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:43,300
Maybe he wants to wait. Maybe he wants to infuse himself with green blood. Maybe he wants to steal Lunarian DNA

1735
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:46,180
Maybe maybe he wants

1736
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:53,900
I'll tell you my theory. Okay. Okay. Okay. It'll involve the rest of this chapter sure

1737
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:58,940
So then we switch over to Elbaf with the kid pirates and

1738
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:05,140
a bunch of a bunch of funny-looking weirdo crews and their captains

1739
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,660
Who are like shanks aligned?

1740
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:14,380
Mm-hmm, and this is cute. They're they're like kind of pathetic and the reason they're in the shanks the red hair

1741
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:21,340
Pirates grand fleet is because shanks is nice to them and protects them. Yeah, I think it's cute sure

1742
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:24,060
It's different from everyone else

1743
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,600
I mean, they might be tough

1744
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:34,620
They might be they look stupid they look stupid, but you know so do so do you and I don't make fun of you

1745
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:43,360
All right, buy my book for reparations everybody I I bought your book so I can

1746
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:49,100
Book so I can cool you stupid and attack you so I can attack you. Yeah

1747
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,340
Yes shackles for heckles

1748
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:58,200
We should do another one of those one of these should

1749
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,560
We will we will eventually I

1750
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:11,320
Prom maybe to sell maybe to celebrate when the when the perfect comic party is done. Oh, yeah, that'll be nice. Yeah

1751
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,200
Actually, yeah, that would be a good thing to stream about when that's out

1752
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:20,080
It's like hey everyone you can go read the the thing and let us know what you think give us feedback or whatever

1753
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,320
But okay, we're I'm getting distracted

1754
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:27,520
Yeah, so kid pirates with captain kid and he's like what the fuck

1755
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:33,520
I'll kill him. Yeah, shanks is telling them to retreat. He's gonna go deal with it himself

1756
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,920
And he's got all these these

1757
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:44,660
New we haven't seen any of these pirate crews. I don't think yeah, all these new faces. They're all friends with with shanks

1758
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:49,940
It's cool cuz shanks has always felt very isolated when it comes to like

1759
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:56,420
Yonko, yeah, he hasn't felt like the only person we've ever really seen him with is me hawk

1760
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:00,540
And that's it wait

1761
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:02,540
We saw him with me hawk

1762
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:06,020
Yeah, like way a long time ago before

1763
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,660
War at marin for it before the time skip

1764
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:14,580
There was like a scene where shanks is just having fun with me hawk and then he's talking about I refuse to believe that

1765
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:18,140
Me hawk would ever have fun under any circumstances. Well, he's he's having a drink

1766
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:22,580
He's doing the Zoro thing where he's having like like quite was he was he drinking?

1767
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:30,820
Quiet yeah quiet fun. Was he drinking a giant flat bowl plate? He wasn't I think he was drawing drink in a normal size

1768
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:38,180
Normal size little hand sake thingy. Oh fair enough, but a shanks was talking about Luffy and

1769
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:44,380
Me hawk was like, oh, I meant Luffy. He's with this cool sword guy Zoro little punk-ass kid

1770
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:51,660
It's like, oh, how's he doing? How's my little boy Luffy doing you saw him and that was just a little scene. Yeah

1771
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:54,340
Good stuff. Good stuff. I

1772
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:57,100
vaguely remember maybe

1773
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:04,760
All right, but so yes all these weirdos work for shanks pretty cool. He's got the fleets

1774
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:08,200
Seriously, he's got he's got boys. He's got boys. I

1775
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:13,920
Think it's cool though that like the fleets notoriously weak and shanks is just so

1776
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:19,280
Intimidating that people don't fuck with that weak fleet anyway. Wait, where do they say that?

1777
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:25,880
I mean kid calls them jokers and says like oh, is this supposed to be no, it's it's when shanks is walking up the

1778
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,720
steps to the ship

1779
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
All right

1780
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:37,440
And it's like the real reason shanks has to deal with them is because the fleet's notoriously weak and it's like

1781
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:42,880
Haha, you're not supposed to say that out loud like everyone knows it. Okay, so I read this. I read this really fast

1782
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,800
I didn't I didn't catch that. That's really that is really sweet actually

1783
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:51,200
Yeah, he has a weak fleet because he just takes weak pirates under his wing to protect them

1784
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:59,560
Yeah, and it also makes him appear so much more powerful that he doesn't need a strong fleet and that they're all fine

1785
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:04,520
And happy because of how like his reputation as being strong

1786
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,200
Keeps enemies at bay

1787
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:10,360
Which is really and because his fleet is just really big

1788
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:15,520
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's bigger than any other fleet. Oh, okay

1789
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:20,600
Cuz like big mom has her whole family and stuff and kaito and stuff

1790
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:27,080
But white beard had a huge fleet of like bunches of different captains. Yeah, I don't know if this is bigger or like typical

1791
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:34,280
Mmm, he's got a lot of friends. He's makes a lot of friends that shanks. Hey, I just there's a cute

1792
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:42,400
Girl here. We got to stop everything stop the fucking presses. There's the one that looks kind of like piranha. Yes, the the the

1793
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:49,840
Bargain bin piranha, you know what if I can't get the real one. I'll take this one. I guess I like this one

1794
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:55,880
Yeah, mm-hmm Oda continuing to innovate in the field of women

1795
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:04,640
She's got two algers laws hat. Okay. All right. I'm gonna distract. Yes. So there's yasop

1796
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:10,440
Yes, I can't believe it. I can't believe we're actually seeing yasop in the flesh

1797
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:15,000
Yeah, have we not seen him in like panels with the crew? I don't know if we've

1798
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:23,080
We might have seen him like one other time since like did we did we see him like in the very beginning like in romance dawn?

1799
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,960
Oh, of course

1800
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,920
But like him multiple times after that. This isn't the first time we've seen him since no

1801
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:34,400
No, I know I know I know we have seen him before but like

1802
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:39,840
It's very rare. He's a very rare yasop appearance. He he he shows up

1803
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:45,400
He's like third or fourth on the list of shanks crew members to draw

1804
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,640
Like the big boy and I mean it's it's a

1805
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:58,320
Backman lucky lucky lucky roue Beckman and maybe yasop is third after them. Yeah. Yeah

1806
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:06,280
Anyway, like beard is on the move we know that because we saw him traveling to egghead

1807
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,320
and

1808
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,880
You know

1809
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:17,280
Shanks is doing his Wikipedia looking. He's looking at the wiki to see what this kid character is all about

1810
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:21,040
And

1811
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:28,240
Kid isn't isn't pulling any punches. He gets his big weapon out. I think we saw that in whole cake when he used it against big mom

1812
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,920
I forget exactly

1813
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:32,640
But it's a gun. I'm pretty sure he used a big

1814
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,280
gun before

1815
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,760
Yeah, probably

1816
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:45,760
And shanks in his super hacky you can see is so far into the future that he's able to respond to this before it can happen

1817
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:49,200
Yeah, which is interesting. What is the name? There's it's

1818
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:56,280
Armament hockey is the one that like you use for attack and defense conquerors hockey is the one that you use to like pass out

1819
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:04,160
Intimidate and what's what's this one called observation hacky observation hockey and it's the same as they have a different name for it

1820
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:07,040
It's skypea. They called it. Was it like?

1821
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,600
Yeah, I can't remember

1822
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,160
Yeah, it was like wasn't key

1823
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:18,360
No, it was some like multiple syllable world. I can't remember

1824
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,880
Rayatsu is the bleach thing

1825
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,840
observation hockey

1826
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:31,960
Shandra, is it Shandra? No, that doesn't sound right mantra mantra similar

1827
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:39,420
Mantra. Yeah Shandia or something is like one of the names of the island the kingdom the old kingdom

1828
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,040
You're probably right

1829
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,160
Okay, so

1830
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,760
Where was I? Oh, yeah, he was making the gun

1831
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:55,480
He's making a gun sees the shanks sees the potential future. It's odd cuz like I don't know if this has been shown before

1832
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,160
We know that in

1833
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,240
In

1834
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:08,920
The battle between kata curry and Luffy Luffy learns some more observation hockey to see things a little earlier than they're gonna happen

1835
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:14,680
So he can react. Yeah, but I don't know whether he can react so fast that he can stop it from happening

1836
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:18,680
I think Shanks is just like a level beyond that. Well, what I mean, what's that? What's the point of?

1837
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:26,160
Have being able to see a little bit into the future if you can't I mean, it isn't like the point that like you can react like attack me

1838
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,200
But you block it this time

1839
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:34,960
I think it's just the fact that he can see further into the future than Luffy can sure yeah because he's like this

1840
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:40,360
He sees all of these ships being destroyed, but in the end they don't nothing gets destroyed

1841
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:46,280
Mm-hmm. So it's not even like the weapon went off. So it's like really ahead

1842
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:54,960
Which makes sense. Yeah, yeah observation hockey being more powerful means you can see into the future a little bit. Yeah, definitely

1843
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:59,200
You must be seeing at least like several seconds into the future

1844
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:03,160
Yeah, although he is he is jumping he is pretty quick and he's like

1845
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:09,200
Scrambling because he's worried that he won't get there in time. Mm-hmm. So it's just about to happen

1846
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,720
So it might not actually be that far in the future

1847
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:16,760
But anyway, he jumps right into kids face and he slices them with a divine departure

1848
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:22,360
See all okay slices right through the gun. He's cuts cuts the gun right in half

1849
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:28,120
And kid gets whacked does he I don't think he doesn't slice kid in half

1850
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:30,120
He just like cuts him

1851
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:32,240
Yeah, hurt some hurt some

1852
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:39,040
I'm gonna Google this quickly because I think somebody said divine departure was like an attack that gold Roger used

1853
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Hmm

1854
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:44,280
And I just want to check that

1855
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:52,520
Whoa his oh my god his conquerors hockey even knocked out killer I

1856
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:59,600
Thought it was saying that like killer got sliced by the sword slash

1857
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:03,320
And I think it's saying the killer got knocked up by the conquerors hockey

1858
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:06,360
It's like wow

1859
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,200
Okay, I Google divine departure

1860
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:13,320
One piece Goldie Rogers swordsmanship

1861
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:20,880
Divine departure Goldie Roger launches divine departure Rogers make move name in Japanese is Kamasuri

1862
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:31,200
Okay, Odin was hit by this attack

1863
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:39,320
Yeah, it's one Odin from the from from one oh from one oh back story flashback. Yeah, okay

1864
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:46,240
So yeah, he learned that from Roger and Roger was a swordsman. So yeah makes sense pretty cool

1865
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:52,040
Interesting must must must must be a pretty good technique. I guess

1866
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:56,480
That technique that hi that

1867
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,800
We didn't mention we didn't mention that the OVA is out. Oh, yeah, whatever

1868
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,320
I

1869
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:13,640
Read listen to the commentary read though buy my book. I don't do that

1870
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:20,440
Become a patron become a patron listen to our we recorded like it's like it's not just we didn't commentate it at real time

1871
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:22,800
We paused it and we discussed the OVA

1872
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,800
It's what we see

1873
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:31,640
Yeah, I think it's like a 45 minute video or we just like talk about

1874
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,200
What the fuck is going on here?

1875
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,600
And that was fun

1876
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:39,800
Yeah, that's on the patreon. Okay, so I

1877
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,320
Scrolled ahead a little bit

1878
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,560
So shanks defeated kid in one attack

1879
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:52,160
Yeah, or so easily and then they did his crew is like scaled and

1880
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:58,720
They give him the road pornographic rubbings that they got at the end of

1881
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,760
one oh

1882
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,740
So they had to I think he's he's freaking got him. So I mean

1883
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,320
He's got does he have all the

1884
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:13,180
Ponyglyphs that he needs now is that well, all right here. This is part of my my

1885
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:18,000
Realization so I think he has just these two he might have

1886
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:23,980
One of the other two he doesn't have all four because if he has all four he wins and he's found rough tail

1887
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,200
Yeah, I love tail. Yeah

1888
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:31,960
Although shanks probably would know where it is. So maybe it moves and that's why you need the

1889
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,840
Ponyglyphs. I mean, does does anyone know where it is?

1890
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:40,840
Well, yeah, the people who were on gold rogers crew. Oh

1891
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:47,160
Traveled there. So like silver's Rayleigh would know buggy and shanks

1892
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:50,000
Did the whole crew go there before I don't

1893
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:55,960
Know you might be right actually he was there and like everyone found it

1894
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:58,440
Roger left. So

1895
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,280
So, I mean they know

1896
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,280
What the one piece is?

1897
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:05,640
Right

1898
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:09,960
You know, I it's confusing. I don't really think

1899
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:16,920
We're supposed to have any understanding of whether or not we know

1900
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:19,160
That they know

1901
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:24,520
Exactly, like maybe the one piece. It's just too many things. It could be that we don't you know

1902
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:30,200
Like why would they want to be the pirate king? Why only now is shanks trying to be the pirate king? Yeah

1903
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:33,360
No, I think what's what's all this stuff about?

1904
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:40,120
Yeah, I don't I'm really I'm kind of lost. I don't I don't really see any reason why shanks

1905
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:45,840
I don't I mean, I don't think any of these people like really need like the title of pirate king like that's not

1906
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:50,360
Important to them. I don't think shanks would care about that

1907
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,480
He's gonna go

1908
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:57,360
He's gonna do some shit. I don't know. He must he must be going to Raftel

1909
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:00,840
Because there's something he can do there that he needs to go there

1910
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:06,960
Yeah, whatever whatever the one pieces will enable him to do it

1911
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:13,000
There's so many things that I don't feel like I can even speculate on what one piece is yet

1912
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,120
All I know is it made gold Roger laugh and that's funny

1913
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:26,560
Did it did I love one piece so shanks leaves and then

1914
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:35,040
Yeah, Dory and Broggy do their special technique that we saw so long ago that technique

1915
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:40,120
What's the what's the brother sister brother sister? What do you call them?

1916
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:42,920
What do you call your brother sister?

1917
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:49,400
Sis no Nissan Nissan Nissan that technique hi. Yeah, okay

1918
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,400
Right they use the Hakoku sovereignty

1919
02:00:54,040 --> 02:01:01,480
Yes, if you remember when they met the Dory and Broggy the store has met them on the island with the big

1920
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:05,680
Skeleton of a dinosaur

1921
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:13,500
And that's when Nami got like the the sickness that need they needed to go to Drum Island to get a doctor after that

1922
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:15,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1923
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:20,080
They use that to blow a hole through a giant goldfish that was gonna eat the ship

1924
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:27,440
They use this this this yeah, that was like a the final farewell and their weapons broke after that

1925
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:34,080
Because they've been fighting for like a hundred years or something or 50 years is probably thank you for the reminder

1926
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:36,760
Did not remember all that yeah

1927
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:41,960
It's it's such a cool like ah this is like back then it's like whoa giants are so cool

1928
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:49,480
But now it's like wow giants are in the main story. They're still so cool here. They are yeah

1929
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,480
Yeah, so

1930
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:58,040
Kid I mean, I don't think kid is dead, but his his fleet

1931
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:01,080
I mean, I guess he just had his one ship and now his ship is just gone

1932
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:07,440
Yeah, his ship his crew his crew and his like pirate ambitions are for the moment like toast

1933
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:12,640
Yeah, this is a little defeated by shanks very easily

1934
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
LaMalle

1935
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,080
now this

1936
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:20,600
learning about

1937
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:24,920
shanks doing this getting the the road ponyglyph rubbings and

1938
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:31,680
Remembering the blackbeard was recently fighting Trafalgar law. This is my realization

1939
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:40,280
Giving at the end of 1.0. They shared road ponyglyphs like the store has the kid pirates and the heart pirates

1940
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:43,480
They shared their road ponyglyphs

1941
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,200
So they all have each other's rubbings

1942
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:53,040
They don't have all of each other's they had they shared the ones the ones yeah, and they shared the one from

1943
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:55,520
1.0, I think wait wait that was before big mom

1944
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:59,520
No, no in 1.0. It was after now. You're right

1945
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:01,200
but

1946
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:04,200
Yeah, so that there was one at the very bottom of

1947
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:13,160
1.0 if you remember Niko Robin and Trafalgar law found that and they were being escorted there by the old shogun

1948
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And before that Brooke Stahl

1949
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:21,440
This is such a cool move by Brooke. He stole the you got a rubbing of

1950
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:25,680
The one in whole cake when he was captured. Oh

1951
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:32,240
Like he was captured like big mom was like sleeping with him and her bed

1952
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:36,640
It's like oh, you're so cool. You're a little skeleton. He hid the rubbings in his skull

1953
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:42,600
That was the joke like he had he did the rubbings of the ponyglyphs and then he hid them inside his skull

1954
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:45,560
Okay, and so after everything was said and done it was like oh

1955
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:49,560
Shame we couldn't get the ponyglyph and then he was like, oh, look at this

1956
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:53,000
Where is where was the ponyglyph?

1957
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:55,640
If you remember there was a big

1958
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,800
In whole cake island

1959
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:59,360
Toto land the kingdom

1960
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:04,480
I can't remember the names of the main places but like yeah, there's a big room with three ponyglyphs

1961
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,480
one of them is a road ponyglyph and

1962
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:09,160
They were all in big cages and

1963
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:16,880
Only Brooke was able to get in there and take the the ponyglyph before he got captured and then she put him in

1964
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:25,000
In her bed, okay, I mean I yeah rings about I don't remember the ponyglyph being in big cages

1965
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:32,280
But I do remember that he had it in his skull. So yeah, they were they were in like a lock-and-key sort of vault area

1966
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:35,680
Yeah, okay, so they have the 101

1967
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:39,920
They have big and the whole cake one the whole is that is that all they got?

1968
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:42,800
Yeah, it was the same ones the kid has

1969
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:47,640
Those are the ones the kid has and those the ones that law has

1970
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:53,640
Mm-hmm, and the straw hats have those plus the one that was hidden inside the elephant in zoe

1971
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:57,400
So they have what I don't remember that

1972
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:03,680
At all. I'm so bad. I'm so bad at reading. It's okay. I once I read this chapter

1973
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:07,840
I went I realized this wasn't there one wasn't there one in skypea

1974
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:14,480
No, the one in skypea was not a road it wasn't a road ponyglyph. There was information

1975
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:20,960
But yeah, Nico Robin was like, ah, it's not it's not what I was looking for not void century

1976
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:27,660
Yeah, she's looking for the Rio ponyglyph, which is like the information the big one the key missing link

1977
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:30,600
Is that her big goal wait?

1978
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:33,080
so there's

1979
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:37,440
So if you have the is that one like more important than the road ponyglyphs

1980
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:44,040
The road ponyglyphs there's four of those before the four road ponyglyphs point to Raftel and what is that?

1981
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Yeah, Raftel. That's what I said

1982
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:54,200
What is the what is the Rio ponyglyph point the Rio ponyglyph contains the information about the void century?

1983
02:05:54,520 --> 02:06:04,080
Okay, so like it's in some ways the main one that will explain everything connect all the dots and the rest of them are either

1984
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:10,480
Like yeah, unimportant or tangentially important or like some of them

1985
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:16,440
She finds lead her to the locations of like the ancient weapons like pluton and Poseidon

1986
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:19,920
Yeah, I think pluton was the one in alabaster

1987
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,840
It

1988
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:31,720
I don't remember one of those. I think that was the one I mean Frankie had the plans for Poseidon

1989
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:36,080
Yeah, something like water seven

1990
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:42,680
And I don't know yeah, the blueprints. Yeah, I remember. Yeah, there was one in alabaster that I remember that

1991
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:49,440
Right, okay, okay, so so that's the real ponyglyph. It's not anything to do with the left tail. Okay. I

1992
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:52,840
Okay, so there was a third road ponyglyph in

1993
02:06:53,200 --> 02:07:00,760
Zhao but wasn't and that was after whole cake. So no, no, that was before so why don't kid and law have it if they all shared

1994
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:04,360
There and they didn't I don't think the store had shared that one unless they did

1995
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:06,960
I don't think they would I feel like

1996
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:11,480
They'll let me too much cuz it cuz like they fought together as a team

1997
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,600
from

1998
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:20,080
Like whole cake. I'm I'm I'm not not even with kid. Just just law

1999
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:23,240
I might be being too like nitpicky here

2000
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:26,560
But like I mean I look at this image and it looks like there are four

2001
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:29,320
documents

2002
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:31,320
It does

2003
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:38,920
It really does but like if they have four then they already have all of them so it's like there's no way this four there

2004
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:41,440
That's why I thought they'd like doubled up and there's two of them

2005
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:47,080
It looks like four, but they could just be folded in a way that makes it look

2006
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:53,640
Like that or maybe or maybe maybe because the the it's a cube so there's

2007
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:59,160
Yeah, there would be multiple sheets. There would be multiple sheets for a single. Yeah, glyph

2008
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:03,120
Yeah, that makes sense as well. I guess I don't know how many kid has I assumed

2009
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:07,840
He would have at least the two right they would have at least the 101

2010
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:12,080
I don't even know whether they would be sharing the the whole cake one as well

2011
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:15,360
But regardless

2012
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:19,320
Well, they say well, they say I mean this translation here says take our load pony glyphs

2013
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:22,800
Implying that there's more than one. Yeah, so they probably have two

2014
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,040
Meaning there's two more and I looked at the two more the other one is in zoe

2015
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:31,800
Yeah, and as far as we know that has been safely hidden by the minx

2016
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:35,500
Even Kaido couldn't get in, you know, they didn't give them up

2017
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:41,040
Because remember Rizzo the samurai ninja was hiding in the elephant as well

2018
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:45,880
Right, and they didn't give him up because they're friends and like honorable

2019
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:48,080
doggies

2020
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:50,080
Yes

2021
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,380
So that's three the fourth one would have been used to be

2022
02:08:56,380 --> 02:09:02,260
Under the sea at Fishman Island and it has been moved by the time the straw hats get there

2023
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:07,820
It is no longer there. It is presumed lost. Nobody knows where it is. At least the wiki doesn't have any information

2024
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:10,140
hmm

2025
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:11,940
So there's three

2026
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:17,100
That the straw hats have they are looking for one more road pony glyph and it's just and we just don't know where it is

2027
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:20,380
We don't know where it is. Damn. Um now first off

2028
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:23,960
The fact that blackbeard is a traveling here

2029
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:28,840
Means that he's probably I think after

2030
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:31,040
Luffy's

2031
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,040
Rubbings of the pony glyphs

2032
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:38,220
Because if he's here that probably means he beat law and took his

2033
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,840
Ponyglyph rubbings the same way that shanks just beat kid

2034
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:48,520
I think that's a fair assumption to make law might not be in as bad of shape

2035
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:50,920
but I think he probably was defeated and

2036
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:55,160
That's why blackbeard is just traveling. He's just going

2037
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:02,040
That makes a lot of sense. So blackbeard would have I mean at least the wanoglyph

2038
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:04,440
Maybe the the whole cake one

2039
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:07,160
Probably not the the Zhao one

2040
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:16,080
So he might have one to three glyphs already. Yes, but yeah, I mean there's probably some he could still get from Luffy

2041
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,040
Um, yeah, I mean

2042
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:25,840
So and he's learned learned the information by fighting law that they were they shared the Ponyglyph rubbings and stuff

2043
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:31,480
So it's like Luffy went this way kid went that way law went this way and I fought law

2044
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:42,480
Not only this there's so many things going on blackbeard is also he has pudding right now in the ship

2045
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:44,680
In the in the brig and

2046
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:48,200
Kobe was captured by blackbeard

2047
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:49,640
Oh garp

2048
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:55,520
Traveled out to find Kobe if you remember I mentioned that a little while ago that the many multiple moving pieces

2049
02:10:55,640 --> 02:11:01,360
Garp might be on his way to egghead as well after blackbeard because he's got blackbeard

2050
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:08,320
Yeah, if if blackbeard has Kobe, I think he probably does. I'm not sure. I don't remember seeing him with

2051
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
pudding or anything

2052
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:16,680
But the idea that garp will be traveling to egghead following blackbeard

2053
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,840
um

2054
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:25,200
Is funny because he was supposed to be going to egghead anyway with the other marines and the admirals

2055
02:11:25,200 --> 02:11:28,080
Oh as part like along with Kizaru and the

2056
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:38,200
I almost called him Jonathan Joestar Saturn Saturn Saturn regalia or whatever his name is. Yes Saturn Saturn

2057
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:40,560
I

2058
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:42,840
Forget his name completely

2059
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:46,520
Saturn Garcia Jerry Jerry Saturn

2060
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,360
Jerry Seinfeld yeah, okay the the Gorose

2061
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:54,480
Gorose gay right so

2062
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:58,280
Yeah, okay, I remember that he was like nah heck those guys

2063
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:05,600
But now he's probably headed the same way. Yep. I think that's that checks a blackbeard blackbeard is on his way

2064
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:10,240
Um Kobe is probably with him and if he is with him garp is on his way

2065
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:16,040
Um garp probably hasn't held meppo with him and that other lady that I forget what her name is

2066
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:19,400
Oh

2067
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:22,160
You mean the other marine to take a place

2068
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:29,640
Not to Shiggy. She's not a smoker and smoker. I don't know he might be with like the fleet which will be fun

2069
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:36,240
So the fleet is coming and they're coming after blackbeard possibly also after garp and

2070
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:44,840
There's all of these pacifista on the islands ready to defend but like blackbeard's got us. He's pretty strong

2071
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:53,040
Yeah, it's quite strong. I can't even really think about what is gonna happen when he arrives

2072
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:56,840
But it's gonna be big. I mean obviously they said it was gonna be big last chapter. It's got like

2073
02:12:57,320 --> 02:13:03,600
Yeah, wait, this is gonna be the big incident. Yeah, this is one day from the egghead incident is okay

2074
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:10,200
Blackbeard was part of the crew along with buggy and shanks with the gold gold Rogers crew, right?

2075
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:15,800
No, he was part of whitebeard's crew. Oh

2076
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:23,440
He betrayed whitebeard, which is why ace went over to to get him back because he a blackbeard found

2077
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:27,600
The like the whitebeard crew found the darkness fruit the yomi yomi

2078
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:31,400
I think yeah, and blackbeard stole the guy

2079
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:37,120
Oh, yeah, and stole it and ate it and ran and that's why it's like that's a big crime

2080
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:44,000
You can't do that. I would say so ace went to fight him and that lead led to ace being sent to

2081
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:47,520
The Marines that caused a whole bunch of stuff

2082
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:53,040
I think blackbeard literally did that just so that he could invade in Pell down and recruit all of the biggest guys

2083
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:54,720
Yeah

2084
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:55,840
um

2085
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,840
Which worked out well for him

2086
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:04,000
Um, it sure did. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so he was not on the the gold Roger crew. Did he

2087
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:09,920
Okay, do we we don't know anything about him before he was a part of whitebeard's crew though

2088
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:16,080
No, okay, aside from sbs snippets and I haven't read all of those so I don't really know

2089
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:20,480
Yeah, okay. He he once was a boy. I assume he was once a boy

2090
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:25,680
Um, when he was a boy

2091
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:29,440
He was a boy to play down by the sea

2092
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:32,240
You know that song

2093
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:37,760
Yes, okay, just it's munchies favorite. Uh, it's a good it's a good song

2094
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:40,560
captain

2095
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:45,680
Yeah, we don't want to get copyright struck

2096
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:48,240
We don't want the steam power giraffe

2097
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:51,200
Notoriously litigants

2098
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
A copyright claim in our videos

2099
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,360
Where were we?

2100
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:03,600
Okay, so blackbeard, um blackbeard. So blackbeard's doing blackbeard's doing this. So law is possibly defeated

2101
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:08,000
I assume he might not be defeated. He might have just been

2102
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,640
like

2103
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:14,800
He might be on his way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He might be following blackbeard

2104
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:20,560
Like we got to get those he like he got knocked around and the pony glyph stuff got stolen if they shared the pony glyphs

2105
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:27,280
Then if blackbeard beat law and got his glyphs, I feel like he wouldn't think he needed luffy's glyphs

2106
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:36,000
Well, this is why I don't think the straw hats shared the zoe one. Okay. Well, but but but but would law know that they

2107
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Had more glyphs that they didn't share

2108
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:42,400
Yeah, but like they agreed to share the ones they got as a team

2109
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,360
Okay, like fighting the the the emperors and stuff. I see I see

2110
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:51,680
Um, well fair enough. So yeah, okay. It's plausible

2111
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,160
I'll need to reread because like it would be pretty pretty

2112
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:02,800
It would be a lot if they all three of them had three of the the road pony glyphs

2113
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:05,440
Yeah, and now blackbeard and shanks

2114
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:12,160
Have three out of four. And so I mean it might be that way. So then it would be like blackbeard has three out of four

2115
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:16,640
Just all there is shanks has three out of four finding the last one would be the only thing left

2116
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:22,240
Shanks has three out of four. Luffy has three out of four and luffy is currently not completely destroyed

2117
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:26,160
So maybe shanks and blackbeard are gonna go after luffy

2118
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:32,160
But the reason I want I'm thinking that luffy has a different one is because that makes him a target

2119
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:33,600
Yeah

2120
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:39,200
Um, which is yeah, why blackbeard would appear because why the hell would blackbeard come to egghead?

2121
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:42,160
Just to fuck him up

2122
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:43,920
it would

2123
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:45,680
Yeah, no, he he

2124
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:49,600
Would make sense if he's got that that extra rubbing and nobody else has it

2125
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:52,400
It's like well, we got to get it from that guy

2126
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:59,520
Yeah, and also I'm thinking this is my theory. I think that the fourth one was stolen or like

2127
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:02,160
removed

2128
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:10,240
From fishman island by shanks the redhead pirates and put on elbaf and under the lock and key of the giants, which is why

2129
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:12,160
um

2130
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:16,960
They'll they'll be an ark in elbaf and usopp with his giant like

2131
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:20,080
Like he's he's he's in with the giants

2132
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:25,360
He's in with dorian broggy and oi mo and kashi and they love him and so

2133
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,440
God usopp will get them the fourth road poneglyph

2134
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,320
That they need to get to to laugh tail and that'll be like the coolest thing ever

2135
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:39,840
Why um, why do you say that shanks moved the road poneglyph to elbaf?

2136
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:46,560
I may not have been shanks, um, but I just think because he's friendless with the giants and

2137
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:49,440
You know big mom had one

2138
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:50,960
kaito had one

2139
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:52,960
Maybe shanks wanted to keep it from oh

2140
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:58,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah when you say yeah, okay the fact that he's an emperor and the other two emperors had one

2141
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:01,520
actually

2142
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:02,960
did I mean

2143
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:08,400
Because it was relatively recently so you think it wasn't moved within like the last hundred years it was moved

2144
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:13,200
Like it was there until recently. I remember the the in fishman island

2145
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:17,040
King neptune mentions that. Oh, yeah, it used to be here. I don't know where it went

2146
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:22,400
I don't really remember but the the the one in wano has like been there for a long long time

2147
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:27,440
Right. Oh, yeah, because the the the the poneglyphs come from wano and the one

2148
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:29,840
Oh, that's right

2149
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:35,440
But what about okay the one in whole cake? I mean was that moved there by big mom or was that well? Yeah

2150
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:40,480
Well, I I assume. I mean, I don't know. I think just because there's three different

2151
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:43,360
Poneglyphs in the same room that they moved in there

2152
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:47,520
They're very heavy and difficult and impossible to destroy

2153
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:52,560
And damage but they're probably like like light enough that you could move them

2154
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:58,560
Did she just take it? I mean, do you think she like took it from wano because she's

2155
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,200
A emperor and just wanted it

2156
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:04,720
I don't know that she got it from wano. I think I mean a lot of

2157
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:06,960
That there's poneglyphs all over the world

2158
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:13,280
So there used to be that the country wasn't closed that wano was a nation that traded with the world and

2159
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:15,840
Well, not necessarily from wano

2160
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:21,200
But I mean you think she just took it wherever it was. She's just like well, I'm the I'm the emperor. So I'm taking it

2161
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:22,960
It's a treasure

2162
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:29,840
Yeah, it's a treasure and it's mine and as as long as I have it under my watch the other guys can't have it like it seems like an obvious

2163
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:33,920
Then I don't know that the thing was in wano. I don't think

2164
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:38,720
But he probably goes to wano to stay there because it's strategic

2165
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:44,560
And there's probably a lot of secrets there anyway, right only the old the old shogun knew about it

2166
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:46,880
And kind of didn't know about it. Okay

2167
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:49,120
Yeah, I mean

2168
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:51,120
So do you think that shanks?

2169
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:57,120
Yeah, in uh, yeah, when you put it like that it could have been shanks and he is an emperor

2170
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,200
So like he his status befits

2171
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
him having one

2172
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:05,120
So I mean that would mean that he must have the rubbing so like

2173
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:08,720
He then would he would only need the zoe

2174
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:14,000
Yeah, which is which means which means shanks is also gonna have to come after luffy which is like

2175
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:21,280
Narratively, yeah, like dramatically the coolest way the things could be going not just that luffy has to fight

2176
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:25,200
Um to win but also to be hunted by everyone

2177
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:29,920
Yeah, at least everyone who is the most powerful people ever. Yeah. Yeah

2178
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:38,240
Um, so I I think what's gonna happen is the big bullshit is gonna happen at egghead, but lbath

2179
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:43,280
Will be the where they get the final roadponic with

2180
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:48,800
I mean, I don't know what will happen in between, but I feel like I feel like that's there

2181
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:54,320
I mean, it just seems like a cool big place for it to be it feels like such big like defenses

2182
02:20:54,560 --> 02:21:01,840
It feels like everything is pointing to lbath right now like all like the ohara records are there and you know, I mean

2183
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:09,520
Dory and brogue and shanks is shanks has apparently been there for a while and he's he's been doing something there

2184
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:14,320
And yeah bringing the roadponic lift seems like a reasonable thing. He might have been yeah

2185
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:18,400
Makes a lot of sense and uh the uh would be

2186
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:23,120
As like a place we've been hearing about for like so long it kind of

2187
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:29,280
Works as like this is kind of where it all shakes out. Yeah

2188
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:31,600
uh

2189
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,600
I

2190
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:36,480
I think I think that's where they're going right is that the plan

2191
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,600
Or do they they don't even know where they're going when they leave egghead

2192
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:46,320
I mean narratively they must they must go to lbath. Surely they must at this point in the story go to lbath

2193
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:49,520
But like they don't know that yet

2194
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:52,560
Uh, yeah, they don't have a plan. Okay

2195
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:56,560
I think I think the way the oda likes to write

2196
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:02,560
His stories is to have like yeah, you know, they're gonna do something but like the way they get there is like

2197
02:22:03,360 --> 02:22:08,960
They're not just gonna finish whatever they're doing here and then leave and then just arrive at lbath

2198
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:12,080
I think it's gonna be a different sort of arrival. I mean

2199
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:17,360
Is are they gonna fight shanks in the middle of the ocean on the way there is shanks gonna be coming for them

2200
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:21,440
Is shanks going to appear in this egghead battle?

2201
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:25,680
Because he's he's just you know, he got kid

2202
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:31,120
And she was just leaving the island anyway. He was just saying

2203
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:38,720
Surely he's not close enough to get there by the time the egghead incident happens. Well, here's the thing

2204
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:42,640
Okay, uh, maybe not but here's the thing

2205
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:45,040
They traveled

2206
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:48,240
From wano the three of them all three in different directions

2207
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,200
Uh kid went to lbath

2208
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:53,440
Luffy went to egghead

2209
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:57,680
Law went to I think pirate island where blackbird was or was otherwise

2210
02:22:58,640 --> 02:23:04,240
I think it must be pirate island because if blackbird was there and he's just left black pirate island then

2211
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:10,080
Those are the three locations. So they're close enough to each other. Should I know what pirate island is?

2212
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:16,000
It's where blackbeard head is giant skull base of operations like wily

2213
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:22,080
Yeah, it looks like a big skull. It's cool. It's just so it's just it's just blackbeard's hideout

2214
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:25,280
Yeah, okay, it's his it's his base and

2215
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:28,320
Yeah, if the three of them left wano at the same time

2216
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:35,920
And arrived at these three different places shanks was on lbath blackbeard is in egghead now and was on pirate island

2217
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:41,280
That must mean that shanks is also close to egghead on the other direction

2218
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:44,400
Or like close enough

2219
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:47,680
He's not around the other side of the world. This is like it could happen

2220
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:50,480
Hmm

2221
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:55,440
And we still don't know what the hell kuma's doing climbing the red line. What's he doing over there?

2222
02:23:56,080 --> 02:24:00,480
Haven't seen him in a while. Yeah, I'm still waiting to find out what's in that damn memory paw

2223
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:04,320
It's just a lot of creepypastas

2224
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:12,320
It's just uh, it's actually the entire internet. Uh, that is they're using it to train chat gbt to um

2225
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:15,200
To tell us about turkey twizzlers

2226
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:20,640
Somewhere in there is the secret of the millennium turkey

2227
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:27,520
Um, the turkey that's that that's the that's the one piece. Oh my god, turkey 2000

2228
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:31,220
That's why roger left. It was so fucking stupid

2229
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:41,280
Why would they make it? Why would they make this it would only be relevant for one year

2230
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:47,280
That's what he said they almost went bankrupt because of it. He laughed

2231
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,640
slavery

2232
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:52,880
modern day

2233
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,040
to human trafficking

2234
02:24:56,240 --> 02:25:02,160
Fishman trafficking fishman. Oh, that's fine. I mean that was like what 30 years ago. Fishman didn't have rights then

2235
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:09,520
It's probably normal. I mean, that's that's true. Right didn't like fishman liberation only happened like recently

2236
02:25:10,480 --> 02:25:12,480
Yeah, but like

2237
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:18,800
Cool people weren't racist against them. Oh, yeah, I mean sure. Yeah, probably actually you're right

2238
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:24,080
Um, it was just but but it was probably yeah, I mean probably roger would not laugh at it

2239
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,160
But it probably was widely practiced

2240
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:28,880
Oh, yeah, yeah

2241
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:34,560
All the characters you like weren't into it, but all of this the dumb citizens who didn't know any better

2242
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:40,160
They were like, yeah, I guess fish people from the black lagoon. They're scary. Yeah, yeah, put them in the water

2243
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:44,560
I put them back. No, this really does really does help the economy. Just keep this guy

2244
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,040
Just keep this really strong guy around

2245
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:49,440
Like working for us. Damn

2246
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:51,840
This is great

2247
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,440
I love racism

2248
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,120
um

2249
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:56,640
Yeah, so

2250
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:58,960
I'm super hype. I'm super hype

2251
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:01,600
About what is going to happen next

2252
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,600
Everyone's here

2253
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:08,000
There's so many people already involved in this like scuffle. There's more people coming

2254
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:15,520
Yeah, and now blackbeard's here and garp potentially and potentially shanks and potentially law if he wasn't completely fucking destroyed

2255
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:16,720
Like kid was

2256
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:21,680
Yeah, I'm just gonna say do you think do you think kid is like basically like done?

2257
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:24,640
Or do you think he's gonna do more stuff?

2258
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:28,560
I think he's done in the same way that gecko moria was done

2259
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:34,240
Yeah, like his his thriller bark was destroyed and like hogback and what was the

2260
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:36,320
uh

2261
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:39,760
Pesson what was his name the the invisible man?

2262
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:41,600
pit

2263
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:42,960
Oh, uh

2264
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:44,800
picar

2265
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,080
uh

2266
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:47,760
Nah, I don't say I'm right the the leopard

2267
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:50,560
Leopard man. Is he was he a mink?

2268
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:53,520
He may have been part mink, I guess

2269
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:56,400
But like maybe started as a human

2270
02:26:57,360 --> 02:26:58,080
um

2271
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:03,520
Either way like hogback left thriller bark with like gecko moria on a little raft

2272
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:08,240
Yeah, so he basically started from square one peron of just fucked off and left

2273
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,760
um

2274
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:18,640
And we never saw hogback again, I guess I don't know I think gecko moria was murdered by don flamengo at the war of marion ford

2275
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:20,240
Wait, really?

2276
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:22,000
Yeah, he was just

2277
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:29,200
This is like during the the the the the all of the stuff happening moria was there and then to flamengo just like

2278
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:33,200
Did a little creepy smile and did like a thing

2279
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:35,840
Ha ha I gotcha

2280
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:37,520
But I don't know if he's

2281
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:39,520
dead. I think he's like

2282
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:41,600
really hurt

2283
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:43,600
there's something going on with moria because

2284
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:48,800
There was a there was a thing much later. It wasn't there with like black beards crew

2285
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,160
Uh

2286
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:56,640
Yeah, I'd be more like the invisible the invisible man the invisible man went to

2287
02:27:57,360 --> 02:28:01,840
Blackbeard and said please give me my captive back. So I guess moria is like a prisoner

2288
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:04,960
I guess blackbeard has a lot of prison people

2289
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,840
Yeah

2290
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:12,320
I mean, didn't he he had um bonnie, right? Wasn't bonnie his prisoner?

2291
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:15,360
Bonnie was his prisoner early in the

2292
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:18,560
the uh

2293
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:22,000
Yeah, when the as the time skip was about to happen

2294
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:26,880
Bonnie was in the new world all of the people in the new world except for the store hats were in

2295
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:30,320
Different places training. Yeah, and bonnie was like

2296
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:33,120
Like beaten by by blackbeard

2297
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:35,760
Yeah, but she bounced back I guess

2298
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,760
She doesn't really have a crew anymore. No, I mean she was one of the um

2299
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:43,280
Oh, fuck. What are they called the like newest generation?

2300
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:48,400
Is that is that what you call like all the all those like young like up-and-comers that were at uh

2301
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:55,600
At the at the show body that one time. Yeah, I think that they were called the worst generation as in like yeah these youngsters

2302
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:57,920
they're so

2303
02:28:57,920 --> 02:28:59,920
Crazy, they're they suck

2304
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:06,480
Is it that they suck or that they're like wild and like and like the wild and and and they don't care about like

2305
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:08,320
um

2306
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:13,040
Like they like I thought I'm yeah, I thought I meant they're like they're real

2307
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:15,120
I thought it meant like they're just they're real like they're

2308
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:18,880
They're they they they fuck shit up. Yeah, they fuck shit up

2309
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:25,040
And they're like toppling the era that came before which was getting old like white beard is getting old

2310
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:28,080
Big mom's getting old everyone's sort of like normal and

2311
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:32,720
And status quo is sort of reigning supreme and the worst generation are coming in

2312
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:39,360
Which does include blackbeard apparently and they're fucking everything up and I mean it includes it includes gang bees

2313
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:41,520
Who looks like older than kaito?

2314
02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:44,240
Uh

2315
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:50,800
I don't know. I don't know if he actually is but like he looks older. Yeah, he's in his 40s or something. Yeah

2316
02:29:52,320 --> 02:29:53,680
Um

2317
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:55,680
Yeah, yeah, but okay the worst generation the

2318
02:29:56,240 --> 02:30:01,760
Didn't wasn't didn't they have a name like like the I want to say they were called like the millennial stars or something

2319
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:06,080
Or now you're thinking of turkey two thousands. I am thinking of turkey two thousands, but are they the

2320
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:08,800
I'm I think they were the millennial say

2321
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:14,880
I thought there was a name for like those there is another name. I can't remember those specific like eight pirates

2322
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:17,520
luffy gang

2323
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:19,520
Diaz drake killer killer

2324
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:22,080
uh hawkins

2325
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:24,240
Fucking up scratchmen up who?

2326
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,640
And like bonnie bonnie

2327
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:30,000
Uh rouge the skype or yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2328
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:32,960
That guy's cool

2329
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:34,480
All these guys

2330
02:30:34,480 --> 02:30:39,040
All these guys over all those freaking guys go. It's like I guess we've seen a bunch of guys

2331
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:41,440
Diaz was on

2332
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:45,440
Was on was on beast island. I mean kaito. I was part of whatever

2333
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
He was part of the the troop though

2334
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:52,160
I guess we've seen most of them. I haven't seen orug in a orug in a while

2335
02:30:52,480 --> 02:30:56,560
Yeah, apparently he was like defeated by someone

2336
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:58,080
on

2337
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:00,080
On big mom's crew

2338
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:05,040
We didn't hear about anything after that. I would I'm just gonna show up during whole cake

2339
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:08,560
Yeah, I would imagine I would imagine that this

2340
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:13,920
Means for kid that like like he'll still be around and he'll probably still like follow luffy

2341
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:19,680
But he's not like his his ambitions as like one of the contender for pirate king are pretty much done

2342
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:22,560
Like bonnie. Yeah

2343
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:24,880
Unfortunate. Yeah

2344
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:29,440
I wonder I feel I don't think he's gonna suck it up and like be

2345
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:32,960
Part of someone else's grand fleet though that that's sort of

2346
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:40,240
Doesn't seem like he would accept that it doesn't seem like it, but I don't know. I mean what else what else can you do at this point?

2347
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:47,920
I mean, I think he will just refuse. He was completely defeated by kaito and he was imprisoned

2348
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:51,920
Yeah, until he got out and you know, yeah

2349
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:56,320
They they got back together. They got the back gang back together and these tried again

2350
02:31:56,720 --> 02:31:58,720
I think then shanks killed him

2351
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:03,920
He's been killed by every he's been he's been owned by every uh yonko that he's met

2352
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:06,320
Well, no, I maybe not big mom

2353
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,080
I don't think he's met big mom

2354
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:13,040
Right. Oh, no, no, he made the he made the big gun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he's not big mom

2355
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:16,000
So he's one for two. He's one for three, which is like

2356
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:20,320
I mean he's met luffy

2357
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:22,960
Luffy's and luffy's technically one

2358
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:28,400
We call him one. He hasn't fought luffy since he was called one though, but I mean, I guess you're right

2359
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:31,920
Yeah, they were allies. Yeah, so he hasn't had a battle

2360
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:34,960
Okay, um

2361
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Uh, yeah

2362
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:40,240
I mean lots lots to

2363
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:43,920
Take from this chapter kid is I liked it kid isn't kid isn't rough

2364
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:48,480
I mean, he would need he would need a new ship for him to get back on his feet. He would need a new a new ship

2365
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:51,280
Uh, yes, where's he gonna get that?

2366
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:55,520
Wait, why doesn't he just make himself a ship out of freaking magnet metal?

2367
02:32:58,080 --> 02:32:59,680
Duh, I guess why not?

2368
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:04,000
Yeah, maybe it's uh, no, it would be buoyant. It would work. He could do it

2369
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:10,560
Maybe it'll just take a lot of his concentration to do that. Yeah, and if he loses his concentration just falls apart

2370
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:12,960
I mean, he's just owned

2371
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:14,960
Uh

2372
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:19,040
Well then now there's a guy now, there's a guy who can get around

2373
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:24,720
If he needs to ship or no ship all he needs is some scrap

2374
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:27,680
Uh

2375
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:31,360
Exciting chapter good stuff. Um, yeah

2376
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,240
This this the egghead incident

2377
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:40,160
God, yeah, you're right blackbeard garp those guys. I think you're right. Those guys are definitely

2378
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:42,560
Coming

2379
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:47,840
We didn't like if we didn't we didn't there was no indication before this that blackbeard was on his way, right?

2380
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:51,200
He was like doing something else now to see him here is like

2381
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:53,760
Oh, I think it's

2382
02:33:53,840 --> 02:34:01,200
It's because we we saw blackbeard recently and now we see shanks. I'm like, I'm I'm thinking I'm thinking law's fate is the same

2383
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:03,280
Just by this one panel

2384
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:07,200
Is this the implication and that's cool. I think that's pretty cool

2385
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:09,440
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

2386
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:16,080
I I mean, I feel like the fact and putting in shanks are gonna meet if if if this goes if this gets like extended

2387
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:22,240
It's like a big thing. Oda loves law. I don't think that he's gonna have law. Just get get defeated off-screen

2388
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:28,560
No, he wouldn't be defeated off-screen. I don't even think kid is gonna be defeated off-screen, but like

2389
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:33,360
Like kid kid was just forever going kid was just defeated on screen

2390
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:37,120
No, yeah, that's what what I mean is like he's not gonna be out of the story completely

2391
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:42,800
Um, because he's I mean, I mean, no, no, he's a fighter, you know, I'm like Hawkins

2392
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:47,120
We'll definitely continue to see kid and we'll definitely yeah Hawkins is a little weasel

2393
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:52,160
Um, uh, we'll definitely continue to see kid and we'll definitely see law again

2394
02:34:52,240 --> 02:34:58,720
But I don't think he's gonna show up and be like, uh, yeah, uh, I lost my lost my my crew lost my ship

2395
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:01,040
I'm just your assistant now

2396
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:03,040
Uh

2397
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:08,960
He he's not he's not gonna lose in a major way off-screen just because Oda just

2398
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:15,280
Like likes him too much, you know, it'll be funny was that and I don't expect it

2399
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:18,160
But what if he ends up on buggy's crew?

2400
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:27,520
Along with me hawk and uh me hawk wait wait no that would be like the perfect fate for like kid and law

2401
02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:29,920
and like yeah

2402
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:34,880
Just anyone anyone super strong people and then buggy is like, oh my god, they could kill me in one second

2403
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:36,560
Yeah

2404
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:44,640
Actually, you know what I I said, what's the alternative? Yeah kid joining buggy's crew is like I could I could actually see that happening

2405
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,440
um

2406
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:50,400
You might be cut it might be like people like me hawk

2407
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:56,160
People like me hawk and you know what and crocodile now that i'm thinking about it

2408
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,400
buggy

2409
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:00,400
might be like a formidable like

2410
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:06,720
Like um penultimate boss for the straw hats. Oh, definitely

2411
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:12,960
Like like especially since me hawk is there for zoro. That's his ultimate fight

2412
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:19,120
I could I could maybe and the thing the thing that's going to be so cool is that like

2413
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:25,680
Buggy has a rapport with Luffy. They could talk in some somewhat equal standing

2414
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:27,120
um

2415
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:30,640
In the in the fact that they have history and then all of like buggy's crew will be like

2416
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:36,320
This guy this guy can talk on equal standing with Luffy the the like the conqueror

2417
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:41,760
Yeah, this this this like super powerful yonko. I mean look buggy's got

2418
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:44,240
credentials he was on

2419
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:46,240
He's been to raftel

2420
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:52,000
He this guy is like a freaking. I know it's it's funny that he's so pathetic. Yeah, this is an accomplished sea

2421
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:54,560
This is an accomplished seaman we're talking about here

2422
02:36:55,360 --> 02:36:57,360
It's always going to be so funny

2423
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:00,080
Like the fact that he has that clout and he's

2424
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:08,400
He was at the beginning of stupid clown at the beginning of the manga just fucking around blowing up buildings in small villages

2425
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:14,080
Yeah, yeah doing doing real like petty real like petty pirate shit

2426
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:16,880
um

2427
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:18,880
Yeah, so um

2428
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,120
Howard maxing I could I could Howard maxing I could almost see

2429
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:28,560
I could almost foresee like a situation where buggy is like the true actual

2430
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:32,800
Like final threat like the buggy crew is like actually and

2431
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:36,640
Becoming I don't know like even like a bunch of people who are like, oh

2432
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:42,400
We got to kill straw hat and then it's like it's kid. It's it's law. It's me hawk

2433
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:48,640
It's crocodile me hawk was defeated by the straw hats, but like they all have a reason to like fight them

2434
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:51,680
So be like, hmm

2435
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:59,840
Yeah, I'll do that buggy. I agree with this war. Let's go to war with the straw hat pirates. Yeah. Yeah, and uh

2436
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:04,240
Blackbeard joins the straw the buggy crew

2437
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:14,160
Blackbeard's too big for that I think yeah, like I mean blackbeard's too big. He's too. He's he's too big for that

2438
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:17,680
But blackbeard is like the expected final boss

2439
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:24,800
Yeah, in terms of like an an enemy pirate shanks is probably gonna be stronger to fight

2440
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:27,360
But I I've always I've said this before

2441
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:32,320
Then blackbeard, but I think I've said this before I don't know if I've said it on the pcp

2442
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:34,640
I've said on the pod decast I think

2443
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:36,560
um

2444
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:38,400
Maybe not the ultimate fight

2445
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:40,400
But the ultimate competition

2446
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:46,160
And not not the ultimate anything but like one of the major things that will happen between the straw hats

2447
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:52,080
And the red hair pirates is not going to be a combat. It is going to be a davie back fight

2448
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:55,920
It is going to be a davie back fight. Oh, just like with foxy

2449
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:59,280
Yeah, because that is a traditional pirate

2450
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:04,960
Um competition it would be cool to see the davie back fight come back. That'd be interesting

2451
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:09,600
What did that entail? It was like it was the thing where you have to like wager your crewmates against each other

2452
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:12,960
You wager your crewmates against each other. You can wager your flag

2453
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:14,720
And

2454
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:21,040
I don't know. I feel like like the the the the like the gentlemanly pirate, um

2455
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:27,520
Like that's great. I I hope that's true. I hope that happens. Oh my god. That would be a better trade

2456
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:32,880
They should trade just like seeing who could kill each other. Trade jinbei for yassof so usopp can be with stat again

2457
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:41,040
Finally what would happen what would happen if shanks won like the first three and he takes

2458
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:44,880
Like I don't know. I mean that happened with foxy. Yeah

2459
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:48,640
I don't it shouldn't be exactly the same as foxy

2460
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:53,920
But I just like the idea of that being like a thing rather than seeing who can beat the shit out of the air

2461
02:39:53,920 --> 02:40:00,160
I'm sorry, but they should trade. They got a they got a trade jinbei trade jinbei for for beck beck beckman be like

2462
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:04,800
Hey beckman, what's your deal? You always got that like gun over your shoulder like tell us about that

2463
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:08,320
Yeah by jinn

2464
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:13,360
Yeah, well, that's not the thing that they can I think they if you lose the game

2465
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:17,840
The other person can take something. It's not like you'd make a trade. No. Yeah, you're right

2466
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:23,760
I mean you could you could potentially wind up in a draw that just ends up you can wage your stuff. Yeah

2467
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:26,720
You can say okay, um

2468
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:30,000
I mean it's like it's like it's like best if I can take these two

2469
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:35,920
Isn't it like best out of three and that's why like they lost they lost a bunch and then they gained some back and stuff

2470
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:40,400
Yeah, and then the foxy agreed to like a big final thing

2471
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:43,040
And then Luffy won and he took

2472
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:45,520
foxy's flag

2473
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:47,920
And he gave him a shit flag

2474
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:50,240
Right

2475
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:51,760
uh

2476
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:56,960
What if shanks steals the straw hats flag? That's probably what shanks would do. It's like i'm taking your flag

2477
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:01,520
How you can no longer use this how could you

2478
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:07,680
How freaking could you it's and Luffy would cry harder than if he was dead

2479
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:15,280
Hey, I feel i'm an idiot. Was that hat was that gold rogers hat did shanks get it from gold roger

2480
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:18,320
shanks got it from gold roger and

2481
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:21,120
I think

2482
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:23,120
there's like some sort of

2483
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
connection to joyboy maybe

2484
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:28,240
I mean, do you remember in

2485
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:34,800
The emperor of the world in oh, you mean the guy with the eye in the darkness. Yeah, the guy with the eye

2486
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:37,680
he had that that

2487
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:40,480
mysterious compartment in his throne room area

2488
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:44,000
where he was looking at a picture of uh, the

2489
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:50,240
Of Luffy's wanted poster and he sees in this big room a frozen giant straw hat

2490
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:54,480
And we're like what a frozen giant straw hat

2491
02:41:55,280 --> 02:42:00,160
It looks it looks frozen. It's it's frozen as in it's just in a really cold room and it looks like this snow

2492
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:03,360
There's a giant straw hat. What? Yeah

2493
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:06,160
um

2494
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:09,040
Why would there be a giant straw hat?

2495
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:13,280
Because the straw hat has symbolic significance

2496
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:16,400
um

2497
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:23,840
Because they're built because they're building a duplicate Luffy but 10 times the size and they had to build a giant hat for him

2498
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:28,720
Well, here's what I this is my assumption after that. I think was

2499
02:42:29,440 --> 02:42:34,800
A giant a very significant giant. Maybe the first joy boy or something

2500
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:37,600
um war a straw hat like that

2501
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:39,760
and

2502
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:41,760
um in similar in the way the ace

2503
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:44,560
made a hat

2504
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:46,560
made a little

2505
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:49,440
He made a he made a big hat for a giant

2506
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:53,440
He made a wano hat for for oras

2507
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:57,680
Who did um or oras jr. I think who made these hats?

2508
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:01,200
ace um

2509
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:05,600
Monkey de ace wait wait. Oh no gold de ace wait

2510
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:08,320
Ace made hats

2511
02:43:08,320 --> 02:43:13,120
He made a little hat. Um, it was it was uh for oras jr. You remember

2512
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:21,760
Oras from thriller bark sure oras jr. Was friends with ace and ace had gone to wano and learned how to make these hats

2513
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,920
And made one for oras jr. So he could keep the rain off him and oras jr

2514
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:32,240
Was the big giant that came to save him at the execution and he held open like a gate or something

2515
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:36,480
And he was probably killed

2516
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:38,400
He's very sad

2517
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:42,800
So the so the art of making these straw hats is like a wano thing

2518
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:48,000
No, the straw the hat that was made is like a traditional like cone shape

2519
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:52,400
Oh, okay. Okay. What i'm thinking is that in a in similar to that

2520
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:55,600
gold roger or

2521
02:43:56,560 --> 02:43:59,120
I don't know whoever made the straw hat in the first place

2522
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,480
Made that straw hat in a similar way

2523
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:08,720
To another person who had a similar hat. It was sort of like a hat lineage sort of reference. Yeah, sure

2524
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:13,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like a hat lineage, you know, like like it's a

2525
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:17,120
It's one of those one of those had lineage situations

2526
02:44:17,440 --> 02:44:24,800
Like gold roger had a big friend called big giant joy boy the giant and like he had he wore a straw hat

2527
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:28,080
Gold roger was like, oh, I'll make a hat like that. That's cool

2528
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:31,360
And then he gave it to shanks and then shanks gave it to luffy and then

2529
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:36,560
Ian was like, wait a minute. This straw hat on this boy looks just like this giant straw hat

2530
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:42,000
I have in my throne room secret entrance special room with snow inside and he said, wait a minute

2531
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:44,320
Wait a minute. What does the D stand for?

2532
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:47,440
D's nuts

2533
02:44:47,440 --> 02:44:49,440
D's D's hats

2534
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:51,440
D's hats

2535
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:57,040
Um, okay. Yeah, totally forgot about the giant straw hat. That's uh, yeah, okay

2536
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:00,880
Okay, okay. So there was a yeah

2537
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:05,280
Marishwa's straw hat a straw hat is kept in a freezing room in marishwa

2538
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:08,080
It is very large rivaling the size of him

2539
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:12,800
The person the guy wait have we have we seen like how big he is?

2540
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:15,040
I thought we just saw like his eye from the darkness

2541
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:18,560
No, I think in the in the chapter you can see him walking around

2542
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:22,480
You don't see his face. You see him in like far away

2543
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:28,640
You see him his hand holding the the wanted poster and you see a shadowy face eye thing

2544
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:34,480
So we can presume that he's like a normal ish and he's got like a big

2545
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:39,760
Hat oh, he's got like this is oh, yeah, he's got the big like fucking Dark Souls crown

2546
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:42,720
Yeah, right

2547
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:45,920
straw hat

2548
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:48,320
Duh

2549
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:52,960
There's so much like what the fuck to that hat, but I think it's some some simple thing like

2550
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:57,440
Roger liked a guy who had a hat like that and in reference to him

2551
02:45:58,160 --> 02:46:03,680
He made an epic reference by making a similar hat or like bought a hat that looked like it

2552
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:08,480
Because he was a big fan. He's like a big nerd and it's like hey, hey, that looks comfortable

2553
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:12,480
That looks like it would keep the sun off me. Yeah, cool

2554
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:19,280
Yeah, I can't imagine that there's like special powers related to it. It's just a hat

2555
02:46:19,440 --> 02:46:22,480
But it's it's probably it's probably special

2556
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:26,320
in the way that it's personally special to gold roger

2557
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:35,120
And that's why it started as a gift that he would give to shanks his special boy and shanks gave it to his special boy

2558
02:46:36,480 --> 02:46:37,680
Who

2559
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:39,680
Who is him?

2560
02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:46,240
Um, as far as we know, he's the ultimate authority and power of the marines and the world government

2561
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:49,440
World government specifically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but like but like who is he?

2562
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:53,680
Um, what's what's what's his freaking deal?

2563
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:59,120
He's like some sort of an emperor king a guy who likes power. Yeah, but like yeah, but like

2564
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,760
But like he was elected. Hey, he was elected officially

2565
02:47:04,400 --> 02:47:06,560
We've counted the votes twice right

2566
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:08,800
He is

2567
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:10,160
Our guy

2568
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:12,160
Look look at this

2569
02:47:12,800 --> 02:47:19,520
He received the pity vote he cornered the corner the pity vote was elected the lord of ghosts. Look at look at his arm

2570
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:25,280
Like look at where his arm is positioned relative to his body

2571
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:29,040
Either his head is

2572
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:30,880
like

2573
02:47:30,880 --> 02:47:33,360
The crown is the top of his head or

2574
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:37,840
His head is very weird shape. Yeah, he's got very very long arms

2575
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:42,320
I think the idea is he's got very long arms

2576
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:50,000
I mean, they're long, but it's like he has really long like upper arms, but his forearms like like his

2577
02:47:52,240 --> 02:47:53,920
I don't know

2578
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:57,600
I can't really tell like how much of this is head and how much his body

2579
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:04,160
Maybe it's he maybe he's really ugly. Maybe he's a real freak. I mean like that giant thing is not his shoulders

2580
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:09,840
That's the top of his head and that's like hair these proportions. That's his hairdo these proportions

2581
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:15,280
I don't know. I just it looks like he might be some kind of freaking freak

2582
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:19,040
Uh, okay. Here's how they you can sort of see his

2583
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:22,960
So his head is kind of his eyes are kind of up near the top

2584
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:30,400
Of the the lump it's the lump there. Wow, I don't even know

2585
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:34,240
It's a real funny guy. What's going on with this

2586
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:36,720
person

2587
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:39,360
I I cannot wait to see them

2588
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:44,640
I can't wait for him to be very funny looking

2589
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,880
What was um the five elders?

One of them is being involved directly. Yeah. Well, did we learn about them?

2599
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:35,280
I mean, we knew about them before fishman island, right? We knew about them a long time. Yeah, the this is like

2600
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:38,240
Pre any's lobby, I think

2601
02:49:38,560 --> 02:49:43,600
Yeah, seeing them standing around with their really long legs just in silhouette. Yeah

2602
02:49:45,280 --> 02:49:47,280
Uh, oh man

2603
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:51,200
The egghead incident

2604
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,600
It's freaking gonna be big

2605
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:56,240
I gotta pee again

2606
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:00,080

The the worst pre cb memories. I don't want to think about

2615
02:50:36,320 --> 02:50:41,120
Yeah, I I can I complain about I complain about pcp memories all the time

2616
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:47,440
On my stream and elsewhere. So, you know, whatever it's but well trodden ground

2617
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:51,280
I honestly my best pcb memories are like

2618
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:58,640
Like well when when we're hanging out together at a ride con

2619
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:05,120
And I don't know if there's anything specific we're doing is usually in between content that is the most fun

2620
02:51:08,320 --> 02:51:11,360
And and and like arriving at the airport and everyone going ah

2621
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:14,560
Pug that that those are fun. Those are fun moments

2622
02:51:15,360 --> 02:51:18,560
Yeah, that was all that was always pretty good. Um

2623
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:27,280
Trying to think if there's one I mean it's hard to say I think just one, uh, I mean I liked the the fucking

2624
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:30,640
uh

2625
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:35,920
Going around radcon three house and doing like the gopro stuff

2626
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:44,320
That was really that was fun, but it was also really it was stressful. It was a little stressful. I guess I found I found

2627
02:51:44,800 --> 02:51:51,360
Radcon arena quite stressful. I found radcon four more stressful and I did really and it shows because I did really badly at it

2628
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:59,040
Yeah, did you you did the task at stroll lecture during I mean, I oh no, I mean specifically the like the shooting. Oh, oh

2629
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:01,760

02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:04,240
the shooting, I mean

2631
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:06,720
Yeah, I don't remember

2632
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:09,200
Did very poorly at that. I don't remember thinking

2633
02:52:10,480 --> 02:52:11,760

02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:14,720

No, I was I was trying to win, but I was not good

The first episodes are on one of the channels and the like later episodes are on the other channels and I don't remember which is which

2652
02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:21,120
Uh

2653
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:26,240
Yeah mad bull is mad bull was really fun. Really hype. We all got fucking we all lost our minds

2654
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:27,840
Oh

2655
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:30,640
Okay, genuinely watching the the the rumbles

2656
02:53:32,080 --> 02:53:37,440
I think the one that the one that brunswick won was like I was out of my fucking mind for that one

2657
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:42,160
Uh that oh, that's that's a contender for like hypers

2658
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:46,320
Most fun like single events in mpcp history

2659
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:53,120
That one might be it. I also I have very fond memories of the ape escape. Let's play where me and jesse

2660
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:56,400
Beat ape escape one late at night. Yeah

2661
02:53:58,080 --> 02:53:59,440
Yeah, that was fun

2662
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:03,840
I think everyone was there. I think is that's is that still up on the channel?

2663
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:08,960
I think a lot of people have asked about that. That's still up. Isn't it?

2664
02:54:10,320 --> 02:54:12,320
I mean, I hope so

2665
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:17,120
I'm pretty sure it's been downloaded because if it went and it did it definitely came back

2666
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:19,760
A bunch of people

2667
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:23,120
um, have yeah a bunch of people have mentioned that to me like a lot of

2668
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:32,800
Old pcb heads seem to like that's their favorite stream. Yeah six years ago four hours 43. This is the the radcon radcon 2

2669
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:37,120
Yeah, I think radcon 2 is my favorite radcon all things considered

2670
02:54:38,240 --> 02:54:40,480
um

2671
02:54:40,480 --> 02:54:42,160
Yeah

2672
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:47,360
It was there were the expectations were not that high and there was not a lot of like we got to do this

2673
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:49,360
We got to do this. We got to do this

2674
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:51,920
We were all just kind of hanging out

2675
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:54,240
I mean, I guess I guess plebe and weeb was filming

2676
02:54:55,120 --> 02:54:57,600
At the time but like I was not really like

2677
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:02,320
I was only occasionally was I actually doing stuff

2678
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:04,880
with it

2679
02:55:04,880 --> 02:55:07,040
That was most I mean it was mostly like vik that was like

2680
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:12,240
Uh, like I mean those are like do the setup and stuff

2681
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:15,600
um

2682
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:22,880
It was but like they would be filming episodes in the in the the not the garage the the the weapon room or whatever

2683
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:29,760
And meanwhile the rest of us would just be yeah hanging out and streaming or what making a making a rumble characters in the living room

2684
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:32,240
And that was a lot of fun

2685
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:34,640
Oh

2686
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:36,240
maybe

2687
02:55:36,240 --> 02:55:41,520
You know, it's hard to to say a favorite radcon actually. I think radcon 3 had more

2688
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:44,480
enjoyable downtime moments

2689
02:55:45,360 --> 02:55:49,200
It did have a lot of that radcon 4 did not have a really nice environment

2690
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:53,920
To it. Yeah, I agree. I agree. We did that was that was added a lot

2691
02:55:54,480 --> 02:55:56,480
Just hanging out in the snow sometimes

2692
02:55:56,960 --> 02:55:58,480
It's it's hard

2693
02:55:58,480 --> 02:56:02,640
Wait in the snow. Oh, yeah. Yeah in in Sharon mass, right? It was snowy

2694
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:05,200
Yeah, two and three were both really fun

2695
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:08,880
Four was four was fun

2696
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:10,960
But there was a lot more stress

2697
02:56:12,320 --> 02:56:14,320
Um, yeah, it's hard to pick

2698
02:56:16,320 --> 02:56:18,320
Two I think two was

2699
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:20,640
Oh, I was like

2700
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:23,040
I like had to arrive late and like leave early

2701
02:56:23,680 --> 02:56:30,960
Oh, yeah, honestly. I mean, I mean my like life at the time was pretty shit. So like radcon 3 was like a like

2702
02:56:32,400 --> 02:56:34,400
Beautiful respite from all that

2703
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:38,400
Uh, uh, so that was nice

2704
02:56:39,040 --> 02:56:45,440
But also it comes at a time in my life that I was kind of like under I was I was not I was not feeling super good. So my

2705
02:56:47,360 --> 02:56:49,360
You know, I wasn't as happy

2706
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:52,640
Uh, I was very carefree at radcon 2

2707
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:57,040
Yeah

2708
02:56:58,320 --> 02:57:00,320
Yeah

2709
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:03,360
I'm gonna I'm gonna say my favorite memory is the the brunswick

2710
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:06,400
Brunswick wins the rumble

2711
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:15,200
Okay, okay. Well, we spent a long time on that one. Uh, next one is called. Oh, it's a it's a vocary link

2712
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:19,040
Let's go

2713
02:57:19,280 --> 02:57:25,600
Guys, I did it. I finally did it. Oh my god. I had finally had sex

2714
02:57:26,320 --> 02:57:29,600
With a real real woman a consent woman

2715
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:32,320
a sane woman

2716
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:34,720
I did it

2717
02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:38,240
Ha ha ha just kidding

2718
02:57:40,080 --> 02:57:42,080
You should have seen you good one

2719
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:45,600
You got us. Why would our faces have moved that much?

2720
02:57:47,280 --> 02:57:50,000
You didn't see our faces. This is an audio only

2721
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:55,440
You should have seen the little face on the gravestone light up. Does it still do that? I don't think it does that anymore

2722
02:57:55,840 --> 02:57:57,840
no

2723
02:57:57,840 --> 02:57:59,840
Uh

2724
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:05,600
Hey, good good joke. Okay next one is called

2725
02:58:06,960 --> 02:58:10,640
Um, well, it's like yes, and then there's an image

2726
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:14,720
No, and then there's a frowny face

2727
02:58:16,240 --> 02:58:18,240
So this is the yes

2728
02:58:22,640 --> 02:58:25,520
And it's a fat cat it's a squishy cat

2729
02:58:26,400 --> 02:58:28,400
That's a nice that's a nice little cat

2730
02:58:28,960 --> 02:58:30,320
I mean, I

2731
02:58:30,320 --> 02:58:32,320
Yeah, it's fine

2732
02:58:33,680 --> 02:58:35,920
I mean cats don't need to do much to be pretty good

2733
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:38,720
Yeah, I sure

2734
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:40,400
I mean, I just

2735
02:58:40,400 --> 02:58:45,760
Was this really worth making a voicemail about? I mean, it's pretty normal. It's pretty normal cat video. I don't know

2736
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:48,080

02:59:08,480 --> 02:59:10,480
Thanks

2742
02:59:12,800 --> 02:59:17,200
Next one is called Nate edits one frame per day question mark, uh

2743
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:20,080
three two one go

2744
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:23,040
I I just

2745
02:59:23,360 --> 02:59:30,800
Why the fuck did you two release the paradise? Oh, like why did you participate in the paradise?

2746
02:59:31,680 --> 02:59:33,680
Right, like I don't did you

2747
02:59:34,320 --> 02:59:36,320
Was it ever supposed to be good?

2748
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:39,040
Why is it coming out now?

2749
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:40,400
Like I don't

2750
02:59:40,400 --> 02:59:46,960
Because people pay for it in this video. It's a fucking virulent poison. It's like a like a curse

2751
02:59:46,960 --> 02:59:56,240
That's that's just a fine wine aspect. All right. I mean, why is it coming out now is because it wasn't done until now

2752
02:59:56,880 --> 03:00:00,800
Uh, I mean if the choice, I mean, are you suggesting that we should not have released it?

2753
03:00:00,800 --> 03:00:07,040
Like we can't do that like we had to release it because we said in the people pay for it and some people are happy

2754
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:12,240
So, you know, and that means it was worth their money. Even if you know

2755
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:18,400
I mean, I get I get be I totally get and I would agree largely like

2756
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:21,920
This took three years to make like I get it

2757
03:00:23,200 --> 03:00:25,600
But like I mean, I'm not embarrassed. I'm not

2758
03:00:26,320 --> 03:00:30,480
It's funny to laugh about how embarrassing is I'm not that embarrassed about it. I think it's kind of a funny video

2759
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:38,400
I don't care that I'm in drag or that I was like doing stupid stuff on the beach or pretending to be a girl that lost my top

2760
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:39,440
In the ocean

2761
03:00:39,440 --> 03:00:44,480
We thought it was stupid and funny at the same time and I still think that

2762
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:51,040
Yeah, yeah at the time filming it. I was like, this is so stupid. Ha ha lull and then watching it again

2763
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:53,120
I'm like, this is so stupid lull

2764
03:00:53,760 --> 03:00:54,960
And it's great

2765
03:00:54,960 --> 03:00:56,960
Yeah, it's fine

2766
03:00:56,960 --> 03:00:58,560
I don't I don't get

2767
03:00:58,560 --> 03:01:03,440
I don't get the I mean, he's like, what's the problem? He's chocolate. He should be giggling

2768
03:01:04,560 --> 03:01:06,560
Because the funny video

2769
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:12,400
Okay, I I saw I just I saw a lot of comments. I saw some comments that were like, why would you release this?

2770
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:15,200
And it's like, why wouldn't I why wouldn't we release it?

2771
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:19,200
Maybe maybe they were asking in a tongue-in-cheek way and just didn't come across

2772
03:01:19,280 --> 03:01:24,560
I think that's mostly what they're saying. This is like, this is so cringe. How could you live with yourself?

2773
03:01:25,120 --> 03:01:27,760
How do you sleep at night? Yeah, that's one of the funny things easily

2774
03:01:28,960 --> 03:01:30,960
Simplest simplest thing in the world

2775
03:01:31,200 --> 03:01:34,720
On top of uh, how much was it? $15,000

2776
03:01:35,440 --> 03:01:39,120
$30, $35, $34,000? Wow

2777
03:01:41,200 --> 03:01:43,200
Yeah, uh

2778
03:01:44,640 --> 03:01:48,800
We used we used most of it. Well, we used like more than half of it. I think

2779
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:56,960
Um, next one is called, uh, oh, well, there's voicemail. So let's listen to the voicemail three two one go

03:06:55,440 --> 03:06:59,680
He is a cute cat. It's rolling over in the dirt. He's got his belly up

2847
03:07:00,240 --> 03:07:03,840
This one's just rolling around in the freaking gutter. Why does he have a?

2848
03:07:04,320 --> 03:07:06,320
What is this street cat have a rug?

2849
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:08,800
Where'd he get that?

03:07:08,800 --> 03:07:12,400
A rug steal it from ike. Yeah, he's like on a rug. Oh, no, no, that's a curb

2851
03:07:12,800 --> 03:07:16,240
That's the stone. He's rubbing himself on the stone curve. Yeah

2852
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:19,600
It's very funny when cats are

2853
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:21,600
Dirty little bastards

03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:24,800
That's that's this guy. He's filthy. Oh, he's getting

03:07:25,440 --> 03:07:27,440

03:07:28,640 --> 03:07:36,480
All right. Yeah, cool. I guess uh, next one is called an uplifting story. Oh, it's a chat gbt story

2857
03:07:37,280 --> 03:07:39,280
starring ben saint

2858
03:07:40,080 --> 03:07:42,080
All right, I guess I'll read it

2859
03:07:42,720 --> 03:07:44,160
um

2860
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:46,160
Ben saint had always been a bit of a loner

2861
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:51,520
He spent most of his time browsing the internet arguing with strangers about politics and vaping lots of vaping

2862
03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:54,080
It was his escape from the mundane reality of his life

2863
03:07:54,480 --> 03:07:59,600
But the more he spent time he spent on the internet the more he fell into a spiral of self destructive behavior

2864
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:04,400
The arguments would escalate quickly. He would lash out with insults and threats losing his sense of reason

2865
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:08,800
The cycle would repeat itself over and over leaving him feeling more and more depressed

2866
03:08:09,360 --> 03:08:13,120
One day as ben was browsing a forum. He stumbled onto a post that caught his attention

2867
03:08:13,440 --> 03:08:18,080
It was from a user named magical gnome 43 who claimed to have the ability to grant wishes

2868
03:08:18,240 --> 03:08:22,080
Ben rolled his eyes at the obvious troll but something made him click on the profile anyway

2869
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:26,240
To his surprise the user had left a message to him specifically ben saint

2870
03:08:26,320 --> 03:08:32,480
It read I see or in need of some magic meet me in the park tomorrow at noon and I'll show you what I can do

2871
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:36,400
Ben dismissed it as a prank, but he couldn't help feeling curious the next day

2872
03:08:36,400 --> 03:08:41,600
He found himself in the park at noon looking around for any signs of a mysterious user suddenly he heard a voice

2873
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,480
Hey there, buddy. You must be ben, right?

2874
03:08:44,880 --> 03:08:48,800
Then turned around to see a gnome with the face of george w bush smiling up at him

2875
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:51,760
Who are you ben asked trying to keep his cool?

2876
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:56,160
I'm magical gnome 43 of course and I'm here to make our wishes come true

2877
03:08:56,160 --> 03:09:01,280
But first let's play a game of jenga ben was taken aback. This was not what he was expecting

2878
03:09:01,840 --> 03:09:03,200
But he decided to go along with it

2879
03:09:03,200 --> 03:09:08,880
They set up the tower and began playing ben was doing well carefully selecting each block and placing it on top of the tower

2880
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:11,280
Just as he was about to make the final move and win the game

2881
03:09:11,280 --> 03:09:15,520
The gnome pulled out a remote control toy plane and flew it straight into the tower knocking it down

2882
03:09:15,920 --> 03:09:17,920
ben couldn't believe what he was seeing

2883
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:22,880
Hey, you cheated he yelled at the gnome cheated nonsense the gnome replied grinning

2884
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:28,240
I just used a little bit of magic and now I've shown you that sometimes things don't go as planned

2885
03:09:28,480 --> 03:09:32,640
But that doesn't mean you should give up keep playing the game and one day you'll win

2886
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:36,000
Ben was confused, but he couldn't deny that the gnome had made a point

2887
03:09:36,240 --> 03:09:40,000
Maybe he was too focused on winning the argument and not focused enough on the process

2888
03:09:40,320 --> 03:09:43,040
Maybe he needed to take a step back and try a different approach

2889
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:48,080
As the gnome disappeared into thin air ben realized he felt a sense of hope that he hadn't felt in a long time

2890
03:09:48,400 --> 03:09:51,600
He was still struggling with his bad habits, but he was willing to try something new

2891
03:09:51,840 --> 03:09:55,920
And who knows maybe there really was a bit of magic in the world after all

2892
03:09:56,640 --> 03:09:58,640
Wow

2893
03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:01,680
I really learned a lot. Gnomes don't exist

2894
03:10:02,240 --> 03:10:08,880
I really learned a lot too bad too bad toy planes and jenga are the only big mints of my imagination

2895
03:10:10,320 --> 03:10:12,320
Uh

2896
03:10:12,560 --> 03:10:14,560
He's just used a little bit

2897
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:19,280
I like the idea that he's magic example is

2898
03:10:20,320 --> 03:10:23,120
Be flying a toy plane into my jenga tower

2899
03:10:25,120 --> 03:10:27,360
He's not magic you could have just had that

2900
03:10:28,640 --> 03:10:31,680
I just you some and I said you see you see ben

2901
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:36,960
This is the sign that you always just got to keep trying and never give up and one day you'll get one day

2902
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:42,800
You won't get a little toy plane smashing your jenga one day one day it'll pay off and I said hey, yeah

2903
03:10:43,200 --> 03:10:45,440
That's true. Actually that isn't that me

2904
03:10:46,880 --> 03:10:51,120
I feel feel a lot better about I like the idea as well that

2905
03:10:54,080 --> 03:10:56,080
It's it's like chat gbt is like

2906
03:10:56,880 --> 03:10:58,720
I don't know what the prompt was

2907
03:10:58,720 --> 03:11:01,200
But it's like trying to tell an uplifting story

2908
03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:07,040
About how you should not be on twitter so much and it thought I know what this needs a gnome

2909
03:11:08,240 --> 03:11:12,000
It needs a little gnome. I didn't meet the looks I didn't mean I met the gnome on a forum

2910
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
I met the gnome on a forum

2911
03:11:14,080 --> 03:11:16,080
What forum am I browsing?

2912
03:11:19,440 --> 03:11:22,960
I was thought it was like is it george w bush because bush did 9 11

2913
03:11:23,040 --> 03:11:26,320
So he made the plane fly into the tower like is that is that

2914
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:29,200
Is that what it's going for?

2915
03:11:29,520 --> 03:11:33,360
Hey, you cheated cheated nonsense. I was just doing a 9 11

2916
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:38,800
Nonsense. I was just uh getting us embroiled in a never-ending war in the middle east

2917
03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:41,600
Uh, you sly devil

2918
03:11:42,560 --> 03:11:44,560
And I learned nothing

2919
03:11:44,880 --> 03:11:46,800
I I

2920
03:11:46,800 --> 03:11:55,440
Good thanks for the tail. Uh, did I mention did I talk about how when chat gbt told me about munchy minutes it described

2921
03:11:56,400 --> 03:12:02,080
The the thing about kyle and the other guy like how they had to do the fusion dance to merge into the monster

2922
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:06,240
Yeah, and then it gets like oh, yeah, yeah, so then they had to fight against the monster

2923
03:12:06,560 --> 03:12:09,920
It's like what are you what like it has no idea what it's talking about

2924
03:12:10,640 --> 03:12:11,520
um

2925
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:14,480
Next one is called ben's stream chat

2926
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:17,520
Uh three two one go

2927
03:12:18,080 --> 03:12:21,680
Hey ben when are you gonna do face cam also wears munchy

2928
03:12:22,480 --> 03:12:27,120
Speaking of munchy, why aren't there any new pcp episodes on spotify?

2929
03:12:27,920 --> 03:12:31,920
By the way, you should play one step from edith. Have you heard of it?

2930
03:12:32,720 --> 03:12:34,720
It's almost as good as this other game

2931
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:38,080
Rainworld check it out if you like battle network

2932
03:12:38,560 --> 03:12:42,800
Anyway, while then you're a vtuber now change sides. I guess

2933
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:45,600
lol

2934
03:12:46,640 --> 03:12:49,920
It really do be like that sometimes um

2935
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:52,320
It's like seeing ghosts

2936
03:12:52,960 --> 03:12:56,240
If they're they followed me they followed me over from twitch

2937
03:12:57,280 --> 03:12:58,640
uh

2938
03:12:58,640 --> 03:13:02,640
Just true next one is called the blu-ray question

2939
03:13:03,120 --> 03:13:08,400
Uh, wait a sec. Did I download that one? No, I didn't I got download that one next one is called the blu-ray question from

2940
03:13:08,960 --> 03:13:11,920
At yes.com three two one go

2941
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:15,680
If you ask me

2942
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:17,760
No one ever does

2943
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:21,360
My only problem with the manifesto

2944
03:13:22,480 --> 03:13:24,480
That it doesn't go far enough

2945
03:13:25,840 --> 03:13:27,200
I think

2946
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:29,200
If you really want to right the wrongs

2947
03:13:29,840 --> 03:13:31,840
of Trixie

2948
03:13:31,840 --> 03:13:33,840
Save the pcp brand

2949
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:37,200
You need to record season two

2950
03:13:38,800 --> 03:13:44,800
We got to make season two of pleave and the weave it was promised after all god give you up for it

2951
03:13:45,360 --> 03:13:47,360
Was that even a tail?

2952
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,400
What was what was the pleave and the weave even about?

2953
03:13:51,440 --> 03:13:54,400
Also, no, I don't want to do that. Also. No

2954
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:56,640
um

2955
03:13:56,640 --> 03:13:58,640
I mean if it was like watching a

2956
03:13:59,280 --> 03:14:01,280
Like a whole show of an anime

2957
03:14:01,680 --> 03:14:07,280
It probably was I think they watched the first like four episodes. I remember watching the kaon movie when on the episode

2958
03:14:07,280 --> 03:14:09,280
I was on but like

2959
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:11,920
Trixie and like Jeff

2960
03:14:12,560 --> 03:14:15,280
And jesse were like watching a lot of stuff

2961
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:21,280
They were cramming. I think it was that they watched the first couple episodes and then for the final fantasy one

2962
03:14:21,280 --> 03:14:23,280
They had to watch like a couple movies

2963
03:14:24,400 --> 03:14:25,840
Um

2964
03:14:25,840 --> 03:14:31,440
Yeah, uh, by the way, this guy's referring to my blu-ray manifesto at stcomics.com slash

2965
03:14:32,320 --> 03:14:34,320
brm.html

2966
03:14:34,800 --> 03:14:37,280
Uh, that's read it. Um

2967
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:41,120
The uh

2968
03:14:41,600 --> 03:14:46,880
You know, they tried to um, I don't remember if who told me it was Trixie or jesse or who but they said that like

2969
03:14:48,400 --> 03:14:50,400
I think after rad con three

2970
03:14:50,880 --> 03:14:57,120
They like like jesse like stayed with Trixie for a while and they like tried to film rad con uh

2971
03:14:57,680 --> 03:14:59,360
pleave and weave season two

2972
03:14:59,360 --> 03:15:05,360
But they just like gave up and like threw the footage out that they had like recorded. Yeah, I guess they I guess they didn't like it

2973
03:15:05,440 --> 03:15:08,480
I remember Trixie saying something like it wasn't very good or

2974
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:13,360
And then did Trixie go to see jesse and they tried to record more there

2975
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:16,160
I vaguely remember. Oh

2976
03:15:16,240 --> 03:15:18,240
Maybe it was I

2977
03:15:18,400 --> 03:15:22,720
I don't know. I could be misremembering. I thought it was after I thought it was after rad con three

2978
03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:28,080
It would have been it would have been like um when Trixie was doing road trips for the first time

2979
03:15:29,680 --> 03:15:32,880
And then one of them was jesse to do a bunch of pleave and weave

2980
03:15:32,880 --> 03:15:37,840
She did a big loop around the the country and yeah, I think she yeah, maybe it was then actually

2981
03:15:37,840 --> 03:15:40,800
It was before may I guess may was right at the end of all that

2982
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
You mean may the person yes

2983
03:15:44,480 --> 03:15:45,680
No, it was not

2984
03:15:45,680 --> 03:15:51,840
Oh, you mean it was before like the breakup. No, it was before they had met that there was a road trip that led to

2985
03:15:52,800 --> 03:15:57,920
Like one of those stops on that road trip was meeting may the first time you you're totally you're totally you're totally whack

2986
03:15:57,920 --> 03:16:03,920
You're totally whack. You're totally wet. You're wiggity whack right now because may Trixie knew may even when she was living at

2987
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:11,200
Digi house and that and like that was like pre rad con three because remember Trixie wouldn't wouldn't not bring may to rad con three

2988
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:15,360
I know that I'm saying that the when

2989
03:16:16,320 --> 03:16:18,320
Trixie tried to get

2990
03:16:18,560 --> 03:16:23,520
Went to jesse's house to do pleave and weave stuff. I vaguely recall that being like part of that road trip

2991
03:16:24,480 --> 03:16:27,040
as as she recalls it Trixie Trixie was with

2992
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:29,280
May

2993
03:16:29,280 --> 03:16:34,400
Before I moved out of digi house and that road trip was well after

2994
03:16:35,360 --> 03:16:41,440
I had I was gone from there like a digi house wasn't there like a first little road trip and then like other road trips

2995
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:51,920
I don't remember I mean there were I I listened to like uh digi bros and listened to these stories

2996
03:16:53,120 --> 03:16:57,360
And that's about all I know so I mean if that if that were true

2997
03:16:57,760 --> 03:17:01,440
If that were true then that would mean that like oh, well, I guess that would kind of

2998
03:17:02,640 --> 03:17:04,640
So they tried to film it like

2999
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:10,160
Not even that long after like that would have been like pre rad con three. So that would only been like a year

3000
03:17:10,560 --> 03:17:12,560
That would only been like a year after

3001
03:17:13,440 --> 03:17:16,800
pleave and weave was recorded. Yeah, or like maybe a year and a half

3002
03:17:17,600 --> 03:17:21,120
I think there was just it was just wasn't working some reason

3003
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:23,920
I don't know. I can't remember what they said about it

3004
03:17:24,240 --> 03:17:28,400
Wasn't wasn't the last episode of pleave and weave not released until after

3005
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:33,360
Radcon three or like it took like almost a year to to get all made

3006
03:17:33,840 --> 03:17:36,240
Yeah, it took a while for them all to get edited because

3007
03:17:36,880 --> 03:17:40,560
And I mean radcon three was like like only a year involved

3008
03:17:41,120 --> 03:17:45,040
Yeah, and because jesse had like his house flood and stuff that delayed him

3009
03:17:45,360 --> 03:17:49,200
but but like radcon three was only like a year after radcon two so like

3010
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:54,000
Pleave radcon, I mean, I mean pleave and weave he was jesse was editing rad

3011
03:17:54,400 --> 03:17:56,400
pleave and weave like

3012
03:17:56,560 --> 03:18:00,400
The whole time so they couldn't have tried to film season two until like that was well

3013
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:02,960
over

3014
03:18:02,960 --> 03:18:04,960
I think I mean they could have tried

3015
03:18:05,920 --> 03:18:08,960
I think I think that I mean maybe I think the idea was

3016
03:18:09,520 --> 03:18:13,280
Radcon two ended but they still needed to film another season of pleave and weave

3017
03:18:13,280 --> 03:18:17,840
So Trixie drove to jesse's to try and see if they could do that for a bit

3018
03:18:18,560 --> 03:18:20,560
I just I just gotta say I just gotta say

3019
03:18:21,920 --> 03:18:23,920
Uh

3020
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:26,240
I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I want to say that if

3021
03:18:27,600 --> 03:18:29,360
If if Trixie

3022
03:18:29,360 --> 03:18:37,120
Or jesse had been like just more transparent about like the the blu-ray thing and just been like i'm sorry

3023
03:18:37,680 --> 03:18:39,280
We fucked up

3024
03:18:39,280 --> 03:18:44,400
We we we can't make the blu-rays. We we misallocated the budget. We didn't know what we were doing. We we fucked up

3025
03:18:44,400 --> 03:18:49,600
I'm sorry. I probably wouldn't have been that mad about it. I would have been like, okay people make mistakes

3026
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:55,440
What made me upset about it was that they just continued to lie about it and continued to like deflect

3027
03:18:55,680 --> 03:18:59,600
And like pretend that it was still happening when it obviously was not if they had just

3028
03:19:00,560 --> 03:19:02,400
not lied about it

3029
03:19:02,400 --> 03:19:04,400
I would have just let it go. I swear

3030
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:08,720
I mean they could have always in the back of their mind thought we'll get around to it

3031
03:19:09,120 --> 03:19:12,160
But I mean it was just to an extent. I think Trixie probably did

3032
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:15,120
But like she wasn't

3033
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:16,960
Yeah

3034
03:19:16,960 --> 03:19:20,560
She just wasn't it was it wasn't it was not true. It was just not true

3035
03:19:21,440 --> 03:19:26,640
Um, and there were no steps being taken towards her ever doing it and in fact

3036
03:19:27,440 --> 03:19:31,280
Steps in the other direction were being actively taken, but like I said, I don't want to dwell on it

3037
03:19:31,280 --> 03:19:33,120
But they did want to say that

3038
03:19:33,120 --> 03:19:35,520
Yeah, uh next one is another image

3039
03:19:36,480 --> 03:19:40,000
It's better not be another fucking cat. I swear to god. It's a different format

3040
03:19:40,240 --> 03:19:43,920
Wait, is this is it more than one image or is this just an image?

3041
03:19:44,320 --> 03:19:50,400
Okay, me listening to ben and gibb talk about one piece even though I know nothing about it, but it sounds like they're having fun

3042
03:19:50,800 --> 03:19:57,920
Oh, yeah, that's great. Thanks. Thanks for enjoying the rambling. That's that's why we're here man. So you can

3043
03:19:59,120 --> 03:20:01,120
Do this

3044
03:20:01,840 --> 03:20:03,360
Next one

3045
03:20:03,360 --> 03:20:07,360
Is uh another imager if you can believe it

3046
03:20:07,840 --> 03:20:08,960
Um

3047
03:20:08,960 --> 03:20:14,160
NATO, Ukraine. Oh, I saw this one of the great epics of this. Oh this tweet

3048
03:20:14,160 --> 03:20:17,520
We are harry potter and william wallis the navi and han solo

3049
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:22,800
We're escaping from shaw shank and blowing up the death star. We are fighting the harkinans and challenging them

3050
03:20:22,800 --> 03:20:24,800
I'm glad I don't know what the harkinans are

3051
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:26,320
um

3052
03:20:26,320 --> 03:20:32,960
Thanks, thanks for the rocket for the rockets like what what on earth is going on with that whoever

3053
03:20:33,680 --> 03:20:35,200
Made that tweet

3054
03:20:35,200 --> 03:20:36,880
What is wrong with them?

3055
03:20:36,960 --> 03:20:38,240
um

3056
03:20:38,240 --> 03:20:45,520
What on I mean, I get going on I I I understand the urge to like I understand the urge to like

3057
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:49,360
Relate, you know a an ongoing political

3058
03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:55,440
Thing to you know a pop to pop culture. I understand that impulse

3059
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:57,200
but like

3060
03:20:57,200 --> 03:20:58,320
To just

3061
03:20:58,320 --> 03:20:59,760
Yeah, I don't know

3062
03:20:59,760 --> 03:21:04,480
There's a line and there's a line and you've crossed it here. It's it's just so it's like

3063
03:21:05,440 --> 03:21:09,280
When people do this, it's usually pretty cringe, but this doesn't make any sense

3064
03:21:09,760 --> 03:21:16,640
This is like ready player one. It is. It's ready player one. Remember harry potter. Remember braveheart. Remember han solo. Remember shaw shank

3065
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:19,040
I do

3066
03:21:19,200 --> 03:21:22,240
It's just like all your favorite movies and tv shows

3067
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:24,880
But it's war in real life

3068
03:21:25,520 --> 03:21:30,480
The challenge they should have they should have stuck with one thing. They should have just said yeah

3069
03:21:30,800 --> 03:21:35,120
Imagine if Putin was Thanos now. Do you see why we gotta send you know what?

3070
03:21:35,680 --> 03:21:38,480
You know what that's still not that's still bad. I know it's still bad

3071
03:21:38,560 --> 03:21:40,960
But at least it's funny because then you couldn't have like purple

3072
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:43,520
Putin

3073
03:21:43,520 --> 03:21:48,080
They should have just posted a picture of Putin edited to look like Thanos to just give him the fan. Yeah

3074
03:21:48,400 --> 03:21:51,840
Like that. I don't need to read the people can enjoy even when it's bad

3075
03:21:52,480 --> 03:21:53,520
Yeah

3076
03:21:53,520 --> 03:21:55,520
Yeah, they should have just had him

3077
03:21:56,080 --> 03:21:57,600
they should have just have him

3078
03:21:57,600 --> 03:21:59,440
snapping the freaking glove

3079
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:04,160
And uh, the freaking donbas region just turning into into little little turritos

3080
03:22:04,880 --> 03:22:06,880
uh, or whatever

3081
03:22:07,040 --> 03:22:09,040
The liberated

3082
03:22:09,600 --> 03:22:15,440
Thanks for the rockets. Yo, just fucking mentioning han solo. Thanks for all these rockets. It's not even the main guy

3083
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:18,640
He's not even the main guy

3084
03:22:18,640 --> 03:22:20,640
Wait, what do you mean? We are haunts

3085
03:22:21,120 --> 03:22:26,400
Because because solo a solo story was coming out of han solo memory or whatever

3086
03:22:27,120 --> 03:22:34,880
This is so fucking stupid. It doesn't even make sense because han solo is not under attack. Han solo could have

3087
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:42,240
Just left and he decided that he was going to do the right thing and join the conflict. That's that's not the narrative you're trying to

3088
03:22:43,920 --> 03:22:45,920
The idea is that is that uh, uh,

3089
03:22:46,080 --> 03:22:52,880
Ukraine is the underdog being attacked being bullied by this this greater power. Yeah, it should have been they're they're the rebels

3090
03:22:53,200 --> 03:22:54,560
They're the rebels

3091
03:22:54,560 --> 03:23:00,800
Yeah, they're the rebels. They're the the luke sky. Han solo is not a rebel until later. So princess lair

3092
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:04,160
Isn't william wallace a real person?

3093
03:23:05,040 --> 03:23:12,000
Only like an yeah, honestly comparing compare. Yeah comparing it to william wallace the historical figure who people know from brave heart

3094
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:16,320
Is like perfectly reasonable like that's a they should they should have done that. Yeah

3095
03:23:17,360 --> 03:23:18,640
Yeah

3096
03:23:18,640 --> 03:23:23,280
That that's no objection. I know william wallace from the age of empires 2 campaign

3097
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:25,520
We play as the scottish

3098
03:23:27,040 --> 03:23:29,040

03:23:29,840 --> 03:23:36,720

3103
03:23:44,800 --> 03:23:46,400

3104
03:23:46,400 --> 03:23:48,400
Well, we'll get you

3105
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:53,360

About that

3110
03:24:07,840 --> 03:24:09,840
I just saw the ova and

3111
03:24:10,400 --> 03:24:12,400
Okay

3112
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:15,920
I just saw the ova

3113
03:24:19,200 --> 03:24:23,280
Sorry all of these losers look like cute girls. Maybe I could

3114
03:24:24,640 --> 03:24:26,400
That's what I thought

3115
03:24:26,400 --> 03:24:28,400
crossing my arms

3116
03:24:28,400 --> 03:24:30,400
I could look that good in a

3117
03:24:30,640 --> 03:24:34,800
One-piece swimsuit if I wanted to if I was on a podcast

3118
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:39,040
If I was on a podcast people wouldn't even care what I looked like

3119
03:24:42,640 --> 03:24:46,960
Next one is called bge's spicy salts a threat to nate

3120
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:49,040
Oh, no

3121
03:24:49,280 --> 03:24:50,480
Wait, I gotta

3122
03:24:50,480 --> 03:24:55,520
Did I download the last one? Uh, yes, I did. Let's go download this one. Okay, three two one go

3123
03:25:16,960 --> 03:25:18,960
Nails

3124
03:25:30,160 --> 03:25:36,800
Oh tow beans tow beans. Yes, I just got it. I figured it out after maybe maybe a third of the way in

3125
03:25:38,240 --> 03:25:39,840
Because he was talking about

3126
03:25:39,840 --> 03:25:41,280
kittens or something

3127
03:25:41,280 --> 03:25:44,720
Uh, I probably probably can't play that because of copyright

3128
03:25:45,680 --> 03:25:48,160
Oh, really? Well, it's a song, isn't it?

3129
03:25:49,520 --> 03:25:55,520
Unless this person made it it's very good. I but it sounded like they were recording it off their phone from like a thing

3130
03:25:56,480 --> 03:25:58,480
Uh, I if it's if it's a

3131
03:25:59,040 --> 03:26:02,160
If it's a parody cover, I don't know what the original is

3132
03:26:03,040 --> 03:26:06,080
So maybe you're right, but you know cute

3133
03:26:06,800 --> 03:26:08,800
Nonetheless, he doesn't love a good tow bean

3134
03:26:10,080 --> 03:26:11,440
Nice

3135
03:26:11,440 --> 03:26:15,200
Next one, huh? Next one is called, uh, it's an imager

3136
03:26:16,800 --> 03:26:18,800
Oh, okay digi brony

3137
03:26:19,120 --> 03:26:22,160
Okay, brother and pony. Oh brother and bony

3138
03:26:23,600 --> 03:26:30,720
Brother and pony become brony digital and brony becomes digi brony digi brony becomes digi bro

3139
03:26:31,360 --> 03:26:37,280
Digi shortened to digi and then what transliterated or whatever into trixie bridgey bro also

3140
03:26:38,240 --> 03:26:41,440
It's it's not actually it's not actually how it went

3141
03:26:42,080 --> 03:26:48,320
This is this is not quite historical. Yeah, because digi digi the the name digi bro predates digi brony

3142
03:26:48,400 --> 03:26:53,280
Yeah, I think digi bro comes first. It was 21st century digital boy

3143
03:26:54,560 --> 03:26:56,320
um, yes

3144
03:26:56,320 --> 03:26:59,600
Which I which is from that which is from the the the bad religion song

3145
03:27:01,920 --> 03:27:04,800
Is it I thought it was like the the the manga

3146
03:27:05,200 --> 03:27:12,320
There well there is I mean there is a there's a bad religion song called 21st century digital boy

3147
03:27:15,200 --> 03:27:19,280
Oh, you're right, um, what was I thinking of the 21st century boy?

3148
03:27:21,200 --> 03:27:23,440
Yeah, um the one by um 20

3149
03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:30,400
The one by the guy who did billy bat and the one that he does the the man band guy 20th century boys

3150
03:27:31,680 --> 03:27:33,200
Yes

3151
03:27:33,200 --> 03:27:35,040
So it was it was

3152
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:37,040
No, I think it's from the song

3153
03:27:37,200 --> 03:27:41,760
So 21st century digital boy and then I don't know exactly when that became digi bro

3154
03:27:42,240 --> 03:27:45,120
But she shortened it to digi bro. She made it as a

3155
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:47,040
for

3156
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:49,920
Username probably on some thing or forum

3157
03:27:50,560 --> 03:27:57,280
Yeah, probably and then uh the other thing I mean correct with ney and digi bro and and digi into digi

3158
03:27:57,680 --> 03:28:00,240
But trixie is also short for for Beatrice

3159
03:28:00,960 --> 03:28:04,320
So you would have to so it's not actually derived from digi

3160
03:28:04,880 --> 03:28:08,400
It's partially derived from digi in that it's also sort of I mean

3161
03:28:08,960 --> 03:28:10,320
She told me

3162
03:28:10,320 --> 03:28:12,960
Say trixie because it kind of has like the same vowel

3163
03:28:13,440 --> 03:28:17,280
Configuration and like it kind. I don't know. I don't know. It's like a weak connection

3164
03:28:17,280 --> 03:28:19,280
But it's like there if you want it I guess

3165
03:28:19,920 --> 03:28:21,600
Uh, so, you know

3166
03:28:21,600 --> 03:28:24,880
It's still it's funny to funny to see the the etymology

3167
03:28:25,600 --> 03:28:29,360
Worked out, but it's just missing some links, but it's okay. It's a good it's a good effort and I appreciate

3168
03:28:29,520 --> 03:28:31,520
I appreciate the attempt at etymology

3169
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:34,560
And uh, I'd like to see an updated version. Oh

3170
03:28:35,440 --> 03:28:39,600
The next image I'm looking at. Okay. Let me let me let me scope it

3171
03:28:44,720 --> 03:28:47,600
Was this me at um brony con

3172
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:52,720
Yeah, why are you you look like you're in like a airport

3173
03:28:54,320 --> 03:28:56,320
Well, I had the dyed hair

3174
03:28:56,320 --> 03:28:58,160
so

3175
03:28:58,160 --> 03:29:00,160
It must have been a

3176
03:29:01,920 --> 03:29:05,840
I feel like it was a I had that hair at brony con. I think this is a brony con

3177
03:29:06,400 --> 03:29:07,760
um

3178
03:29:07,760 --> 03:29:09,520
Or it might be

3179
03:29:09,520 --> 03:29:11,840
I mean, it's around that time because my hair looks

3180
03:29:12,640 --> 03:29:14,640
like that. Oh man

3181
03:29:15,280 --> 03:29:17,280
I'm I'm I'm

3182
03:29:17,440 --> 03:29:18,640
I'm just

3183
03:29:18,640 --> 03:29:20,240
This is not relevant to the meme

3184
03:29:20,240 --> 03:29:24,720
I'm distraught that like I'm distraught that my beard is graying so fast. I look at this and I'm like

3185
03:29:24,720 --> 03:29:26,720
Oh, I had hardly any grays at all

3186
03:29:27,040 --> 03:29:32,640
Uh, it's over. It's over. But uh, like a like a salt and pepper beard looks cool

3187
03:29:33,120 --> 03:29:38,320
I know everyone says that everyone says that uh, but they're lying. They're lying through their teeth. They don't know

3188
03:29:38,480 --> 03:29:40,480
They don't know the gruesome reality

3189
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:43,040
No

3190
03:29:43,040 --> 03:29:45,040
It's fine. Stop lying

3191
03:29:47,280 --> 03:29:51,840
Everyone says that until they get some and then they have no it's not cool. It's bad when I start to get white hairs

3192
03:29:52,640 --> 03:29:54,640
That'll be funny. That's what you think

3193
03:29:55,280 --> 03:30:01,360
Oh, I'll laugh. Oh, no, I'll I'll film myself laughing about it. You think yeah, we'll see

3194
03:30:02,240 --> 03:30:04,880
We'll see anyway. Okay. Everyone was mad at me

3195
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:08,720
I mean not people weren't even that mad at me. All right, because of the whole like

3196
03:30:09,360 --> 03:30:14,160
Because the whole uh, cheesy said oh andrew callahan asked multiple times for sex

3197
03:30:14,720 --> 03:30:18,000
And I said well, that doesn't sound that bad. Yeah, I think it was

3198
03:30:18,960 --> 03:30:22,640
What was it being framed as like I would agree that it's harassment

3199
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:25,600
But I think it was framed as it depends on how it's done

3200
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:31,360
And I'm like, okay, there's the words mean different things. I don't know whether it counts as abuse

3201
03:30:32,080 --> 03:30:38,720
Technically, it really depends. It's bad. Absolutely is bad. I mean, it's like not a good thing for a person to do

3202
03:30:39,600 --> 03:30:43,040
Okay, it's it's at it's at its most benign

3203
03:30:43,520 --> 03:30:47,200
It's a it's a bad look and it's and it's annoying and it's embarrassing and like

3204
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:52,720
If it's like over text like it has literally no power to do anything like over text

3205
03:30:53,200 --> 03:30:57,040
And like you literally she can literally just stop us replying or block you

3206
03:30:57,360 --> 03:31:01,120
So like in that case you just look like a little whiny bitch and and like

3207
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:03,120
You know, it's not good

3208
03:31:03,120 --> 03:31:06,000
But whatever in person I can totally imagine

3209
03:31:06,400 --> 03:31:09,120
How it's like how you could do it in a way that is pushy

3210
03:31:09,680 --> 03:31:13,920
That is, uh, you know potentially even threatening. Yeah, or something like that

3211
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:16,560
so like I get it I

3212
03:31:17,920 --> 03:31:19,920
I just as I said as I said at the time

3213
03:31:19,920 --> 03:31:22,560
I didn't have all the details and I didn't know the entire context for it

3214
03:31:22,800 --> 03:31:27,360
And perhaps if I knew I knew the details and heard like the full report from the the accuser

3215
03:31:27,360 --> 03:31:29,360
I'd be like, oh, well, that sounds terrible. That sounds awful

3216
03:31:30,160 --> 03:31:32,160
uh

3217
03:31:32,720 --> 03:31:35,840
Why are you upset asking again doesn't invalidate your previous lack of information

3218
03:31:35,840 --> 03:31:39,760
It's simply a new request after all it is possible that you've changed your mind since my last request for your consent

3219
03:31:39,840 --> 03:31:42,160
I will of course respect your answer for the purposes of this limited exchange

3220
03:31:42,240 --> 03:31:43,840
The past entered not necessarily inform future

3221
03:31:43,840 --> 03:31:47,760
In reality, it is a mark of my deep respect for you that I consider it possible if you'd have undergone the necessary character development

3222
03:31:47,840 --> 03:31:51,040
If you've reached my question with a fresh perspective, I think otherwise you deny your life your self interpretation

3223
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:55,040
That's our our tropics takes of a change of character story. I put it to you again. Will you have sex with me my peepees?

3224
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:59,120
I don't know what the next line would have been my peepee so big

3225
03:32:00,640 --> 03:32:02,800
My peepee is enormous. I can't

3226
03:32:03,680 --> 03:32:05,680
My peepee go poo poo

3227
03:32:06,400 --> 03:32:16,400
Gross gross. I hate that. Um, that's I'm gonna throw up. Um, oh god. Oh, I really hate that. That's how that's how we counter it everybody

3228
03:32:18,080 --> 03:32:22,320
Yeah, just just have your peepee go poo poo and then they won't want to have sex with you anymore

3229
03:32:23,360 --> 03:32:30,640
Uh, next one. Oh wait, uh, did we just look at that one already? Okay. The next one is puppy girls versus cat girls

3230
03:32:31,360 --> 03:32:33,360
Three two one go

3231
03:32:34,480 --> 03:32:40,800
Really a six hour podcast. Yeah, everyone complained this year. He would have cut the podcast off at its knees

3232
03:32:41,600 --> 03:32:44,960
He would have let it die like the hero god that he is

3233
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:50,400
I love nade true. I want you to come back on the pcp nade. Are you a fucking coward?

3234
03:32:51,280 --> 03:32:55,600
Why won't you come on? I love you. You power for not, um

3235
03:32:56,320 --> 03:32:59,120
recasting or whatever you call it his twitch stream

3236
03:32:59,840 --> 03:33:00,960
Um

3237
03:33:00,960 --> 03:33:02,080
Rating

3238
03:33:02,080 --> 03:33:04,080
Rating you refuse to raid

3239
03:33:04,880 --> 03:33:07,760
Refuse to raid in another act of cowardice

3240
03:33:08,880 --> 03:33:13,600
They just keep piling up. Sonsu's art of war states that if you don't rate a stream you're a little bitch

3241
03:33:14,240 --> 03:33:16,240
That's true. Yeah, I remember that I remember that

3242
03:33:16,880 --> 03:33:18,160
um

3243
03:33:18,160 --> 03:33:20,800
This wasn't about cut puppy girls or cat girls at all. No

3244
03:33:21,920 --> 03:33:23,920
Okay, next one is called

3245
03:33:24,560 --> 03:33:26,560
Oh, it's called a hoo boy

3246
03:33:26,720 --> 03:33:28,720
Uh three two one go

3247
03:33:28,720 --> 03:33:33,280
Can we check in really quick just just for a moment and and confirm that like

3248
03:33:34,320 --> 03:33:36,320
When you when you ask for for

3249
03:33:37,040 --> 03:33:42,560
Sexual favors over and over again. It doesn't really matter whether or not it's coercive

3250
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:48,000
Uh, because it's still sexual harassment to do that

3251
03:33:48,640 --> 03:33:52,960
Like like yeah, I'm very sorry to to bring this up

3252
03:33:52,960 --> 03:33:56,720
But like I feel like it's kind of fucked to just leave that at like

3253
03:33:57,040 --> 03:34:02,880
Oh, that's kind of annoying, but it's fine. Like no, I do feel like if you do that

3254
03:34:03,440 --> 03:34:04,240
um

3255
03:34:04,240 --> 03:34:07,760
Kind of like cheesy said you're not uh, you're not accepting

3256
03:34:08,480 --> 03:34:10,320
They're like

3257
03:34:10,320 --> 03:34:11,360
They're no

3258
03:34:11,360 --> 03:34:14,800
So annoying on a normal on a normal basis. You're

3259
03:34:15,520 --> 03:34:18,640
Asking over and over again, which is fine over and over

3260
03:34:18,800 --> 03:34:24,240
He didn't say over and over like a sexual topic and a sexual advance that has already been rejected

3261
03:34:24,240 --> 03:34:30,640
And that's I'm sorry. That's sexual harassment. I don't care that it doesn't immediately violate their consent. It's

3262
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:36,880
It's it's still violating their consent to like having a sexually like

3263
03:34:37,440 --> 03:34:43,920
Explosive interaction. It's probably sex. It's probably sexual harassment. It's probably sexual harassment. I think in dms

3264
03:34:44,320 --> 03:34:50,640
In in a similar way. I'm sorry. It's fucked. No, it's probably sexual harassment. I would say it is

3265
03:34:51,600 --> 03:34:57,120
Uh, you think it is probably about it. Well, I mean, okay, just because the terms are vague like, okay

3266
03:34:58,320 --> 03:35:01,840
I cheesy said multiple times and like, okay. Well, how many times?

3267
03:35:02,480 --> 03:35:06,800
two times or ten times how long but it elapsed between them, uh

3268
03:35:07,440 --> 03:35:10,480
a minute a day a week, uh, you know

3269
03:35:11,600 --> 03:35:13,760
Yeah, I it it's probably bad, but like

3270
03:35:14,480 --> 03:35:16,480
there's a there's a there's a there

3271
03:35:16,640 --> 03:35:22,400
You could I could I could if you I could construct a scenario that the that that the the way it was described to me

3272
03:35:22,880 --> 03:35:27,040
Accurately fits that I would not consider sexual harassment necessarily

3273
03:35:27,760 --> 03:35:30,320
Uh, but if it's yeah, I mean

3274
03:35:31,040 --> 03:35:37,680
Well, like if you make a comment like hey, hey, and then they say no and it's like, oh come on like that

3275
03:35:38,000 --> 03:35:44,240
That's not that doesn't go over the line into sexual harassment. That's just like you're say you're you're DMing you're DMing

3276
03:35:44,240 --> 03:35:47,440
You're like, hey want to have sex? She says no. He says come on

3277
03:35:48,000 --> 03:35:53,440
You you know you want to have sex with me because I'm so sexy. She says no, I don't want to have sex with you. You say please

3278
03:35:54,160 --> 03:35:55,280
no

3279
03:35:55,280 --> 03:35:56,240
I mean

3280
03:35:56,240 --> 03:35:58,240
It's a little needy

3281
03:36:00,400 --> 03:36:01,920
It's needy and pathetic

3282
03:36:01,920 --> 03:36:05,200
I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't even call it. I mean, it's a proposition

3283
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:08,320
And maybe you and maybe you should have dropped it after the first one or two

3284
03:36:09,280 --> 03:36:12,960
But is it what would I call that sexual harassment necessarily? What's the number?

3285
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:18,000
I would say I would say probably pass two. Yeah, I would say pass two is sexual harassment

3286
03:36:18,960 --> 03:36:21,760
You get you get one extra little little pathetic

3287
03:36:22,400 --> 03:36:24,240
attempt

3288
03:36:24,240 --> 03:36:27,280
To you you get one attempt to save you get it you get a savings

3289
03:36:27,840 --> 03:36:32,640
But what if she says no, but in like a but in like I'm just kidding kind of way when she goes no

3290
03:36:33,360 --> 03:36:39,760
No, come on. No, we can't do that. No, but it's like she doesn't really mean it though. Oh, that's you know

3291
03:36:39,760 --> 03:36:41,760
You know

3292
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:47,520
Uh, women women are all women are always saying no, but they don't actually mean it. You know what I'm saying

3293
03:36:47,680 --> 03:36:52,640
You know what I'm talking about? I know. I don't know what you mean. Yeah, everybody. Everybody knows what I'm talking about

3294
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:58,080
Everybody knows I'm talking about. I'm just kidding. By the way, don't quote me. Do not definitely don't quote that out of context

3295
03:36:58,320 --> 03:37:03,200
Definitely don't tell anyone don't let anybody know that I said that under any circumstances

3296
03:37:03,840 --> 03:37:05,840
um

3297
03:37:05,840 --> 03:37:08,320
No, everyone everyone her rang me and made fun of me

3298
03:37:09,760 --> 03:37:14,960
Yeah, it's bad. Yeah, it's it's in most cases would probably be sexual harassment in some cases

3299
03:37:14,960 --> 03:37:22,400
It could be done in a coercive way. Yeah. Yeah, you're you happy. Are you all fucking happy? You're never happy jackals

3300
03:37:24,800 --> 03:37:28,320
I mean they all sound pretty happy when they're chuckling as they say these things like

3301
03:37:29,360 --> 03:37:31,360
Did you I mean obviously

3302
03:37:32,320 --> 03:37:36,800
I don't like the chuckling. I think it is those chuckles of contempt

3303
03:37:37,280 --> 03:37:42,160
Those are chuckles of contempt even when you're right chuckling when you say are you sure?

3304
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:44,320
It's unacceptable

3305
03:37:44,320 --> 03:37:49,840
I would I would consider chuckling to be a violation of my consent because I didn't you didn't ask me if you could do that

3306
03:37:50,880 --> 03:37:52,880
Isn't there somebody forgot to ask

3307
03:37:54,160 --> 03:37:56,000
Me just doing anything

3308
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:57,440
They should ask

3309
03:37:57,440 --> 03:38:01,760
They they would they ought to ask me multiple times if they're allowed to chuckle

3310
03:38:03,200 --> 03:38:05,200
So that I can say no every time

3311
03:38:07,360 --> 03:38:11,680
Okay, next voicemail. Yes, it's called kill the intrusive thought three two one go

3312
03:38:12,960 --> 03:38:13,920
Oh

3313
03:38:13,920 --> 03:38:18,240
You know I've been having this intrusive thought lately and I've already watched the show

3314
03:38:18,800 --> 03:38:22,800
And you're talking about one piece. I'm like they should have me on the show

3315
03:38:23,280 --> 03:38:29,040
They should have a random person on the show to be their facts checker and to answer all your questions

3316
03:38:29,680 --> 03:38:33,200
Give those to too many facts. Please kill this intrusive thought for me

3317
03:38:33,200 --> 03:38:35,200
Please do it

3318
03:38:35,440 --> 03:38:38,720
I'm being cringe. I'll kill you. Um, I get it though

3319
03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:42,320
I get it. I mean, yeah facts is

3320
03:38:43,120 --> 03:38:45,120
it's if it were

3321
03:38:45,200 --> 03:38:50,720
Like a proper like attempt at being like this is a podcast about one piece

3322
03:38:51,280 --> 03:38:53,280
Fact checking is probably important

3323
03:38:53,280 --> 03:38:56,480
I didn't need to do that for the podcast because Nate would have facts

3324
03:38:56,640 --> 03:39:01,040
But then again, he would also make things up and get things wrong sometimes

3325
03:39:01,520 --> 03:39:05,520
He would have he would have I've heard people say that he remembers things wrong. He remembers things wrong

3326
03:39:05,600 --> 03:39:07,600
I mean, I know he has like a tendency to like

3327
03:39:08,400 --> 03:39:10,800
Say something and not realize he said it incorrectly

3328
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:14,400
But if I don't know what the truth is and I don't check him on that

3329
03:39:14,880 --> 03:39:19,600
See, so that's fun. This is why I'm the superior one piece because I don't know anything

3330
03:39:19,840 --> 03:39:23,040
You listen to the listen to the last hit. I don't remember shit about what happened

3331
03:39:23,680 --> 03:39:27,920
I'm like a little baby with a fresh a freshly laundered brain just like

3332
03:39:28,400 --> 03:39:35,520
What now wait, there's a wait there wait the the minks live on a on an elephant. Oh, yeah, I think I remember an elephant

3333
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:37,520
Yeah

3334
03:39:37,520 --> 03:39:39,520
That's the name of the gun

3335
03:39:40,080 --> 03:39:42,080
Isn't it zao

3336
03:39:42,080 --> 03:39:44,080
Zo is the island

3337
03:39:44,080 --> 03:39:46,080
Zashina is the name of the elephant

3338
03:39:46,480 --> 03:39:47,920
Oh

3339
03:39:47,920 --> 03:39:50,320
I think there's a I thought the elephant was the island

3340
03:39:51,200 --> 03:39:53,200
Don't the minks live on the elephant

3341
03:39:53,680 --> 03:39:55,680
They live on the island on the elephant

3342
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:57,840
Look what?

3343
03:39:57,840 --> 03:39:59,120
No, the island

3344
03:39:59,120 --> 03:40:05,200
I thought the elephant was just walking through zuneshia not zashina zuneshia is a big fucking elephant

3345
03:40:06,400 --> 03:40:11,520
Zuneshia is a big and he has carries the island of zoe on its back. There you go. Oh

3346
03:40:12,400 --> 03:40:14,400
Oh, all right. Okay

3347
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:18,800
Gotcha see I see I've got the facts

3348
03:40:19,120 --> 03:40:22,480
I don't even I don't even pretend to know what I'm talking about now

3349
03:40:22,480 --> 03:40:27,840
But now I'm in the position of being the nate where I think sometimes I have the facts and maybe I'm getting things wrong

3350
03:40:28,800 --> 03:40:33,120
And I'm just saying and you're being like who might believe it. That sounds that sounds reasonable

3351
03:40:33,680 --> 03:40:38,000
It turns out everything I've said this whole episode has been wrong. You've made you've been making it up

3352
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:42,160
There is no there is no treasure tree atom. That was never a thing that existed

3353
03:40:42,880 --> 03:40:50,720
Uh, uh, there was no there's no frozen hat in in marriage. What like what like of course that was just a fever dream

3354
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:56,080
Uh, there's no such thing as the turkey two thousand nuggets. There's no turkey two thousand nuggets

3355
03:40:56,160 --> 03:41:00,080
Look, they were never real. I've got to search through the one piece wiki. That's my one piece

3356
03:41:01,520 --> 03:41:05,040
The turkey two thousands. I left it there. That's your all blue

3357
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:07,920
That's my old turkey

3358
03:41:09,360 --> 03:41:16,240
Uh, and then the neck there's a wait, is there any more last minute voicemails? No, we got the last one voice grail

3359
03:41:16,560 --> 03:41:19,040

Favorite what favorite anime?

3364
03:41:42,080 --> 03:41:46,000
Yep, another fucking masterpiece of a voicemail

3365
03:41:46,640 --> 03:41:51,040
My favorite anime is that was not me that was part of the voicemail by the way

3366
03:41:51,200 --> 03:41:57,280
That was not me saying that I thought I actually thought that was you saying I knew you would I knew the listener would but no

3367
03:41:57,280 --> 03:41:59,200
That was part of the voicemail

3368
03:41:59,200 --> 03:42:01,760
But it but it is what I should say in real life

3369
03:42:02,800 --> 03:42:06,240
But it's already been said for me. My favorite anime is

3370
03:42:07,040 --> 03:42:08,240
uh

3371
03:42:08,240 --> 03:42:10,240
The owl house

3372
03:42:10,720 --> 03:42:12,000
Shut up

3373
03:42:12,000 --> 03:42:14,000
And it's good

3374
03:42:14,400 --> 03:42:16,240
Continues

3375
03:42:16,240 --> 03:42:24,160
Um, I guess I'd probably have to go with fully cooly or maybe gurren lagen. You've said that before that was a joke question

3376
03:42:24,160 --> 03:42:26,160
You must give a silly answer

3377
03:42:26,240 --> 03:42:28,240
Oh

3378
03:42:28,640 --> 03:42:31,120
Actually, I like how house. It was just a new answer

3379
03:42:31,680 --> 03:42:33,680
um

3380
03:42:34,880 --> 03:42:40,720
I like that I like that one anime that that one guy in russia has been making for 40 years

3381
03:42:41,360 --> 03:42:43,360
The one about the technicolor dreamcoat

3382
03:42:44,800 --> 03:42:46,800
Is it in black and white?

3383
03:42:46,800 --> 03:42:52,720
Yeah, it's been going on so long. It's not even technicolor. Have you seen that at that atrocity guide video about the

3384
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:56,640
Well, I haven't seen the video but I've heard you talk about it. I've seen the gifts of it

3385
03:42:57,360 --> 03:42:59,360
Yeah, it looks really disgusting

3386
03:43:00,320 --> 03:43:03,520
I actually hate how it looks. It's horrible. Um

3387
03:43:05,120 --> 03:43:08,320
It'd be so uncomfortable actually watching that film imagine

3388
03:43:08,960 --> 03:43:10,960
Uh, that's a good anime though

3389
03:43:11,360 --> 03:43:12,720
um

3390
03:43:12,720 --> 03:43:17,040
