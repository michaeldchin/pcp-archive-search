1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,640
Oh my fucking god, you're still listening to The Pro Crastinators Podcast in 2018.

2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,480
It's me Digibro, and I'm joined by good ol' boy's best guy ever.

3
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,960
Microphone Jones is over, so please excuse the noise in the background.

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,000
We've got The Davoo.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,600
I recently watched FLCL Progressive, and in one part someone says, you need to become

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,520
a pro, and he was like, what kind of pro?

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,920
I don't know, you gotta decide what kind of pro you wanna be.

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,840
And I thought, a crastinator pro?

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
And then the song started playing in my head.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I wanted to yell to him over the screen, become a pro crastinator.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,200
We've got Tom Oliver.

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,680
I am here, and I am queer.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
And you are games.

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
And we've got Munchy.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,760
Wait, you're telling me it's not 2015, and we have Oliver and integrity intact still,

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:31,280
and the PCP hasn't just started a couple months ago, and it's so still gone?

17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
What?

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Wait, is this show starting 2015?

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,440
I don't think that's accurate.

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
That can't be right.

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
We can't be doing this for three fucking years.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,640
The first episode was the very end of 2015, so it will soon become three years.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Oh my god.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Oh my god.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,440
Well, it's now an unstructured clusterfuck, like it was always meant to be.

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,020
Does anybody have a subject that is burning through their mind, or should I just start

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,020
us right off?

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
Start us right off.

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,020
Pop culture is bad.

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,020
Go for it.

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,400
Yeah, I'm going to talk about, let's talk about how pop culture is bad.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:14,120
And I don't mean anything, like any individual piece of media is bad, or that people's tastes

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
are bad.

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,960
In fact, I think that people's tastes are a lot better than pop culture.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,540
But what I think pop culture is, is like a filtration system that just puts everybody

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,760
to the same things.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,400
But I don't think it's inherent to people that they like that stuff.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
What do you guys think?

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Yeah.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,640
Well, what's inherent to people, I think, is that they gravitate to the most popular

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,200
thing, because it's the most discussed.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Right.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,040
So I think it's just a natural process of people's interaction, and discussing media

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
and stuff.

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,360
The thing is that it's so easy to control.

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,760
Like, for instance, with music, I was just watching some analysis video called, When

47
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,280
Soundtracks Repeat Themselves, and it wasn't saying anything I hadn't already known, but

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:12,080
just hearing it reaffirmed by quoting a science book made it like, man, it really made me

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
think about it.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,640
In fact, people literally, literally like something more, like a song more, because

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,400
they hear it multiple times.

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,600
Like the more times you hear something.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,840
You're saying this piece of information was more impactful because you heard it again,

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
A.K.A. multiple times.

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Exactly.

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Yeah.

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,160
Well, I mean, and it wasn't even that I'd heard it before, it's more that I just implicitly

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,600
knew this, but like, just knowing that a scientist person had put it in science words

59
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:49,280
in an academic book somewhere, like she literally was like, yeah, if you hear something again,

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,720
you just like it more, because you'll internalize it more, you'll think about it more.

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,760
And this is why when a new song comes out that the radio stations think could be a number

62
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,360
one hit, they just play it all day and hope that it works.

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,080
They're just like, here, listen to this song every hour on the hour, and you just are going

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,800
to end up liking it because you hear it so many times.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,880
Is this applied to everything or just songs?

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,680
I mean, I think that anything you hear it probably applies to.

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,320
If we watch Sword Art Online enough, will it be good?

68
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,880
I've argued that before.

69
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,360
You'll probably develop a familiarity and thus like a comfort with it.

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,480
What about FLCL Progressive?

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Can that become good?

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Oh, God.

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,640
You have to put yourself in the process of watching it again.

74
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,280
I was a pop culture.

75
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Do you mean just art?

76
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,520
Do you mean movies and video games and songs by pop culture?

77
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,880
I mean anything popular.

78
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,880
I think that popularity is an engine that perpetuates itself not on the basis of what

79
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,680
people like, but on the basis of what someone wants people to like.

80
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,840
Bludgeoning yourself with it over the head till you like it.

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,200
Just last night, I was having a conversation at the round table about Fairy Tale, to which

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:18,720
one of my conversants said, oh yeah, I didn't like it until around 50 episodes in, to which

83
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,240
the wife came up and said, see, even if that's true, I have to watch 50 episodes to get to

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
that point.

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,600
And I just sort of mumbled Stockholm Syndrome under my breath.

86
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,680
I don't know, man.

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,840
I hear that shit all the time about those long running shounens.

88
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,000
People will say, oh, once you get 40 episodes in, it gets really good.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,560
The fact that you even made it 40 episodes in means that your thought process is so fundamentally

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
different from mine.

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,280
I'll tell you that I can't believe that it actually gets good.

92
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,680
The shonen that I watched that totally changed my perspective on all of fiction was called

93
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,000
The Pretender from 1998 to 2002.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
It's one of those shounens that are from America and are live action.

95
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,560
And it's about a guy who's super autistic and has genius capacity.

96
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
He was locked up his whole life, but he has the ability to, in the first episode, he just

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,720
reads a medical book and then can just go and be a fucking doctor now.

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,640
That's how good he is at simulation, which is a cool premise, just like any good shonen.

99
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,800
And it's got some very archetypical but likable characters, just like any good shonen.

100
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
But it was written terribly.

101
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
The same shit happens all the time.

102
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,720
It does things where it'll build up like, oh, his long lost brother for half a season

103
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,960
and then he dies immediately, and then the next season they build up, oh, he's actually

104
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,640
returning, he's not dead, then he actually dies for real.

105
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,680
So it's like, it's horrible, it's tedious, it wasted four seasons of watching, and at

106
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,840
the end of it all I was like, I didn't gain anything from this.

107
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,160
I like the character, I don't need to know what happens to him, he's not fucking real!

108
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Stories aren't real, and if they're frustrating you, fuck them.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,760
Fuck those sympathetic characters you like for the sin of being in a shitty story.

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Dump the story.

111
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:09,760
I was probably like 13, and ever since then my mentality has been, fuck a story!

112
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:16,640
I feel like I had a recent example of this thing, which is, just the other day, me and

113
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,600
I was, I don't know why, but I thought about Cromartie High School, and I'm like, Michelle,

114
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,280
do you want to watch Cromartie High School?

115
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
And she was like, okay, sure.

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,440
In my mind I was going through all these loop-de-loops about thinking about how this is the best

117
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
show ever.

118
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,400
I'm telling you, this is the funniest show ever, it's the best comedy, it's one of those

119
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,800
anime that reminds you why anime is worth existing, and then we proceeded to watch it.

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,200
We watched like four episodes, and I loved it because I love all the characters and I

121
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,920
know everybody there, and there were some great jokes, like in the very first couple

122
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,600
minutes when the guy just eats the pencils, like that's hilarious.

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,640
But I got a distinct depression that like, huh, these episodes are not as funny as I

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
remember them being.

125
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,600
I'm enjoying them, but I can sense that this isn't going over as like literally the funniest

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
thing of all time.

127
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,840
That's so bad when you show something to someone, and they're just kinda like, they're

128
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,240
watching it, they aren't seeing anything, but you know, the aura is changed.

129
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,120
The aura, the aura is there, and like, I felt like, okay, I think that there are better

130
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,280
episodes later or something, but I was still thinking like, this is so far not exactly

131
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
lived up to what I thought.

132
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,720
It's really funny, Nate, because Chromarty High School was a show that was pitched to

133
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,600
me kinda like that, and when I watched it, I really thought of it as like a 50-50 kind

134
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
of show.

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,680
Like, half of it is unbelievably hilarious, the other half is just okay, and like, but

136
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
there's this amazing line-

137
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,120
I still buy it though, it's still the best show ever made.

138
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,880
It's still, I mean, it's really memorable because it's so different, because there's

139
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,320
not another comedy show that feels like it, and so if you just like that feel, and like

140
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,400
you remember the great scenes, then it's like, that's enough.

141
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,440
There's a fucking phenomenal quote from the Watchmen that I love bringing up, towards

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,360
the very end, where throughout the whole story, Silk Spector, I think that was the younger,

143
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
the girl, right?

144
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Yeah, the lady.

145
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
That was the young lady.

146
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,200
She's like, she's, you know, always been like traumatized by the fact that her mom

147
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,600
was like, raped by the comedian, and in the end, her mom is like, kind of like, she's

148
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,320
kind of nostalgic about him, and kind of like forgiving, and Silk Spector's like, what the

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
fuck?

150
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Like, he raped you.

151
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Like, how could you feel this way?

152
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,680
And she says, like, you know, as you get older, and you know, everything's changing,

153
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,960
and all the people who you care about start dying, like, you just look back, and you don't

154
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,280
really fixate on the bad stuff, all the bad memories are replaced with bright lights, as

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
she says it.

156
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,520
And I see this in people all the time, especially if your life is, if you're going through something

157
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,560
rough, if your life feels worse than it once felt, then like, you will over glamorize the

158
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
past.

159
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,760
You'll remember all the best things that happened, and you'll be like, oh man, I was so much

160
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,800
happier when I was this, in this state, like, if only I could get back there, but then you

161
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,600
remember like, oh wait, that's right, there was tons of bullshit, you know, and I think

162
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,280
people feel that way about media too, where you just, and I think because I've kind of

163
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
known about this, I've always tried to avoid it.

164
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,680
Like, I always try to remember exactly how I felt at a time and preserve the memory of

165
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,480
how I felt rather than my memory of the thing itself.

166
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,680
So like, with Chromarty, I remember exactly the fact that it was like, I thought it was

167
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,880
50, 50, half the funniest thing ever, half not, and that's the memory I've preserved

168
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,400
above everything else.

169
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,320
And then if I watch it again, I can be surprised or reaffirmed, but like, yeah, I do think

170
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,720
that it's why we, it's why nostalgia is so powerful, you know, like nobody remembers

171
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,000
the bad episodes of the stuff that they watched, and especially this is why people will always

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,440
think that modern media is worse than older media, because when you think back, you're

173
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,960
only going to remember the shows you actually finished or the ones that stuck out, like

174
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,640
all the dumb generic bullshit just goes by the wayside and nobody talks about it anymore,

175
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,440
so it doesn't stay alive in your memory.

176
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,120
But there was always just as much dumb generic bullshit as there is, you know?

177
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,640
Yeah, more or less.

178
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Percentages-wise, anyway.

179
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:35,080
I mean, people will sometimes look at certain mediums and like run up stats of what people

180
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,760
are enjoying, and it does come in peaks and troughs.

181
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,360
I think generally people would say the turn of the last decade from 08 to 12 or so, you

182
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,200
know, that was the club shit era, and people tend to be more favorable of pop music right

183
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,080
now in comparison.

184
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,480
But also, people talk about-

185
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,960
I mean, it really depends on who you ask, because when you look at Todd in the shadows

186
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,440
and like, he really thought that last year was like the worst year of pop music.

187
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Oh, really?

188
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Yeah.

189
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,400
Because that's why I found your series, Digi, legitimately fascinating.

190
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,160
And you, like, when you like, you tried to basically mathematically prove that I think

191
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,480
it was that like 2007 was like the best year of anime, like based on like reviews and stuff.

192
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,040
And that's like a useful thing.

193
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,040
I mean, by really analyzing daily, you can be like, are things actually getting better

194
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,800
or not or, you know, whatever?

195
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,160
The thing about that video, though, is that I may have empirically proved that 2007 is

196
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,920
the best- what I really proved is that four like Western anime fans' consensus 2007 is

197
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
the best year.

198
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,640
But the reason why that's the case is that 2007 is the year that speed subbing really

199
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,880
took off.

200
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,680
So for most people, that was the first year they were watching anime while it came out

201
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
in Japan.

202
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Myself included.

203
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,280
Like, that was the first year where I was watching seasonal shows.

204
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,720
And like, at the time, a lot of shows were, you know, still getting subbed really slowly.

205
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,480
Like it wasn't like everything got subtitled back then.

206
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
What caused that?

207
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Did Haruhi cause that?

208
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Or was it Lucky Star?

209
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
It was Naruto.

210
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,520
Naruto caused speed subbing.

211
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,840
Throughout the 2000s, there were sub groups who were basically competing with each other

212
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,040
to see who could sub it as fast as possible.

213
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,920
So Naruto was the first show, I think, that ever had fansubs like day one of an episode

214
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
coming out.

215
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,880
And then the fact that Torrenting got popular and Torrenting was by far the safest and easiest

216
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,240
way to download stuff.

217
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,800
So it was like, between that and also streaming sites were getting bigger.

218
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,080
You had sites like Crunchyroll that were taking in, like they had- Crunchyroll used

219
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,680
to have fucking everything.

220
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,920
Like, anything that had been subtitled was on there.

221
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,240
YouTube had a lot of shows at the time.

222
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,280
Back when they were good old pirate boys and didn't have their squeaky clean image.

223
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,840
What did For Never World say about them?

224
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
They're a clean company.

225
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
They're a clean company.

226
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
That's hilarious.

227
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,200
I love that.

228
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,680
They were literally the dirtiest of all those fucking streaming sites because you had to

229
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
pay for a subscription to full screen your video.

230
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,360
How come we can shit on- It's okay to run James Gunn out of the business for saying

231
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,720
some fucked up jokes about baby rape.

232
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,000
But it's not okay to shit on Crunchyroll for being the worst actual pirates in the game

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
back in the day.

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,640
I went to Disneyland recently on every single roller coaster at the height of the coast

235
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
before it dropped.

236
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,280
I said hire James Gunn as loud as I could.

237
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,120
It was the most effective marketing campaign of all time.

238
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,880
On the Matterhorn, I had the abominable snowman that was going to come out and get you.

239
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,640
I kept going over to my friend Kyle behind me and I'm like, dude, that's James Gunn.

240
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
He's going to try and swipe you up.

241
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
He's really mad.

242
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
He wants to contract that Kyle.

243
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,520
He's going to make the contract.

244
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,800
It's the only job that had left.

245
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,400
He gets into the abominable snowman costume, runs around.

246
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,320
That's where Disney puts all their rejects so they can stop the abominable snowman costume.

247
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
They force him to characterize people.

248
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
This is what your tweets have done to people.

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
Now they act it act physically and now you can see the damage you've done.

250
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Oh boy.

251
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,720
Yeah, I think it was a combination of Naruto and Torrance making speed something possible

252
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,440
and then yes, the hype around Haruhi, but early 2007 Gurren Lagann came out and that

253
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,240
was subbed within the week every episode and Code Geass was also really huge at that time.

254
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,000
So I'm thinking it was those two where I think Code Geass probably even more because Gurren

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,080
Lagann was like a slow burn before it got popular.

256
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
That's true.

257
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,960
Geass before Gurren Lagann.

258
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:32,480
Yeah, Geass was a huge meme on A and everything so I think it was that and so yeah, I think

259
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,200
a lot of people are really nostalgic for that era and also it depends on genre because

260
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,160
most anime fans in the West get into it or at least they used to get into it because

261
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,320
of action shows and the mid-2000s was when action shows were the most prominent genre

262
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,360
in anime and then as it sort of drifted over into cute girl shit and comedies and isekai

263
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,160
and light novel adaptations, it's like people who really miss that certain style are kind

264
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,920
of ass out now and so that's kind of how it was with Gigak with his whole golden year

265
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,120
of anime which was what inspired me to make that video was that he was reminiscing on

266
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,560
this certain era that he considered the best but it's entirely because of what was popular

267
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,600
during that era just happening to resonate with him.

268
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,000
But anyway, my real problem with pop culture is that it's not even so much that the wrong

269
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,080
things get promoted or that they get promoted for the wrong reasons, it's that it hampers

270
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,280
people's ability to find what they will like because I think that the average consumer

271
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,360
actually has a much broader taste than they probably give themselves credit for and like

272
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,240
if you talk to almost anybody, they probably have something they really love that you wouldn't

273
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,160
expect because maybe it just came on one night when they were watching TV and flipping through

274
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,440
channels or like a friend showed it to them or there's just something particular that

275
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,960
this person is way into that's not on the radio and it's not like a best seller or anything,

276
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:14,720
they just found it and loved it and I think most average people have that but like most

277
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,520
people don't go out of their way to look for media to consume, it's not really something

278
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,560
that is encouraged by our culture because most of us are just going to go see the things

279
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,560
that everyone's talking about so we can be in the conversation.

280
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,920
When you're trying to fuck Stacy Rottencroch down the lane, you only need to know about

281
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,280
the latest season of Game of Thrones, you don't need to know about Psycho Pass season

282
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,240
two and why it's shitty compared to season one or whatever.

283
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,560
The most fucked part is that literally seeing, I think that going beyond music, going beyond

284
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,840
anything, I think that people will respond more to something just because they have seen

285
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,520
the name before.

286
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,920
Not even that they've seen the show, just the name because like so many things that

287
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,000
Shenmue is the perfect fucking example because Shenmue was like this fucking obscure Dreamcast

288
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,120
title, people treat it like it's this beloved classic.

289
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,360
Only when the revival became a thing did I suddenly hear everybody really excited about

290
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,720
Shenmue which very much surprised me.

291
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Because Shenmue 1 and 2 not only, they didn't really review all that well at the time, they're

292
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,400
not like important classic games, they just introduced new things that hadn't been seen

293
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
before.

294
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,680
Is it the same way as like God Hand was like hated when it came out but has like become

295
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,200
a classic since then?

296
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,440
Is that what happened to Shenmue?

297
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,600
I think that, well with God Hand it was a case of if you love platinum games, people

298
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,320
have gone back and played God Hand because it's all mechanics and that actually brings

299
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,840
me to part of this because part of what inspired me to bring up this topic was Shinobi which

300
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Tom did a playthrough of that we live streamed and then we did a video about it.

301
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,640
Shinobi is a game that got like 7 out of 10 reviews across the board and like generally

302
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,920
was not praised as like this amazing game but when you play it it's clear that the game

303
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,000
is like it's borderline perfect at what it's supposed to be like if you're somebody who

304
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,720
likes like hardcore arcade style games this game is for you and you will love it.

305
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,720
But because of the fact that magazines would not see that as for everybody they're not

306
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,680
going to give it a super high score they're going to give it a 7 because they're like

307
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,120
oh well people most people are going to be disappointed with this game so if we give

308
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,280
it a 10 and everybody rushes out and buys it they're going to complain that it was too

309
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
hard.

310
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,920
I know I talk about this all the time but this is exactly the issue I always bring up

311
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,480
about how like super bunny hops reviews like 100% Metal Gear Solid 5 that's for a specific

312
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,120
audience somebody else could review the same game being like I played 10 hours it was really

313
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,240
fun then threw it away that's the right review for somebody else.

314
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,040
Everybody needs to be clear what their review is for like if you're going to review something

315
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,360
be like look here's who I am here's how I feel about games in general here's what this

316
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,760
game means to me because anytime you try to make it for a general audience you kind of

317
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,840
fuck over everybody because the only games that get 10s are the ones where they're like

318
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,480
oh we think everyone will love this game and the only reason you would think that is that

319
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,920
other games that are popular are similar and this is why every game that gets like high

320
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,040
review scores is the same fucking game.

321
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:38,160
I know if it's a fool's errand if it's literally impossible I feel like we could make a change

322
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
here.

323
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Well I think so.

324
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,760
I think the problem is that like traditionally like to talk about game reviews in particular

325
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,640
because that's what I'm most familiar with like growing up reading EGM and GamePro and

326
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,400
all that shit like those were just magazines designed for anybody who's into games no matter

327
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,000
their taste to pick up so they had to just like write them for everyone because they

328
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,640
had no control over it the interesting thing about YouTube and like us doing reviews like

329
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,080
a singular person is you're not a big media company so you can be like I'm going to make

330
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,760
reviews for X kind of person who shares my particular taste you know that gives us the

331
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,680
freedom to really craft a review with a specific focus as opposed to like a game magazine.

332
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,960
I think that those game magazines were wrong headed to do that in the first place though

333
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,960
because they're trying to predict what they think people like and care about and like

334
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,640
I think that you just need to be honest about it because for instance a great example of

335
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,680
something where I think that this that it got saved by reviews taking the opposite stance

336
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,920
is the Souls series because when Demon Souls came out obviously that's a pretty hardcore

337
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,520
game not everybody was going to love it but GameSpot gave that their game of the year

338
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,920
they were like Demon Souls is fucking perfect if this is your type of game this is exactly

339
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,320
what you need go get this and the the like groundswell of recognition surrounding that

340
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,400
that game because everybody who played it was like this is the fucking sick of shit

341
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,080
ever so then when Dark Souls came out all of those people were like really talking about

342
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,360
and they wouldn't shut up about it and like that made it able to be successful and it's

343
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,800
like now the Souls games are like millions selling you know it's a it's a huge game

344
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,680
franchise even though like nobody would tell you oh this will appeal to everyone but guess

345
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,000
what most people are willing to bend their tastes a little bit if they hear that it's

346
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,840
supposed to be good then they will try to engage a little harder so if you give Shinobi

347
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,800
a 7 out of 10 and you're like you know it's too hard for most people they're gonna play

348
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
it and they're gonna go oh it's too hard I can't get into it but if you give it a 10

349
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
out of 10 and then someone picks it up and they're like this game is really fucking hard

350
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,480
but I know it's supposed to be a masterpiece which means that it's probably my fault I'm

351
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,360
not understanding it I'm gonna try harder basically we're all sheep and we need to be

352
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:03,000
led like cattle I was just gonna say Tom I think the problem here is the allure of the

353
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,240
just x out of 10 generic rating scale and the simplicity of it is so powerful that and

354
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,800
it's so to like a useful metric for people to not have to like look any further than

355
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,120
just that that you're you're really fighting an uphill battle trying to get people to like

356
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,120
think as a teenager I always felt bad for okay come on read the review this time read

357
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,360
the review this time be literary god damn it ah numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers

358
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,000
fuck again why am I paying for this but looking back as someone who's written reviews

359
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,640
other reviews were shitty and boring I was averting my eyes from literary filth from wasted

360
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,000
brain cells still to this day I mostly look at review scores with those magazines because when

361
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,080
I try to read them like I get game informer sent to my house and like I just give them the scores

362
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,520
and what I'm looking for is what got under a seven because anything that gets under a seven a

363
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,840
game informer is like unplayable I was like recently nothing gets under a seven if I became

364
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,480
like if I if my career I switched it to making documentaries I would make like my magnum opus

365
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,480
a documentary called the IGN seven about and it would start by just talking about IGN and its

366
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,120
culture of you know the whole cultural idea of anything less than the seven is bad but that

367
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,000
just means that it's this weird way of looking at the world and I very slowly start to pan out to

368
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,480
the rest of media and how we think of us out of a seven and then I slowly spiral out to seven out

369
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:41,080
of ten being the mindset that holds back all of human progress this idea that we need to chase

370
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,960
what we see as good but what is good is actually just mediocre I'm gonna finally break it down

371
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,200
right now what the IGN seven actually means because I think that the reality is when IGN

372
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,480
gives something a 10 or a nine it's because they think everyone in their audience will enjoy it

373
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,200
when they give it a seven it's because they know someone in their audience this is their favorite

374
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,000
game but not enough and when they give something less than a seven it means it's actually a bad

375
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,280
game so like the seven out of ten it's such a it's such a weird milk toast middle rating because

376
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:19,960
like for instance jrpg's they if you look at review scores in any major publication you will

377
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,920
never see a jrpg get a 10 no matter what the absolute the ones that are considered like the

378
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:34,440
greatest of all time might get like a nine to a nine point two five and the ones that are like

379
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,440
really good will get like an eight to an eight point five and the ones that are like jrpg

380
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,400
fans will like it will get a seven and it would have to be like broken and unplayable to get below

381
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,480
a seven but like that's all the mindset is it's just like seven out of ten means play it if you're

382
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,760
into this genre eight out of ten means like you know definitely play it if you're into this genre

383
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,920
nine out of ten means if you care about rpg's this will be your your new magnum opus but like it

384
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,520
will never get a 10 even if it is legitimately one of the best games ever made just because it's a

385
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,560
jrpg and like they know that most people won't play it um but i just think it's wrongheaded

386
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,480
because i think there was a time when jrpg's could be the greatest game of all time and there's no

387
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,640
reason we couldn't get back there so like for for magazines to try to instead of just saying like

388
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,800
this game's a 10 out of 10 let's make a cultural shift and and go back to appreciating jrpg's

389
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,080
instead they just say well we can't give it a 10 because this is not a popular genre it doesn't

390
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,160
matter if persona five sells as well as a you know major title i think for for game informer in

391
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,760
particular they also have like another reason for never giving below a seven and i think it's just

392
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,200
because like they're owned by game stop and like games off they want to sell games so if they give

393
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,480
the more games they give seven or higher the more like titles they have to sell at their stores

394
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,160
the conversation shifted a little bit but that's why i look sorry i just want to say that's why i

395
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,160
like looking at the ones that get under a seven because it's when it's like so bad they won't

396
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,120
even shill it they're like because they know that if you go buy this game it's gonna make

397
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:20,600
game stop look bad for selling it to you you know to go back to the the idea of like like top 40 and

398
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,840
you know popular movies and stuff like that are we being cynical or are the people who are flocking

399
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,520
into these things just genuine fans because i have a i have a friend who i didn't know could exist until

400
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,680
i met him and this person is just a diehard honest to god like he loves marvel movies he just

401
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,320
wants to see them with all of his life and he has a ton of friends who are the same i i i've

402
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,680
sort of cracked into the the norm a lot of my friends are like that yeah so who are we to say

403
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,880
that they are not enjoying them and they're just kind of being i'm not saying that at all i i think

404
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,640
those movies are legitimately good for the most part and i definitely think the reason that like

405
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,880
the avengers movies get such like absolutely insane ratings is partly this it's that it keeps

406
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,440
coming back up so people get used to it and and they want to be a part of it because it's like an

407
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,720
ongoing narrative but it's not that i don't think people would naturally watch those movies it's

408
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,240
the problem is that it takes them away from everything else it's that it's that we're siphoning

409
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,320
people into just a few places and like sort of being like hey you know this is a thing you recognize

410
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,520
go look at it again and again and again and it's like there's no attempt to make people

411
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,000
go to something they don't aren't already comfortable with you know but i think most

412
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,120
people would you know most people would like something that they're not comfortable with

413
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,040
they just need to be showing it and like you know co-recently went out i didn't go but she went

414
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,960
with like i think her mom or her friend or whatever and watched crazy rich asians don't

415
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,880
think it's a movie i would like but she came home and she was like almost a different person

416
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,640
for about 36 hours she was so happy she was just she was simply filled with energy and vigor

417
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:13,880
more than she usually is and i was like damn man and that's what people out what i don't know it was

418
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,160
just a movie that she liked a lot you know i think that i think a lot of people um like the stuff

419
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:25,720
that people tend to say is their favorite is rarely the one that is the super big popular

420
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,200
tentpole media because everyone likes that thing but it's made you know it's made to appeal to

421
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:39,400
everyone and like most people whatever is their number one favorite is something that is more

422
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,640
you know true to their their them personally but like most people aren't like me where they've

423
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,640
gone out and like watched everything in the effort of finding that one thing that appeals to them most

424
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,360
most people it's like they happened upon one thing like yeah and you see this a lot with newer anime

425
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,760
fans where it's like whatever is their favorite is usually something they saw in like the first

426
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,600
10 shows they watched and it like blew them away and it could be something that like they're like oh

427
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,520
my god like it's online a good example like because even though it's huge like you know on a world

428
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,840
scale when you think about it as an individual person living it in the world like most people

429
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,120
haven't heard of sword art online so like like average joe so like when someone finds out about it

430
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,080
from their friend who's like dude you gotta watch this show sword art online and then they watch it

431
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,280
never having seen anime before never having seen a show about being trapped in an mmo never having

432
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:42,600
seen a show about like a death game never having seen a show with you know with this or that element

433
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,440
maybe even just a fan service that they're very young and they're sexually you know like they're

434
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,400
just starting to feel you know sexually like awakened and then they see this like really

435
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,120
raunchy shit and they're like whoa my dick is exploding like that's the kind of shit that will

436
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,520
make people say like oh my god this is my favorite show i can't believe it and then like someone like

437
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:07,560
me who's literally watched 10 000 of the same exact thing but better is like oh boy you know but i

438
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,920
totally understand why people like it it's just a matter of like when i see those people i just want

439
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:20,360
to say well let me entreat you to to to some more let me show you there's an endless world of things

440
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,920
out there that might appeal to you even more specifically because everybody's a little bit

441
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,520
different and so there's probably something that appeals to every individual person a little

442
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,760
differently from everybody else around them you know that's true it's just that most people don't

443
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:41,160
give a shit right not like not even close and for most people i think about my dad for example

444
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,560
my dad watches and i know that he's not the typical yet but like this will be like when our

445
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,400
generation becomes dads like that'll be us then and then it'll be you know the next year blah blah

446
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,880
like he couldn't give less of a shit about like like what would my dad ends up watching is like

447
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:04,120
like fox 24 style shows like crime dramas you know and like like real world stuff that he can

448
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,240
he like he like gets it he's like ah yes i understand what this is and like he'll watch the

449
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,040
stuff that falls into his lap and now that there's like Netflix and the on-demand stuff like it's

450
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,880
easier for him to like to find those things and watch more but like he is not i mean he's not

451
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,280
going on youtube this will change slightly as as youtube like takes over more and like i think that

452
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,880
like tom was saying more personal tastes we'll be able to permeate just as like it's not one monolith

453
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,600
now that controls everything but more smaller voices that reach more people let me let me expand

454
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,760
this beyond just media because it supplies to everything in culture a huge one is food and it's

455
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,360
really funny to me that they're like nobody comes out the pussy with a specific preference for food

456
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,960
like probably not if you're american and all you eat is american food it's because all you've eaten

457
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,000
is american food you grew up with it you're used to people who only want to eat hamburgers that that

458
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,400
marvel movie friend is just like that all i want to do is eat hamburgers and just have the meat

459
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,560
the the cheese the bun interesting to use like that yeah like and i i know a lot of people like

460
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:14,200
that who who won't even go to like a restaurant from like you know you say oh let's try out this

461
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,720
tie place and they're like oh like what is a i don't know about that and it's like it's the same

462
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,000
fucking thing they first of all there's only like six animals we actually eat on this goddamn planet

463
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,720
they eat the same shit everywhere they just cook it slightly differently with a with a few extra

464
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:37,000
peppers like you'll be fine go to the fucking tie place i okay i i i am a picky eater i was a picky

465
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,760
eater ever since i was a kid so i sympathize with but ever like like recently i was okay much i was

466
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,040
a picky eater too it's not it's not hard i'm gonna pick up new cultures of food it's not it's not

467
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,240
dude right okay or these good restaurants and figure out if you do like Thai food or whatever

468
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,000
right i grew up as a super fucking picky eater as a kid all i ate was like macaroni and kid

469
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,680
cuisines and like i was raised on garbage like outright garbage food and it wasn't until like

470
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:10,680
my late teens when i just because of the fact that i was applying this logic to anime that like

471
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,640
in my early days watching anime all i liked was action shows and shit like that and then

472
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,320
when i got introduced to like cute girls shows because that was kind of the zeitgeist in the

473
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,000
late 2000 and i started liking that it made me able to start exploring and like the first time i

474
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,360
watched like princess tutu for instance i was like this is way too girly i can't sit do something this

475
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:36,600
girly and then like gradually i got into girly or shows through like hard catch pre-care because it

476
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,960
has cool action scenes in it and then it acclimates you and then at some point you're like it made me

477
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,200
realize oh like all you have to do is just get used to it whatever part of it that that strikes

478
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,840
you is weird or you're not sure about just exposure expose yourself to it and eventually

479
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,720
you'll like it so i went through that process with anime and then i went well surely this applies

480
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,320
to everything else so i taught myself to like spicy food i couldn't even handle texas peat

481
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,920
i couldn't even handle like fucking fire sauce at at taco bell and i trained myself up to be able

482
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,000
to handle like really spicy thai food and it's just like i now i'm sure how high your spice

483
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,080
tolerance is i remember me you and ben at a vietnamese place i believe i was it was like a yeah i

484
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,880
think it was that and there's they have some sort of pepper or thing with jig in the middle of the

485
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,960
bowls and you pointed that it's a thai place oh it's a thai place okay you pointed that shit and said

486
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,760
okay so that thing right there that thing is hot af yeah but be careful guys all right and so ben

487
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,960
ate it and was like i'm gonna have to a little bit hot and i ate it i was like wait this is like

488
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,520
dangerous and we just sort of looked at you and you just sort of i think it was just that it was

489
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:56,680
the wrong one oh oh i'm weak no it i think it was that i had misjudged what pepper it was

490
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,960
because like i know for a fact ben spice tolerance is no better than mine so uh but like i mean at

491
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,640
the time that you guys were living with me my tolerance had already gone down because i was not

492
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,840
training myself anymore like well i literally spent a year like non-stop eating nothing but

493
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,640
spicy food until i had a high tolerance and then it completely went to shit when i stopped eating

494
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,320
spicy that makes sense as an explanation but that i it's still been in my um rotation of funny

495
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,880
things to make fun of my friends i told people all the time you're gonna have to like fill me with

496
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,800
evidence in triplicate signed for me to like take that out of my rotation sorry when i was in Rome

497
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,640
the worst i don't want to take that out of your rotation because that is so innocent the absolute

498
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,680
worst thing that i saw people do like the different tourists that would walk past all the anglo pieces

499
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:51,000
of shit i would walk past some tourist trap and i would see people in Rome in the capital of Italy

500
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,560
i see it's been saying for that like like like hundreds of thousands of years they walk they go

501
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:06,680
here and they order spaghetti at meatballs at some fucking irish persians tourist trap italian

502
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,760
restaurant they don't go out and actually try italian food why would you come here if you just

503
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,360
want to order the same things that you can order at home what is the point you spent hundreds of

504
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,680
dollars to get here why are you like this why i hear reviewer people talk about how oh you know

505
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,440
you need to have better taste games or movies or whatever what comes to my mind is the dentist

506
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,760
fallacy which is that dentists feel matter at all that they think that they have the right to talk

507
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,520
to you like children because you aren't taking care of your teeth and the thing is that oh hey you

508
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,880
know trained medical professional who's got your life vaguely together is able to like go to sleep

509
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,680
and wake up at the same time therefore have a time to brush your teeth right you know some people

510
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,720
have depression or anxiety or they just fall asleep randomly you know it's fucking hard it's not

511
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:06,360
it's good to brush your teeth yeah i brush my teeth every night did you guys know that it was harder

512
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:12,040
did you guys know that dentists have like an extremely high suicide rate ha ha ha yeah it's

513
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:17,400
because their practitioners fucking based on lies no it's because they always have lost to hang

514
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,400
let me tell you right now guys i i i talked about this on a recent um pub crawl but i want to hear

515
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:31,240
your thoughts you don't have to brush your teeth all you have to do all you have to do to make your

516
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:42,200
teeth okay is to not consume sugar sure if you consume i know people who brush their teeth every

517
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:50,440
day twice a day still get cavities because they drink soda but i know people who don't brush well

518
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,320
this happened to me for a while when i quit soda for there was like a good year span where my teeth

519
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,560
were perfectly fine in spite of not brushing just as i have always not done and um your no cavity of

520
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,720
like acceptable teeth though is like way off like a rows of normal for this movement like

521
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,040
acceptable teeth is teeth that don't get cavities i mean okay as british standards by the way

522
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,240
that's the thing like most like the main reason to brush your teeth is if you want them to be white

523
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,720
and like i do which most like it's very highly valued here in america just because it's a big

524
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,280
fucking cultural meme yeah that's true and uh here we are in america conditioning stop being gay

525
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:39,960
i'm just uh i'm not proud of my poor hygiene i have poor hygiene but i'm not proud of it i'm not

526
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,120
gonna start it's not poor hygiene to have non-white teeth like teeth are not natural brush your

527
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:54,280
teeth at all or clean a part of your body because it's i'm telling you like okay i'm not i'm not

528
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,600
saying my teeth are in a good state i'm not like proud of the of my teeth because of the fact that

529
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:05,960
i do drink lots of soda and and uh fucking sugar and so my teeth do have problems but like i'm just

530
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,720
saying that that brushing your teeth is not the solution to avoiding cavities because you will

531
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,600
get cavities anyways if you consume and most of the people i know consult a medical practitioner

532
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:22,920
before listening to digi bro there's no dentist that will tell you that you just have to brush your

533
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,200
teeth and no one no no dentist will not say you have to not drink soda they'll all say that yeah

534
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,200
but they're like okay the thing about dentistry is that it is mostly a cosmetic business like it's

535
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,120
not really a health care service they dress it up with that so that people will feel that they have

536
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,480
to go but like dentistry is primarily cosmetic it's mostly about having straight and white

537
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,040
teeth and that's why everything in the fucking place is about how straight and white your teeth

538
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,600
can be straight and white it sounds like pastry oh yeah exactly we gotta get that

539
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:02,040
exactly listen i hate dentists as much as the next person but i i don't i'm the clean your teeth

540
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,840
and not drinking soda thing it's not convincing me i don't even dislike i don't even dislike going

541
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,680
to the dentist by the way i'm like a freak who doesn't even hate going to the dentist because

542
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,560
i've been so many times that i'm okay with sure yeah uh i think that's proof of what you're saying

543
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,080
earlier the more you repeat something that i mean i'm happy i'm happy to be agnostic about

544
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,480
whether or not it's actually necessary to brush your teeth or like if you can just like that's all

545
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,080
fine but i and i'm also sympathetic to this thing that like yeah it is one like i've been to japan

546
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,160
i've seen the people there with their fucked up teeth uh and that's just normal and most of them

547
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,440
don't like in a lot of those places where people have they have teeth that look fucked up because

548
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,360
they're crooked and they're not white but they're not unhealthy because those people don't drink the

549
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,320
amount of soda that we do in america they are not like they're not putting tons of fucking sugar in

550
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,360
their mouth and like the sugar is what rots your teeth like it might as well be one it's it's most

551
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,520
convenient to think of it as one to one hey man i'm sure you encourage people to consume less

552
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:06,280
sugar hundred percent one like i look at someone's one cavity like i look at devu who has a lot of

553
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,320
pride in never having had cavities and he brushes his teeth all the time but he also almost doesn't

554
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:16,360
consume sugar so like you know what the fucked up thing the most fucked up thing in my entire life

555
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:23,880
was was i okay i was so terrible about drinking soda like my entire life like from like age one

556
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,000
to like like recently i was just drinking like two cans a day it was awful it was horrible

557
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,880
two and i never had i never had a single cavity until i stopped drinking soda and then i got a

558
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,760
fucking cavity out of nowhere it's it's it's fucking not fair it was like a maybe it was like

559
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,680
that thing that mr burns has were like all the diseases were like trying to push through all

560
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,160
at once but then it's like if you take away a bunch of them then a couple can actually get through

561
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,280
yeah because i don't know so i brought up the dentist thing because i call it the dentist

562
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,120
fallacy because it's the thing that this person chose to specialize in and they have tunnel vision

563
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,480
regarding its importance and so imagine you know some people are like what you don't uh know

564
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:11,400
which is sub sub sub genre of metal is on the radio right now how are you living a functional

565
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:20,600
life if you don't know uh eight late 80s thrash hardcore from 90s thrash hardcore bitch the thing

566
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:27,160
about that though is that if you spend a couple of years listening to people like digis let's play

567
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,960
part of genre well whatever it doesn't matter you're the i know i know i know i don't have a

568
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:41,720
dysfunctional life i have to come up with a fake metal sub genre so so uh if you listen to people

569
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,040
who have who are always persnickety about having good opinions like digi who who insists you you

570
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,600
think your opinions out really long the more you listen to his shit the more you find out that he

571
00:43:52,600 --> 00:44:00,200
does in fact apply this process to everything his chairs his walls his ceilings his floors his

572
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:09,080
houses his mouses his food his life his everything so it's not hypocrisy apply to all these things

573
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,200
the same logic of like experiment with absolutely everything and find the best one and and the

574
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:25,000
reason i feel that way is just that i see so many people that like they most people live sub optimally

575
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,120
and i don't just mean in terms of efficiency i mean in terms of like just their own mental well-being

576
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,960
like most people they just kind of get a job and then they have the job and it's like shouldn't

577
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:45,560
you be looking for the job that you can do best that will have the best min max of you know energy

578
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:52,120
put forth to rewards taken shouldn't you be looking like if you're gonna spend all your time watching

579
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,120
watching shit shouldn't you try to watch it that will give you something well if you're gonna play

580
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,040
a lot of video games shouldn't you go find the video games you'll really love and like i think most

581
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:09,240
people they'll consume and like with those those broad pop cultural things most of them again are

582
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:15,960
not bad most of them appeal to almost everybody in a very shallow way and so people will always say

583
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,800
like oh yeah i've played the new assassins creed i played the new call of duty i played the new

584
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,040
whatever but then like when you ask what's your favorite game it's never one of those it's always

585
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,160
something unique that they played usually as a kid because when you're a kid you don't know the

586
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,800
pop culture zeitgeist is easily you just go to the store and pick something that looks cool

587
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,400
and like maybe you you've did that a lot and you got a lot of bullshit that wasn't good so you stopped

588
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,840
that method but there was that one time you got that thing that was like life-changingly awesome

589
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,080
and it's been your favorite ever since and it's like you can have that again well you know what

590
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:58,760
it is um people treat life like they've just arrived in an unexplored land and they've they've

591
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,640
got to find where they're going to live and so like there are people live here like there are

592
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,880
signposts as to where to go in this new con that they've just arrived on and so they go through

593
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,960
and you know they'll find like you know the cities which are like the popular things like ah there's

594
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,040
a lot of good here uh maybe i'll keep going and and keep looking elsewhere but a lot of people

595
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,320
are just going to be like like this city's got everything i need man like why am i gonna keep

596
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,640
going and then of course some people are gonna like go out and they're kind of forge their own

597
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,160
path and discover new places and and find new trails and stuff and you know they'll find cool

598
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,080
stuff that other people didn't know and then some of those people will establish a new city and then

599
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,240
people will flock to that and some of those people will keep going others will stay there and be like

600
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,320
i'm content here because and like and maybe someone will make it they're on a new trail

601
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,720
they're like they find like a nice little valley or something they're like it's all metaphor

602
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,560
obviously and they're like you know what this is a nice place i'm just gonna camp it right here

603
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,920
even though over the next hill is like i don't know like a gold mine is like something that would

604
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,040
be incredible but like it requires energy and effort to continue to seek these things and so

605
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,240
after a while people are just like you know i'm content right here the majority of people are

606
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,200
just lazy just in everything you know well you could call it lazy but like it's fine for people

607
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:15,320
to just be content uh it's what i was saying when i was talking about the i g and seven of life

608
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,760
um you guys i'm sure know the allegory of the cave like and i think that's what we're kind of

609
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,160
describing here is like i guess you're right i guess you're right yeah like you don't know what's

610
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,240
above what's on the surface till you get i mean the first episode of growing the gond is literally

611
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,760
the allegory of the cave made into a show so let's make it let's make it relevant to anime uh

612
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,600
yeah and growing the gond it's like nobody believes coming out the surface is real

613
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,320
and he's like look all of our fucking people just like die in landslides all the time like don't

614
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:50,440
you think it would be nice if we lived somewhere where that didn't happen like but most people are

615
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,480
just like well i mean yeah that's how life is that's just what life is and it's like every time there's

616
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,600
something if there's anything that bothers me in my life my first thought is always there must be a

617
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:07,400
better way like surely and uh and i'm not even amazing at it tom was uh was telling me that

618
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,600
this is why he knows so much about computers because like tom is great at this i run into

619
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:18,760
lots of issues with with my computer and like i i've taken to just anytime anything goes wrong i

620
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,240
just asked tom and he's always found a solution for it because the second something bothers him

621
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:28,760
he goes well i know that this this can't be the way you know like there has to be something we can

622
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:34,200
do to a lot of us yeah i that's i totally do that with tom too a lot of computer and like

623
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,720
software issues are like black boxes and because you don't know that there even is a fix uh like

624
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,120
i feel actually there i there's a there's a there's a voicemail today that describes like

625
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:50,840
kind of a solution to our like voicemail uh issues and like because i had no idea how to do it uh

626
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,160
none of this would have made sense i never would have thought to do things this way but uh and we'll

627
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:04,200
get to that um but yeah i mean tangentially related but i am really sick of safe movies and

628
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:09,400
not just because they they upset me in the moment and you know like like i'm upset i want a movie

629
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,200
with like a 10 to 20 chance that i'll just be eviscerated while watching the movie i'm sick of

630
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:20,680
these safe movies ironically i'm upset with them because the like safe movies have not been the

631
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,400
most popular movies of all time and they haven't been for like a long time

632
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,720
nay if you remember is that true though isn't marvel like by far the most popular right now

633
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,120
yeah i'm saying that's not always been the case oh it hasn't always been okay nay do you remember

634
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,200
in the final fantasy lecture how i was mildly unimpressed with your eye over final fantasy

635
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,640
because like what the last few games have been bad you know like whatever yes i don't care um and i

636
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,600
haven't uh i haven't forgiven you yet for feeling that way okay well well i forgive you because i

637
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:56,840
haven't spiritually felt that until i re-watch a lot of disney movies and i realized how good

638
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:03,880
renaissance disney is and it is unorally some of my favorite art of all time and i think about how

639
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:11,400
every single year from like 1989 to like 1990 or to however long the renaissance was

640
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:21,320
every single fucking year what he said 1989 to 1990 oh oh sorry sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry

641
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,240
well what's the one movie that was it like little mermaid and just little mermaid or something

642
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:30,520
yeah yeah uh but every single year they popped out like incredible movies with like unbelievable

643
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,640
projection values that are ironically like like la hunchback no chadam takes fucking risk sure it

644
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,280
has the shit gargles that everyone hates and is a huge fucking meme but it honestly takes

645
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,760
risk in a lot of different ways that's sanctuary scene we're causing more crimes no chadam and he

646
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,480
fucking screams sanctuary down the crowd and it's fucking beautiful by the way those are ground

647
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,720
baking pieces of media that came out every single year like the final original final fantasy games

648
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:59,080
and then it just like peered out for a while and like zootopia is good but like it's not trying to

649
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:03,800
be like the hunchback of no drum it's not trying to have these incredible set pieces or make any

650
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:10,680
broad like real statements it has all about that organizational momentum organizational momentum

651
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:17,080
and like belief in the project and just morale and the creative flow and when it's on it's fucking

652
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:22,680
on and then the white 2k disaster didn't fry computers but it fried many creative minds

653
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,600
so it would seem and by the way uh they didn't make one in 1993 but that's because they were

654
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:34,120
working on the lion king so that would make sense but talking about king is the best production

655
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:40,440
cycle of all time talking about the fucking gargoyles from from hunchback you know i thought you

656
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,520
were gonna complain about disney movies because i complained about them for things like the gargoyles

657
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,960
because that's a safety measure because literally they're like oh but this one has like you know

658
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:56,440
issues of image and looking ugly and also has like suggested rape and it criticizes christians

659
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,960
and it doesn't have like a whole lot of goofy scenes we need to inject some really uninspired

660
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:09,240
goofy characters so that people who don't like serious catholic shit will be able to at least

661
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:16,600
sit through the movie okay that okay that is the fucking word the gargoyles are the worst thing in

662
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:23,240
any disney movie ever because it's such a bizarre half measure that makes no sense if you think about

663
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:28,360
for more than two fucking seconds okay in a disney movie you would think if the writers have some

664
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,800
sort of dark tones they wanted to explore disney would say okay yeah don't explore those because

665
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,160
this is disney and we don't want to have that in a movie because you know our target audience is

666
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,360
children we don't want to have dark tones but they have dark tones and execute them beautifully i've

667
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:47,880
watched hunchback notion down extremely recently in the past month uh fucking literal nine i love

668
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:54,840
that movie uh and it executes its themes perfectly but then they're like well oh you know i'm getting

669
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,160
kind of scared like you know pull the call on my shirt sweat in a little bit this is a dark movie

670
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,360
time to add the gargoyles so you know like the kids will still be interested but here's the thing

671
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,960
there's still all of the dark shit there so if you're a baby and you're amused by jess now xana

672
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,640
saying pour the wine and cut the cheese then you're going to be scared by claud throw a little

673
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:22,440
fucking raping ismeralda on screen and burning her to death and likewise if you're an adult who

674
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,000
likes frollo trying to rape ismeralda you're gonna be like oh the fucking gargoyles oh my god

675
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:35,000
raises paw yeah yeah so no one's going to be happy no one's going to like like either of these

676
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,880
two things you're not appeasing the children you're making them sit through a boring movie they won't

677
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:45,000
like there's there comes a time i think with big productions where they where they say it's a sad

678
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
thing but companies have to do this a lot they say we know we're not going to please everyone

679
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,920
all the way so we're gonna try to please or you know like they said like okay throw out the united

680
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:03,080
collective possible 10 out of 10 vision for some people instead we will take like across the board

681
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,280
eights or like across the board nines that we can get which is sad it's a sad artistic compromise

682
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,520
but i guess that's just business the bizarre part is is that it comes so close the hunter

683
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:19,080
no shame comes so close to just being a great movie with no flaws and i just think if disney

684
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:25,160
just a fucking if michael eisner just allowed the things to continue the way that all the writers

685
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,360
and all the artists want to push it to and they allowed the creative produce to go to like like

686
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,960
up to 11 and they allowed to have all the crazy dark shit that they want to put in it and you know

687
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:42,040
this one movie in this fucking like 10 year run of great movies that all peer to children this

688
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:49,080
one movie oh i'm so sorry it's like an e10 plus rating oh you know heaven forbid that they would

689
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:54,600
have swept the fucking academy awards they would have won every single like academy that they could

690
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,400
it would be great and everyone would have looked back on extremely fond but the problem is now but

691
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,120
the gargles and all you know a couple other shit just makes it so that couldn't reach the heights

692
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:08,360
that it could have otherwise because they were so scared about not reaching their usual target

693
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,920
i just want to i want to corroborate all of munchie's opinions on hunchback

694
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:19,240
it's the only movie i actually like from that era though uh i think of almost every movie in that

695
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:25,080
is fucking key now i've i've been recently i've been i've been watching just movies a lot recently

696
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:30,200
i think they're all landmarks in cinema and animation they're beautiful to look at they all

697
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,000
have incredible colors and they all have incredible animation i just could talk about them forever i

698
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,640
love the meta story behind disney and era i love the story behind michael isner and how he came

699
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,240
to be all this sort of stuff everything about them is perfect and they bring such joy to my heart

700
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:48,200
they are the best movies of all time well it's the best common part of history of all time to swing

701
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:56,840
in with a big fat pseudo disagreement my problem with probably the entire company-wide creative

702
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:04,680
philosophy of the entire disney super conglomerate since the late 80s can be summed up in the

703
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:11,480
fact that they boast about how many times they rewrite and re-storyboard their shit during the

704
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:18,600
production process which they frame as a constant effort of evolution and bringing the story and

705
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:24,680
the film to a greater height of of optimal realization but when i walk away from their movies

706
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,560
i come away underwhelmed thinking i felt like i just watched a frankenstein together mishmash

707
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:35,240
pishposh of different ideas that kept getting edited and i felt like i was like this was not a

708
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,880
smooth ride because i kept bumping over a shitload of staples what i don't know what the gargoyles

709
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:45,400
are what movie are referring to specifically when you think all of them starting with the little

710
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,520
mermaid um most of them they're all like like hodgepodge frankenstein like has someone much

711
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:56,040
had to know it was obvious i feel like the gargoyle effect is similar to i mean i i've always hated

712
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,560
the hakuna matata sequence in like lion king i just thought it was really lame and boring and

713
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:07,880
like for babies wait but that progresses the plot and it's and it's a fun music no no i was

714
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,720
exaggeration i hate fun i was uh the progress is great the progress is great and it progresses the

715
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:19,640
plot and it's a montage so that i was exaggerating when i said all of the problem i specifically

716
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:27,160
mean dumb and boring frozen i don't see the appeal i prefer watching nala uh you know get

717
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:33,880
clearly wet during can you feel the love tonight that's that's the kino moment right there hey you

718
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,600
know all this talk of like i i think the lion king is a great movie and i think it's i think it's a

719
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,640
great movie and not boring yeah that's a that's a very that's pretty much the opinion of everyone

720
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,720
other than me munchie so munchie are you ready for the lion king to get totally ruined when they

721
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:54,600
redo it oh yeah oh okay the disney live action movies are so bad action or something yeah i think

722
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:01,960
it's a live action realistic cg oh are you what yeah i know it's gonna be fucking crazy dude okay okay

723
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,480
okay okay all right i read an article about the live action lad which is my favorite disney movie

724
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,760
except it's not because hulture james but you know i like a lad and always have a place in my heart

725
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:16,280
because i like this next game uh and shout out to robin williams get hang in yourself will give you

726
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,880
such a crick in the neck robin williams uh uh there was a live there's a live action

727
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,840
land coming out soon like in the next couple years and one of the articles was don't worry guys

728
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,000
we're going to make jasmine way more feminist like you know she was just she was just a you know

729
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,680
cool sexy lamp and i'm not no way no way i'm not against jasmine being feminist but here's the

730
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:42,600
thing she already fucking was and that was her entire character that she was a feminist so okay i'm

731
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,160
not upset that they're going to make her more feminist i'm upset that these people are framing

732
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:52,440
it like they've done justice to land like you know we've no we don't understand the story to make

733
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,240
jasmine more feminist but no it's already there monchi what they mean is they're going to put more

734
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:02,600
clothes on jasmine they're going to take this character who dresses light because she lives in

735
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,800
a desert and they're going to put her in more clothes okay so they're gonna watch so they're

736
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,560
gonna keep in the original lad you know she runs away from home she doesn't want to be treated like

737
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,160
a toy you know she she she doesn't want to be married someone who she doesn't love you know she

738
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,560
does all these proactive things in the plot oh that's not feminist slap a brick out of the oh

739
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:26,920
dude i'm gonna i'm gonna get up we've done now uh um because what would be more feminist than

740
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,760
being ashamed of the human body yeah pretty much i i mean i don't know i guess it's not about this

741
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,120
is why the the like birk or whatever is like a weird feminist thing because like okay true it does

742
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:45,240
cut off the that evil sinister male gaze but at the expense of like a woman being you know like

743
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:50,040
unable to kind of express us like is that worth it is this disclaimer monchi's opinions have stopped

744
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:55,080
when he stopped talking uh understood understood look whatever i don't care about this i was just

745
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:00,680
gonna say about this topic of corporate meddling and like uh i don't know like like a creative spark

746
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:06,200
being kind of like uh interfered with by by business necessity like i get why it happens

747
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:12,520
and it reminds me of what happened to elon musk recently uh which was just he he stepped down

748
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,560
from uh the board of directors at tesla he's still ceo but he stepped down from the board of directors

749
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,160
did he step down or was he forced out because i know he's not the chair well i mean there was

750
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,760
pressure he he stepped down is what i read um i mean you know he i'm sure this was in reaction

751
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,280
to pressure so how much of this was like volunteer i mean i don't know exactly i'm sure it was just

752
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,920
to control it apparently worked out a deal of some kind where this was like the thing he probably

753
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,880
like did that got to stay being ceo doesn't matter but like the point is um the reason why he had to

754
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,800
do it was because after his appearance on the joe rogan podcast where he smoked the weed um like

755
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,520
there was a lot of people were criticizing him and shit and in response to that he made a tweet

756
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:56,200
he made a tweet it's all about this one tweet which was um thinking about taking it was something

757
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:03,480
like thinking about taking tesla public at four twenty dollars per share or whatever it was um and

758
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,840
and then the further line was funding secured and the issue is with that funding secured line

759
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:15,080
because it turns out that was like not really true and like okay this was clearly like a joke

760
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:20,920
but you have to like because he's such a huge guy and like the court like he is the ceo and it was

761
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:27,000
chairman of the board of this giant company that does these big important things like i guess he

762
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,280
does have these responsibilities to be like completely truthful and not mislead people at all

763
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,360
because i don't know maybe somebody when they heard that news like invested their life saving

764
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:40,600
because i don't know what's going to do this this time to make no this is this is this is people

765
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:46,920
who who had it out for elon and this was a convenient excuse oh just need a god damn satire tag

766
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:52,440
what is saying is that he did this this is why slash s at the end of that post this is why saved

767
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,760
everything corporations are the worst everyone just needs to work by themselves in isolation

768
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,240
have a patreon doesn't matter how big your dreams are no one has twitter twitter rooms

769
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:06,920
everyone's careers i love elon and yes twitter definitely did fuck him up real bad here i don't

770
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:14,200
actually think that like this is such a like elon is kind of a weird unstable guy like he whatever

771
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,640
he's got like a crazy sense humor it's fine i like him a lot i think he's like the best human on the

772
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:25,240
planet basically but still the fact remains that he is a weirdo uh who like is like when you're

773
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:30,920
the CEO of a company like you kind of are held to just a way higher standard because people are

774
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,160
depending on you and i really do believe in the philosophy of like with great power comes great

775
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:40,520
responsibility and it sucks and you're gonna get fucked over real easily yeah but it's with great

776
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:45,800
power comes great responsibility not with great power comes no sense of humor like like okay i hear

777
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:50,280
you i hear you but the thing is i don't know how much of that was actually a joke and i haven't

778
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:56,120
looked into it for 20 a share yeah yeah what there's no way that was gonna be you know what

779
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:01,320
would uh what that reminds me of talking about when you ascend to some higher plane of status

780
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:07,720
people put responsibility on you now um chairman of a company statements you make about the company

781
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:16,200
you're the chairman of that makes sense but what to me is weird is most subscribed youtubers

782
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:24,200
responsibility to not say the n word because it'll fuck up our ad revenue how dare you do that

783
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:31,960
you gotta take the black you fucked this up for us pewdiepie i'm sure that if i through the

784
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:37,880
lottery of the algorithms had become the most subscribed youtuber i would have changed my

785
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:43,400
philosophy my self-serving desire to get on youtube and would have elected myself the fucking pope

786
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:51,160
bishop of youtube and changed my whole priority to be about supporting the youtube community and

787
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,640
not about supporting my own channel like every other goddamn youtuber pewdiepie you're the most

788
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:03,080
subscribed so you need to like look out for us right for some fucking reason the most eyes and i mean

789
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,720
i don't really blame youtube for what they did i just hate that the people whipped up the kind of

790
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:13,560
like uh fear mongering and what's the word uh like reactions that aren't deserved you know something

791
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:19,400
like that whatever it was do all of you guys know about the most popular fortnite streamer maybe just

792
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,600
straight up most popular twitch streamer i don't know shit about this i don't know shit about

793
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:29,320
twitch but i hear about this yeah yeah yeah how he has a mic pens policy to not stream with women

794
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:36,680
yes yes because so to catch everyone up uh if it be some people don't know because he is married

795
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,360
and if he streams with women people are going to go oh are they having an affair oh look at this

796
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,200
thought over here right i believe we briefly discussed this on a previous episode but i'm

797
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:51,320
i'm happy to excuse me i don't listen to the show whoops i'm like one of those early uh biggest

798
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:58,760
problem guests who don't know shit but so i haven't heard this episode either so i'm so sure yeah dad did

799
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,160
you do you know about this whole controversy i've never even heard this guy before i do right so he

800
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:07,880
doesn't stream with women and people have compared it to how mic pens he has a policy of never being

801
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:13,000
alone with a woman and surprisingly there's never been that much of a blowback for that because

802
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,960
people understand because i mean it's happening right now it's like oh there's you know i was

803
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:22,600
raped by this guy 45 years ago right and while we were alone in the room at one point so you

804
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:27,560
don't know for sure right yeah i understand that and and he has the same this this twitch streamer

805
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:32,840
guy has the same policy of i don't want to bring this kind of hammer down on my head and i did

806
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:37,800
read one of those articles you know modern day sjw is now they they have to like write things

807
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,560
really carefully because they know what all the fucking you know shit lord rebuttals are gonna be

808
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:47,480
so they they did but before before you say that i just want to specify for the audience uh of like

809
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:53,480
a big part of why he wants to not be seen with women is that the people like of like the people

810
01:05:53,480 --> 01:06:00,200
themselves his fans don't spread rumors about them having an affair it's mostly consumed about fans

811
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:05,400
and like the online perception his audience think like spreading right about him indeed exactly

812
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,640
yeah yeah recognizing what's happened it sounds like what somebody who's cheating on his wife would

813
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:15,960
say it seems pretty guilty to me we're spreading this rumor around what no i'm not cheating on you

814
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,120
with her if i was cheating on you with her i would pretend to be going out with someone else and then

815
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:27,000
i would go with her in secret tom just reminded me i was uh no please oh well i don't know that

816
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:32,520
wasn't he done he was he was gonna read something oh oh i thought i was i'll get back to it in a

817
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:37,560
second but all i did you say is fucking anyway uh tom reminded me of i was reading this article

818
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:46,280
about um privacy and how the concept of privacy only really began in like the late 1800s because

819
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:53,000
like up until that point most societies were like you know like it was a tight-knit small group who

820
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,640
all needed and relied on each other and there wasn't really that much room for people to even

821
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,760
be doing like vastly different things from one another and because these groups were smaller

822
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:10,280
there also was not even like there was there was like not a conceit of your privacy being at risk

823
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,680
like so whatever you did in the privacy of your home like there wasn't really a concept of like a

824
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:21,000
public figure because you know everyone's everyone's in a small fucking town you can't be there's

825
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,600
no famous people you know right i mean like london existed and like you know there had been

826
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,720
a lot of stuff before i think that's strange to me london is not the one in your thing you know

827
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,840
it's a big city it's on commerce but it's nowhere near like people if you're thinking of like old

828
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,520
if you're thinking of old london you're thinking of like 1800s industrial revolution where everyone's

829
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:45,640
poked like packed into small houses london and that's not how it was and write an article the

830
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,360
ninja guy whatever his name is i don't remember names whenever i read articles i just remember

831
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:55,640
like the ideas right and the article made me realize that like the person who wrote it doesn't

832
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,720
really understand what it's like to be popular l right doesn't understand what it's like to have

833
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:04,040
people know you to be sort of a public figure because the way the article was written again it

834
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:08,360
was one of those ones that was really mincing words you could tell it wasn't to go full you know

835
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:13,240
social justice about it but she knew that you know that would look wrong so she really meant

836
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,600
her words basically saying imagine that being expected to not lie what a shock she was saying

837
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:26,680
basically saying you know the stream his his policy of not streaming with women is misguided

838
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:34,360
it's okay horribly misguided in fact but what does it say about twitch culture that even

839
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:43,240
the most famous twitch streamer is afraid of their backlash and their toxicity and i thought about

840
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:48,920
that joking my chin thinking you know this person she's she writes for a somewhat known

841
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:54,280
like online magazine the one who is the most afraid of the backlash like you would like

842
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:58,680
here's the thing right despite that this woman is obviously a writer or at least a part timer for

843
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:06,920
some website i think i heard of before she probably doesn't have like anyone who like

844
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:13,240
thinks about her work and judges it as like a person if you know what i mean and that despite

845
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:20,440
being like a like a like d-list internet personality myself i've experienced this

846
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:26,440
for the experienced when you've made enough of an impact or made enough of an impression good or bad

847
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:33,320
and you experience absolute strangers picking around at your shit and talking about you like

848
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:38,520
they know you when they when you feel like they don't and it feels like they're talking about you

849
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:45,240
without your permission and it feels fucking weird and i think unless you felt that you don't

850
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:52,200
understand how vulnerable being popular is it doesn't do anything to boost your confidence

851
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:58,360
necessarily it doesn't make you immune to feeling weirdly violated it doesn't make you immune to

852
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:04,680
rumors often people who can stand being a top-level celebrity are just the ones who were

853
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:09,640
bred through the system of just the ones who were able to deal with it in the first place it's not

854
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,640
like becoming a millionaire makes you able to deal with it it's just that the only people who can

855
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,520
deal with it are the only people who stick around in the first place and these rumors can be spread

856
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:25,160
around so easily and with so much hatred right they can be post on encyclopedia and all that

857
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:30,760
should just pass it all over there and do you want that to even like have the chance of impacting

858
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:35,320
your marriage and then and then these people like have this foregone conclusion this isn't even

859
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:40,840
something that's like discussed or analyzed it's just assumed that these people are popular and

860
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:47,800
they have to set a fucking good example for everyone else so top fortnite streamer you need

861
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:55,960
to risk the hurt of your family and your lifestyle and your job and your career because we need fair

862
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:02,520
representation on fortnite right like on fucking twitch right because you don't want to have you

863
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:08,120
know a woman get called thought all all up and down the corner and like all this sexist abuse

864
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:13,480
right you know that's going to happen that's part of why you don't want to do it but it's your

865
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:20,600
responsibility to like try and fight against it and to take the hate upon yourself because you're

866
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,840
the most popular i want to follow up on that but first i never actually got to the point of what

867
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,320
i was saying earlier uh that that privacy was this new concept from the late 1800s and that like as it

868
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:39,720
spread um like that as soon as like tabloids were a thing it was immediately like anybody in any

869
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:47,000
position of like being known at all was gonna have things said about them and anytime that somebody

870
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,320
was upset that things were being said about them the immediate backlash was well you wouldn't have

871
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,640
anything to hide if you weren't doing anything wrong that's the that's the one that's the one

872
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:06,120
that always gets to me and that's it's so fucked because it's like first of all like i the reason

873
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:14,360
i have to hide is because i'm doing something that you will consider wrong that's why i have to hide

874
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:19,720
because this world is a bunch of people who think that their way of life is the correct one

875
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:24,600
and therefore anything that goes against the grain of what they think is right

876
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:31,240
they're going to be upset with and i don't want to be in a position where i have to constantly

877
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:38,600
explain and justify every fucking thing that i do and it's funny because i have been in that position

878
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,800
for the most of the last like you know since becoming famous and a lot of it is because

879
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,080
i'm somebody who's obsessed with being understood so like every time i do something and people

880
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:54,840
don't understand it i go out of my way to explain it but eventually that just got so exhausting

881
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,240
because you're never gonna you know if you have a constantly evolving audience and they're not

882
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:03,640
going to consume absolutely every piece of media you you do especially not if you're just like

883
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:09,320
doing a corrections or like a further clarifications video people don't care they don't care that

884
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:15,320
much nobody cares enough to get intimately into your life so it's like your options are basically

885
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:22,040
either do things in public that others may find questionable and then spend every fucking waking

886
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:29,400
hour explaining yourself or just say fuck off give me my privacy you know so i can just live

887
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:34,680
my life without having to explain it to you because and i don't know why people don't

888
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,640
complete like i on some level i do but i don't understand why people don't just take the mindset

889
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:46,120
of like other people's lives are different from mine i should just accept that i won't understand

890
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:51,400
everything about what they do you know like it's just that people think that they're right as i think

891
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,920
really what it comes down to and and they further around they don't have a frame of reference or

892
01:13:54,920 --> 01:14:00,200
even understand the different experience of other people which is why i think it's so easy for like

893
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:05,560
lots of poor people to have very little empathy for rich people even though rich people for example

894
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:10,680
just have they have very different problems than like poor people but they're still real problems i

895
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:18,200
would say uh i would understand why i think i think typically very very general here a lot of people

896
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:25,080
with financial struggles overestimate how much their problems are all because of their financial

897
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,240
struggles yeah they put way too much the blame on that and then conversely it's an easy scapegoat

898
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:33,240
and then conversely a lot of people who are well off and don't have financial struggles

899
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,680
underestimate how fucking swell it is and how much easier it makes their lives to not have those

900
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,680
financial problems if it's been a while since they've had any i completely agree if you do

901
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:47,320
i think that all those what what the big misunderstanding is is that the reason people

902
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:55,400
um like the real appeal of having money is simply freedom it's not that because because money does

903
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:01,240
not bring happiness as the the aidage goes and it's been scientifically proven this is a fact

904
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,200
money does not bring happiness but say the peak is seventy thousand dollars a year i believe like

905
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:12,040
what i think the the rich don't understand about the poor is that for a lot of them there is just

906
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:18,680
no way out like there's nothing they can do within their environment to change things and if there

907
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:24,520
were they probably don't know what it is and they have no concept of it like there's no way for them

908
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:31,080
to grasp it and rich people are just like well i've also got my you know i've got issues too but at

909
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:38,520
least you have the power to redirect your life at least if you think like oh my job is a huge problem

910
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,320
you can try to go get another job and granted it's still a huge risk it's still yeah it's not

911
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:49,320
like anybody has the power to just completely uproot all the time um and like i've worked to put myself

912
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:54,360
in a position like that like the reason that i like doing internet work and working from a

913
01:15:54,360 --> 01:16:00,120
decentralized location based on fan donations is that i don't have to answer to anybody so every

914
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:06,200
time something's even slightly off about my life i can work on changing it and try to try to make

915
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:12,520
everything just right but like that would not be possible if not for at the very least my baseline

916
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:17,960
understanding that that is even conceivable like most people don't even conceive of that as something

917
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:23,320
that they could live is really the the the thing that makes it so appealing it makes it so powerful

918
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:28,760
because like when i had to go back to a job after making a ton of money online like everything changed

919
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,560
it's like oh well like i have to be here at a certain amount a certain amount of time so like i

920
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,480
stopped going to conventions i stopped seeing friends as often like all these things i just like

921
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:42,280
could do you just can't anymore and like it's obvious but it is a huge detriment and changes

922
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:46,680
the entire way you think the entire way you have to function because like a third of your life is

923
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:52,520
now taken this this is related to something that i want to talk about later uh while thinking rather

924
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:59,400
reflecting ruminating upon the capital g capital b great people in life i was i was i was interested

925
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:05,240
in how all of them are nobles all of them are people who come from the upper crust of

926
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:13,480
sight i'm talking like pre let's say like pre 19 or i'm sorry 1850 almost everyone that you're going

927
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:18,280
to have a strong emotional connection to and and have like a narrative and you know piece of history

928
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:24,120
dedicated to them all that not just like to say kings or any just you know the the popular political

929
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:30,200
and religious and you know figures of the day the capital g capital p great people are all going

930
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:36,920
to be nobles and it comes down to i think i think i've i've isolated one specific thing it's because

931
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:43,320
when you have that much power and influence and you know money you are able to get a good education

932
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:49,160
and i reflect after reflecting upon history i think education is probably the most important thing

933
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:54,760
that you can do to have a better life not to just say like you know the institutions of

934
01:17:54,760 --> 01:18:00,360
uh depending on the type of education but yeah i mean it's just not even college is good specifically

935
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:05,480
i'm just saying that having the worldliness and having the ability to maybe go to a different

936
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,920
country and learn things about the people learn things like oh these people are different why

937
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:13,000
are they different learn about the you know underlying uh structure of society learn about

938
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,760
these things learn about math learn about science learn about you know history and stuff like that

939
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:22,920
it's so so vital to having a well-cultured well-mean and intelligent person to be able

940
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:28,040
to understand not just you know being able to recite math problems but being able to understand

941
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,240
the underlying course of history course of society and be able to like you know have your

942
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,320
influence directed onto that society it's so important that's the most important thing that's

943
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:43,400
why power and money is so much it's it's almost directly to education i have a like a like a

944
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:50,520
theory a life i have like a digi bro hypothesis level of like this is really grasping at

945
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:58,600
theoretical straws makes a whole lot of sense to me what i'm about to say is that it has that being

946
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:09,000
a noble is not a state of uh physical satiation of resources but a state of mind that people who

947
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:14,520
are living in some white trash by the way what what a digi bro hypothesis is is something that

948
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:20,280
you know for a fact is true you just have no idea what words you can say that will make other people

949
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:29,000
recognize yes so you could be living like a white trash like trailer park there's a fucking like

950
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:36,760
half broken toilet in the front yard kind of life right that level of resources and i think what really

951
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:41,400
gets you down if these people are so poor how come they have so many broken toilets yeah why do they

952
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,560
spend all their money on because they got a shit no matter if you're rich or poor you got a shit

953
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:52,680
if you're that poor you can't flush you can't afford it so you got to keep buying another toilet

954
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,400
every time you needed to shit no he's right no one who's actually no one who is actually poor

955
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:03,960
has a toilet like if you live my mind for that for you with the world's your toilet my my buddy

956
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:10,840
don son uh who's uh you know vietnamese um yeah lived in vietnam for a little while and they don't

957
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:16,840
do toilets over there what they do is that they'll have a little bridge over a ravine with a hole in

958
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:22,040
the middle of it no and just go up on this bridge and you squat over the hole and you sit down into

959
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,840
the ravine there's like a koi fish down there that eat all the shit up whoa and then uh and then you

960
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:33,080
wipe with leaves whoa okay all right right that's actually that's what the third world no pun intended

961
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:38,760
and that's what i mean when i say poor is a state of mind right uh and i'm not saying that the physical

962
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,720
realities of it aren't very limiting i get that right i don't want to be like oh don't act poor

963
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:48,520
no no no it's a state of mind and it's not one you necessarily that have that much control over

964
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:54,520
when you know you're in a disadvantaged part of the world in in a uh rung of the world of rung of

965
01:20:54,520 --> 01:21:00,600
society that's less valued that has less freedom that is seen as lower you can't help but feel

966
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:07,560
more demoralized about it right but what we don't but like what can be done is at least a little bit

967
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:13,880
a little bit of progress on on the individual level every day is all the free time you still have

968
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:20,040
like even if you are packed at work you know you have you work really long hours and you work

969
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:26,280
full time you still have at least a couple of hours in the day to do whatever you want maybe in

970
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:32,280
the week yeah maybe in the week right but you can do something with that time and it doesn't

971
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:38,360
have to be wasted but what happens is that most people uh i remember there was a cracked article

972
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:42,440
it wasn't like a one of those five amazing facts it was one of those personal story kind of articles

973
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:46,920
and it was saying you know if you want to make it anywhere in life you have to start now because

974
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:52,200
the cycle i was in said the article for years he said the cycle i was in was i had

975
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,520
have to wake up i didn't want to go to work but i had to go to work so i went to work and all day

976
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,600
at work all i would think about is all the books i wanted to write how i want to be an author how i

977
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,560
want to be a writer and i would just think of it all day at work and then like get home i'd get home

978
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:12,280
from work and i'd be at home and i'd have like three hours to do whatever the fuck i wanted but i

979
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:18,680
was pissed off and tired and filed the rest of that under hashtag fuck this day and then went to

980
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:23,640
sleep to repeat the cycle all over it this is my life this is my life i think that's the most people

981
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:30,040
and i was in that i was in that mindset um for a while but like when i worked at target like

982
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:35,720
because it was it was a it was a physically strenuous job because i was on the the flow team

983
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:41,000
and i'm weak but uh like a lot of the days i'd come home and just be tired like so tired i just go

984
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,560
straight to bed but then like there were days where like i was physically tired and out of it

985
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,280
and just done but i was like i need to make two videos a week if i want this channel to succeed

986
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,920
you know so that's what i did it was like no matter what their hat like it didn't matter if

987
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:00,040
i was like falling asleep while editing there has to be two videos a week or this channel is not

988
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:05,240
gonna succeed but you have to look at it i think that the the thing that that was different about

989
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:11,640
my mindset and this is the hardest thing for me to teach other people is that it can happen fast

990
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:18,760
like if you do it you you just gotta think of it like i'm doing this so that it because like

991
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:24,040
let's say that you you barely chip away at the thing that you are working towards like over the

992
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:30,120
course of years like that's years of you just getting further and further beaten down but if

993
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:35,240
you are trying if you're like really cramming it into every single waking hour you have there's a

994
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:41,080
chance it'll happen really fast you know and like with my channel's growth it was like then again i

995
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:45,880
was putting out two videos a week every week no matter what it took to get them out and like it

996
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:50,840
only took a couple months for me to get successful because there was just so many chances there were

997
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,640
so many you know so many lightning rods being placed in the ground that eventually something

998
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:00,200
had to get hit by fucking lightning you know and even if they don't immediately take off in a huge

999
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:07,240
way i this i can definitely guarantee that it is easy to get some positive feedback loop going

1000
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:12,920
quickly even if it's small success which like for me and ben for example it was like when gib put us

1001
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,800
in his like pony review like compilation thing that was the first moment where like all right people

1002
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,760
actually like this stuff and they care and this is dope and that was something but it was a big

1003
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,320
forward to at work like you know there's someone looking forward to the stupid shitty art you're

1004
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,480
going to make when you get home that can at least raise your spirits and i will say to anyone who's

1005
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,720
trying to break this cycle especially people who are at the bottom of it but actually especially

1006
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:40,280
especially the people who have been at it for a couple of years and are totally demoralized about

1007
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:47,880
it my mistake and i i recognize this just the last couple of days is that i was focused entirely

1008
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:55,560
on getting out of my regular job 100% as fast as possible and which is the which is two extremities

1009
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:59,160
right you could plan any other getting out of your job partially or getting out of your job

1010
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:05,160
completely i went for completely you can try getting out soon or later i went for soon which

1011
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:09,640
actually just made things harder because i wasn't satisfied with any of the progress i was making

1012
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:15,240
until i had everything i wanted but if you could figure out how to have a plan to like reduce your

1013
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:20,360
hours yeah that is actually what will get you from point a to b in a more realistic manner and i

1014
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:26,200
almost never planned for that i i was full time and then like the second that i like realized the

1015
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:32,520
channel was going to be successful i i had them cut my hours to part time because it was i was

1016
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:38,040
like it's too hard to continue doing this job when they're working me because during the holiday season

1017
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:42,600
it was like it was brutal because we were going at 2 a.m and they would often have us working like

1018
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:49,640
you know as much as humanly possible so like it was getting really hard to do the youtube videos

1019
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:57,320
and i was just like this is this is on a roll like this has a chance and like if i my dad was

1020
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:00,520
super pissed at me when i cut down to part time because he was like you're gonna lose all the

1021
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:05,480
benefits like how could you and i'm like because i don't plan to be here long like the whole point

1022
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:11,400
of this is to not be here as fast as possible so if cutting my hours means that the youtube channel

1023
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:15,800
can grow faster then that means it's that much and obviously this isn't something everybody

1024
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:21,880
can do unless there is revenue coming in but that's the other thing is that getting getting enough

1025
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:28,360
revenue to to to leave your job is hard getting enough revenue to cut your hours is not as hard

1026
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,880
because like say you make a hundred dollars a week on whatever you're doing then it's like well

1027
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:39,480
shit now that's you know that's a pretty huge chunk of a of a minimum wage paycheck and i know a lot

1028
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:45,480
of people aren't in such convenient positions like you know digi you did you were able to like

1029
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:51,640
not have to pay that many expenses in my case it was like when people talk about privilege i always

1030
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:58,920
want to say like i completely believe that uh that i am a privileged individual but the privileges i

1031
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:05,320
had were that my family was very loving and nothing to do with how much money they had

1032
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:11,000
or how much it was that my dad thought i could do this and therefore encouraged me to do it

1033
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,640
and i think that's the most important thing that you can get is like a safe environment because

1034
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:23,640
space is such a better place yeah and i know people who uh who don't who who have like a family like

1035
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,120
a i have friends who who come from families that had a lot of money who tried to put them through

1036
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:33,720
college who tried like who would have been on that track but because they ultimately decided to do

1037
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:39,080
like internet art or something that's not a guarantee that family cut them off and those

1038
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:44,600
people are struggling now because they don't have the opportunity to sit at home and work on their

1039
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:50,040
art until they're able to leave they are now living in a shit apartment somewhere trying to you know

1040
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:55,560
work shit jobs trying to struggle to get it done and they're not making enough off of the other

1041
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:59,880
art in order to put it back in but also with those people there's always an element of like

1042
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:05,000
davoo said like there's it's just hard to find the energy and it's hard to convince yourself but

1043
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,920
like i would encourage anybody if you're in a position where you're like i i just don't have

1044
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:18,040
the energy to do it you have to just tell yourself the energy it doesn't matter like it doesn't matter

1045
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:23,720
if you're tired and it hurts you have to do it because it's not supposed to feel good until you've

1046
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:29,560
earned it you know here's here and this is it most it's most applicable to our audience who are full

1047
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:33,480
of people who you know i assume want to be some sort of like youtube content career you know only

1048
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:38,280
kind of career but this applies to everything this applies to any sort of like you know arts and crafts

1049
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:43,320
you might want to do outside or just any sort of general hobby you know go into the gym or anything

1050
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,840
like that this applies to all of it all if you want to like leave your job and start your own small

1051
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:52,200
business of anything yeah exactly exactly anything it requires effort i mean i i i

1052
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:58,120
climbed a mountain one time i was physically very weak at the time i was not somebody who

1053
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:04,360
you would think could hike a mountain and it hurt and it sucked but i wanted to climb the mountain

1054
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:10,600
and at the end of the day a a phrase i'll give you is don't run from the pain run with the pain

1055
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:16,680
just be in pain because if you let yourself suffer that little bit then that means it'll

1056
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:20,840
pay off later you know because you won't have to suffer anymore once you're at the top of the

1057
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:26,440
goddamn mountain then it's over and it's like you know you you can sit you can keep you can take

1058
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,840
your time inching up the mountain and it's just like you're gonna be on this mountain for fucking ever

1059
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,160
or you can just climb the goddamn thing through the pain grit your teeth you reach the top and

1060
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,920
you're like now i don't have to climb a fucking mountain anymore now there was a good thing where

1061
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:44,440
someone's like pain points true north this this whole like you know speed this whole like fucking

1062
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:50,840
thing we're this whole vibe we're writing right now any point in the last five years up until a

1063
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:59,160
couple months ago my reaction would have been yeah right now though my reaction is yeah but okay hold

1064
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:08,040
the fuck on though because i have been starting to more value a life of quality work rather than

1065
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:15,880
like manic exhausting quantity work and i think that if you temper your mind correctly you can get

1066
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:21,160
more done with less energy you know hashtag works mark not heart right and i even think well i didn't

1067
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:25,960
have the freedom to do that before when i had my regular job cleaning windows that was uh you know i

1068
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:32,280
had to i had to go double time in order to make progress right is that is anyone still here everyone's

1069
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:38,680
be dead silent yeah okay okay cool i guess i have everyone's attention who so i i'm thinking back

1070
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:46,120
because at the time i think more so than like my hours were booked my hours were taken up what was

1071
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:55,400
even more so is that my ability to sit reflect and plan was was dwindled it wasn't it was it was uh it

1072
01:30:55,400 --> 01:31:00,360
was crippled and i think back now with with the greater clarity of thought i have now and i think

1073
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:06,360
you know what i could have done i could have uh worked a little bit longer for a bit saved up some

1074
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:13,320
money and got my own work vehicle and if i have my own work vehicle then i could actually then get

1075
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:17,400
involved with the actual scheduling of the business because you know family business and i could have

1076
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:24,520
actually scheduled my own work and said oh dad i'll take that job and that job and that job and i

1077
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:31,960
could have taken control of my own job and actually started setting my own hours on my own as it was

1078
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:36,760
because working in a family business while you don't have to deal with like the pressures of

1079
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:41,800
like a boss who doesn't love you as a human being you do have to deal with the fact that you're kind

1080
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:46,920
of being owned like you're just sort of like you're kind of stuck you can't you don't really have like

1081
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:52,040
employee rights you can't say something like hey reduce my hours boss it's more like hey could you

1082
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:57,960
reduce my hours dad and he'll be like uh yeah when they get around to it right i mean to strain

1083
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:03,320
to strain my metaphor as far as i possibly can because that's what i love to do like i think that

1084
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:08,840
when when you go to climb a mountain you often you you're saddled with this big backpack and you're

1085
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:12,120
like you got to climb the mountain with this big backpack it's got all your necessary provisions

1086
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:16,360
in it and you're just like okay and you start climbing and it fucking sucks and at some point

1087
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:21,400
if you're really smart what you should do is sit down open the backpack go through it and make sure

1088
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,640
it's all shit you actually need to be in there because the climb doesn't have to be as hard as

1089
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:29,800
you think it does it just comes if you're carrying a bunch of it's always more important to work

1090
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:34,680
smart than work hard so make sure you're going in the right direction as efficiently as possible

1091
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:39,320
first before you get manic and work really really hard and do all that that's the mistake i've made

1092
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:45,480
time and time again is that i yeah i know a lot of like what is the smart way to work but there's

1093
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:50,920
there's often another smart way like the way i always looked at it was like okay on youtube you

1094
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:56,200
have to game the algorithm and do content that everybody likes and all that stuff and and like

1095
01:32:56,200 --> 01:33:01,160
i don't want to do that so i'm just gonna work super hard and bust out as many videos as possible

1096
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:06,360
and constantly be flooding things and then like over time i've come to realize that there are other

1097
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:12,200
ways to work smart it doesn't have to be like this this is not a dichotomy that has to exist

1098
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:18,280
like um and i one of my catchphrases that i'm trying to get off the ground is uh if you haven't

1099
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:25,160
found a paradigm that works you're not done looking because there is there always is a paradigm

1100
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:30,760
that works but like if you stop the book anywhere you're never gonna find it you just got to always

1101
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:35,400
be questioning what you're doing and if it could be better so so i'm gonna like quickly go through

1102
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:41,320
the specific scenario that happened with me just to a model so you can model yourself right so i

1103
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:46,520
started trying to do youtube in may of 2014 by the way before he does that just consider if you want

1104
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:51,560
end up where divu is right now consider whether or not you're going to do this all right no no no

1105
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:56,200
i'm talking about how i could have done better and been in a better situation by now okay that's

1106
01:33:56,200 --> 01:34:00,840
what i'm saying learn from my mistakes my shortcomings is actually what i'm saying so i started

1107
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:07,000
trying to do youtube in may of 2014 and it was around july of 2015 that i finally had a hour

1108
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,440
reduction arrangement with my dad which was instead of working full time you work two days a week

1109
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:19,480
and you don't uh all the money that you make just go straight to expenses and 200 dollars of your

1110
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:25,000
youtube money you just pay that to me in exchange for only having to work two days a week which is

1111
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,520
you know even less than part-time i think so that was the arrangement i got and once i got to that

1112
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:38,520
nirvana wait wait wait sorry sorry i'm confused all your earnings go from your job go to expenses

1113
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:43,400
hold on i was getting money i was being paid money i could do whatever with right right okay the

1114
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:48,040
idea was hey dad i want to have fewer hours and he's like okay so you know your expenses stay the

1115
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:53,000
same but you're just sure you don't get your own spending money right the money just goes straight

1116
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,360
to expenses but then you're making a few hundred bucks a month from youtube right so you give me

1117
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:04,120
200 to cover the rest of the expenses in exchange you only have to do two up two days a week of work

1118
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:09,240
i feel like you're are you paying more to work less this seems i don't understand right but basically

1119
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,800
what i'm buying is time instead of having to work five why do you have to buy time from your dad this

1120
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:19,480
seems very odd yeah you know maybe what that's the situation i was in right of like you know i'm an

1121
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:24,520
adult i should be paying my own expenses right you might i mean i think i've been having conversations

1122
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:27,800
with with col lately she's like you know i think the way your dad treated you was actually very

1123
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:35,640
manipulative and uh almost abusive and i'm like uh you know well probably but whatever it was the

1124
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:40,200
situation i was in lots people are in manipulated abused situations and you have to figure it out

1125
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:45,880
right so i basically just spent a year my whole strategy was make videos that get popular enough

1126
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:51,400
so that i can buy my way out of this job but what i could have done is made videos

1127
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,440
that's always on the table well then it would have fucked over my family because they needed the

1128
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:00,360
money that i was well that's their problem not yours and you wouldn't be able to eat yeah i mean

1129
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:05,560
it's my problem it's me paying for my own expenses and i was already an adult i was 20 years old so

1130
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,960
i don't know whatever this episode is just very strange to me and i don't understand i understand

1131
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:16,200
no no no i understand but like so what i could have done is is worked on videos a bit here and

1132
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:22,120
there but focused actually on working more cleaning more windows for a bit saved up some money got a

1133
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:27,160
work vehicle by probably the end of summer a really good vehicle and use that to schedule my own

1134
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:33,720
hours and then just through my own agency been able to reduce my hours on my own time right

1135
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:39,000
and that would have made things so much more relaxed you know i would have been able to focus

1136
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,480
and think because when i finally had the chance to focus and think a year after starting youtube

1137
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:48,200
that's when i was able to start getting successful so it's like you know maybe don't think of of

1138
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:52,760
like this job as something you have to just kill right away as fast as possible like think of

1139
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:58,360
it as a beast that you can tame and live with for a while i mean this is what i have done i have you

1140
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:03,320
know so yeah you're right and and for a long time i thought oh man nat you're not going full in on it

1141
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:08,120
but i'm like you know what your videos are good what can i say you can't argue with results you

1142
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:13,160
can't fucking argue with the results uh so as much as we say oh yeah you got it you know no pain no gain

1143
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:20,040
at the same time you know at the same time pain like physical stress sleep loss eating sugary foods

1144
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:25,720
that is taking years off the end of your life that you could also no pain no gain but also don't

1145
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:31,160
go out of your way to get punched in the face right yeah so lately i've been like it's you know what

1146
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:35,800
i remember there was one like workaholic guy who like created an incredible business and burned

1147
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:41,080
himself out completely at 35 by then he had looked at the metabolism of an 80 something he was forced

1148
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:46,680
to quit and he said you know what for workaholics like me burning the candle in both ends is actually

1149
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:52,840
the easy option a work life balance is actually the true skill that's the truly difficult thing

1150
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:57,640
that the true master dude that is some shit that i'm in the middle of middle of trying to figure

1151
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:05,720
out because like i for me working was just like it was just a way to kill time a lot of the time

1152
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:13,080
like it's it's that i was so lonely and bored for most of my life that like working is the just

1153
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:19,640
like what i defaulted to and this is why like in 2016 i was making like this insane number of

1154
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:25,320
after dark vlogs and like um it's funny because there's a lot of fans who miss that era that they

1155
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:29,800
call like the losing your mind in your room era because they related to it but it's like you did

1156
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:35,320
that for too long there'd be no mind left to lose exactly i was legitimately losing my mind

1157
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:40,760
in this room because it was i had gotten to a point in my career where i was making enough money

1158
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:47,080
to be completely set and satisfied and i didn't know what to spend the money on like if you hear

1159
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:52,760
the song rotten i say i got six thousand bucks and don't know what i want to own and it was like

1160
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:56,440
because i had saved up that much which was a lot for me at the time like i'd never had that much

1161
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:02,520
money and it was like i had already bought all the equipment for my job i was living in a good

1162
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,400
situation and like i you know i would have liked to eventually move out of my parents house but i

1163
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:12,280
didn't really have a reason to do so because everything was fine so it was just like well

1164
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:20,360
what do i fucking do like what do i do with all the time i have in life so i just started making

1165
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:25,400
videos constantly because i had no better idea of how to spend my time other than just make

1166
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:30,440
shit and make shit and like it was it was so strange because it was like i didn't really

1167
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:36,680
have a plan it was just do this as much as possible because again working hard like

1168
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:41,640
divu said is kind of the easy way it's easy to tell yourself well if i just work all the time

1169
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,960
is there's an obvious benefit i'm gonna make money but like most of those videos were not

1170
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:51,400
making me any money most of them were not creatively satisfying most of it like you know the the best

1171
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:56,920
thing that came of it is that people got so much of my voice that they in they just anybody who

1172
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:01,400
was watching all of it because they had that little free time is going to love me but that has

1173
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:06,040
huge diminishing returns because as soon as though that audience finds something to do with

1174
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:12,040
their lives they're not following me anymore exactly me included it's true just just straight

1175
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:16,760
up flooding the world the world with as much of your voice as possible like it's it's not always

1176
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:20,920
going to work unless you have like a huge number of people but even then they're going to cycle out

1177
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:25,800
constantly and and it's unreliable and so like at the time i was really relying on like my hardcore

1178
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:32,200
fans it's like this is my central money makers but like as those people started getting jobs

1179
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:37,000
or leaving the house or some of them just weren't interested in what i had to say now because

1180
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,280
eventually i ran out of like super unique things to say because i'm one guy how many ideas can i

1181
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:49,160
fucking have you know um so like well eventually i started losing some of those people and and

1182
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:55,560
what i mean by not having a ton of unique ideas like i think that i was giving people

1183
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:02,200
like the the least creative version and there's some people who like when you just you just speak

1184
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:06,680
to them because it feels like you're having a conversation it feels like friendly but like

1185
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:11,880
those videos are never going to get the attention that a hui's law video would you know present

1186
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:19,560
the same that video i just put out what is deep um it like i literally made this exact same video

1187
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:25,160
as a vlog two years ago during that stint and it was because at the time i didn't know how to write

1188
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:30,200
it as a as a video because i hadn't spent that time like thinking it through really considering

1189
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:36,040
it it was like here's an idea let me turn on a camera and rant it as fast as possible and just

1190
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:42,680
publish it and like maybe it's got like 10 000 views and like for those 10 000 people they're

1191
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:46,680
like oh this video you just made on your main channel it's just the same thing i watched two

1192
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:52,600
years ago but the one on the main channel has 70 000 views because it was written and edited

1193
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:58,600
and has a catchy thumbnail and title and it was prepared for an audience because i used in it i

1194
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:02,680
just was using it as an advertisement for the iam games channel but like difference right right

1195
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:08,040
used to be like the whole vlog group made sense in 2016 when a lot of people said they liked the

1196
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:13,800
vlogs more i think i did too because the vlogs included a lot more side notes things that weren't

1197
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:19,160
really essential to the point but just made the point more humanly digestible and it was much

1198
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:24,440
more naturalistic whereas your videos were still really stiff and that has pretty well evened out

1199
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:30,280
now you're writing in your vo it's all very naturalistic now it's your videos basically are

1200
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:34,920
finally as good as i've always wanted them to be since i first found out about you in 2013 doing

1201
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:40,440
pony shit like why thank you like yeah like this this year your your videos finally got that sweet

1202
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:45,240
spot of just casuality i've always wanted it's really funny just agree you've never been as good

1203
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:50,840
as uh sword art sucks etc go back to that please do more of those what would you like the sword art

1204
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:56,280
one more of the astrosquare oh astrosquare that's true that's the best one um well you just like it

1205
01:42:56,280 --> 01:43:01,560
because it's long uh i like it because there's lots of parts and there's a great narrative going

1206
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:05,480
between it's like compelling it's really long but long is good i mean if you went back and watched

1207
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:10,440
those videos you'd realize that like half of it could be cut easily okay but but the fact of the

1208
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:15,080
matter is i remember it more fondly than any other content and i think that's a powerful thing

1209
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:20,120
i think if i'm objective okay i'm gonna also armchair psychology you and like tell you what

1210
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:24,200
you're really thinking as if i fucking know but it's my pet theory with a lot of people

1211
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:28,280
what did you when people tell you to go back to the astrosquare i think what they're telling you is

1212
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:35,240
go back to finishing plans to fruition like here's the plan okay the plan finish the plan

1213
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:39,640
you know because like the only reason standalone videos that i think are quite good i just like

1214
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:44,280
the astrosquare stuff the best the only reason the astrosquare sucks was a plan that got followed

1215
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:49,960
through is that i wrote the whole thing before it was out you know well most of it but in any case

1216
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:56,120
like the people like astrosquare because it's it's super long and they want me to write stuff that's

1217
01:43:56,120 --> 01:44:00,520
super long and that kind of that that's sort of flowing engagement where you're like apart it's

1218
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:07,720
like a show it feels like a whole show because it's as long as a whole show um and and i know that like

1219
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:12,040
if you want to make something short you have to make it very robust and tight and great for people

1220
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:17,560
to really remember it if you make something longer you can be a little bit more lax and you can you

1221
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:21,640
could be more free flowing and people will still appreciate it because they're involved with it

1222
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:26,680
for so long and i also want to talk about that that thing with that i was saying earlier about how

1223
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:31,480
everybody remembers the best parts and everybody forgets the the worst elements exactly this applies

1224
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:37,160
heavily to my fans talking about my content because almost all of them have some period that

1225
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:41,800
they remember as the best period those also do have the most views which is a pretty good metric

1226
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:47,400
of success i mean it really depends like i get my views have always been kind of all over the place

1227
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:53,320
it just depends on what what videos can you just recognize that one just was the best which it was

1228
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:57,400
which which one what are you talking astrosquare like the whole series doesn't have the most views

1229
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:02,680
it's got like millions of views every part or no one million views i think no it's getting the first

1230
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,920
couple parts in the last part are like getting there they'll be there in like a year but they're

1231
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:11,400
okay maybe i'm wrong yeah i mean the fucking how to recognize a terrible anime has over three

1232
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:16,680
million views by far my most successful video dear crunchy roll stop has more than any particular

1233
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:23,400
part of the astrosquare and that came out last month okay um anyway drama so like my point is

1234
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:29,560
that people look back and they they see they they remember like all the best things about those

1235
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:35,000
i cannot watch a lot of my own shit like even the astrosquare sucks there's parts of it i just skip

1236
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:41,720
because they're not good like my writing has gotten so much better my vio my uh you know if

1237
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:46,840
i edit it myself my editing most of my old videos are like weird because they were trying to like

1238
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:51,880
get past youtube copyright shit and it's just like you know of course people are going to remember

1239
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:56,520
the emotional resonance they had with the videos and not like the actual quality of them which you

1240
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:00,680
can only really experience in the moment you know but i mean okay like let's say that's all true

1241
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:05,560
that's fine but why not apply that to like a new project all your better skills and all

1242
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:11,480
oh i would love to mate you give me a fucking idea for one well okay uh i mean if the issue

1243
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:15,160
was just you don't have an idea for one i mean i'm not trying to tell you what to do i'm just

1244
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:19,480
you know laying out a case here i think you know it's not like i it's not like i haven't done it

1245
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:24,440
because i don't think it's a good idea of course i would love to do another astrosquare sucks i

1246
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:28,920
don't have anything i could talk about for 13 videos okay fair enough fair enough this isn't

1247
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:32,840
even really a criticism i was just pointing out yeah an observation uh but by the way though i will

1248
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:40,840
say because uh a certain a certain show is coming back for an entire year sort out online season three

1249
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:45,640
50 weeks in a row get ready that's gonna be uh that's gonna be something all right it's gonna be

1250
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:49,160
something all right i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do a video for every episode if that wasn't clear

1251
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:55,240
do it dude do it yeah see but then that brings up like i think your greatest enemy so far has been

1252
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:02,120
your like very unreliable attention span for projects you know that like hey man i did i did

1253
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:07,160
my little pony every single time an episode came out uh yeah i mean did you just done a couple of

1254
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:12,280
those like complete you know who cares if it was years ago what difference does that make i was the

1255
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:18,360
same person you aren't doing it anymore i don't know man i feel like i feel like once you didn't

1256
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:23,400
have to be as desperate for the money you've had a harder time like keeping up on things no i mean

1257
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:28,280
there was the me and digi show that we would go back to my anime blogger days and you will find

1258
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:33,400
that every single season i attempted to cover a show weekly and every single season i failed

1259
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:40,440
until uh until my little pony and you know why because it comes out at the same time every week

1260
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:45,720
and i just thought said i have to get a video out within four hours of it coming out for me the

1261
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:50,040
key word is uh you have to get the video out because like you were desperate for the money and i

1262
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:55,640
just feel like once uh after work came out i'm desperate for the money again i am i am beyond

1263
01:47:55,640 --> 01:48:03,800
bankrupt so uh like i have no money right that's why i phrase that your greatest enemy has been

1264
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:10,520
your ocd so uh no not ocd adhd for projects and i'm pretty sure like you know last month pretty

1265
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:15,800
well convinced me that you are fucking on points once more just make sure to keep being borderline

1266
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:22,280
poor and you'll definitely be good digi if you want to bring back uh best guy ever in digi

1267
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:26,680
review something i'll i'll i'll give you a cheap rate i'll give you a cheap rate for my services

1268
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:32,760
that's what i'll do i'll consider it people um people wanted me to do that with saos return

1269
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:39,000
but i have better ideas fair enough hey i have a total complete left turn topic uh because this

1270
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,760
is i don't know where we've been we've been around the world videos like 15 minutes what he okay here

1271
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:51,720
here's the topic uh uh uh skateboarding i am now a skateboarder and it is a huge life upgrade

1272
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:56,520
and i'm better than all of you why that's the topic of is it just because it's a funner way

1273
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:03,720
to like navigate the level geometry of your neighborhood i don't even do it um to get anywhere

1274
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:10,360
i do it purely for fun and also to do pokemon go uh it is the most fun and i mean if it was

1275
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:13,880
a normal skateboard that'd be some pussy shit we're talking about that boosted board that's

1276
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,560
that's what i thought i knew that i was like there's no way you're talking about a regular

1277
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:23,080
fucking skateboard no no no certainly not i got it's michelle's skateboard i got it for a birthday

1278
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:30,200
it's a longboard she lets me borrow it you know let the cuck i am uh it's uh just the most fun

1279
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:34,520
thing i've done in a long time i was doing it for hours yesterday i was doing it immediately

1280
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:38,760
before we started filming this episode and i can't wait to go back out immediately after we're done

1281
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:45,480
it just is great and it feels good and it's a perfect temperature and time of year to do it

1282
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:51,080
and also i'm hoping it'll just be somewhat of exercise every single day i shout out like i would

1283
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:56,520
have really i would have gotten into skateboard to me as a kid skateboards were always just the

1284
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:01,560
thing that you do to get tricks and i don't think i would ever use skateboard to do tricks because

1285
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:06,840
i don't care i would just if i were to just get into skateboard as like you know it's a pokemon

1286
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:11,560
go machine dude a part of like exercise and also you know you're out in the world and you're

1287
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:16,920
going slightly faster so you have that joy of going a little bit faster so you're not too fast

1288
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:22,120
i think i would really enjoy it but it was just always the tricks machine to me you also wouldn't

1289
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:27,400
do well on a skateboard i think because uh what is it uh unicycles are rowdy and skateboards are

1290
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:31,960
killer so right i thought you were gonna say that i would be which would also make sense oh that too

1291
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:38,440
i guess that people do skateboard i um shout out to who to the commenter currently typing the

1292
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:43,400
comment about how he got really excited when nate said he was skateboarding and then utterly

1293
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:48,360

1323
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:35,080
even the original one i'm not going to endorse doomer i prefer millennial i'm sticking with

1324
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:39,240
well they're both you know they they do different things tell me if you think that when you see the

1325
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:45,320
t-shirt yeah where where tom has cleverly cleverly reinvented the doom logo as a doomer

1326
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:52,280
oh that's good i don't know it looks like this whole digi tom t-shirt industry not really getting

1327
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:57,800
me i don't like the iam game sure it's cool you don't like the iam game well your taste sucks and

1328
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:03,640
you suck i'm into this doomer one i might get this one this is pretty sick i'm fine with like the

1329
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:07,800
next generation being called doomers but i guess they're gonna be called no they're zoomers because

1330
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:14,920
yeah they're zoomers dog generation c they're the zoomers what what is that but like what do they

1331
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:22,520
do that like a kid with like shaved sides of his head uh doing the fortnite dance and i don't know

1332
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:28,040
like at like a carly ray jeppson concert i guess yeah all right look here's here's how i think of it

1333
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:35,160
all right if you if the the if your turning point in your childhood was pokemon you're a doomer if

1334
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:41,720
your turning point your childhood was minecraft you're a zoomer yes that is on point i think we're

1335
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:47,560
gonna be able i ruby and sapphire you're like you're a zoomer okay munchie you're like a you're

1336
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:53,800
like a uh you're like a like a um like very early zoomer i would say you know that i think about

1337
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:58,680
it the raddies and the killers are really just doomers versus zoomers uh at the end of the day

1338
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:03,800
oh dude okay munchie i was actually just yesterday in a debate like where does millennial and and

1339
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:08,280
gen z began and the thing is people are gonna keep debating about it people keep debating when

1340
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:13,240
millennial even starts whether it's the mid or the late eighties but i think what's gonna happen is

1341
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:19,480
it'll be a lot more clear once two parents who are definitively stereotypical millennials have a kid

1342
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:24,920
and then that kid becomes a teenager and begins to express themselves once we see what the new

1343
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:30,360
stereotype is we'll start to then reverse engineer you have to let the generation become old first

1344
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:34,840
we're getting i know i know dude like i mean the zoomers are already like adults now

1345
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:38,760
but like yeah they're getting but when we get to the late era zoomers that's when we'll truly

1346
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:42,520
understand it's some of them are what i'm looking forward to it may not be the zoomers it may be

1347
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:46,920
the kaboomers which will probably be the last one and and it all comes full circle back to boom

1348
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,240
right no no it's gonna go back beyond that what i'm thinking is gonna happen is that there's gonna

1349
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:57,800
be like the the generations will keep getting more and more lazy and privileged and entitled and then

1350
01:55:57,800 --> 01:56:02,120
there's going to be a reverse polarity when there's like this sudden huge increase of like

1351
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:07,480
religiosity and like discipline for its own sake after like society collapses right and it'll be

1352
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:12,440
the first generation like 200 years where like the children are more those would be the bloomers

1353
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:17,240
the bloomers yeah and there is a generation defined by like our parents are fucking lazy

1354
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:21,560
it's really funny you say that because there is an image of the bloomer that is exactly what

1355
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:28,200
devu is describing what yeah no look up look up bloomer and like you'll get or um i found it in

1356
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:32,360
the like well while searching doomer i found the bloomer it was like a guy with a big smile and

1357
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:37,880
like everything he's like perfectly moral and like i got it i got it right here it's like i oh my god

1358
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:44,760
this is me this is me i'm a bloomer for sure oh it's too fucking small hang on it's actually crazy

1359
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:53,000
that face uh i disgusting i hate that i'm no longer the child soldier there is a person one of my

1360
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:58,440
consorts in the ratty rough house here we paradox crocs the ancient stignitary of urban development

1361
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:04,360
that guy he has a he has a deep voice and he's fucking like i think like 16 years old or he's

1362
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:10,600
going to turn 60 he's a really young lad and it's kind of crazy to me that i have fans who are now

1363
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:16,600
younger than me and i could not be happier and i could not be more thrilled to have paradox crocs

1364
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:22,920
the youngin on my side it's just it's just okay you know what i turned 18 i am now technically

1365
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:27,880
adult and all the reasons why people used to like me they now have no justification they're all god

1366
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:33,160
yeah and and now why they hate and and and now that my middling skills have been exposed as

1367
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:37,400
middling skills and not like oh you know like you're good as like you're good for a kid much you

1368
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:41,480
know you have good art and you have good humor you know for a child now all that is gone and now

1369
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:45,640
they just judge me as a normal person and now i'm when i have no more fans and so i just stay up

1370
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:50,120
every night i just drink gourmet tea and i go to sleep at like 3 a.m and think about how i'm

1371
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:54,680
going to kill myself which is a real yeah that that's the uh yeah really was literally once i turn

01:57:54,680 --> 01:58:01,640
24 i rose oh shit i'm no longer young i'm definitely feeling old now it's it's the true uh it's the

1373
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:06,840
real big lie about hunter hunter where because there's so many fucking hiatuses they get to be

1374
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:12,520
wow you are good for a kid gone and killer would get to be for 20 fucking years because

1375
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,920
their story progresses so slowly they get to be in that in that nice loop of you know you're not

1376
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:22,520
as good as all of us but for a 14 year old you're pretty fucking good but that period of your life

1377
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:28,840
dwindles away so fucking fast you can't relax i don't i don't consider mungy i have not considered

1378
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:34,520

that nobody gives a fuck about you except you who should care about your life with a burning

passion and be motivated by the stories of your heroes and live life the way they would

1410
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:44,520
to be what happens when you fuse a bloomer and a doomer which is a devil man that's what that's

1430
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:31,160
oh did he use that for something mr beatong used that as a joke once it's not a real statistic

1431
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:37,640
okay i don't know what you're referring to but fair enough uh i suppose that's accurate um all right

1432
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:42,520
well good luck one spar uh keep sending him those uh timestamps for the star fleet things i think

1436
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:09,320
all that much let's see from michigan but i did that because he says pop yeah i just wanted to say

1446
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:28,360

1447
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:38,040
i have no choice but to inject my venom into his ben saint veins his only hope for survival

1448
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:47,400
is to convince all of his patrons to pledge to me patreon.com slash them snakes

1449

that's patreon.com slash them snakes i'm checking right now i i i have is the basis of his content

1450
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:05,640
ben saint sounds too much like them snakes is phonetically identical it's it's amazing

1451
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:12,840
them snakes is a real patreon that was created in september of this year so it just got made

1453
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:30,440

1454
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:37,480
from a gibbs uh try to catch pump game oh right i'm talking about yes yeah that's my headcanon

1458
02:06:56,360 --> 02:07:04,520
one is from wise to your ways uh we should probably hey here's it it's all about that search engine

1459
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:11,320
optimization gotta upload friday three p.m eastern standard time gotta hit up those kids who could

1460
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:16,280
just come out of school so that by the time their fellow friends on the on the west coast are out

1461
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:20,840
of school it's already blown up on the trending charts you already know how it is you already know

1462
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:26,200
how to maximize profits you already know how to get those books cooked oh it's good

1463
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:42,840
it is pretty good wise to your ways uh i was gonna also we release at 2 p.m we should be on

1464
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:48,600
eastern standard time suggestion if you're sending in one where you want like a specific member to

1465
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:53,880
hear it you should probably put that in the title like play this on an episode with ben or something

1466
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:57,400
i've been i've been starting to tag i've got it actually i have one that it was for gib and i'm

1467
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:00,760
just not going to read that because that's like a gib one so i've been trying to do a little bit

1468
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:05,160
better with that but um all right we'll we'll keep working on it all right yeah if you could put in

1469
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:08,920
the in the in your name or title that would be helpful yeah but here's another one this one is

1470
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:17,000
this one is simply called pcp theme 2018-09 uh let's see what we have here

1471
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:27,160
perhaps an update i got a new pcp theme here it goes all right starting up get ready what is that

1472
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:29,160
it sounds like some hit

1473
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,160
is this the german national anthem

1474
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:44,360
i gotta find out

1475
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:54,680
the matching lyrics to the other lyrics is very nice

1476
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:02,600
is this is this a song that can get us blocked in germany could this happen is this a hitler song

1477
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:08,600
you know what it probably is um i apologize to all our german listeners who can't hear us

1478
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:12,280
because this episode was just blocked because it's probably that's probably the nazi anthem and

1479
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:18,680
or you're currently getting arrested for having listened to it all right yeah uh all right here

1480
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:24,600
we go yeah that's germany's a kooky play saying it um here we go this one's from uh tomaso choco

1481
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:31,400
oh i think we had a mess from today is the one-year anniversary of me starting my diet

1482
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:37,000
i could help breads rice, potatoes, pastas, and sugar and lost about 150 pounds so i want to

1483
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,400
ask you how much you're celebrating the town's probably gonna say go to cuckold's landing but

1484
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:45,160
i don't really like the idea the boy's getting sprung when the southern bells are being rung

1485
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:52,280
so i don't want to do that anyway okay there was a lot there digi and davu i think you missed it

1486
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:56,920
but like i think it was our boy choco taco was like driving through like south caroline or something

1487
02:09:56,920 --> 02:10:02,040
and like he said like hey guys if you're still looking for a place to set up pcb hq i just found

1488
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:09,400
a place called cuckold's landing in like south carolina um but anyway this guy lost 150 pounds

1489
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:16,600
in one year since going on a diet it sounded like keto if that's not it was on keto if that's not a

1490
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:23,480
a ringing endorsement for not eating bread ever again i don't know what is bread is just bad for

1491
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:29,880
you it is it really is it's that's that is bread yes scott pilgrim bread and does indeed does make

1492
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:34,680
you fat and it's not no that means truffle gar law from one piece is actually on to something

1493
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:41,560
because he hates bread but fuck that guy uh all right oblivion fall another one let's do it up

1494
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:49,240
mate you are doing this wrong your entire approach with playing these voicemails through soundcloud

1495
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:54,680
is a complete farce and an inefficient solution if you actually cared about doing this right you

1496
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:59,880
would install vb audio cables and voice meter so that way you could play the audio directly

1497
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:06,120
through your microphone to discord with no loss in quality what you can actually do is split the

1498
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:10,680
audio in your computer to different channels and you can toggle which channels come through your

1499
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:15,400
microphone and discord and which channels go through to your headset it turns this is what i want

1500
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:21,720
to hear beastly audio machine dream and you can do so much with it and the best part is you don't

1501
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:26,760
have to waste time on soundcloud and you don't have to delay starfleet from happening with your

1502
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:32,520
stupid inefficient bullshit if you need help setting it up you can contact me i'm on the discord my

1503
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:40,760
username is green you've got to eat your greens god damn it get voice meter you little bitch

1504
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:47,560
that is a super helpful suggestion uh i don't know like will cost money i assume that it will

1505
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:51,880
but i should i should just go reach out to oblivion i i know he i know it's probably just

1506
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:58,840
cuz it it's funny but i've never understood the mentality of people who frame some like incredibly

1507
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:03,960
obscure technology knowledge that you don't have like it's your fault for not knowing it like

1508
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:12,280
how could you possibly not know about vba split gx 17 fucking color arrangement you bitch like

1509
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:17,800
i i appreciate his expertise but please my my fragile this goes back to what you were talking

1510
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:23,080
about earlier about about uh what debu said with like thrash whatever if you don't know the specific

1511
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:28,200
genre like you know this guy just is so into audio it's like yeah i mean he's a music fan so i mean

1512
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:31,720
i'm sure he's doing it because it's funny and maybe he listens to his biggest problem and

1513
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:38,120
is taken out of every voicemail they get that's true uh okay here's another one this is from

1514
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:47,800
truth sayer truth sayer all right i'm ready for the truth lay some truth tick tock tick tock best

1515
02:12:47,800 --> 02:13:02,360
guy ever loves the cork well he said the truth i thought it was gonna be like some heavy existential

1516
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:06,600
thing about how time is like fleeting yeah but uh he brought it back and brought it back i feel better

1517
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:15,000
again um okay that was pretty good let's see if we can follow up here's one from iron beaver um

1518
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:21,480
let's let's let's see nate since you want to create the star fleet and the federation and all of that

1519
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:28,760
utility and bullshit i will assume you also want to start all the other things that

1520
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:39,640
lead that will lead us towards the star fleet like a third world war of 2053 um it is true that in

1521
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:46,920
in star trek universe there was a nuclear world war three uh before star fleet got created but

1522
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:51,160
but actually they really could have just because there was like a bunch of history in star trek

1523
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:56,360
where like a bunch of like horrific like dictatorial regimes took over and then world war three happened

1524
02:13:56,360 --> 02:14:01,640
and like society kind of collapsed but like what actually made star fleet finally happen

1525
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:06,440
was just like after all that bullshit uh there's a movie one of the star trek movies about this

1526
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:13,640
first contact i think it was just where um key for southerland's dad uh he just invented the warp

1527
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:18,840
drive like just because he was a good science man he just did it and when he activated it during this

1528
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:23,480
like test the volcans who were nearby found them and were like oh shit you guys have the warp drive

1529
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:26,680
and then they made contact and then they became best buds and then they like changed the world

1530
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:31,960
they got post scarcity and then star fleet happened so you actually could just skip all that stuff

1531
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:36,600
probably so it'd be nice to avoid that how did we uh how did we in in mass effect how did

1532
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:42,360
he manage yeah how did we discover the master he discovered prothean ruins on mars yeah they found

1533
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:47,160
that's right that's right that's what they did um there's one more here come on digi it's like the

1534
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:53,080
first thing in the codex yeah no i just couldn't remember off the top of my head i'm so sad like i

1535
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:57,560
want to go back and play mass effects all the way through because like it really is just star trek

1536
02:14:57,560 --> 02:15:04,200
only better and for free um and it was just such a joy for me to like play through yeah that's true

1537
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:08,280
it's it was such a joy to play through like the first like couple hours that game with like all the

1538
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:12,280
lore and like like learning about like basically their version of star fleet and like how it all

1539
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:17,000
happened and meeting all the races ah it's a good game good game i wish i was playing it

1540
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:22,360
oh speaking of of mass effect i found out that mass effect and drama is 10 times worse than i ever

1541
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:26,120
would have thought because uh someone in the comments of our iam game stream of it said there

1542
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:31,720
are literally zero quarians in all of andromeda which is like disgusting because the quarians were

1543
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:37,960
fucking sick and they just didn't include them at all i guess they just felt like they wanted to

1544
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:42,280
like cut some of the races and maybe like the quarian story is like kind of over because like

1545
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:46,840
they were like this nomadic guys who oh yeah why would you want to bring people who've been

1546
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:54,680
nomadic forever to a completely unknown galaxy how fucking retarded are you you really don't want

1547
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:59,800
entire race of scavengers and like people who salvage it to go to a completely unknown galaxy

1548
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:05,400
where you have no foothold at all what use could that possibly be maybe they're really sick of it

1549
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:10,920
and they don't want to do it right of course oh god wait a minute wait a minute you know what

1550
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:16,280
i read about that you know i there was one line in that uh bloomer description that i read before

1551
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:20,680
i started to bring this back up it's just i just noticed this as i still had my search for bloomer

1552
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:25,320
i just noticed um like there's others like there was one line in the bloomer thing that was um

1553
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:30,520
what was it love for his people far exceeds any hatred he has ever felt i thought that was a

1554
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:35,640
little weird but didn't you know that was fine then i see another one does it say something about

1555
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:40,040
like jews because these these all originate from pole i think there's a connection to the alt

1556
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:44,840
right with bloomers that i didn't okay this whole meme comes from pole like the doomer

1557
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:51,000
bloomer all that meme it's from pole so uh yeah look look at this bloomer link maybe we're trying

1558
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,880
to make it we're trying to expand it beyond the realm of pole because it's going to stay there

1559
02:16:55,880 --> 02:17:01,240
i just said like i am a bloomer so many times i didn't anticipate this turn but look look at this

1560
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:07,080
one bloomer's friday night a condom you're funny anon that's not going to secure a future for any

1561
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:16,280
white oh no i didn't expect all all this time we should have known of course yeah i got i bet a

1562
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:21,080
lot of people are going to be like lol he says he's a boomer shit i don't go on polling up to know

1563
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:25,480
which are the good memes and which are the bad memes no this is this is fine it's that that's

1564
02:17:25,480 --> 02:17:31,080
what's so great about the doomer meme is that the initial one doesn't have any pole shit if you

1565
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:36,040

1602
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:23,560
conundrum what was the question actually that's the only one i could think of off the top of my head

1603
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:28,040
uh oh i don't know nexus mania obviously i mean he's just a yeah nexus does really great artists

1604

1606
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:45,400

1607
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:52,040
of pcp but people who's original well i'm just gonna give a shout out to silent k who's completely

saved my ass with getting started on programming and shit currently in the process of like

1609
02:21:58,360 --> 02:22:03,000
un fucking a major bug that i have or a major hurdle i have to climb nice that's fucking sick

1610
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:07,960
dude more so than that do we have do we have any rough eta of of the new release date no more

1611
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:12,520
eta's i i had only one very rough eta now that that one's gone it's like taking the half life

1612
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:19,880
re-approach now it's like it's like 99.8% done so all right we've moved up like 0.6%

1613
02:22:19,880 --> 02:22:24,600
since the last update then right oh excellent anyway silent k right even more so than being

1614
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:30,040
good at like you know helping out saving my ass on shit he's just uh he's a great person to have

1615
02:22:30,040 --> 02:22:35,800
conversations about fucking uh life hacking optimizing your time with so so probably don't

1616
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:39,480
talk to him asking him for life advice because he'd probably be like oh i'm talking to too many people

1617
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:43,800
this is non optimal for my life but he's been really cool with me and he recommended me some

1618
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:49,320
fucking audiobooks which really got me on this whole work smart not hard mentality specifically

1619
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:55,960
deep work by cal newport and why we sleep by i don't remember his name but at some point

1620
02:22:55,960 --> 02:22:59,400
i'm just gonna force digi to read or listen to this book because he's one of those like

1621
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:05,640
anti-sleep people this book convinces you oh shit oh no i'm no longer sleep the shorter your life

1622
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:10,600
i am no longer anti-sleep that is not a thing anymore i mean i'm i'm anti-sleep the same way

1623
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:15,640
that i'm anti-death that it's like a biological thing i wish i could rid myself of i've come around

1624
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:21,560
on sleep uh partly because i'm old now and it's okay and it makes me feel good i mean if i were

1625
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:27,000
you i'd be even more angry which is kind of how i feel that my weak human body has these weaknesses

1626
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,240
that are getting more and more i mean the thing is when he says anti-sleep it's not just a matter

1627
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:36,680
of i hate sleep it's that i was actively trying to end it that like i was looking for a way out

1628
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:42,040
and now i am right i still feel the ire i feel that i have to waste all this time sleeping sure

1629
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:47,240
but i have i have completely given into it and acknowledge that i need it and that it's okay

1630
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:52,760
we're getting we're getting close you want if you want to have a chance to quell your ire this

1631
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:57,080
book will explain because yes people haven't really understood why we sleep but they're finally starting

1632
02:23:57,080 --> 02:24:03,880
to figure it out i understand it now because like uh it it helps me to i mean i know that when

1633
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:08,120
you sleep it like it lets your thoughts reorganize themselves it's kind of like a book goes in

1634
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:12,440
extensive detail exactly like what it does with different parts of your brain and it's

1635
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:18,280
so fucking cool to learn how like like no no okay they did a they did a test and this is written

1636
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:22,520
by a guy who's like a sleep scientist so this isn't like a whole lot of oh hey i read an article

1637
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:28,520
that said this about a study it's i did this fucking study where they had people in a sleep

1638
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:36,840
laboratory read a bunch of facts and they put in a green r for remember and a and a red f for

1639
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:42,520
forget next to every fact that they learned right they told them that means remember that means

1640
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:48,440
forget but you actually want you to remember all of them equally ignore the forget and remember

1641
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:54,440
had them go to sleep woke up the next day and they overwhelmingly remembered the shit that had

1642
02:24:54,440 --> 02:25:01,080
the green r for remember more than the red f for forget so the brain is able to process memories

1643
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:05,960
overnight and it actually operates intelligently we may not have conscious control over it but we

1644
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:11,720
are actually able to control what our brain does at night even if not like consciously directly

1645
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:22,200
yeah i uh i believe all that i'm sleep fascinates me because uh some recent things that happen in

1646
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:28,440
my life were caused by lack of sleep and it's it's very similar to when a computer has like

1647
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:33,560
when it sounds like a memory leak and everything just like is wrong that's exactly what happens

1648
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:38,280
to your brain if you don't sleep for long enough it's like it's not that you're at risk of dying

1649
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:43,720
because you're not like rested it's that your brain just is confused and doesn't know where to put

1650
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:48,920
all the information into what holes you know and it's just like it fucking goes haywire and like

1651
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:55,160
now that i've been sleeping more regularly it's like i can i can also like now that i know this

1652
02:25:55,160 --> 02:26:00,280
like ever since like kind of realizing the fact that because somebody told me i guess at some point

1653
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:05,720
that like your dreams are like reorganization of your thoughts and so like in spite of the fact

1654
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:09,560
that i complain about us talking about dreams on the show because i think that

1655
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:14,440
dreams don't mean anything to other people unless they know what's going on in your life

1656
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:20,600
very particularly but if if you look at your dreams interpretively like usually i can look

1657
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:25,640
back on my dream and say okay i know exactly what this was about like this it's all metaphorical

1658
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:30,920
but i know exactly why i had this dream because like this is something that was either stressing me

1659
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:36,520
out or this is something that uh and like you know if i reverse engineer it it makes perfect sense

1660
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:40,600
in in terms of a metaphor you know uh anyway enough for this i don't want to talk about this

1661
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:46,200
anymore kajoro bitter thorn asks which one of you is the most games this is the most important

1662
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:51,960
question it's either a better name i want to say tom i'm pretty games i'm pretty games i don't know

1663
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:57,240
i think ben is the most games in the pcp ben's probably the most games does he play i mean

1664
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:03,640
why well what's your justification that he is the best at games ben is not the best at games

1665
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:08,280
i'm the best at games god damn it i'm definitely the best at games tell that to the pokemon race

1666
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:19,400
i won the dark souls race destroy ben was in the curvy race too though he did win the thing is

1667
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:25,720
like i've seen not only does ben play games that like i can't even conceive of how the rules work

1668
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:31,000
like like dwarf fortress and in fucking dungeon crawl stone soup but like there was that time

1669
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:36,360
that uh me him and davu did a let's play of downwell and he hadn't played it in like six months and

1670
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:41,800
he got to like the final boss on his first fucking try that she does get in the record the game

1671
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:48,760
sometimes and also he like did a pretty good job at toho on like his first or second like like he

1672
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:54,040
did like one game over ever playing it yeah what difficulty was it on i think it was on normal but

1673
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:59,320
like he got a few levels in on like his first time ever playing toho which is like that's not that's

1674
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:03,720
like that's like main character of story level of skill if you know what i mean okay ben's pretty

1675
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:08,600
good at games but i'm better at action games and i'll run circles around him in kingdom hearts too

1676
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:15,480
what i have to say hey listen to this question multi-player games maybe i don't really know i think

1677
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:19,720
i've been catching my virtue of none of you playing online yeah i don't play tf2 or anything

1678
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:29,000
so i i bet i could beat all of you at smash uh i don't think maybe when when ultimate comes out

1679
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:32,920
it's gonna be yeah we have a switch now so i guess we'll find out i'm talking about melee i'm talking

1680
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:38,520
about actual smash i could beat all of you an actual smash hey they say that this one looks pretty

1681
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:44,760
good we got we've got directional air dodges back that's cool that's cool uh you don't carry your

1682
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:50,680
running momentum into jumps it's retarded that's in don't that's in the original super mario bros on

1683
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:57,240
ness oh that's rough that's uh that's rough hey okay listen to this question i love this question

1684
02:28:57,240 --> 02:29:02,440
this is fascinating i think it is from a female zoomer i believe that you can i mean that's my

1685
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:08,520
assumption but we'll we'll see it's from at infinity rise one and they ask uh is it extra

1686
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:13,160
to buy my that's how i could tell it to zoomer asking a question like that is it extra to buy

1687
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:21,320
my crush the smash edition switch we're good friends and he knows i like him so yeah too much

1688
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:27,400
or just do it don't weigh too much why the fuck are you doing way over the top dude you are a girl

1689
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:34,680
okay not you are a girl if he's not already into you that's weird um i would wonder why that's the

1690
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:41,400
case um i we're talking about like a three hundred dollar console right yeah i would not like so

1691
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:47,320
just clearly buy i would not buy my best friend or no i wouldn't buy anyone that unless they were

1692
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:52,840
sucking my cock at that moment yeah that's what i get to that's what i get to what i'm not i'm not

1693
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:57,000
trying to stay like he'll never like you or like it's a loss you shouldn't have to buy like material

1694
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:01,000
wealth to get someone to like you that's not how you shouldn't have to buy someone's affection

1695
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:04,920
buying anything for someone because you want that are like you yeah like like you just

1696
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:12,120
here's my advice show them a little thigh you show them a little just do that with smash underneath

1697
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:18,760
it's not it's not it's not an issue of it being extra it's an issue of if that does work then you're

1698
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:24,440
in a bad relationship if you know he's right because you bought him a switch that's fucked dude

1699
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:27,960
by the way i'm assuming it's a girl because she said it's a he i mean it could be a gay guy i'm

1700
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:34,200
just assuming here but like by the way if it is a gay man then go for it because i mean it is

1701
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:41,160
different if it's if it's a man and he is like on the fence about being gay buy that switch

1702
02:30:42,040 --> 02:30:48,120
and maybe maybe you'll convince him if you buy okay i know he's on twitter i can never know

1703
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:53,800
give him smash the hill make the match girl so i'm just assuming that that yeah if you are a girl

1704
02:30:53,800 --> 02:30:58,280
like don't believe what nate said oh if a guy doesn't like a girl there's something wrong i think

1705
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:03,000
there are a lot of guys who will like any girl who likes them but yeah i think it's like you know

1706
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:09,160
there's sort of a mad toxic masculinity pressure to act like every guy is like that you know like

1707
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:17,400
so i don't think all guys are like that i don't think i just mean like like what the real situation

1708
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:21,320
is like if you're a girl you've got like a friend who's a guy and like you're into him

1709
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:27,160
and like you want like to make it a romantic thing the solution is definitely not to like just buy

1710
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:32,200
him presents and like hope that he makes the switch it's to in some more like court like like

1711
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:37,320
full part full way you have to make yourself like clearly just show that you are romantically

1712
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:42,280
interested but here's the part of the tweet that concerns me is that they said they already know

1713
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:48,280
that they're interested right in which case i mean if if oh my god you're right i forgot about that

1714
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:53,800
knows that you're interested and they don't like you then the only conceivable solution

1715
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:59,960
is that you tell them more about yourself and maybe they like you based on that stuff but but

1716
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:04,760
even then don't go too far down that road i just like if they already know about you like if they

1717
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:09,240
already know enough about you to make a judgment on whether they like you or not then you're already

1718
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:13,960
this has red flag written all over i'm sorry it's rough yeah that's just the way it is

1719
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:18,600
buying them presents this sounds like a lost cause almost it will only make them feel weird

1720
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:23,320
or if it doesn't then they might have sinister intentions they're gonna try and i i suspect

1721
02:32:23,320 --> 02:32:29,560
look guys are very simple i'll say this about guys like a guy knows at first glance with a girl

1722
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:35,880
if he's willing to date her or not for the most part that's true and i don't know hey uh i haven't

1723
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:43,000
the odds are he's not attracted to you buy smash buy a switch for yourself invite him over to play it

1724
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:47,080
and see if he likes you you know that's the way don't do it only because you have this plan you

1725
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:53,960
have to also want this way to the very least yeah it's just not it's not extra it's just retarded

1726
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:59,480
that question was good that's what extra means well i mean kind of that question was good but

1727
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:05,000
here's a way better one from at doom box two who i recommend buying the doomer shirt asks

1728
02:33:05,080 --> 02:33:12,680
best way to cook eggs fried i like fry fry keep that yoke runny as hell my dude runny as hell uh

1729
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:18,840
that's okay i think it's like okay first uh fried egg second uh scrambled uh but if you

1730
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:24,840
want to go the extra like what is the best egg dish carbonara hands down oh uh whatever it was

1731
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:31,160
that me you uh and digi had at that breakfast place it's on an english muffin with the egg on top

1732
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:38,120
with like a piece of ham eggs benedict is the best egg food in the world i'm convinced i'm convinced

1733
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:42,280
i'm gonna show you carbonara i'm gonna show you you're gonna like it okay all right i guarantee it

1734
02:33:42,280 --> 02:33:47,480
you're not the way you look you're gonna get 50 pounds you're gonna like the way you just so

1735
02:33:47,480 --> 02:33:51,640
everyone knows i'm just gonna give you the just the real simple way to cook a fried egg properly

1736
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:56,360
uh there's a video of itachi doing this from naruto somewhere online as well oh that's that's

1737
02:33:56,360 --> 02:34:01,720
true that's there's a thing of that um is that where it started for you what what is that is that

1738
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:07,560
where your love of fried egg started no but i was happy to be you know uh reinforced by itachi's

1739
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:12,360
love of it you just you take your pan yeah you turn on the heat real low yeah you spread your

1740
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:15,880
oil you spread it around yeah you can turn up the heat a little bit if you want and you crack your

1741
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:19,080
egg in the center you can put two or three or whatever and then you have this is the most

1742
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:24,440
important part you put the lid on top you have to put a lid on top so that it cooks the top of the egg

1743
02:34:25,320 --> 02:34:29,800
but you don't do it too you don't turn the heat up too long and then you just like really i'm just

1744
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:33,480
trying to tell you to put the lid on the top because that was the most important thing i learned

1745
02:34:33,480 --> 02:34:39,560
i can see long hair you reminded me of taking notes of this anime scene you reminded me of a

1746
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:45,080
itachi did it too from a really early pcp episode where we were talking about like life and uh just

1747
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:49,240
you know making the best of yourself something like that and you chimed in with you know that

1748
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:54,280
reminds me there's a really great chapter of one piece about this that really adjusted

1749
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:58,680
my life view of this and i and i just have ever since then i've imagined you as like a man in

1750
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:04,360
the library that the grandchildren come to for wisdom and your library is just a shitload of

1751
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:09,800
jump volumes and it's like oh it's just as this bloomer thing describes nostalgia motivates him

1752
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:15,640
instead of depressing don't forget very racist at the risk of this being uh at the risk of this

1753
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:21,160
potentially being a whole other topic like i i think um there's this common sentiment people

1754
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:25,480
have or they're like you have to read to like you have to read because it'll enrich your understanding

1755
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:31,240
of the world and you'll learn so much from reading but they always say books like this is implication

1756
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:38,200
that only books can do this for you and like books are literally no fucking different from any other

1757
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:43,800
medium like well they do stimulate the brain in a pretty good way i think i'm absolutely gonna

1758
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:48,600
turn this into a into a topic or i do definitely have a thing to say about that books don't automatically

1759
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:52,360
change anything but the fact that there's a different business model means there could have been

1760
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:56,440
a very different production model let me tell you that's true but i just think that like i'm talking

1761
02:35:56,440 --> 02:36:02,120
about just on the baseline people talk about it like only books have this power and it's like right

1762
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:07,480
all media has this power because it all comes from the same fucking place it's all just remember

1763
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:13,320
our boy ty Lopez the the the the read a book a day guy who actually just like has people summarized

1764
02:36:13,400 --> 02:36:18,120
books for or something yeah yeah like dude no no like the thing about books though is that

1765
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:23,320
it's just the amount of options and the amount of just the odds of stumbling into something

1766
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:29,320
that's like holy shit like level of effort and insight in depth is higher than youtube videos and

1767
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:35,400
the example i'm gonna go to is i agree with that but i think that okay i don't think that there's

1768
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:43,000
anything you can't learn from like just consuming like even fairly basic shit

1769
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:48,840
because you just can extrapolate from it like typically like let's say reading one piece again

1770
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:55,000
like Nate might see it might not be presented with a huge amount of depth in the in one piece

1771
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:00,280
but like it might present you with an idea that you can then think about and extrapolate on and

1772
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:07,000
add that depth to by thinking about it and like i think that that's just like what me like we all

1773
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:12,360
learn like most of the fucking shit we know from like most of what we consume because it's not like

1774
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:18,280
any of it comes from a place of mindlessness like every story is just somebody taking their

1775
02:37:18,280 --> 02:37:23,160
understanding of the world and translating that into a story and all of our understanding is

1776
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:27,320
pretty fucking similar because we're all there is an extent to which like people will go out of

1777
02:37:27,320 --> 02:37:32,840
their way to do a crazy fucking research project and go out and be a journalist and get original

1778
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:37,880
interviews to attain information and it's like a lot sometimes people turn that into a youtube video

1779
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:41,480
but sometimes they turn that into a book and you gotta get the book if you want the full story

1780
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:47,960
what i want to bring up is Good to Great by Jim Collins which was an audiobook that was so good

1781
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:51,640
i'm like i need to stop listening to audiobooks now before i get into a munchies mom loop of

1782
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:55,320
just listening to books about how to make life better and never actually getting around to it

1783
02:37:55,320 --> 02:38:00,520
whatever that i'll devotee you're my oh my god so i almost forgot i'm sorry to move here finish

1784
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:05,160
your point that i've got something to say so Good to Great by Jim Collins was written from the

1785
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:14,280
mid to late 90s with not just Jim Collins but a team of 20 or 22 different research people he had an

1786
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:21,080
entire fucking like like an entire fucking class of people who were doing research for five years

1787
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:28,280
to examine every fucking business in america and crunched thousands and thousands and thousands of

1788
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:36,040
data to attain a very selected highly curated sample set of companies that were mediocre and then

1789
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:40,760
became great later so that they could look at the common elements and just the amount of data

1790
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:46,200
that they amassed an amount of math that they crunched and then the uniqueness of the insights

1791
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:50,520
that they pulled out of that you know you can't if you decided to make that a youtube video well

1792
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:55,320
to live in five let me ask you something book you gotta get the book do you think that i would get

1793
02:38:55,320 --> 02:39:00,840
significantly more out of reading this book than i would out of if you just explain to me what the

1794
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:07,160
book said yeah i mean in like 15 i probably not because like because i often people will tell me

1795
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:13,080
things like uh like there's a lot of academic books that like i've seen youtube videos that

1796
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:18,600
explain the point of them and like you always get this impression like most of the book is just

1797
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:31,720
justifying the point but like the point can be made in like a sentence but it's a but it's important

1798
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:38,520
that the book exists but is it important that i read the book if i if i already take it for granted

1799
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:43,320
that the point it's making is correct because i know that it was justified by the text because

1800
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:47,880
people i trust have told me as much will i get anything more out of reading the book and having

1801
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:52,760
it readjustified for me then if i just i think i understand your own thoughts better if you take

1802
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:56,840
the book yeah it helps you internalize the information not yeah that's what i was gonna say

1803
02:39:56,840 --> 02:40:00,360
like i think i think you've all spoken at the same time and i didn't know what any of the fact that

1804
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:04,760
you're reading it like firsthand i think it helps you internalize and like retain the information

1805
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:10,840
better what it's also is that you understand like if you if someone tells you the moral of a story

1806
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:15,160
or you know the point of a book and then you you in turn believe that and put that into your life

1807
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:19,560
then you're not gonna know why you believe things if you just take what people say is like oh yeah

1808
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:24,120
the book was about since what i don't know why i believe that gravity is real other than that it's

1809
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:29,320
a thing i can look at and be like that's a thing like i don't look at gravity it could be bullshit

1810
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:34,680
everyone was telling you your whole life i don't need to read a book on what is gravity to know

1811
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:42,520
that gravity is a thing you know why do i need a greater understanding this is your smart so

1812
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:49,160
you're not dumb as shit is why why do i want to be smart what's the benefit being able to better

1813
02:40:49,160 --> 02:40:53,720
articulate any ideas i don't i don't even know how to respond to that well you justify it in your

1814
02:40:53,800 --> 02:41:00,520
worldview i suppose you do it you you basically justify how 99.9 of everything that everyone

1815
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:04,840
says you need to do in life to be happy you don't you can just skip it and you do and i guess it works

1816
02:41:04,840 --> 02:41:09,800
so i guess i guess digi's mentality about books he's talking about right now is answers the question

1817
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:13,560
we were talking about early about media and why people don't expand their taste it's like well

1818
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:19,960
who cares why do i need to be you know nuance in my taste there is there is no need however what

1819
02:41:19,960 --> 02:41:25,800
i'm advocating for in that is that people will find something they will like more like that they

1820
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:31,240
i think you like books more i think people are limit well forget about that because i'm this is

1821
02:41:31,240 --> 02:41:35,320
all of just me postulating this is for the sake of argument none of this is real i don't actually

1822
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:41,080
feel these things i'm saying i'm making an argument and why are we talking about it yeah

1823
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:45,800
and also why is there not this episode is over forget it fuck you guys okay i don't want to make

1824
02:41:45,800 --> 02:41:51,400
you know what in that point 245 into the goddamn episode i've got a surprise announcement at the

1825
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:57,160
end of the episode that i meant to bring up our hero at call me puzzle happily just tweeted

1826
02:41:57,160 --> 02:42:03,080
that it is international podcast day right oh i forgot about that yeah i i i post that i post

1827
02:42:03,080 --> 02:42:07,640
that in chat i was like oh my god guys it's gonna be national podcast day and then it was like oh

1828
02:42:07,640 --> 02:42:13,480
i require that day oh and i was like yeah well i remembered didn't i i i remembered not you you

1829
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:21,480
baby you you twink uh well uh so eat it guys our podcast good are they were are they worthwhile

1830
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:27,080
as an art form do they impact society let's do do this for 45 minutes okay it's like about the

1831
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:32,440
the social benefits of podcasting and if they're morally right i think a lot of people can waste

1832
02:42:32,440 --> 02:42:38,360
a ton of time with podcasts as they do everything for example i was listed yeah that is true i was

1833
02:42:38,360 --> 02:42:44,280
listening to a sam harris podcast the uh yesterday because the title was something like safe space

1834
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:49,160
culture i listened for five minutes it was clear that they signaled that they agreed with my position

1835
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:54,040
that they're bullshit and then i continued to listen to just feel good about them justifying my

1836
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:59,000
opinion this is exactly what i was just saying about books by the way is that like because every

1837
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:04,280
time for any media every time i like go and read the study that like the the result was from i'm

1838
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:10,280
just like oh this is just literally saying the thing like i already i already know that the thing

1839
02:43:10,280 --> 02:43:15,000
why am i reading the thing that's about the thing because you understand why the thing is i don't

1840
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:19,960
i don't need to it has no application to know why it is all right all right fine but here

1841
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:24,680
is my point like if i listen to a podcast and then they clearly signal that they believe something i

1842
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:29,160
don't believe odds are just much higher that i'll stop listening and i think a lot of people are

1843
02:43:29,160 --> 02:43:34,200
that way so i just wonder if we really do a lot of convincing people of anything with these uh

1844
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:39,640
we don't you know with these i don't know those types of videos i mean those are very like you

1845
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:45,320
too okay youtube political videos are so fucking bad they make me so like embarrassed

1846
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:50,280
on like a visceral well it's the problem with all of them is just you can tell what side the people

1847
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:55,880
are on and like that's that's why i think it's i think if you want to change anybody's mind

1848
02:43:55,880 --> 02:44:02,200
stop being on a side obviously like because like nobody's gonna really believe one is right though

1849
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:07,400
there's a difference between people who are not on a side do it through peril or something like

1850
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:14,200
you're never going to get to the other side from a reporter i think people who vote democrat and vote

1851
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:18,680
republic i'm gonna get real fucking specific here okay i don't think is this gonna be another

1852
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:23,320
topic because i've got to piss real bad all right well okay well if you want to if you want to hear

1853
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:28,200
real quick finish your point yeah all i'm gonna say is that i don't think anyone is like literally

1854
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:34,120
believes everything that the major parties do and they all are just a mishmash of different ideas

1855
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:38,200
and they should just embrace that everyone is different there isn't a clear red or blue

1856
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:42,280
you all right i'm sure you democrat have some republican views i'm sure you republican have

1857
02:44:42,280 --> 02:44:48,920
some democrat views so stop fighting each other easier to think that way yeah politics is a sport

1858
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:53,480
for some reason humans human thinking tends to always go towards binary that's why everything

1859
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:57,400
always breaks down to a or b and like business and everything else that's why you have coca

1860
02:44:57,400 --> 02:45:02,840
pepsi or intel or amd or democrat republican it's easy to be i'm either a or b we're just

1861
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:06,840
that's why that's why there are no more great people that's why everyone there's a cap because

1862
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:13,960
of the nsa and uh let's go all right well that being said uh the end everyone's bad everyone's

1863
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:18,040
shit uh except i'm a bloomer so everything's great and secure our future for the white race
