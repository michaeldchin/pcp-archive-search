1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I won't bless that guy. That's son of a bitch.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
That's son of a bitch.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Son of a bitch.

11
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Hello everyone, and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm back, and the fun is over.

12
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Bass.

13
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,800
We're on what? Episode 346 of the PCP? Probably 347.

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
I'm ready.

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Okay. Ben Saint is here.

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
What?

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset anyone.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Uh-oh.

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,800
I'm quitting reviews, and I just want Lindsay Ellis to like me.

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Wow.

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
It's all I need.

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
That's all I need.

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Okay.

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Welcome.

26
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:58,800
You used to surprise me with that one.

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,800
It just seems so clear, so perfect.

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,800
It's all I need.

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Lindsay Ellis, I heard in some video that she's now exclusively creating for Nebula.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Oh, yes.

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Yep.

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I keep hearing about Nebula.

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,800
A lot of people I follow, they're like, and Nebula sponsored this video.

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Yep.

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Every single person who's pretty good is on there.

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm like, yeah, well.

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Yeah.

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
I don't need that much content in my life.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I'm not going to.

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm not going to.

41
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
I don't need that much content in my life.

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm definitely not going to.

43
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Boy, Legal Eagle really needs my $5 a month or whatever.

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Boy, freaking Patrick H. Willems is going to be real.

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
This is a point.

46
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm going to miss the next installment of the Charles saga.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Yep.

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
I love content as much as the next guy would fuck Nebula.

49
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,800
It's just it's even if even if I like the people on it, most of them at least or some of even

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
some of them, it's still it's still it's still a gay little club.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
It's still a gay little club for a bunch of queers.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Okay, I'm getting a little.

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I've been drinking.

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I've been drinking a little bit.

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm a little tipsy.

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
It's not true.

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
But it's not.

61
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I liken it to a reputable news site that looks most or all of the articles behind a paywall.

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
And it's like, well, I guess I just won't get this good content.

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
I guess I just won't learn what the news is from you.

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Indeed.

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Indeed.

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Because I'm just nobody does that.

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Nobody fucking does that.

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Nobody wants to do that.

69
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
True.

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,800
I don't believe that most of them could possibly they're not like they're not getting their

71
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
best stuff.

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
They're getting their like bonus stuff.

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
They're getting frankly, they're getting the craft that only the super fans want.

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Right.

75
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,800
The good stuff that people want to see that generates attention is going to be on YouTube

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
because that's how they get eyeballs on them.

77
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
And that's the most important thing.

78
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Lindsay Ellis is I guess is big enough that she doesn't need YouTube.

79
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
And you know what?

80
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Good for her, I guess.

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Yeah, like I guess that that for me is the main draw is like, well, Lindsay Ellis is gone

82
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
and I like her stuff.

83
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Zoom her new stuff on Nebula is also good.

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
I like Lindsay Ellis's videos, but they're not like my favorite.

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
They're not like I'm not I'm not willing to subscribe to Nebula for them.

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Yeah.

87
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:37,800
So it's just it's just a streaming service, but for Internet creators.

88
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
And I don't like streaming services.

89
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I refuse.

90
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
For sure.

91
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I mean, what do you I mean, what do you what even is a streaming service really?

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,800
It's a bunch of stuff that you have to pay to look at the library.

93
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
It's a library card.

94
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I mean, it's it's a it's a just a little it's just like a second YouTube that's

95
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
pay to play, right?

96
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Yeah.

97
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah.

98
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Pay to access to your point.

99
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Sure.

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Sure.

101
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Sure.

102
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
And that's certainly true.

103
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Certainly true.

104
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
You know, fine.

105
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I guess if you're like like a sneaky beaky, you could pay for Nebula find all the share

106
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,800
a share a password or like just download all of the videos.

107
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Like and then watch them over the course of a long time after you stop paying.

108
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Ah, yes.

109
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Classic.

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Yeah.

111
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Yeah.

112
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
You probably could do that.

113
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Like I say, I think for most people, I mean, for instance, Patrick H. Willems, I think

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
he did put the he put the like the the conclusion of the Charles.

115
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,040
It was either the conclusion of the Charles saga or it was like a behind the scenes truck.

116
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,280
It was like a Charles thing.

117
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Okay.

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
And frankly, Charles like the worst part of his videos.

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,780
I don't know who that is.

120
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,040
Well it's it's a fucking it's a fucking character bit.

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,040
I mean, as a person in this in this.

122
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:07,720
Oh, he's a movie movie nerd YouTube guy, the angriest movie you've ever heard he's he's

123
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
bald.

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Oh, ish.

125
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,040
Do you have any idea how little that is it down?

126
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,040
No, it's the bald guy.

127
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
No, it's the bald guy.

128
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,720
The thing that's most remarkable about Patrick H. Willems, the thing that I'm most impressed

129
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,560
by him for is that he does you to he incorporates his parents into his YouTube videos and like

130
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,840
it actually works and is good.

131
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,120
It doesn't suck like apparently Jack St has his mom on some videos and Jack St's mom

132
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,360
like I haven't watched the videos, but I've heard that it's not very interesting and she

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
doesn't have a great screen presence.

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,240
So it's not great for the content.

135
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,760
But Patrick H. Willems mom and dad are I guess they're either just really charming or he

136
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,080
is like really good at directing them because it's actually great whenever he has his parents

137
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
in the videos.

138
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Good stuff.

139
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah.

140
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Yeah.

141
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Cool.

142
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
It's it's it's incredible.

143
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,160
It's just not something it's just not something you see every day.

144
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
Parents being good.

145
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
I know.

146
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
For content.

147
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Yeah.

148
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Unbelievable.

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Well, sure.

150
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,200
It's pretty rare.

151
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,560
He has he has sort of a bit where he is like this.

152
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,720
He's this like jet setting the you know always on the go traveling executive and he will

153
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,920
like stop into his parent.

154
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,760
He'll like be on cocaine or something and he'll stop into his parents house and be like

155
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,400
hey mom and dad I got a flight of the Bahamas in five minutes.

156
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,160
But first I wanted to follow up on our last conversation.

157
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Let me tell you why Paddington too is the greatest movie ever made etc.

158
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,280
And then he'll do that and then he'll say all right gotta go and his mom will say oh

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,040
but Patrick you haven't had a cold you haven't had a hot shower in six years Patrick sit

160
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,080
down and have a cup of tea Patrick and he'll say mom I got I got cocaine I got more cocaine

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,280
to do and she'll say oh faith in pagoda and that's that's that's the bit pretty good.

162
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
It's so good.

163
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
I love it so much.

164
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Thanks.

165
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
It's mine now.

166
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Sure.

167
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Sure.

168
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
What are we talking about?

169
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,840
The procrastinators.

170
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Streaming services.

171
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Don't like them.

172
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Oh I guess this is the procrastinators podcast.

173
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,640
We're on the procrastinators podcast.

174
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
That's it.

175
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
We did it.

176
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
Okay.

177
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
That's it.

178
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Right.

179
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Yeah.

180
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,840
Oh no.

181
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,280
You have caught me in this procrastinators podcast slightly indisposed and I say that

182
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
it's just help.

183
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm downloading a thing.

184
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,520
I was worried there might be internet problem but it seems fine.

185
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,680
What do you download?

186
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm downloading a totally legal ROM of a video game that I already own so it's okay

187
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,640
don't worry about it.

188
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm trying to like get every single Fire Emblem game including the Japanese ones and then find

189
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,600
like translated patches for the ROMs and it's very involved and very confusing and

190
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,520
very I need to become like a computer hacker to figure it out.

191
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,720
Are you going to stream them or you just want to play them?

192
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,040
I want to play them but I think streaming them would be fun as well so why not and then

193
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,040
potentially if the streams are interesting if I have something to say I might make a

194
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,000
video about the whole fucking experience.

195
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,880
That's not a bad idea actually.

196
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,360
That's not a bad idea at all.

197
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,560
That's my little Fire Emblem plan because the new Fire Emblem Engage came out and I

198
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,480
was watching Mage play it on her stream.

199
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Gay.

200
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Yeah.

201
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,440
You get engaged to the fucking characters.

202
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Is that true?

203
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Wait.

204
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,040
I don't know why it's called that.

205
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
I don't actually know.

206
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,800
I think that that would be really funny if that's why it's called that.

207
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,440
It's not like oh you get married it's that you pair up with like a famous character from

208
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,640
previous Fire Emblem titles that you unlock and they increase your power and they sort

209
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,600
of float around your unit and it's like oh you're engaged, you're emblemized, you're

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
fired up.

211
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,800
I don't know why this is so funny.

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I know.

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,600
But it's like yeah it's a Fire Emblem game.

214
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,480
I haven't played a Fire Emblem game in a long time and at first I scoff at it like oh whatever

215
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,760
it looks like anime like all of them oh they all look like anime now.

216
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,640
This all looks like, this looks like Smash Bros.

217
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,440
I hate Smash Bros.

218
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,640
Exactly.

219
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,160
But I wanted to because I was like thinking.

220
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,720
Stop putting Smash Bros characters in Fire Emblem.

221
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,600
Yeah Mario get out.

222
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,080
But I was like I don't actually play these games.

223
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,600
How do I know they're bad?

224
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,280
I feel like if I wanted to make a big snarky comment about how Fire Emblem sucks now I

225
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,920
should probably play all the games so that I can have like the maximum like Steel Man

226
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,720
argument or whatever.

227
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
That's fair.

228
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,520
So I thought let's play all the Fire Emblem games and then I thought why not play every

229
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,680
single one even the ones from the history to see if it used to be even better, unlikely

230
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,120
but maybe it used to be even better on the SNES or something.

231
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,920
So I was thinking of doing a thing, well why not do every possible version of a thing to

232
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
access.

233
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Exactly.

234
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,360
Maximizing the stream length and the potential video length if I go into it.

235
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,920
How many Fire Emblem games are there?

236
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
I have the wiki open right now so.

237
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
Who's going to get done first?

238
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,520
You playing all the Fire Emblem games or me playing all the Mega Man Battle Network games?

239
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:07,880
Truly I think it depends on like Fire Emblem can be a really long game if it's hard and

240
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,240
you're trying not to lose.

241
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,120
But Mega Man is like long in like tedium where there's many, many multiple sets of little

242
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,240
random battles you can't avoid.

243
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,360
Fire Emblem is like there's a map, beat the map and sometimes you lose and you have to

244
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,960
restart and the map can take like hours and then you have to restart anyway.

245
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
So I don't know.

246
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,560
I mean how long would you say a typical Fire Emblem game is?

247
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:40,320
You know my experience is skewed because I played Fire Emblem when I was young and when

248
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,680
you're young you're dumb and so I lost so many times.

249
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,480
I feel like I could be smarter now but you don't know.

250
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
I don't know.

251
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,480
Another week of me not streaming again.

252
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,120
I fucked up again.

253
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Lol.

254
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Get fucked.

255
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
I am fucked.

256
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
I am fucked.

257
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm going to start again.

258
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
I just didn't do it.

259
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,920
I just didn't have time this week.

260
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,080
I'm going to try and make.

261
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,640
Yeah, that will be a fun side competition.

262
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,440
You and me streaming different game series.

263
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
That's funny actually.

264
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,880
Yeah, that'll be funny.

265
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
But yeah.

266
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
The...

267
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
What was I saying?

268
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Oh, the number of games.

269
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Oh, the number of games.

270
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:32,640
And Fire Emblem both involve moving around on squares and casting spells?

271
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,400
Yeah, those spells.

272
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,800
Cast spells and Fire Emblem?

273
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Okay.

274
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,960
Yeah, there's three different types of magic.

275
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,080
Axe magic, sword magic, and bow magic, spear magic?

276
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
No.

277
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,600
You're so stupid.

278
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,880
You're so fucking stupid.

279
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,280
No, it's like anima magic which is like the nature, elements, fire, wind, electricity.

280
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,720
And there's holy magic, which is, you know, Christian core, and then there's dark magic,

281
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,520
which is void of this core.

282
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Also good.

283
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Also good.

284
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Yeah.

285
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,120
Classic, classic trio.

286
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Nature?

287
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Okay, wait a minute.

288
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Wait a minute.

289
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,880
Nature, holy, and dark.

290
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,840
What is there like a rock, paper, scissor thing going on there?

291
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
There is.

292
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
There's a rock, paper, scissor.

293
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
Holy beats dark.

294
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Dark beats nature.

295
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Nature beats holy.

296
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,120
The sword, there's another triangle, sword, sword, axe, spear, and then there's some other

297
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,920
things like bows can really hurt Pegasus Knights because they got wings and shit.

298
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,920
In nature magic, I mean, inside of that, does like fire beat ice and ice beat lightning

299
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
and lightning beat fire or something?

300
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,200
No, it's quite like condensed.

301
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
It's just the three sets of magic.

302
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,560
So it doesn't matter what sort of thing.

303
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:58,560
They should have a freaking sub rock, paper, scissor inside of the rock, paper, scissor

304
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,840
where oh, it's nature, so it beats the holy, but it's fire nature, so it beats like wind

305
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,120
holy, so it kind of balances out actually.

306
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:17,040
The thing is the magic is effective against like the defenses of the person.

307
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,880
So it's like if you're strong against magic, you'll take less damage.

308
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,520
Actually no, I guess whatever book you're holding, whatever magic tome you have changes

309
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
your defenses.

310
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Now there's books.

311
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
God damn.

312
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Well, that's where the magic comes from.

313
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,040
You hold a book and that gives you your weapon and you can get different books that have

314
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,440
more powerful attacks.

315
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,120
Oh, like instead of holding an axe or a spear, you hold a book of holy.

316
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,240
You hold the book that has the spell in it and it has a limited number of curts.

317
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
It's like weapons have durability.

318
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,760
It's very, very nice.

319
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,280
So you'll have a book that has a particular spell and the spell will have, depending on

320
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,040
what spell it is, it'll have a certain number of uses per battle and it'll do a certain

321
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,600
amount of damage and it'll have a certain attribute, whether it's holy or nature or dark.

322
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Yeah.

323
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Okay, I got you.

324
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
I got you.

325
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Interesting.

326
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,680
So basically that's just like a separate like magical version of the axe spear.

327
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Other thing.

328
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Sword.

329
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Yeah.

330
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Okay.

331
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
It's interesting.

332
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Yeah.

333
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Fire Emblem seems fun.

334
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,960
I just never played it before.

335
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,160
It is fun and I used to really like tactical RPGs.

336
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,800
Now I find turn based combat a little bit tedious these days.

337
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, I find it.

338
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,160
I found Fire Emblem more interesting generally than like Final Fantasy where you walk around

339
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,200
and then there's a random battle and a set of monsters come up and then you have to beat

340
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
them.

341
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:52,520
It just feels like there's a lot of aimlessness to the combat.

342
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,480
These monsters, they don't want to stop you.

343
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
They're just around.

344
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,800
They're just in the way, sometimes as a boss and that makes sense.

345
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,960
You're trying to kill them.

346
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
There's guards.

347
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
I get it.

348
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,960
But like in Fire Emblem, the map sort of adds a layer of strategy, obviously it's a strategy

349
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:19,200
but like a layer of strategy to positioning and terrain advantages and retreating isn't

350
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,440
just a button you press.

351
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,040
You actually have to retreat to a safe distance so that you can regroup and heal up and then

352
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
come back.

353
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Right.

354
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,720
And it's like, it's cool.

355
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,560
I like the idea of being a tactician in a battlefield because it feels more substantial than I got

356
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,120
a group of people and they're walking through a featureless cave corridor until they get

357
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
to the end.

358
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Well, I could not stop complaining about the random battles in Mega Man Battle Network,

359
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,040
easily the worst part of the game.

360
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,880
The battles themselves are fun, but the fact that they just cannot avoid them and they will

361
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,120
just continually happen as you walk around in dungeons is so annoying, but I guess that's

362
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,080
the genre.

363
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:12,480
So the number of Fire Emblem games, I'm going to play the remakes as well, but some of them

364
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,200
are only in Japan and have not been remade.

365
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,760
And one of the remakes is only Japan, so I still need a translation for that.

366
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:29,000
There's Fire Emblem, Ang Kokyōryō to Higari no Tsurugi, Shadow Dragon in the Blade of

367
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Light.

368
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Naturally.

369
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's the first one that's got Marth in it.

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Remember Marth?

371
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Oh, yeah.

372
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
I remember.

373
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
I remember his down B.

374
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,920
Yeah, I hope he got some down B in the game.

375
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,440
Then there's Fire Emblem Gaiden, Fire Emblem Mystery of the Emblems slash Moncho no Nazo,

376
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
which is one of the difficult ones.

377
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Wait, wait, wait.

378
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
What does no Nazo mean?

379
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I know that phrase.

380
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
What does that mean?

381
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
I don't know.

382
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,440
It says Mystery of the Emblems slash Moncho no Nazo.

383
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,240
I've heard that phrase no Nazo.

384
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,920
It might be like a changed title translation.

385
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,680
I think it means mystery.

386
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,320
I think it's like the mystery of something.

387
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Yeah, okay.

388
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Okay.

389
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,760
That's three, and that's the first on SNES, and then it's Fire Emblem Genealogy of the

390
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Holy War.

391
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,960
Oh, it's because there's a Mega Man.

392
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,840
It's like Wily no Nazo.

393
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Oh.

394
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
I think that's two.

395
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,320
I think that's number two, Mystery of Dr. Wily, because he turns into an alien at the

396
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
end.

397
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Yes, of course.

398
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Of course.

399
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Of course.

400
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:52,400
Genealogy of the Holy War, Seisin no Keifu, Fire Emblem Thrasia 776, and then Fire Emblem

401
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,040
the Binding Blade, which is the one with Roy, who is our boy.

402
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:04,560
Then it's the first, after that, it's the first officially translated into English Fire Emblem,

403
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:14,040
known as the Blazing Blade, or Reckon no Ken, Reckon no Morty, then it's Fire Emblem the

404
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Sacred Stones, Path of Radiance, Radiant Dawn, and then Shadow Dragon, which is the

405
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,320
remake of the first game on DS.

406
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,360
New Mystery of the Emblem, which is Mystery of the Emblem remake on DS, Fire Emblem Awakening

407
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,160
on 3DS or- Jesus Christ, why can't they just number them?

408
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,520
Well, don't matter.

409
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:44,560
Fire Emblem Fates slash If in Japan, Fire Emblem Echoes Shadows of Valentia, which is another

410
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,120
thing, 3DS remake, I don't know which one that is, then Fire Emblem Three Houses, and

411
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,800
then finally Fire Emblem Engage, and I want to play them all.

412
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
So how many was that?

413
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:06,000
Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 with three remakes.

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
Okay, that is more than there are battle network games.

415
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,320
I think there's 11 battle network games.

416
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,640
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,200
So I'll probably be slower.

418
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Probably.

419
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah, I mean, I don't know how-

420
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,880
Considering both series are RPGs, yeah, probably.

421
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,440
I think the average battle network or Star Force game takes somewhere in the vicinity

422
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,840
of like 30 hours, 20 to 40-ish.

423
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:43,200
I don't think a Fire Emblem game typically takes the same as like a traditional RPG.

424
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
It can.

425
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,640
I think Fire Emblem Awakening took a while when I played that, but the early ones are

426
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,640
on NES, the first two, they can't be that big.

427
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,200
They're probably going to be tough, but like, they can't put so many, yeah, NES.

428
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,640
The ones that I'm struggling getting a translation for are Mystery of the Emblem and Genealogy

429
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:14,000
of the Holy War, because there's like, there's ROM hacks, translation patches made by people

430
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,240
that you download, and then you need a special program to take the ROM that you get legitimately

431
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,960
and the ROM hack, and you squish them together.

432
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,280
You always get legitimately.

433
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
You always get legitimately.

434
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,720
Do you always have a copy of the game before you download a ROM movie?

435
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Absolutely.

436
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,240
Absolutely.

437
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,280
Even the rare ones that cost $400 on eBay.

438
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Exactly.

439
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Mm-hmm.

440
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:47,960
And I'm like, I have, there's like, okay, here's, there's a thing that I'm barely understanding,

441
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:54,080
which is like, header ROMs, which is some ROMs have a header, and some ROMs do not,

442
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:02,880
and a header adds, the header is like a bunch of data that is added to a ROM for some reason,

443
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,200
something, something floppy disks, something, something, and so some translations they need

444
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,360
to know or are designed for header ROMs or unheaded ROMs.

445
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:20,640
And if the bit, like number, the byte number is off, it will corrupt the thing and it won't

446
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
work.

447
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,840
So you need to know, you need to some, you need another program to check what the like

448
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,280
numbers are, the fucking codes for all these ROMs are to make sure you have the correct

449
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
ROM.

450
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:41,120
Obviously, ROMs sometimes are fucked and it's hard to find the right ones and then sometimes

451
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,800
the translations just aren't finished or are buggy because they're just passion projects

452
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
from some people.

453
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,840
Oh, I got scared for a minute because you said buggy and it reminded me of one piece

454
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,000
and I didn't read the new chapter, but there is no new chapter this week, right?

455
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,960
Yes, there is no new chapter.

456
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Okay.

457
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,720
I had a gut reaction, a visceral reaction to hearing buggy.

458
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
Okay, sorry, go on.

459
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,520
So right now, before we started recording, I was trying to figure it out, trying to like,

460
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,440
like, oh, what the fuck?

461
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,760
There's like, there's a fucking, I got so many tabs open right now.

462
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,840
Are you, are you just downloading them from cool ROMs or whatever?

463
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm downloading ROMs wherever I can find them.

464
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,200
Not a lot of places have the Fire Emblem ones.

465
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,880
I mean, maybe I just need to scroll a long time to find better sites that have the ROMs

466
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm looking for.

467
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,760
I mean, I don't know, for me, looking for Mega Man's, it was usually just a matter of just

468
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,120
typing it the name and ROM into Google and usually I would get the first result would

469
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,560
be something from cool ROMs or wow ROMs or whatever and it would just be there.

470
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,320
Only a few, only a few of them that I have to like dig through slightly more obscure

471
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
websites for.

472
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:06,840
Yeah, I mean, the ROMs are here, it's just, some of them are like, especially for a Fire

473
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:16,960
Emblem 3, Moncho no Nazo, there's like versions of the ROM, like 1.0 and 1.1.

474
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,880
And that's another thing, like some of the translations only work for one or the other.

475
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
And also the header thing.

476
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,440
And if your ROM does or doesn't have a header, there are programs you can download to add

477
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,960
or remove a header from a ROM so that it can work.

478
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,440
Remind me what a header is?

479
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:44,400
I don't know, it's just, it's like, I assume, just based on having seen videos about computers.

480
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,760
Yeah, I've heard of computers before.

481
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,880
The way the patch works is that it counts like the bits and bytes and then when it gets

482
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:03,280
to a certain bit, it changes it based on what the patch is trying to change, like the language,

483
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:10,600
the text used, whatever it needs to do to change the patch to translate everything.

484
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:19,680
And if the ROM has an unexpectedly different size because of a header or a lack of a header

485
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,600
then it will count and then change the wrong byte because it can't tell.

486
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,120
It just does like it goes from the beginning and changes all the things that needs to change.

487
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,960
And if they're all the wrong, if all the things they need to change are like slightly offset,

488
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,080
they'll change all the wrong bytes and they'll be corrupted, which I think is what's been

489
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,240
happening with this thing.

490
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,640
So I need to be smart or something.

491
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,680
But do you have the power to do that?

492
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,760
I think I have the power.

493
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,920
It's just that it's just has been causing a bit of a headache just because I'm not that

494
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,560
good at like emulating stuff.

495
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,200
If it's easy, if you download a thing and you download an emulator and it just works,

496
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
that's good.

497
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,640
But if there's like issues with certain emulators and you have to learn, you have to use a specific

498
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,840
emulator for a specific game and then use some specific settings to make sure it works.

499
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,720
And there's like forums talking about it and like read me's that are walls upon walls

500
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,160
of text that I have to read to understand that stuff.

501
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:36,200
It starts to hurt all the all of the text entering my brain causes a malfunction.

502
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,640
It hurts my brain.

503
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,640
I'm not good at all this stuff, but I really want to do it.

504
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
So I have to.

505
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,640
It's a lot of stuff.

506
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,040
Luckily, I've got most of the ones that are just Japanese done and it's just three and

507
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
four.

508
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,720
Once I get three and four and I think four will be easier than three just because I've

509
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:07,920
seen like three has very few translations according to romhacks.net.

510
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,960
There may be other romhack translations, but I doubt they'll be elsewhere because romhacks

511
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,000
seems pretty, pretty complete with its like documentation of different hacks and translations.

512
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,280
There's not many for three, for some reason.

513
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,800
People don't give a shit, not enough people.

514
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:36,000
I mean, just need, just need more love, just need people to care, just need people to care.

515
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,800
If we love with all of our heart, maybe all of our fucking problems will be solved.

516
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:48,880
If we wish upon a star, but yeah, that's a little project.

517
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,120
Once I've got all that working, I might start streaming don't know when exactly.

518
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,040
I've been, I've been downloading.

519
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:07,280
I had a freaking download going for like a freaking, like literally set for seven weeks.

520
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,920
It took me seven weeks, almost eight weeks to download the entire DigiBro archive.

521
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,240
Be a torrent.

522
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,400
It finally completed.

523
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Yeah.

524
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,520
It's like, it's like one and a half terabyte.

525
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,360
It's so fucking huge.

526
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,080
It finally finished.

527
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:30,040
It was stuck for like almost a week at like 99.7% done, one gigabyte left.

528
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
But it finally finished this week, which was a relief.

529
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,600
So now I'm seeding.

530
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Now I'm seeding.

531
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,560
So if anyone else downloads in the future, that's what I said.

532
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,720
I was seething before it finished, but now I'm seeding after it's completed.

533
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,880
So in the future, if anyone downloads that you're welcome, I am helping.

534
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,440
Wouldn't it be cooler if like the term was sowing, like you sow the seeds and then when

535
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
they want a tarant?

536
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
I'm reaping.

537
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
I'm reaping.

538
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,200
The people who want to download it, they reap those, that tarant.

539
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Hmm.

540
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,760
Wait, no, because if it were like that, then first you would, you would reap first and

541
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,360
then you would sow.

542
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,640
No, you only, you're supposed to only reap after sowing, but with torrents you reap first

543
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,600
and then you decide whether you want to sow for the next person to reap.

544
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Oh yeah.

545
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,160
I guess someone else, I guess you can sow what someone else reaped.

546
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,440
That's just not how the expression is usually used.

547
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
That's why it's cool.

548
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,120
It's like you reap what has been sown.

549
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,640
It's like communal, communal.

550
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Communal reaping?

551
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Yeah.

552
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Hmm.

553
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,160
I mean, yeah, true.

554
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,400
Yeah, it does make sense.

555
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,000
It does make sense.

556
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm not sure why it's seeding.

557
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,760
It could have been anything, but anyway, I have that and since, I think I'm, I guess

558
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,640
I should probably start thinking about how to put that, how to make some content out

559
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
of that.

560
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,200
Reacting to the entire Digi Pro playlist.

561
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,920
I don't even know how long it is.

562
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,920
You know, you could do like a fucking, what's his name?

563
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,040
Like the guy who hates Dark Souls 2.

564
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,880
Oh, H-Bomber Guy?

565
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,080
No, he likes Dark Souls 2, the guy who reacted to H-Bomber Guy for like 20 hours.

566
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
Oh, Mahler?

567
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Yeah.

568
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:35,880
Do a Mahler style reaction critique and pause and rant on all of the fucking archives.

569
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,480
Watching every fucking old Digi Bro After Dark video, pausing every minute, it'd be

570
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,040
like, no, look at that.

571
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:48,080
In this scene, she's wearing the same glass as she was in the last video and that's, what

572
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,400
does that tell me thematically?

573
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,720
That tell me stagnation, the channel is stagnating.

574
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,760
That tells me that it's, that it's just, it's just not believable.

575
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,320
That would be like- Okay, anyway, let's keep going.

576
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,040
It was like, what was it?

577
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,760
It really was like 24 hour- Oh, now she's, oh, now she's getting married.

578
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,600
Oh, now she's got a fiance.

579
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
What is this?

580
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,800
Did anyone want this?

581
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,920
The audience did not ask for this.

582
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,960
The writers just got woke and they put a woman in.

583
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Yeah.

584
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,920
You could magnify the length of the content by like 25 times.

585
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Horrible.

586
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Horrible.

587
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,760
750 hour video.

588
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,000
Does YouTube have a 10 hour limit?

589
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,360
No, I've seen 100 hour videos.

590
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Jesus.

591
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, just got a message.

592
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
Just got a message.

593
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,920
And I, I'm in semi-regular contact with knows someone is in contact with someone who tested

594
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,400
positive for COVID.

595
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,680
So it is possible.

596
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
So all right.

597
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Oh shit.

598
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,320
I might have to- I should get myself tested.

599
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,120
Might have to test myself in the next week or so, just in case, but it's probably gonna

600
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
be okay.

601
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,280
Oh, damn, I haven't thought about COVID in a while.

602
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Fuck.

603
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Oh, downer.

604
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Oh, downer.

605
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,240
They'll eat your brains.

606
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Will eat my brains.

607
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,600
When was the last time I got vaccinated?

608
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Was it like October?

609
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
I don't know.

610
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Oh shit.

611
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I don't remember.

612
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
When did I get that booster?

613
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Oh God.

614
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
I have no memory.

615
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Help.

616
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Help.

617
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
COVID just destroyed my memory.

618
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Oh God.

619
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
My brain fog.

620
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Brain fog.

621
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
I can't remember when I got the booster.

622
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Where's my card?

623
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Where's my Vax card?

624
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
I gotta have my Vax.

625
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I gotta have my Vax.

626
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,120
I gotta have my Vax.

627
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,560
Typical liberal, addicted to the vaccines.

628
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,480
Oh, you just can't live without those vaccines, can you?

629
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Yeah, I can't.

630
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
You're addicted.

631
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Yeah, I'll die.

632
00:32:47,480 --> 00:33:01,440
Oh, well, hey, I found a- hey, should I make a video about this fact that I learned?

633
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
What is it?

634
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,600
Well, I'll tell you.

635
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Here's the fact.

636
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,400
I saw this Tumblr post going around.

637
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:18,000
It was a screenshot of a Tumblr post that I guess was pretty popular, and the post purports

638
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,200
that the word Nimrod, you know, the word that you would call someone if you're a- yeah.

639
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
It's an insult.

640
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,720
It means you're stupid, but where it comes from is from the Bible.

641
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,400
It is in fact the name of a great hunter in the Bible, a hunter and a king, I believe.

642
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:43,880
And so, it means that, but the Tumblr post purports that it has- it became an insult

643
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,760
when Bugs Bunny called Elmer Fudd a Nimrod, ironically comparing him to the great hunter

644
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:57,160
from the Bible, but people didn't- but people took it to mean that it means you're stupid,

645
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:03,200
and so the word reversed its meaning to be an insult.

646
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,360
Sounds plausible.

647
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,880
It sounds plausible, and it's not really true.

648
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,320
There's like a grain of truth to it.

649
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
It's not really true.

650
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,080
I looked into it, and all I really did was read the Wikipedia article on Nimrod because

651
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:20,000
there's a section on colloquial usage, and here are the facts.

652
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,600
The facts are, according to the Wikipedia, is it one?

653
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,800
It was Daffy Duck, actually, that called Elmer Fudd Nimrod.

654
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,920
Sounds more like a Daffy thing to say.

655
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:45,760
Bugs Bunny called Yosemite Sam Nimrod, and also the word Nimrod was used sarcastically,

656
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,040
and thus as in an insulting way, like well before Looney Tunes, and I think the earliest

657
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:57,360
example was in a letter from Frick and General Lee in the Civil War who called someone Nimrod.

658
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,080
And I think importantly, he doesn't even capitalize the word Nimrod.

659
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,680
He doesn't capitalize it like it's a name.

660
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,880
He calls someone a young Nimrod from out of the west, or a young Nimrod from the west,

661
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:17,560
and he is with a lowercase letter, so he's just using it as a generic noun to either

662
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,440
outright insult him or to ironically insult him with a sarcastic usage of an otherwise

663
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,840
complimentary word.

664
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,760
So the word's already being used as a sarcastic insult even in 1830 or whatever.

665
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:38,240
I guess it would be similar to saying, oh, you're a good shot, go ahead Robin Hood, show

666
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,560
me what you got.

667
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,720
Call on someone Einstein, oh, yeah, nice math skills Einstein or whatever.

668
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
No shit Sherlock.

669
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,840
Right, so I don't know.

670
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,720
Fuck you Nimrod, die.

671
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,640
I thought, is that the kind of thing when I learn something like this, is what I should

672
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,960
do as a YouTuber, like make a video about it?

673
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,360
If you want to.

674
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,400
Is there even enough, I don't know, well here's the thing I want to, if it would be a good

675
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,080
video and it would get views and I would make money, will it make me any money if I make

676
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,800
a video out of that and post it, explaining what I just explained to you?

677
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,120
I mean it doesn't sound like a lot of content, you could do a little troll style, little

678
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,620
Ben style.

679
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:28,280
Yeah, be short.

680
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,520
You do a YouTube short, did you know blah blah blah Nimrod?

681
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,680
Just feel like that's what, just feel like that's what, that's what YouTubers that I

682
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,480
like do, is they will just have something that they find interesting and they'll go

683
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,540
down a little rabbit hole and they'll research it and then they'll learn some interesting

684
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:50,480
stuff about it and then they'll make a video where they're like, hey let me explain all

685
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,360
this weird stuff I learned on this little rabbit hole that I went down purely because

686
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,160
I found it interesting to, you know, dig into it.

687
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,600
I do like videos like that.

688
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,240
What was the one about the Disney-ident music?

689
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,880
Oh, the, not, defunct land, was that the guy?

690
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,520
I always, I always freaking confuse defunct land with Todd in the shadows, but yeah, it

691
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,200
was the defunct land guy.

692
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Yeah.

693
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Da da da da.

694
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Da da da da.

695
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,480
And that was, that became a huge big video because the rabbit hole just kept going.

696
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,800
It's not, da da da da, although it's kind of that, it's da da da da.

697
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,520
Da da da da da.

698
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Yeah, you know, it was really annoying.

699
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,680
I don't know if this was intentional, but you know that video starts off with him interviewing

700
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,920
a bunch of other like YouTubers about it and then asking them like, hey, do you know the

701
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Disney Channel theme?

702
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,240
And all of them are like, no, I don't know what it is.

703
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,560
And then he tells them, you know, it's da da da da, and they all go, oh, except that

704
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,080
one girl.

705
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,120
That one girl is like a cunt about it.

706
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,560
She's like, no, there's no Disney Channel theme.

707
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,080
And like, she's such a bitch.

708
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,200
Oh yeah, I remember, I was a bit weird.

709
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Why'd you leave that in?

710
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Yeah.

711
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,480
She looked bad.

712
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,640
Like you've, you've really made this person look like an asshole.

713
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:20,360
Um, yeah, hang on, you gotta take another bite of my oats.

714
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:26,080
Like things, things on the PCP where he had like a mini deep dive into Wikipedia to learn

715
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,960
about flanges or whatever.

716
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,520
Mm, of the thorn, the letter thorn.

717
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,760
Yeah, like those are fun.

718
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,240
They're short and the rabbit hole ends pretty quickly because the answer to the

719
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,040
question was just right there.

720
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,040
Yeah, the answer to the question is nowhere to be found and you have to go

721
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
digging.

722
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,040
That's when it turned into a big video.

723
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,880
But you don't actually know that until you start looking.

724
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,360
I could, I could probably dig a little deeper and I could probably make like maybe a

725
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,680
five, maybe a 10 minute video explaining what I just explained.

726
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,440
And I mean, I don't know, that's content.

727
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,200
And then that's all I can say.

728
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,960
That's, that's content.

729
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,960
It's, yeah, I don't know whether the people who make videos like that think of it as

730
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,320
content or whether they're genuinely like, I gotta know what the hell is going on here.

731
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,000
And then they simply document it.

732
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,200
I, it's just, it just, it just, the thought just occurred to me.

733
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:25,240
It's like, okay, what a real YouTuber who does this as a job and who takes it seriously.

734
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,920
And who is successful at it.

735
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,360
Would a real YouTuber be like, hey, a thing that I have thoughts about and did some research

736
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,280
into and found out something about, I should make a video about that.

737
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:43,440
I think there's often lots of those, but many of them just don't go anywhere.

738
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,000
And the videos you see are the ones that became like worth investing time in.

739
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,040
Yeah.

740
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,920
I would imagine that like for every one video that comes out of that nature, there were

741
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:04,080
lots of other little things that just didn't, didn't have any, any staying power or interest

742
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,680
or like, oh, I guess that was half interesting.

743
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,440
But the question was answered too easily.

744
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,400
It's like, I have to get it.

745
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,040
You mean ones that got made that just never, nobody watched?

746
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,680
Or you mean just ones that could have been made that they decided not to because it just

747
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,400
wasn't enough there?

748
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Could have been made.

749
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,920
Like they go on a little journey and they like, okay, write down some notes.

750
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,280
And then at some point deciding to whether to make it a video.

751
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,760
It's like, I remember James Rolfe talking about angry video game nerd choosing a game

752
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,440
practice.

753
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,480
Sometimes he'll pick a game off the shelf and see if it's fun to play or if there's

754
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,520
anything there and he'll play it for like five, 10 minutes.

755
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,160
And if it seems like there's nothing interesting, then he won't bother to make a video.

756
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,280
It won't start the script writing process.

757
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,760
But if you can see some things, then he'll start and then it becomes a video.

758
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,160
OK, so you'd for YouTube videos for any sort of creative thing.

759
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,480
Yeah. Yeah, I think I get what you're saying.

760
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,680
So I guess you already did that.

761
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,880
You dipped your feet into the research, dipped your toe in and you're like, hmm,

762
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,640
well, knowledge.

763
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,880
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

764
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,560
I was thinking about how to make it on this platform.

765
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,320
You just do.

766
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,360
I mean, why did you do anything?

767
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,440
Why did you do the Mega Man lecture?

768
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,600
Huh? Why did that continue to be a thing you worked on?

769
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,560
For fricking views, you Nimrod.

770
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Yeah, but like.

771
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,360
But like, what was the deciding thought like that it would get a lot of you?

772
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,200
Yeah, but why did you know that?

773
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,560
What? I'm asking you to like to define the difference between a little thing

774
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,200
about Nimrod and Mega Man.

775
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,840
I mean, obviously, Mega Man has I mean, it's a well known thing.

776
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,240
But like, I don't think things are also interesting.

777
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:14,680
It just submit the the the Mega Man video idea just fit into various

778
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,920
templates of things that I had seen get a lot of traction in the past.

779
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,680
It's really long.

780
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,040
It's about a popular franchise.

781
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,040
That's it.

782
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,000
So you're a Nimrod thing.

783
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,840
Does it meet criteria similar to other interesting videos of that type?

784
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
Um.

785
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Um.

786
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,840
Not not one not ones that I feel like I see lately.

787
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,480
You that the ten minute video that the five to ten minute video feels like

788
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,160
I might be stupid.

789
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,320
I might be like two.

790
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,360
I might be two on the bleeding edge of this.

791
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,040
But the five to ten minute video feels like a relic.

792
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,720
Almost feels like almost feels like something that has has kind of

793
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,640
we've moved past as a society.

794
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,920
I still watch Tom Scott videos and they're usually like six minutes or something.

795
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,760
I sometimes if the content is good and and stuff, then little videos

796
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,720
are just, you know, oh, cool.

797
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,960
New one of these you click on them.

798
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,520
Yeah, they're low investment.

799
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,920
It's like closer to YouTube shorts.

800
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,560
I feel like YouTube shorts are big just because.

801
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,000
Committing to a huge video has to be the sort of subject you care about.

802
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,240
But for a small video, it's like, I guess I'll hear about this person.

803
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,720
I don't know.

804
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,080
Talk about this mildly interesting thing for a few seconds.

805
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,040
All all I'm saying all I'm saying is I learned this fact and I thought, boy,

806
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,800
what a waste of a fact.

807
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,320
What a waste of knowledge.

808
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,240
If I can't if I can't monetize it somehow, if I can't like if I if I can't,

809
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,840
you know, it's like if a tree falls in the woods, it's like if a YouTuber

810
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,280
learns a fact, but there's no video in which they explain and monetize it.

811
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,880
Did they really even learn it at all?

812
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,880
What was the point?

813
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,680
Well, I mean, do you want to make a video about flanges?

814
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,480
No, why not?

815
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,800
That's funny.

816
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,760
It is a little funny.

817
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,080
I guess I just I don't know.

818
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:39,200
I like words and learning the the the the history of words and colloquialisms.

819
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,240
It's an air.

820
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,720
It's an area of some interest for me.

821
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,880
They genuinely think small little things like that have a place.

822
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,880
YouTube shorts, whether whatever you think of them.

823
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:57,000
They're they're little bite sized things that are easy to make and throw away

824
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,080
and just like a little bit of content for you.

825
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,400
Nothing big, nothing fancy, nothing that you as a creator need to spend

826
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,680
all that much effort creating.

827
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,520
So really, what's the harm?

828
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,840
If it were a bigger rabbit hole, then it might be more of a

829
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,440
should I or shouldn't I, because maybe you could make a 20 minute video,

830
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,240
but that's not that cool.

831
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,120
What about if it could turn into a four hour video?

832
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,880
If I if I feel the urge, I might try and like

833
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,200
write out what that video would be in like essay form

834
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,600
and then just look over it and be like, is this worth?

835
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,400
Is there is there enough here?

836
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,280
Was I able to say enough that I feel like it's worth like narrating this

837
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,640
and putting a video over it?

838
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,600
And I might do that and see how I feel about it.

839
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,120
Yeah, I don't know.

840
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,200
And that feels stupid because like everyone listening now already knows the point.

841
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,560
There's everyone listening now is like, well, I wouldn't need to watch that

842
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,520
because I just had it explained to me.

843
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,440
Yeah, but who watches the PCP?

844
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,840
Literally, nobody.

845
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,360
Ha, ha, that's literally no.

846
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,320
That's my audience.

847
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,120
Literally, nobody.

848
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,720
LaMau.

849
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,240
OK.

850
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,520
Hey, I forgot to mention this is something I forgot to mention last week.

851
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,680
But did you know that my video game, Phantom's Revenge, got reviewed?

852
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,640
And I did not.

853
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:42,360
You did know that from a furry, four or was it a diaper from a diaper fur?

854
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,720
Yeah. Did I mention this on the show?

855
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm pretty sure. Or maybe I mentioned it on the stream.

856
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,600
And like, well, mention it again.

857
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,040
Damn, well, now I thought I forgot to mention it.

858
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,520
Maybe I did mention it. No, this.

859
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,760
Oh, I don't want to repeat myself.

860
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,280
Oh, no, you did say on the stream, but I think you also said on the episode.

861
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,400
Damn it.

862
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,800
Well, you got reviewed.

863
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,920
Phantom's Revenge got reviewed by a diaper fur.

864
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,200
I got reviewed by this diaper fur and it was actually kind of a good review.

865
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,280
It was kind of a they made thoughtful observations about the game,

866
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,720
but they made them.

867
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,480
With this literal and I'm not joking, literally a drooling

868
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,280
like a drooling baby, but adult, adult baby in a diaper.

869
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,080
Avatar, I didn't hear about that part.

870
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,760
Um, I think they were called fluff bite.

871
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,200
Systems or fluff bite entertainment.

872
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,480
OK, I think maybe I did mention this already.

873
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,960
So I won't belabor the point.

874
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,080
Um, how do I find this?

875
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,120
They're fluff.

876
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,920
OK, on Twitter, they're fluff bite entertainment systems and they're on

877
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,760
Twitch. Where's their freaking YouTube?

878
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,480
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

879
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,800
I can fluff shank.

880
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,800
It's on their fluff bite presents channel.

881
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,760
They have two channels.

882
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,720
The one this was on is the fluff bite presents, which is they're like edited videos.

883
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,200
They have another one for like.

884
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,960
Oh, by doesn't be BYTE.

885
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,080
Yeah. Yeah.

886
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,560
So 10 days ago in the JRPG used to inspire one.

887
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,200
Yeah, I don't know why it's I don't know why it's called that.

888
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,600
I don't know why I don't know what's going on with that title.

889
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,120
Oh, my God, it is a drooling diaper very.

890
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,360
Yeah, it's it's the first review.

891
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,760
It starts like three minutes in and the delivery is terrible.

892
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,280
They like stammer their way through the scripts of themselves talking about it.

893
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,560
But the review, it's the content of the review itself is not that bad.

894
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,960
Like, it's kind of good, actually.

895
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,280
I don't know. Pretty funny.

896
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,320
It's it's it's the avatar like normally it's like drooling

897
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,680
and it's like jittering, you know, in that way that like a PNG tuber sort of jitters

898
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,480
when the voice is speaking.

899
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,200
Yeah, but then sometimes it like lunges forward.

900
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,960
It lunges forward at the camera and it stops drooling, but it gets like a sad face.

901
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,840
I saw it just then. Yeah, that may literally be a Vtuber.

902
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,000
Like, I think it is a like a P it like it's not animated to speak.

903
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,120
Instead, it is sort of animated to make that face and jitter around when

904
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,960
there's speech happening and when there's not speech, it's sad.

905
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,720
Yeah, it's a little bit unsettling, honestly.

906
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,400
You know, I did appreciate the review, though.

907
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,840
And they actually they actually had a pretty.

908
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,480
You know, the section is like seven minutes long and they they talk about

909
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,400
like the design of the game and stuff.

910
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,720
And they, you know, they talk about all the freaking assets I had.

911
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,160
And they talk about how this how the Sonichu enemies are like a smart use

912
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,320
of like default assets to like get a lot of content out of.

913
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm like, yeah, it is. Thanks.

914
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,240
He they say that the whole the game is like one long like battle corridor.

915
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,360
They say that it's like a combination of a JRPG and a beat them up.

916
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,720
And I'm like, yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.

917
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,880
You've figured it out.

918
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,480
She said described my game correctly.

919
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,080
Surprisingly rare.

920
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,840
OK, whatever.

921
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,720
It's a fucking thumbnail with all those things and then Phantom Horn.

922
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,720
I mean, he fits. He fits right in.

923
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:49,240
Shoutouts to Fluff by Fluff by systems for their sick review.

924
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,600
Hell, yeah, revenge. Hell, yeah.

925
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,280
OK, that's all I have to say about that.

926
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,600
Did I meant did I mention did did we talk about how we found that freaking web comic?

927
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,200
I think we did, right?

928
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,880
What freak are the ladies?

929
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,200
The big big boob ladies.

930
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,400
Did we talk about that that we found that?

931
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,600
Um, I definitely remember on the stream you mentioned.

932
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,160
And we had to we had to stop streaming

933
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,880
because I can't remember what I said on the stream and what I said on the show

934
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,840
because it all just blends together.

935
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,640
I just say it.

936
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,480
Yeah. Say it again.

937
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,440
I got things to talk about.

938
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,720
But someone someone called Rusting Robot

939
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,440
found when and found on the on somewhere on the forum,

940
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,720
some bad web comics forums or something.

941
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Yeah, the comic with the big boob ladies is called Jennifer.

942
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,360
It's called Jennifer's show.

943
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,600
Jen, I'm losing my I'm losing my freaking mind.

944
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,720
I'm losing my freaking mind.

945
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,920
I'm literally going to check the show notes of the last episode

946
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,400
and see if if if it's there because I feel like I've said this before.

947
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Help.

948
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,720
I don't know. Go check.

949
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,440
OK, I'm going.

950
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,640
All right, whatever.

951
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,720
It's not in the show notes, so I guess I didn't say it.

952
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,640
Yeah, Rusting Robot found Jen Jennifer show.

953
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,720
And that's what the freaking web comics called.

954
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,640
Yes, it's it's it's a comic.

955
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,120
About two ladies who are lesbian lovers.

956
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,120
Yeah.

957
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,000
One of them has ears and a tail.

958
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,640
The other one just has ears.

959
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,520
One of them is a cat girl.

960
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,320
Let me check the episode before the last one.

961
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,680
Wait a minute.

962
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,680
Wait a minute.

963
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,760
No.

964
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,080
Two episodes ago, I talked about that Hazel video about the big booba anime.

965
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,720
This is one about Jenny Nicholson.

966
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,320
Oh, well. Oh, well, I guess I'm repeating myself.

967
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,440
Yeah.

968
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,760
There's some really funny like

969
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,160
there's a really funny like reaction images of like the Jenny's

970
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,360
because I think I think they're both named.

971
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,480
Jennifer like one is Jennifer and the other is Jenny.

972
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,720
Yeah, there's something like that.

973
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,320
And they have the they have the big booba and

974
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,120
there's a YouTube channel.

975
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,480
The person has a YouTube channel where they post videos of themselves

976
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,840
like cosplaying as their own characters.

977
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,440
And it's very weird looking.

978
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,760
And yeah, I didn't look through too many of those.

979
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,920
Yeah.

980
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,560
I think that they had one with a puppet.

981
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,680
They had made a puppet of Jen or Jennifer.

982
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,320
I don't know if I saw a puppet, but that was one of the first videos.

983
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,080
A lot of them.

984
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,840
I think they have multiple channels.

985
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,680
That's the thing.

986
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,960
They have one that's like they mention in the comic that I googled

987
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,960
and I found and then there's another one that's like more,

988
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,120
I guess, brand.

989
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,920
More brand, more brand.

990
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,240
Hang on, my phone just spoke to me and I'm scared.

991
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,120
I need to go kill it.

992
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,720
I freaking I freaking can't Google Jennifer show without YouTube

993
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,680
or Google telling me, oh, did you mean the Jennifer Hudson show?

994
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,680
No, I don't even know who that is.

995
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,440
This this fucking sucks, even though I know the name,

996
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,280
I literally like can't Google it because it just gives me.

997
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,720
Unrelated results for things with the word Jennifer.

998
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,720
OK, sorry about that.

999
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,960
I I just heard out of the corner of my ear like your alarm has been set

1000
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,920
for one a.m. tomorrow and I'm like.

1001
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,360
Why? Oh, you're over the other side of the room

1002
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,960
and I haven't been talking about that.

1003
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,800
Did you listen to me?

1004
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,360
What the fuck happened?

1005
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,000
Oh, it's it's Miss Jen, Miss Jay.

1006
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,240
No, the characters are called Miss Jay and Jen.

1007
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,320
Um, the content of the comic is is just like,

1008
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,600
aha, we love each other so much, aha, it's so lovey-dovey over here.

1009
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,720
And then they say trans rights and then they say gay rights.

1010
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,520
Do they do they say trans rights, gay rights?

1011
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,800
Do they say stuff?

1012
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,400
Yeah, very occasionally, there'll be like a flag wave in moment.

1013
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,600
OK, the comic is not really like a narrative.

1014
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,720
It's just nothing really happens.

1015
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,240
It's just them.

1016
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:21,920
Yeah, it's it's like it's just drawing the characters with like you can tell

1017
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,400
when they've learned about a different brush setting and Photoshop.

1018
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,600
And they're like, oh, this one is like this is like a Japanese,

1019
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,040
like a sideways, like diagonal sort of brush.

1020
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,400
And they start drawing with that and it looks like shit and then it all looks

1021
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,160
like shit, but it's like, oh, yeah, it's sort of.

1022
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,520
But that's what I'm here for.

1023
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,640
Yeah, it's odd.

1024
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,360
It's odd and weirdly charming.

1025
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,640
Wow. What do you what do you know?

1026
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,280
I like I like the one where we're Miss J or Jennifer or whatever.

1027
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,560
It's just like, get the popcorn, honey.

1028
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,160
They're going to they're going to make fun of us on Kiwi Farms thread again.

1029
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,840
Ha, ha, movie time.

1030
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:07,560
And the spelling is like a trotius, like a parody level bad spelling.

1031
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,040
It's great.

1032
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,120
It's really there's a lot of really that's what you like to see.

1033
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,080
It honestly feels like a like a genuine

1034
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,560
sweet bro and hella Jeff comic.

1035
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,320
Yes, it really it really does.

1036
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:27,320
It feels like someone actually made sweet bro and hella Jeff,

1037
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,560
but unironically, but it just happens to be instead of dude bro gamers.

1038
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,080
It's about big boob lesbian trans cat girls.

1039
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,920
And honestly, I love you know what?

1040
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,520
Yeah, you know what? It's.

1041
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,800
And that concept in and of itself feels like some someone it feels like some

1042
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,880
unfunny shit Lord was like, haha, I'll do that as a joke.

1043
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,920
But no, it's not a joke.

1044
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,600
They didn't do it as a joke.

1045
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,720
It's just earnest and it's the appreciation of the of the subject matter.

1046
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,480
Friend of the show, Jennifer J. Jennifer J.

1047
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,200
Can we get Jennifer J as a guest?

1048
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,840
Oh, my God, can you imagine?

1049
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,960
Oh, my God, we should do a lecture.

1050
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,800
Do a PCP lecture on the Jennifer Jane averse.

1051
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,680
I guess so. I don't know if there's that much to it.

1052
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,320
I read like a ton of the comics.

1053
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,640
Did you actually?

1054
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,160
Yeah, I just kept like moving through them.

1055
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,680
That's funny.

1056
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,520
I can't even find I literally can't find them on Google

1057
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,400
because they don't like where are they posted what website?

1058
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,840
What do you mean? The website that.

1059
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,560
Does she have her own website?

1060
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,840
Yeah, didn't they say what was the person who found the website?

1061
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,240
Well, they found it on like a forum.

1062
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,040
Oh, I somebody when it was announced.

1063
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,280
Oh, during the stream, we mentioned it during the stream

1064
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,120
and then somebody in chat linked the website

1065
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,480
where they post all of their own comics.

1066
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:04,080
OK, well, I'm OK, well, they have a Twitter.

1067
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,600
But oh, my God, they have a Twitter,

1068
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,640
but they haven't posted since like 2019.

1069
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,120
Oh, boy, this person, I guess I didn't save.

1070
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,320
OK, OK, is it is it the new the linked website on their Twitter

1071
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,520
is called the new stories of Miss J and Jen dot webcomic dot WS.

1072
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,600
Try that.

1073
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,760
Yeah, I mean, link it here.

1074
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,720
I there are a bunch here.

1075
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,880
It like starts with like a a retrospective

1076
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,720
because they made comics before, but have had transferred

1077
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,320
from whatever site that was on to this new site.

1078
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,440
Fuck is this? What is this?

1079
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,800
Here's here's the here's, I guess, the newest one or the newest one

1080
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,200
on this site posted on 2019.

1081
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,080
It's called the joint shop.

1082
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,560
Yeah, that's the one you post the website as well.

1083
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,480
Yes. Yeah, this is the website I looked through.

1084
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,920
Like as much as I felt like it's quite a lot, honestly.

1085
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,240
There's quite a lot.

1086
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,000
Some day I'll learn love.

1087
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,080
All right, this is the first one that's like amusing on a wave.

1088
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,680
OK, like I wonder if my creator will still draw me in 30 years, said

1089
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:33,440
my Miss J on the fourth or the 26th of the fourth 1984.

1090
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,240
Hey, she's wearing a vinyl scratch T-shirt.

1091
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,840
OK, here's one.

1092
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,600
This one's funny.

1093
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,040
Welcome to my world, the Canada's North.

1094
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,560
I don't know why this one's funny.

1095
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,640
Oh, look, 30 years ago, Miss J had normal big boobs.

1096
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,600
Now she's got the biggest boobs ever.

1097
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,160
It's so development.

1098
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,320
It's character development.

1099
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,120
Yes, Jen, I found that meteor that fall from that meteor shower.

1100
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,120
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1101
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,480
Wait, read this one one second.

1102
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,040
Lamal, you'll never guess what you'll never guess what the punchline is.

1103
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,080
Yes, Jen.

1104
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,680
I found that meteor that fall from the meteor shower is bigger than my boobs.

1105
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,920
Yeah.

1106
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,760
Wait, is there like a copy paste, like different image of legs?

1107
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,440
Over top of that. Oh, God, there is.

1108
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,720
Oh, God.

1109
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,320
She put a she put a carpet, a little rug on top of the meteor.

1110
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,200
To sit on it.

1111
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,840
That's OK.

1112
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,280
That's that's got to be her actual house, right?

1113
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,520
That's got to be like the actual house that she lives in potentially.

1114
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,760
I feel like she takes like a lot of random images

1115
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,960
from all over the Internet to compile these things.

1116
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,080
Like the boobs in this one are like a shape

1117
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,520
that has like a different layer of some texture stripes.

1118
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,720
Like underneath.

1119
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,960
Yeah, well, that's just that's called

1120
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,440
that's called screen toning.

1121
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,120
Give mangaka have mastered the art.

1122
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,000
It's just funny because they clearly know like some techniques

1123
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,840
to like have like a layer mask and then put something underneath.

1124
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,080
But it's so bad.

1125
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,920
Yeah, yeah.

1126
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,040
But it's all in service of of this as the final product.

1127
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,200
Um, but it's so bad that it's good and I like it.

1128
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,680
Wait a second, we got it.

1129
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,720
Wait, we got to show Cheesy this one.

1130
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,200
Check check this out.

1131
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,920
I don't even know what's going on here.

1132
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,160
Is she fighting a clown for the last box of popcorn?

1133
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,960
The last box in town.

1134
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,560
What is pink candy popcorn?

1135
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,000
Licking the elephant.

1136
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,600
Isn't it Lucky Elephant?

1137
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,480
Oh, Lucky Elephant, Lucky Elephant, pink.

1138
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,320
Lucky Elephant, pink candy popcorn.

1139
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,440
A Canadian confection.

1140
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,240
Oh, Canada's North.

1141
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,680
Yeah. OK.

1142
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,840
I guess that's why it's like a Canadian thing.

1143
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,280
Like weird, like troll feet.

1144
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:46,520
Like OK, so it's just Pink Cracker Jack but with no peanuts.

1145
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,960
I hate Cracker Jack.

1146
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,880
You're a Cracker Jack.

1147
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,360
No, it sucks.

1148
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,520
It's ass. I don't like it.

1149
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,640
Look at this.

1150
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,440
Look at this edit.

1151
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,480
Big groups on this web call me.

1152
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,560
What?

1153
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,880
Why did they forget the last point?

1154
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,280
Yeah.

1155
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,200
Atom dot smasher dot org slash what is do I dare click?

1156
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,800
Yeah, I think you do.

1157
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,640
I think you do.

1158
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,960
I've seen Adam dot smasher before.

1159
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,360
That's that's a real thing.

1160
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,760
Dot org slash what?

1161
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,320
OK.

1162
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,720
I need some coffee for this.

1163
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,640
HTTP column.

1164
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,160
Double slash fucking you there.

1165
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
Are you alive?

1166
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,520
This person's like 60, by the way.

1167
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,520
Yeah.

1168
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,120
Probably around the same age as what's her name?

1169
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,560
Jennifer Diane writes.

1170
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,520
Oh, my God, Jennifer Diane writes.

1171
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,520
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1172
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,400
Jennifer Diane writes is more significantly more.

1173
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,160
Literate.

1174
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,640
Yes.

1175
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,640
I know this is.

1176
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,080
I should I should dive in.

1177
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,280
Pression.

1178
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,560
I don't know if that's the right word, but like this month is February

1179
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,560
and I've been.

1180
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,280
Oh, my God.

1181
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,080
I should draw Jennifer J.

1182
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,120
You should do fan art.

1183
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,400
You should do fan art.

1184
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,360
Dude, what the fuck?

1185
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,480
That's beautiful.

1186
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,560
That's beautiful.

1187
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,240
Just make sure.

1188
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,760
OK, there's something something very charming about the Canadianess of it.

1189
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,640
Something something about something about pink lucky elephant pink candy popcorn

1190
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,000
is such like such an old person thing.

1191
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,480
Why on earth is the background like this?

1192
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,800
It's it's it you look at it and you're like, oh, yeah, it's a badly drawn comic.

1193
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:03,120
But then the choices made are baffling straight up sweet bro and hella Jeff mouth.

1194
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,120
After watching that Miley Cyrus wrecking ball video,

1195
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:11,240
I want to ride your twin wrecking balls all night long.

1196
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,120
This is amazing.

1197
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,440
In static bedroom.

1198
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,680
Yeah.

1199
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,760
Why are they in a static.

1200
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,640
World.

1201
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,120
It's just I don't I don't understand, but it's great.

1202
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,440
I I I I I can't explain anything.

1203
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,760
I'm just glad I'm glad the mystery is solved.

1204
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,440
Yes, Jennifer.

1205
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,480
The new PCP girl.

1206
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,320
PCP guy, PCP girl.

1207
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,560
I should I should we should we should put this in the.

1208
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,840
In the perfect comic party.

1209
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,720
You should get her to.

1210
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,800
Yeah, just steal it.

1211
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,560
Just steal it and put it in and call it a call it a parody.

1212
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,280
I'll only post one more.

1213
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,000
Yeah, OK, this is because this is we could post we could we could we could do.

1214
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,480
Yeah, we could do this all day.

1215
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,640
But I just phoning to tell you thanks for the roses.

1216
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,600
Like what a what a nothing premise for drawing for comic.

1217
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,520
You know what?

1218
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,280
But it's funny because it's like, oh, yeah, from real life, you know,

1219
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,400
when when an old person is like, oh, thank you for the gift.

1220
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,840
I'll just phone you up and like say that.

1221
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,320
It's like, oh, it's like real life, but so uninteresting.

1222
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,320
Why would you draw it?

1223
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,760
Why would you make a comic about it?

1224
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,760
You know, that's true.

1225
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,480
This is very this is a very old person thing to do.

1226
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,240
First of all, the landline.

1227
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,960
The the bow, the like bow around the neck.

1228
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,040
Yeah, just calling in to tell you thanks for the roses.

1229
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,240
And also.

1230
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,920
Oh, shit, I was going to say something else when, you know,

1231
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,320
you say it's a boring premise,

1232
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,760
but when you're a genius like me, all art is like that.

1233
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,080
You look at everything and you say, what was the point?

1234
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,840
Why? What a boring premise.

1235
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,360
Why even play all the Mega Man games?

1236
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,720
You like is exactly the same as Jennifer J. Exactly.

1237
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,440
Oh, wait.

1238
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,440
So Mega Man, just some robot masters attack and Mega Man.

1239
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,240
She's got to stop them.

1240
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,960
What a boring premise for a video game.

1241
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,880
Who cares?

1242
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,840
Just phoning to tell you thanks for the.

1243
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,760
Sentience.

1244
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,920
Yes, yes, yes.

1245
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,920
You go to the yes to the frickin light capsule

1246
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,240
in the hologram of Dr. Light.

1247
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,800
Just phoning to tell you thanks for making me giving me free will.

1248
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,480
Dr. Light.

1249
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,800
Anyway, I'm off to shoot nuclear blasts at some Mavericks.

1250
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:51,840
I'll see you by just, you know, just tedious, just tedious.

1251
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,720
All right, this is great.

1252
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,160
I guess we can't.

1253
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,240
Hey, I made a I made a frickin dish.

1254
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,440
Out of clay.

1255
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,760
No. Out of food.

1256
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,080
Would you put on the dish?

1257
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,960
I cooked. I cooked lentils.

1258
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,800
I heard lentils were high in protein, so I bought some and I cooked them

1259
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,720
in my rice cooker and that worked out pretty well.

1260
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,520
But I ever have lentils?

1261
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,840
I think so. Are they the little green?

1262
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,440
Yeah, they look.

1263
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,280
Yes, yes, yes.

1264
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,320
Um, they were like they came out of the thing.

1265
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,400
They were like, OK, they smelled like OK.

1266
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,760
They smelled like kind of earthy and otherwise neutral.

1267
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,800
And I was like, yeah, all right, all right.

1268
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,360
But you know what I had?

1269
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,160
I had some bacon grease.

1270
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,560
I put the bacon grease on the lentils and it was amazing.

1271
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,760
It was incredible, perfect, perfect.

1272
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,920
So glad I had that.

1273
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,680
If I wish I had more bacon grease, but I used up all that I had.

1274
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,280
If I had more, I would make more lentils and eat them.

1275
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,800
It just went just went really well.

1276
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,400
Just went really well.

1277
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,800
You know, I could put like butter on them or something,

1278
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,800
but wouldn't be as good.

1279
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,160
I did. How do you?

1280
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,200
What is the like taste of I know it's taste of bacon.

1281
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,920
Like if you had like just oil, like a neutral oil,

1282
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,720
what would you add to it to make it like bacon?

1283
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,320
Would it just be salt?

1284
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,920
Um, I mean, the most important thing would be salt.

1285
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,160
Other. Yeah, there's not really.

1286
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:32,240
I mean, you could put like some like mesquite flavor on if you had mosquito.

1287
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,760
Mesquite, it's like the smoky.

1288
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,800
Chemical or whatever.

1289
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,800
Yeah.

1290
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,000
You can get, you know, it's like to get, I think the way you do it

1291
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,440
is like when you when you roast meat, like the smoke

1292
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,360
gives it like a certain flavor and they you can sort of

1293
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,640
they can like chemically extract that mesquite smoke flavor

1294
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,080
and you can like put it on food.

1295
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,120
So I mean, that might.

1296
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,480
Is it different from just carbon?

1297
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,160
Oh, God, I don't know.

1298
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,000
Get some charcoal rub it on there.

1299
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,720
I mean, a little bit.

1300
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,800
Yeah, just a little bit.

1301
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,720
I mean, not not charcoal.

1302
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,520
But toast. Yeah.

1303
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,040
Yeah, the saltiness is the most important thing.

1304
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,800
But the like specifically bacon flavor.

1305
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,760
I don't know if there's anything you can really do.

1306
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,880
I guess you could just get some like pork, pork broth or something.

1307
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,520
Anyway, I just wanted to rave.

1308
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,560
Just want to rave about these lentils.

1309
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,200
I'm going to start using that rice cooker more.

1310
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,480
For lentils.

1311
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,840
Cool.

1312
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,320
Wait, hey, is it cold over there?

1313
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,680
It's really cold here in New England.

1314
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,800
I've heard it's very cold.

1315
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,040
It's not actually it's quite warm right now.

1316
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,840
The sun is up.

1317
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,960
I blast in where it was.

1318
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,360
I think it might be warming up now,

1319
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,560
but like the last two days, it was like bitterly cold.

1320
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,440
It was like 30 like it was like 30 degrees below zero,

1321
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,360
like with the wind chill.

1322
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,520
Hmm. Yeah.

1323
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,600
Yeah, it was just like fucking nightmare.

1324
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,760
I had I had to walk for like a minute to the bus stop and it was horrible.

1325
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,960
I was waiting for it to get colder.

1326
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,640
I wanted it to like we had a snow time.

1327
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,320
It was a bit of snow, but I wanted it to be a bigger snow than that.

1328
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,440
And I was like, oh, what if it, you know, what if it's not December?

1329
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,360
What if it's like January, February?

1330
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,120
Those are usually cold, but it's already warming up.

1331
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,600
I don't know if it's going to get cold again.

1332
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,960
Yeah, it was warming up here.

1333
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,600
It never really got that cold this year.

1334
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,920
It was warming up.

1335
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,560
And then there was just a really sudden, super cold snap

1336
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,120
just the last two days and like it's over and it didn't snow during it.

1337
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,720
We had a couple of little snows this year, nothing, nothing too big.

1338
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,320
It was just fucking brutal, just freaking brutal out yesterday.

1339
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:03,280
Make sure you find like a fountain and you get a big slab of ice and you smash it,

1340
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,960
pick it up and throw it, would recommend.

1341
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:10,760
Interesting.

1342
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,040
The other like a few weeks ago, it was like it wasn't snowy,

1343
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,080
but it was very, very cold and there was like a bucket of water.

1344
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:22,440
That we had outside just from like the party where we had like wine in it.

1345
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,920
There was just water in it now.

1346
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:32,760
And the top layer is like two inches of sheer ice, just a big slab.

1347
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,880
So I picked it up and I dropped it and I got a crowbar

1348
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,320
and I started swacking it and it was fun.

1349
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,880
I would encourage that behavior.

1350
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,720
Dangerous, dangerous.

1351
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:51,320
I wasn't like like hitting as hard as I can because ice doesn't need that much pressure.

1352
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,760
I was sort of tapping it and seeing it crack and then holding it up to the light

1353
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,040
and seeing like all the prismatic effects, Isaac Newton shit.

1354
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,320
Isaac Newton shit.

1355
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,000
No, I get you. I get you.

1356
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,680
Yeah, like ice, I guess.

1357
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,120
Yeah, ice can be cool.

1358
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,080
It can be cold. Sometimes.

1359
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,880
Ah, OK.

1360
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,640
But what else?

1361
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,520
What else? I'm going through my list.

1362
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,840
Well, I got something.

1363
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,680
Oh, sure. So I forget what happened last PCP.

1364
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,440
But. Oh, no.

1365
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,600
Yeah, no, I can't remember.

1366
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,600
Timelines are fucked right now, but I've been working on Clarissa Gunsmoke.

1367
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,280
I've been hard at it.

1368
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:52,840
Good. This past week and it's been going slow, but increasing in productivity.

1369
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,840
So that's good.

1370
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:00,800
I'm on track to, I don't know, get the chapter out by the end of the month,

1371
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,560
but I want to see if I can increase my productivity over the next week or so.

1372
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,280
Because right now it's a bit slow, but I'm doing it.

1373
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,000
I'm doing it consistent.

1374
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,240
I just need to at least stay consistent.

1375
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,520
And that's my update.

1376
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,920
Perfect Comic Party will, like, like begin in earnest once that is nearing completion.

1377
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,360
And then I can be like, OK, time to actually draw the logo properly

1378
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,840
and come up with like the system for the PDF and the contents page

1379
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,720
and what fonts to use and stuff.

1380
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:38,720
I have not done any Biscopades yet.

1381
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:46,840
And the reason why is because this week I've pretty much finished

1382
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,640
I've pretty much finished editing the book.

1383
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:54,480
And I remember how I talked about how I was going to have to catfish the editor.

1384
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,120
Well, I've successfully done that.

1385
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:01,960
I've made a new account and I contacted the publisher again

1386
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,080
and they don't know it's me.

1387
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,160
Did you give them a different name?

1388
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,040
Well, I made the new account funnily enough, the old account that I was doing

1389
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,760
it was the the rowdy fuckers cop killers Alibaba account

1390
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,000
and the one that we made the pins under.

1391
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,240
And so like my name, my official name on the website was listed as rowdy fucker.

1392
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,360
And so like people and like these these Chinese like correspondence

1393
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,760
would they would address me as like dear rowdy fucker comma

1394
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,120
because I mean that's was what it said my name was.

1395
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,280
No, now I'm doing it as a cop killer.

1396
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,920
And yeah.

1397
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,640
And so now I'm just going to I'm just I'm not going to I'm not going to ask

1398
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,320
them any questions. I'm just going to she gave me she gave me a new template.

1399
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,240
It's slightly different from the old template she gave me whatever.

1400
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:56,000
So I had just got to reform out all the pages to meet the new template.

1401
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,680
And I got to finish the cover and then it's just like got to send that off

1402
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,680
to her and tell her like, OK, make a test copy.

1403
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,080
And I think I'll I think I'm going to try to get her to make two test copies

1404
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,560
and like two different color schemes and like two different like page

1405
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,760
like page weights like paper weights.

1406
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,280
And I'll just see like which one is better.

1407
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,920
Yeah. And that's the plan at the moment.

1408
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,560
And so that's what I've been doing because like it's basically ready to go.

1409
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,720
And that's very exciting.

1410
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,200
And it's just for sure.

1411
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,880
It's very tedious, very tedious to go.

1412
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,560
I got to go through every page and reformat.

1413
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,400
But you know what? That's that's that's that's the business.

1414
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,560
That's give me a refresher. I'm going to I want to buy the book, obviously.

1415
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,800
But I forget you had like the slime as a potential

1416
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,200
like reward. Yeah, all the things.

1417
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,760
Um, well, I don't know exactly.

1418
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,760
You mean like what are all the like bonus?

1419
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,400
Well, what are the things that could potentially be sent with the book?

1420
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,560
Um, OK, well, there's going to be.

1421
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,240
I'm going to give podrans.

1422
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,560
I have green crystals.

1423
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,800
I think I'm probably going to make that like a stretch goal.

1424
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,960
Like if everyone if we hit a certain stretch goal,

1425
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,240
everyone will get a free podrans, which although you might be maybe

1426
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,680
if you wanted extra, you could buy some extras if you want.

1427
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,200
I'm going to do.

1428
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,080
Yeah, I'm going to offer the slime bottles because that's funny.

1429
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:37,200
I'm going to offer some like the pins from the RFCK pin Kickstarter.

1430
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,480
Instead of offering them on like a one by one base, I'm going to offer like a pack.

1431
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:45,800
It'll be like for 20 extra dollars, you get like, you know, four or five.

1432
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:52,320
Like like a set of like rowdy ones, killer ones or slime corp ones or whatever.

1433
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:58,720
So yeah, you can get pins in like not in like huge bulk, but in like a slightly

1434
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,280
more like bulk discount than just buying them one by one.

1435
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,200
What else?

1436
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,000
I think that's it.

1437
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,360
I think that's it.

1438
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,760
I mean, what more do you want?

1439
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,360
A physical copy of Phantom's revenge.

1440
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,920
I can put in my NES.

1441
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,960
Oh, no.

1442
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,200
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1443
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,640
That's that's not that's not happening.

1444
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1445
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,240
I'll probably do it like I'll probably.

1446
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,720
Oh, OK. Oh, yeah, sure.

1447
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,640
I'll probably do it like I'll probably have the baseline

1448
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,280
goal for the Kickstarter just be hit a certain number of copies

1449
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,280
and it'll be like just the comic.

1450
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,480
And I'll probably have like a stretch goal

1451
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,240
that's like if we hit the stretch goal, then I can also include the index

1452
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:53,720
because the extra pages of the index will cost more to print.

1453
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,680
Although really, I mean, I want to I want to include the index

1454
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,400
because like I put a lot of work into it.

1455
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,720
But I but I also like to set the the base goal as low as possible.

1456
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,240
So probably split it up like that and make make the index technically a stretch goal.

1457
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:14,720
I've been spending a lot of money on commission stuff

1458
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,560
and I can create a plushies.

1459
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,200
Oh, you bought that.

1460
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,280
You got that commission from from Botster.

1461
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,160
That was kind of expensive.

1462
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,160
That was expensive, but hell, yeah. Yeah.

1463
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,160
Worth I saw that that she retweeted that

1464
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,280
Clarissa page. Was it this week that you tweeted that Clarissa page?

1465
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,440
Or is that the one?

1466
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,080
I think it was last I could have been this week.

1467
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,960
No, I think it was last week.

1468
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,640
I don't as I said, time doesn't make any sense.

1469
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,720
I think it was this week.

1470
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:46,120
I think it was this week and it was a good good page.

1471
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,360
Yeah, it was a good page.

1472
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,240
I was just sort of looking back at it because I was like,

1473
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:55,600
I don't remember which side of the fucking belt her gun holster is on.

1474
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,720
Let me check my own comic and I was reading it and it's like, you know what?

1475
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,120
This is good. This is a good comic. It looks good.

1476
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,760
I did it. I'll continue to do it.

1477
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,000
And so I posted it on Twitter.

1478
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,880
That's the spirit.

1479
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,280
I posted it on Twitter.

1480
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,680
It's like, you know what? I like this.

1481
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,800
And then people like, wow, Pog.

1482
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,040
And because of her retweeting it, I got like a bunch of followers.

1483
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,200
And you're a thousand like a thousand likes or something.

1484
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,320
A thousand something likes. Yeah.

1485
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,880
That was a nice. That was a nice boost.

1486
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:26,600
There was one guy.

1487
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,400
There was one guy who responded to it, saying, oh, this is good.

1488
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,080
I like this sort of thing.

1489
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:35,200
And then we need more comics like this, this sort of action.

1490
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,200
OK, weirdo. And then I under the the tweet,

1491
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,720
I had like a link to the Clarissa Gunsmoke comic and he left a reply to that.

1492
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,800
And he said, I like it.

1493
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,720
But I feel it feels a bit misandrist how the bad guys are boys

1494
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,360
and the good guys are girls.

1495
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,800
That's so funny.

1496
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,920
That's so insightful of him.

1497
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It was so amusing, like the misandrism, but otherwise pretty good.

1498
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,400
And I'm like, what a.

1499
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,640
What a freaking journey.

1500
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,040
And it's just I couldn't.

1501
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,200
It's I don't even really feel offended about it.

1502
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,560
It's just sort of like what an odd specific.

1503
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,080
I'm sorry to have about it.

1504
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,120
How how do you get through?

1505
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,520
How do you get through life?

1506
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,200
How do you get through life?

1507
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,520
It feels misandrist that the that the protagonist is a girl

1508
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,520
and the and the and the and the bad guys are boys.

1509
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,280
Yeah, let me find the tweet.

1510
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,200
I'm so fucking sorry, you sick fuck.

1511
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:38,560
OK, he says here it is twisted.

1512
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,040
It's pretty nice.

1513
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,480
Overall, I like it.

1514
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,160
I love the girl with freckles and the action scenes,

1515
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,080
but the comics have some.

1516
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:50,560
Yes, the titular Clarissa almost all the dialogue is useless.

1517
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,080
And it just slows the pace without adding anything, which is like.

1518
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,440
I mean, I have like a bit of like agreement

1519
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,840
with like some of the dialogue is just sort of like, ah,

1520
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,800
this is cringe.

1521
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,640
Sometimes it could have been better, whatever, fair enough.

1522
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,080
But then the good girls versus bad boys

1523
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,080
stuff really feels misandrist to me.

1524
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:19,240
Which is I guess that's very funny, very funny.

1525
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,080
It's not even like it's funny

1526
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,720
because Clarissa is not necessarily a good character.

1527
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,320
She gets called a murderer

1528
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:33,080
because she killed those guys at the beginning and she is like,

1529
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,880
she really didn't need to shoot them through the head

1530
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,240
because they were rustling their horse.

1531
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,760
No, she's not wholly good.

1532
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:45,280
And she swears a lot and she's kind of a, you know, she's she's rowdy.

1533
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,240
She's a ruffian. She's rowdy.

1534
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,320
Yeah, I see. I see what you mean.

1535
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:54,080
Yeah, you know, I just I just can't I just can't take a comment like that seriously.

1536
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,400
Uh, Miss Andrews, Miss Andrews, like who says that?

1537
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,720
Yeah, I just I'm I'm I'm taking I'm taking a back.

1538
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,400
I'm taking a back by it.

1539
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,640
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

1540
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,880
No, somebody I remember now, somebody went to this guy's Twitter

1541
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:23,440
and found that he he has a I mean, just look.

1542
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,640
Click on this link, see what he's responding to.

1543
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,760
OK, he says the man is completely savage, hate him or love him.

1544
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,480
He is doing incredible stuff and then see what it's a response to.

1545
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1546
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,640
I I I.

1547
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:52,280
Oh, yes, I put it put it in the I I I it makes perfect sense to me

1548
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:58,920
that the kind of guy who would be upset seeing like a comic about like a girl

1549
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:05,240
cowboy who is fighting against some evil boy cowboys and gets upset about that

1550
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,880
is a Jordan Peterson guy that's like completely tracks.

1551
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,480
Like the image of Jordan Peterson wearing a funny suit.

1552
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,960
He's like, oh, he's savage.

1553
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,200
He's doing incredible stuff.

1554
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,200
I see. I see.

1555
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,920
I wonder what I wonder what Jordan Peterson thinks about Bloodborne Cart.

1556
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,400
I you think you think he's a fan?

1557
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,480
Can't imagine Jordan Peterson playing a video game.

1558
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:42,400
I feel like Jordan Peterson would really resonate with like.

1559
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,720
The fucking themes of like corrupted motherhood and stuff in Bloodborne,

1560
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,640
I think it would make him cry a lot.

1561
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:57,120
I feel like the perversion of the nuclear family or whatever that's going on there

1562
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,240
would like really wrestle him.

1563
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,440
If you know what I mean,

1564
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,080
like the Pokemon.

1565
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,240
That's a deep. That's a deep PCP cut.

1566
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,760
That's a deep. That's a deep PCP cut right there.

1567
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,320
Shout out to the fans.

1568
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,400
Shout outs. Shout outs to Russell.

1569
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,720
I mean, amazing comment, amazing tweet,

1570
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:31,400
amazing content for

1571
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,800
the perfect comic party coming soon, coming soon, a store.

1572
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,800
Yes, I've got a lot of stuff going on right now.

1573
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:48,040
I got like my Clarissa and I've got February, which I'm trying to do every day.

1574
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,400
And then there's Fire Emblem thing, which I'm probably going to leave

1575
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,720
in the back burner. Once I have all of the the rums,

1576
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,320
like my current focus is on that because I just I really want to figure it out

1577
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:03,040
and have all of the the files work and be like, hell, yeah, I have every game.

1578
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,840
I can play them at any moment and then I won't play them.

1579
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,560
I'll play them maybe in March once February is over.

1580
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,320
That's fair. Yeah, that makes sense.

1581
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,080
I have a lot of stuff that I'm supposed to be doing.

1582
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,800
I'm supposed to be working on Beescapades.

1583
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,640
I'm supposed to be streaming battle network.

1584
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,120
I'm supposed to be I think there's more than that.

1585
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:27,120
I'm supposed to be be streaming right now.

1586
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,160
I'm supposed to be drawing right now.

1587
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,320
Mostly instead, I'm

1588
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,760
trying to just trying to scramble and finish and feel good about the files

1589
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,720
that I send to Frickin Alibaba.

1590
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,920
And then what else? What else?

1591
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,600
That's not the only thing I was doing this week.

1592
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:54,880
Now, yes, it is.

1593
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,480
Oh, God, help. I'm floundering.

1594
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,840
I'm floundering. Floundering.

1595
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,520
I don't remember. I don't remember what else happened.

1596
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,080
Oh, what? I've been on Monday.

1597
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,560
I've been working out, of course.

1598
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,400
I am ripped.

1599
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,160
That's why I'm eating oats to get even more ripped and jack.

1600
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,480
Lentil ripped.

1601
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,760
Yeah, that protein went to good use.

1602
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,400
I'm strong now.

1603
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:25,000
I should get back on the whole doing any motion at all thing.

1604
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,280
It's good.

1605
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:32,640
But what if I don't do it to be strong?

1606
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,440
Oh, I played a bit more disco Elysium.

1607
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,760
Oh, I haven't played that either.

1608
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,120
That's another thing I haven't done for like three weeks.

1609
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,000
I played a bit more.

1610
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,320
I just finished day two and so day three is coming up.

1611
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,440
Oh, I'm still ahead of you, though. So that's fine.

1612
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

1613
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,240
I went. What did I do?

1614
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:58,920
I found the truck, the ladies truck with the ladies truck.

1615
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,640
In the truck traffic jam.

1616
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,640
There's like if you talk to the lady on the boat, she says,

1617
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,160
please explain, please look into this drug smuggling potential thing.

1618
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,200
Oh, well, we got to go look for it because now we know we're police officers

1619
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,600
have to investigate.

1620
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,960
So we're looking and then we find

1621
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,160
the the fucking.

1622
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,640
Sandpaper on the the.

1623
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,280
What do you call it?

1624
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,440
Foot pedal.

1625
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,240
Oh, I don't know this.

1626
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:37,880
Oh, OK, maybe I shouldn't maybe I shouldn't say too much.

1627
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,400
There's a truck trying not to spoil too much.

1628
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,480
But I mean, whatever, there's a truck

1629
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:49,160
that once you look in, you see that sandpaper thing

1630
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:55,760
and it corresponds to the odd shoe

1631
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,480
at the scene of the crime that has a scuffed shoe print.

1632
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,160
So it's like, oh, is it the light step?

1633
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,560
I forget which one it was, but there's like the one shoe is scuffed

1634
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,000
and the other one isn't.

1635
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,680
And so it's like the sandpaper is rubbed down on that shoe.

1636
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:16,360
So now you have a link to that person that you didn't know who it was.

1637
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,040
And the person has that truck and I won't say anything other than that.

1638
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,600
But that was a cool extra thing.

1639
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,400
So I followed it up, but it's getting pretty late.

1640
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,280
And I had to. Interesting. OK.

1641
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,560
Yeah, I didn't find that, but that's that's neat.

1642
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,640
There's a bunch of things I bought.

1643
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:38,880
I bought a boombox, which is turns out to be important

1644
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,880
because I needed to play a tape.

1645
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,800
And so I could play it just on my like he holds it on his shoulder

1646
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:51,840
like a funny classic boombox 80s sort of pose.

1647
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:57,800
But it's like like a like a recording of people talking.

1648
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:02,440
There's not exactly a dance moment.

1649
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:08,600
And then did you know you're on you wouldn't have found the the kids by the church.

1650
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,320
No, I can't get there because the drawbridge is closed because of the

1651
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,920
the sign being smashed.

1652
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,600
Did you? Yeah. Did you examine the sign stuff?

1653
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,640
Yeah, I mean, I crossed the water lock.

1654
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:27,560
No, but like there's there's like the tire tracks and then the the bent

1655
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,560
sign and you look at it and you can be like deducing what happened.

1656
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,800
I think so.

1657
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:42,000
Hmm, maybe in Wednesday, they remove all that and so you can't examine it.

1658
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,360
Maybe I mean, yeah, maybe I didn't because I mean.

1659
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:50,240
Because the blockage was there was a sign that had been bent

1660
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:54,360
and you look at it and you can see tie tracks on the sign and then there's a house.

1661
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,680
And then before that, there's tie tracks on the road and you can deduce that.

1662
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:04,080
Oh, a car drove over this this little ramp bit, landed on the roof

1663
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:10,920
and then drove the roof of like the the pawn shop and then drove into the sign

1664
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,160
and then landed on the other side.

1665
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,040
No, that's what the blockage was from.

1666
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,800
I did know that a car was involved.

1667
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:23,400
I did not realize it drove over the roof of the pawn shop.

1668
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,080
That's interesting.

1669
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,080
OK, yeah, I don't know whose car it was.

1670
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:36,080
But because I read a magazine earlier about like the the the racing stuff.

1671
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,080
Oh, the Communist magazine, right?

1672
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,080
Communist magazine.

1673
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,080
Yes.

1674
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,080
It has all of that article about the racing.

1675
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,080
The one that like racing is like an evil capitalist.

1676
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,080
It's an evil capitalist thing.

1677
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,080
Blood sports, you watch it because you want to see a crash.

1678
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,080
Right.

1679
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:59,080
And so because I read that, I had an option to propose that it could have been

1680
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:04,080
the famous driver from the magazine article that did that.

1681
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,080
Oh, was was Kim asking you like, who do you think did this?

1682
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,080
Who do you think did this?

1683
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,080
And I was like, hmm, well, it could be it's probably this guy.

1684
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,080
And he's like, I don't see any evidence for that.

1685
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,080
Why would he be here?

1686
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,080
Mm hmm.

1687
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,080
And then you could you could you could push it.

1688
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,080
You said, no, I'm absolutely certain.

1689
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,080
Mm hmm.

1690
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,080
I don't.

1691
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,080
Yeah, I don't think I did that because it's like there is no evidence.

1692
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,080
Why the hell would this famous guy be here right now?

1693
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:31,080
I'll tell you what, I do know who's I do know who did that.

1694
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,080
I didn't do that interaction.

1695
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:38,080
But from other clues that I've gathered, I do know who did that.

1696
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:44,080
So that's just that's all I'm going to say.

1697
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,080
Haha.

1698
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,080
Haha.

1699
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,080
Haha.

1700
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,080
Yes.

1701
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:55,080
And then I went, I talked to the guy who's sitting on boxes selling clothes and sunglasses

1702
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:59,080
outside the back of a truck.

1703
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:04,080
And I bought some the sunglasses, the Samaritan guy.

1704
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,080
Yeah.

1705
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,080
Yeah.

1706
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,080
And.

1707
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:08,080
Oh, cool.

1708
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:13,080
It's super cool of you to apologize for colonialism.

1709
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,080
Yeah.

1710
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:19,080
Now, please buy, please buy my wares.

1711
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,080
Yeah.

1712
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:26,080
This, the apricots, apricots, Susan T is a shithole, man.

1713
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,080
He's right.

1714
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,080
He's so right.

1715
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:33,080
I also hate his home country.

1716
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,080
Yeah.

1717
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,080
I don't think I did too much else.

1718
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:42,080
I went back to Titus Hardy to try and like prove myself to him again.

1719
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,080
I failed again.

1720
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,080
And then I tried it again.

1721
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,080
I failed again.

1722
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,080
I'm like, fuck.

1723
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:54,080
I'm going to be cool in front of these guys.

1724
01:33:54,080 --> 01:34:00,080
And yeah, there's a few other things I don't want to spoil.

1725
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,080
But that's, that was day two.

1726
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:07,080
And then day three, I think I'm just going to go across the bridge and see what the fuck

1727
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,080
is on the other side.

1728
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,080
Oh, and the cryptid.

1729
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,080
Oh yeah.

1730
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,080
Yeah.

1731
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,080
The lady in the wheelchair who has a husband, a cryptozoologist.

1732
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,080
Cryptozoologist's wife, yeah.

1733
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,080
And she likes cryptids as well.

1734
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,080
And if you talk to her.

1735
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,080
Did she tell you about cryptids?

1736
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,080
You can ask her about cryptids.

1737
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:29,080
And I asked about are there invisible cryptids and she said yes.

1738
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:33,080
There's one that has a high frequency thing.

1739
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,080
And she talked about that.

1740
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,080
And then.

1741
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,080
Wait, is it the one that like is a high frequency sound?

1742
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,080
Yeah, it is a high frequency sound.

1743
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,080
It doesn't have mass.

1744
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,080
That one.

1745
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,080
That one's, that one's fucking dog shit.

1746
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,080
That's a fucking dog shit story of a cryptid.

1747
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:52,080
That one's, that one literally like makes me hate her a little bit.

1748
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:56,080
Like that she would, that she would relate that story as though I'm supposed to take it seriously.

1749
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:01,080
Well, but after listening to that, I went outside and I could hear it.

1750
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,080
You know, like your character is like, oh, I think I hear the cryptid.

1751
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,080
Wait, what?

1752
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:11,080
But it's like probably in your head, but you can do one of those like thought things,

1753
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,080
you know, when you have like a little diamond.

1754
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:17,080
The little orbiting thing around your head.

1755
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,080
Yeah.

1756
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,080
I mean, that's what started it.

1757
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:22,080
But like, you know, when you can internalize something.

1758
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,080
Yes.

1759
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,080
Yes.

1760
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,080
Yes.

1761
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,080
You have a thought and you internalize it.

1762
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,080
Yes.

1763
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:32,080
I'm currently internalizing the cryptid that you can't feel or touch, but you can hear.

1764
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,080
Oh, that's so funny.

1765
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,080
I didn't get that.

1766
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,080
Yeah.

1767
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,080
I didn't ask for all the cryptids.

1768
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,080
I said one cryptid, please.

1769
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,080
And I said, OK, that one.

1770
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,080
Yeah.

1771
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,080
So I learned about that one.

1772
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,080
I know.

1773
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:49,080
I think I've pretty much completed like her whole like saga.

1774
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:55,080
And yet I never I never got like a cryptid thought to internalize.

1775
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:59,080
Even though she told me about a bunch more cryptids that were like less shitty than the

1776
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:02,080
the stupid sound one.

1777
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,080
I wonder what it's going to do to me.

1778
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:08,080
That's I'm going to get turned into a fucking freak.

1779
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:12,080
I'm going to be fucking hearing things demon.

1780
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,080
Yeah.

1781
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:16,080
What are the thoughts do I have?

1782
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,080
I mean, I've got I've got the shit compressor.

1783
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:22,080
I've got the long way home.

1784
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:26,080
I've got the, of course, the Mazovian socioeconomics.

1785
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,080
Obviously.

1786
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,080
I don't know.

1787
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,080
It's a bunch of just a bunch of crap.

1788
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,080
I didn't really use those too much.

1789
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:39,080
I mean, the Mazovian socioeconomics just is like, I just say communist stuff whenever

1790
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,080
I can to get that sweet, sweet bonus exp.

1791
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,080
Right.

1792
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,080
You get bonus experience.

1793
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,080
Yeah.

1794
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,080
I think I had one.

1795
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,080
I internalized.

1796
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:55,080
I forget what it's called, where when I click on a green thing, like a green orb to pay

1797
01:36:55,080 --> 01:37:01,080
attention to something, I get money somehow, like little 10 cents every time I examine something.

1798
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:07,080
Is that some kind of like some, you must be doing some kind of weird, like ultra liberal

1799
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,080
thing.

1800
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,080
Maybe.

1801
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:19,080
I put on some shoes that were like these shoes like clue you into the economy or something

1802
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,080
like these shoes make you like really make you want to make a lot of money.

1803
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:27,080
I was like, no, get them off.

1804
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:30,080
Yeah, I don't think I have that thought.

1805
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,080
I haven't played in a while.

1806
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,080
I got to get back into it.

1807
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:41,080
Oh, and the last thing that I was trying to figure out is in the place where there's

1808
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:46,080
the bear fridge, there's an ice cream maker.

1809
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:53,080
And if you have a supreme crowbar of some kind, better than the pry bar that you can get from

1810
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:58,080
if you have a super pry bar, you can open it with the relative ease.

1811
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,080
And I don't know what the hell that is or where to find it.

1812
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,080
And I assume it'll be across the bridge.

1813
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:07,080
Yeah, I really want to open this ice cream machine for some reason.

1814
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:12,080
I have not managed to open that ice cream machine.

1815
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,080
I think I turned it off.

1816
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,080
Did you turn it off?

1817
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,080
Yeah.

1818
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:19,080
Turning it off gives you a bonus to opening it, but it wasn't enough.

1819
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,080
Right.

1820
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:26,080
I forgot that I was supposed to be playing Disco Elysium.

1821
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:35,080
I could have freaking beaten it at least once by now if I just put my damn mind to it.

1822
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:40,080
I've been trying to wake up earlier so that I can get my work done so that I have time

1823
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,080
to do things like Disco Elysium in the evening.

1824
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,080
Yeah.

1825
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:52,080
Because if I wake up at 1, I feel compelled to work a little later.

1826
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:56,080
And then by the time I'm really relaxed, it's time for bed really.

1827
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,080
Yeah.

1828
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:59,080
Do I stay up late?

1829
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:05,080
When you're staying up late, even though you could have the same schedule just shifted

1830
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:11,080
a few hours ahead, it feels like after a certain period of darkness, there is no daytime.

1831
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,080
You are off work.

1832
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,080
You don't need to do anything.

1833
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,080
I remembered something that I've been...

1834
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:25,080
It's not that I've been really working, but I have been thinking and buying.

1835
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:29,080
Thinking and buying stuff for when I...

1836
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,080
Okay.

1837
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:35,080
I've been trying to get the files for the book complete and finished now that I have

1838
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:38,080
got another opportunity to do that.

1839
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:45,080
And on top of that, I have been buying stuff for the video, for the announcement video.

1840
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:50,080
Did I tell you what I want to do for the announcement video for the book?

1841
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,080
No.

1842
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,080
I didn't know you had a plan for that.

1843
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:56,080
I do have a plan for it, and I don't exactly know how it's going to go.

1844
01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:01,080
I don't know exactly if it's going to work, but I have a bunch of ideas that I really want

1845
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,080
to see happen.

1846
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,080
I think what I want to do is I want to try and film it.

1847
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:10,080
It's going to be like, I'm going to dress up as the cop killer, and I'm going to give

1848
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,080
the announcement as the cop killer.

1849
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:15,080
And I'm going to try and do some weird shit with...

1850
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,080
I'm going to do it on a green screen.

1851
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,080
I'm going to put myself in the cathedral or something.

1852
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,080
I'm going to wear.

1853
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,080
I'm going to color shift myself.

1854
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:31,080
And I'm thinking, okay, I bought these big standing black lights, and I'm going to try

1855
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,080
and arrange it.

1856
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,080
I'm going to try putting...

1857
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,080
I don't know.

1858
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,080
I just kind of have to experiment with it and see.

1859
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,080
But I'm going to try putting black light on myself.

1860
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:44,080
I'm going to try doing it in the dark.

1861
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:50,080
I bought some liquid quinine extract.

1862
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,080
And what I would like to try and do with it is paint my teeth with it.

1863
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:58,080
Paint my glasses and my teeth with it so that it will open my mouth.

1864
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,080
Will that glow green?

1865
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:04,080
It would glow blue, but I would color shift it to be green.

1866
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,080
I just think that it might look bad.

1867
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,080
I'm going to try and see how it looks.

1868
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:15,080
But I just have this idea that what if I did that and it looked awesome?

1869
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,080
That makes me think of this one...

1870
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:18,080
I'm going to try it.

1871
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:21,080
An animator guy who does...

1872
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,080
Yes, I know exactly the one you mean.

1873
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,080
I know exactly the one you mean.

1874
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:30,080
Okay, the guy who has his bright glasses and he slightly morphs the shape of his mouth.

1875
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:35,080
So it almost looks like stop motion or animated, but it's just footage of him that's sort of...

1876
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,080
Yeah.

1877
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:39,080
Yes, his bright glowing glasses and his white teeth.

1878
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:48,080
His white teeth and his big huge expression with his mouth and jaw.

1879
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,080
I really like how that stuff looks.

1880
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:56,080
I'm going to try and go for a somewhat similar...

1881
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:01,080
I don't want it to look cheap or shitty.

1882
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,080
No.

1883
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,080
So I'm going to...

1884
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:11,080
Look, I just have some ideas and I'm just going to fuck around with them and see what looks good.

1885
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:21,080
But I bought some high-powered black lights for it and I bought all these fluorescent fabric and quinine.

1886
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:28,080
Because quinine glows blue and is theoretically non-toxic, so I could put it in my mouth.

1887
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:33,080
Otherwise, I could draw on my teeth with highlighter.

1888
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,080
It would probably be bad.

1889
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:37,080
I feel like that would probably hurt you.

1890
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,080
That's probably bad.

1891
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,080
That's probably bad.

1892
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:45,080
I mean, actually, painting my teeth with high-concentrate quinine, that might also be bad for me.

1893
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,080
I'm not sure.

1894
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:49,080
Yeah, definitely make sure you know what the hell you're doing.

1895
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,080
I mean, quinine is not toxic.

1896
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,080
You drink it.

1897
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:59,080
It's a food that you eat, but that doesn't mean that it's good to put a high volume of it directly on your gums.

1898
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:02,080
So we'll just have to see.

1899
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:07,080
I'm pretty sure people have done such things with teeth before.

1900
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:10,080
It must be some safe thing.

1901
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:21,080
Actually, I guess teeth whitening and then ultraviolet light presuges every bright glow as well.

1902
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:22,080
What does?

1903
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:27,080
Anything white with ultraviolet light glows extremely bright in there.

1904
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,080
Not everything white.

1905
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,080
It depends on how white it is.

1906
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,080
So if you have whitened teeth.

1907
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,080
Yeah.

1908
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:42,080
Your teeth do sort of shine bluish in a black light, but it's not that bright.

1909
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,080
So, I mean, it's brighter if your teeth are whiter.

1910
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,080
But even so, there's a limit to it.

1911
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:54,080
So, coating them with something fluorescent, I don't know.

1912
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,080
Honestly, it might look like shit.

1913
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,080
It might not actually look good, and it might not even really be worth doing.

1914
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,080
And I might just do something a little more conventional.

1915
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:05,080
But the point is, the point is I'm going to do a green screen stuff,

1916
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:09,080
and I would like to do a little green screen thing of like me as the cop killer,

1917
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:12,080
make sort of like announcing the book and stuff.

1918
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,080
That's the idea.

1919
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:19,080
And I think some weird like black light green screen shit could make it look kind of weird

1920
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:23,080
and like other otherworldly and school maybe.

1921
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:30,080
You should get fucking spectral on and put it on your teeth.

1922
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,080
I've watched this video.

1923
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:36,080
James Lee. James Lee is the big white teeth guy.

1924
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,080
James Lee, yes.

1925
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,080
The animator.

1926
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:44,080
Spectralon is the world's whitest white pigment.

1927
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,080
Spectralon.

1928
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,080
It looks weird.

1929
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,080
Like it doesn't matter really how it's lit.

1930
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,080
It's always as white as possible.

1931
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,080
It feels like a video effect.

1932
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,080
Hmm.

1933
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:03,080
And Musso Black, he also talks about is like the pigment that absorbs the most light possible.

1934
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,080
It's cool.

1935
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,080
How does Spectralon look under a black line?

1936
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,080
Cool, I don't know.

1937
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:14,080
Also this stuff looks like it's like industrial.

1938
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:19,080
This stuff does not look like it's just something you could buy in like a craft store.

1939
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,080
No.

1940
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,080
Lemau.

1941
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,080
Highest diffuse reflectance of any known material.

1942
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:30,080
Or coating over the ultraviolet visible or near infrared.

1943
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:33,080
It exhibits highly Lambertian behavior.

1944
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:36,080
It exhibits highly Lambertian behavior, Gib.

1945
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,080
Lambertian.

1946
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:41,080
Highly Lambertian.

1947
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,080
If you can believe it.

1948
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,080
Wow.

1949
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,080
Wonder if it looks good under a black light.

1950
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,080
You know I have some markers.

1951
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,080
I was shining black light on some shit.

1952
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:54,080
I was shining black light on some shit and I had a bunch of markers.

1953
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,080
You know, like markers have like a white casing.

1954
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:04,080
And they all look similar in a normal light, but a shan, the black light on them and one of them glowed.

1955
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,080
One of them glowed and a couple of them didn't.

1956
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,080
So it's not just about how white they are.

1957
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:14,080
Something in the plastic of this one particular one, even though it looked similar, was like

1958
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:20,080
United nuclear and European ultra glow in the dark phosphorescent paint.

1959
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,080
It's super bright, non-toxic.

1960
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,080
Non-toxic?

1961
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,080
Does that mean I can paint my teeth with it?

1962
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,080
Ooh.

1963
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,080
Ooh.

1964
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:32,080
It's like that episode of The Simpsons where Homer's got to weigh 300 pounds to qualify

1965
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:36,080
for obesity disability pay to work from home.

1966
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:41,080
And there's no more food in the house for him to eat to get over 300 pounds.

1967
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:44,080
So Maggie makes him a donut out of Play-Doh.

1968
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:48,080
And Bart says, Dad, it says non-toxic.

1969
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,080
You know.

1970
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,080
You know.

1971
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:52,080
Non-poisoned.

1972
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,080
Non-poisoned.

1973
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:58,080
It's not poison, technically.

1974
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:04,080
Oh, $30 for a bottle of this glow-in-the-dark non-toxic.

1975
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:08,080
I want to see how the quinine looks.

1976
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:11,080
Freakin' tonic water looks.

1977
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:17,080
It glows not super bright, but fairly bright-ish blue under a black light because quinine is fluorescent.

1978
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:22,080
So I bought some concentrated drops of it.

1979
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:26,080
The liquid is brown, which I'm not sure if that's going to affect it.

1980
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,080
So I don't know if it's going to be super bright because it's highly concentrated quinine,

1981
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:37,080
or is it going to be not that bright because it's kind of brownish and that'll dull the glow of it or whatever.

1982
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:41,080
But it'll never cost me $10 to find out.

1983
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,080
That's in the mail.

1984
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:50,080
To be getting that later in the week, and then I'm going to try fucking around with filming myself against a green screen

1985
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:54,080
and just fucking around in Sony Vegas and see what effects I can come up with.

1986
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:57,080
I should get some better video editing software.

1987
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:01,080
You know, sit on a chair with a bunch of wires dangling?

1988
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:03,080
Yeah.

1989
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,080
Something like that.

1990
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:09,080
Something like depicted in the killer cathedral.

1991
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:12,080
The green slime tubes.

1992
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,080
I mean, yeah, that's the idea.

1993
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,080
I was thinking.

1994
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,080
I was thinking.

1995
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,080
I was thinking.

1996
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,080
I was thinking.

1997
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:22,080
I don't know.

1998
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,080
I was just thinking.

1999
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,080
I don't know.

2000
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,080
Don't think so hard.

2001
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:28,080
You'll hurt yourself.

2002
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:34,080
I just think it would make an impression to just kind of do it in a sort of a green cartoony,

2003
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,080
like a special effecty kind of way.

2004
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,080
You know, just a little bit.

2005
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,080
A little bit goes a long way.

2006
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,080
Yeah.

2007
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,080
Well, okay, I guess we'll see.

2008
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,080
I guess we'll see how that turns out.

2009
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:51,080
But I'm kind of excited to fuck around and try that soon.

2010
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,080
What else?

2011
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,080
What else?

2012
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:57,080
Hey, did you watch the Velma show?

2013
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:59,080
No, I saw some people talking about it.

2014
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:02,080
I heard some things.

2015
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:05,080
It doesn't sound very good.

2016
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,080
Everyone says that it's bad.

2017
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:11,080
I don't know if it's true.

2018
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:20,080
I just asked because Trixie tweeted yesterday and said that I said that Velma is like me.

2019
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,080
She said Velma is like Ben St.

2020
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:26,080
If Ben St. were a woman, a girl of color.

2021
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:30,080
And I just don't know what that means because I haven't seen the show.

2022
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:32,080
It clips a bit where Velma is just like a cunt.

2023
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,080
So I guess it just means that I'm a cunt.

2024
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:46,080
Yeah, Velma is, as far as I know, unlikable on multiple, like different sides of the political spectrum.

2025
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:51,080
She's like, I think Shaggy is not called Shaggy.

2026
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,080
He's called something else.

2027
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,080
Norbert?

2028
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:56,080
Norville.

2029
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,080
Norville, that's it.

2030
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,080
I think that's it.

2031
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:02,080
He's a cop.

2032
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,080
Is he a cop?

2033
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:11,080
Yeah, I think he's a lane in that respect.

2034
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,080
That's funny.

2035
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:18,080
And Velma, because it's like what if Scooby-Doo Mysteries, but there's murders involved.

2036
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:23,080
So you can't really not involve the police when there's a fucking murder.

2037
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:30,080
But she's just sort of comes across as, well, I guess I hadn't seen it.

2038
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,080
I'm just going off of hearsay.

2039
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,080
Yeah, I've just seen some clips.

2040
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:38,080
I've just seen some clips, most of which make Velma look very unlikable.

2041
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:47,080
She's friends with a cop and she's sort of like liberal in a way that leftists wouldn't like her.

2042
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:55,080
And also right-wing people hate her because of what she is, but also she's annoying.

2043
01:50:55,080 --> 01:51:00,080
It's just like, what if you made the worst show?

2044
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:04,080
So it's a compelling show.

2045
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:06,080
It's like, wow, how bad could it be?

2046
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:09,080
But I really don't care to look and find out.

2047
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:14,080
There was no chance I was ever going to watch it, even if it was good.

2048
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:20,080
So I'm not going to watch it to find out how bad it is just because people are saying it's bad.

2049
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,080
That's what they want.

2050
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:23,080
That's what they want me to do.

2051
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:27,080
That's what Mindy Kaling wanted.

2052
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:32,080
She wanted to make a show so bad on purpose that everyone would have to watch it to complain about it.

2053
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:35,080
Well, I won't let her have that power over me.

2054
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:38,080
Yeah, people were saying as well.

2055
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:44,080
Well, this show sucks, but the writings went up because everyone wanted to know.

2056
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,080
You fuckers.

2057
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:55,080
I just want to understand what does Trixie mean by Velma herself is like Ben St. as a girl of color.

2058
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,080
What does it mean?

2059
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:59,080
She has glasses.

2060
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:03,080
What would I be like as a girl of color?

2061
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:05,080
Sexy?

2062
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:10,080
Well, gee, I don't know.

2063
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,080
Why don't you try it and find out?

2064
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:18,080
Yeah, I guess there's only one way to find out.

2065
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:20,080
All right.

2066
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:24,080
Well, that was my question.

2067
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:31,080
Oh, last week we opened up with the May and Ethan Ralph stuff, and I just want to give an update on that.

2068
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:43,080
The update is, and I think we might have talked about this on stream, but the update is that May very quickly went back to Ralph and then Ralph immediately pivoted from saying,

2069
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,080
I have no wife.

2070
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,080
My wife is a whore.

2071
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:49,080
I fucked my wife's sister, etc.

2072
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:53,080
Immediately pivoted from that to, haha, it was all just a prank, actually.

2073
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:56,080
It was a ruse and you all fell for it.

2074
01:52:56,080 --> 01:53:09,080
It was a trick to make Amanda's dad look foolish by having him think that his daughter ran away from me because I said that that's what happened.

2075
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:12,080
What a great plan.

2076
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:15,080
Was that really the stated goal?

2077
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:22,080
I embarrassed myself horribly to make some other person feel like get duped.

2078
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:26,080
Feel hopeful that his daughter would not marry this off?

2079
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:28,080
Yeah, I don't know.

2080
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:32,080
What's the end game of that plan, really?

2081
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:40,080
I mean, in my opinion, obviously it was not a prank, and this is just like, oh, how am I going to save FaZe?

2082
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,080
How are we going to sweep this under the rug?

2083
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,080
Pretend this didn't happen.

2084
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,080
Oh, let's pretend it was a prank.

2085
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:50,080
And yeah, the stated goal of like, oh, we did it to trick her dad.

2086
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:55,080
We did it to trick her dad into thinking something was happening by saying it was happening.

2087
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:58,080
I mean, that's not a prank.

2088
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:02,080
It's definitely not what happened.

2089
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:11,080
Yeah, the stated punchline is, haha, we tricked you into thinking she ran away because we said she did.

2090
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:14,080
And in fact, she actually did, and it wasn't a prank.

2091
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:20,080
But, haha, we've made you look foolish by believing that's what happened.

2092
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,080
I don't know.

2093
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:24,080
Is there any information about what likely did happen?

2094
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,080
Like, did they say anything?

2095
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:28,080
Did they say anything?

2096
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:31,080
Like, why did they run away and why did they come back?

2097
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:35,080
Well, Ethan said that they had an argument.

2098
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:39,080
Well, Ethan said that they had an argument, and also there was a report, and this is funny.

2099
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:48,080
There were unrelated reports of an unruly passenger delaying like a flight in an airport, like at the same time that this supposedly happened.

2100
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,080
Oh.

2101
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:59,080
So it seems like there was some sort of, yeah, there was some sort of ruckus, an unruly passenger, whether that was May or Ethan is not clear.

2102
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:08,080
A flight was delayed, May fled, ran away, and then later changed her mind and came back.

2103
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:11,080
So were they going to fly somewhere?

2104
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:12,080
And Ethan mentioned that.

2105
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:18,080
I think they, yes, I think they had gone to New York.

2106
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,080
I think they had, they were like, I think they were going to Rome.

2107
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:31,080
They had like, they were like catching a connecting flight to Rome from New York, and it was in New York that this happened, and yeah.

2108
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:34,080
So they were in Rome when she ran away?

2109
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:35,080
No, they were in New York.

2110
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:36,080
Oh, okay.

2111
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,080
They were on their way to Rome, I think.

2112
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:45,080
And so the, like, argument was like, don't you want to get pizza or pasta when you get there?

2113
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:47,080
I don't know.

2114
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,080
Nobody said anything about what the argument was actually about.

2115
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:55,080
We can't go on a flight that has mandatory masks.

2116
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:59,080
I ain't going on this flight, probably something like that.

2117
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:05,080
You know, May was at January 6th, so like she should be on the no fly list.

2118
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:06,080
Oh my God, I forgot.

2119
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,080
You know that?

2120
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:08,080
Yeah.

2121
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:14,080
I don't think, I mean, it doesn't surprise me that she was, but I don't think I really knew that.

2122
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:22,080
She, I mean, she didn't, she wasn't like personally like breaking into the Capitol building, but she was there in Washington D.C.

2123
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:36,080
And I know this because literally on the day that it happened, I don't know why, but I saw Ethan tweeted that like he had a court, that May was at there and that there was like something happening.

2124
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:43,080
So I literally tuned into the kill stream to watch it and May was there live.

2125
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:46,080
And like May had to like, had to like pee or something?

2126
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,080
Like she had like forgotten to go to the bathroom.

2127
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:56,080
So instead of like being there at the Capitol building to like report on what was happening, she was like looking for a restroom like the whole time.

2128
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,080
Like on stream?

2129
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:58,080
Like that was the stream?

2130
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:13,080
I think Ethan at some point was like, okay, all right, you know, go do that and like we'll get, we'll call you back again when you are composed and can report on what's happening.

2131
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:15,080
And then she's like, she missed it.

2132
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:18,080
She missed the, it happened for hours.

2133
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,080
What do you mean?

2134
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:20,080
Well, she was, I don't know.

2135
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:25,080
She like saw it from a distance starting and then she was like, I gotta go find a bathroom.

2136
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:30,080
And then she was like looking for a bathroom for a long time or something.

2137
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:32,080
Oh, you missed the fucking riot.

2138
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,080
You missed freaking January 6th.

2139
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,080
You missed the insurrection.

2140
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,080
She could have made the difference.

2141
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:49,080
She personally could have intercepted Nancy Pelosi and AOC before they made it to the tunnels.

2142
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,080
Could have changed everything.

2143
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:54,080
Trump would still be president.

2144
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,080
Dang.

2145
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,080
If only.

2146
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:58,080
If only.

2147
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,080
My president.

2148
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:03,080
Well, okay.

2149
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:05,080
I think I've, how long ago?

2150
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:07,080
Okay, we're only on two hours.

2151
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,080
What else is on my topic list?

2152
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:12,080
Cat Fishing, my publisher.

2153
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,080
Ethan, Velma, Lentils.

2154
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:19,080
Oh, have you seen freaking Infinite Seinfeld?

2155
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:23,080
No, I heard about that.

2156
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:26,080
There's multiple layers to this.

2157
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:28,080
Oh my fucking god.

2158
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:41,080
So first, from what I understand, it is an artificially intelligent, procedurally generated series of Seinfeld scenes or episodes.

2159
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:43,080
Yes, scenes, basically.

2160
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:45,080
Right.

2161
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:48,080
And it sort of kind of makes sense, but not really.

2162
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,080
I watched like several hours of it the other day.

2163
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:54,080
Is it just on a permanent live stream?

2164
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:59,080
Yeah, it's, I think it's called Watch, Watch Me Forever is the Twitch channel.

2165
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:03,080
And the show itself is called Nothing Forever.

2166
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:17,080
And yeah, it's just infinitely, procedurally generated conversations of, well, it's the Seinfeld gang hanging out in like Jerry's apartment and Elaine's apartment.

2167
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:20,080
And I think it's Elaine's apartment.

2168
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:23,080
And sometimes Jerry does a stand-up routine.

2169
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:26,080
And that's it.

2170
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,080
And yeah, there's no...

2171
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:28,080
I've clicked on it there.

2172
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:31,080
There's no...

2173
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:33,080
Yeah, there's no like episode plots.

2174
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:36,080
It's just like conversations that they have.

2175
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:41,080
And sometimes, I mean, they always like sort of make sense.

2176
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:44,080
They always like are coherent.

2177
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:52,080
But, you know, it's AI generated, so it's like pretty off.

2178
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,080
It's really funny though.

2179
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,080
It's really compelling.

2180
01:59:55,080 --> 02:00:00,080
And like, it's not even just the dialogue that's like procedural.

2181
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:06,080
It's like the characters like walk around and like their walk cycles are procedural too.

2182
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:13,080
And like they'll just like, they'll like walk around like bent over at like 180 degrees at the waist and stuff.

2183
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:18,080
Or like they'll sit down and then like they'll try to walk out of their chair, but like they won't stand up.

2184
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:25,080
So like their little feet will move as they'll just like be sitting and like they'll just like be walking through the air like while they're still sitting.

2185
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:28,080
Stuff like that.

2186
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,080
The stuff...

2187
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:32,080
Okay, their personalities are all like off.

2188
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:35,080
They're not really the Seinfeld characters.

2189
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:45,080
They're all like really, really wholesome and really like enthusiastic about everything.

2190
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:48,080
They don't tell jokes.

2191
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:53,080
I mean, in the logic of Nothing Forever, all four of them are comedians.

2192
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:55,080
Like they all have one job.

2193
02:00:55,080 --> 02:01:02,080
They all work for the same like joke company or whatever, which is different from the actual show.

2194
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:06,080
But they never actually tell jokes.

2195
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:12,080
Like when Jerry does a stand-up routine, the routine will usually just be like,

2196
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:16,080
Hey guys, can you believe how divided our country has become?

2197
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:23,080
You know, it's too bad that politics is so divisive these days.

2198
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:27,080
But I wear a mask whenever I ride public transit.

2199
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:29,080
Okay, would you like to hear a joke?

2200
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:32,080
What did the fish say when it hit a wall?

2201
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,080
Damn, okay, that's my set.

2202
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,080
Thank you, and I'll see you soon.

2203
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,080
And that for several hours you watched.

2204
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:46,080
Well, yeah, a scene will usually last like a minute or two.

2205
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:50,080
And yeah, it's just really, it's really...

2206
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:56,080
I saw one where like Elaine had just discovered that there's no Santa Claus.

2207
02:01:56,080 --> 02:02:02,080
And Jerry was like opining on like, damn, if there's no Santa Claus and there's...

2208
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:05,080
What else? Is there no Easter Bunny? Is there no Tooth Fairy?

2209
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:08,080
Are they just lies that we've been told?

2210
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:14,080
And then he ends it with only one way to find out.

2211
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:17,080
And then the scene ends.

2212
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:24,080
No, he said like, yeah, are they just lies they tell us to keep us believing in the magic of life?

2213
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,080
Well, only one way to find out.

2214
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:28,080
What was he going to do?

2215
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:30,080
That is pretty funny.

2216
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,080
Yeah, it's stuff like that.

2217
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:37,080
I was watching just for a second there and somebody said, I think it was George.

2218
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:39,080
He said, hey, I thought of something.

2219
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:43,080
It was a pregnant pause and then a laugh track.

2220
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:47,080
Yeah, the laugh track seems almost random.

2221
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:51,080
I saw a bingo card for like things that happen.

2222
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:55,080
And one of the things on the bingo card is that specific, what did the fish say when it hit the wall?

2223
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:56,080
Damn.

2224
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,080
They say that all the time.

2225
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:05,080
Another thing that's not was not on the card, but that I noticed happening all the time is somebody gets a part-time job as a clown.

2226
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:09,080
George got a part-time job as a clown.

2227
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:14,080
I saw one where Jerry had just gotten a part-time job as a clown and George...

2228
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:19,080
Oh, there was one where the mayor, they talked about how the mayor had gotten a part-time job as a clown.

2229
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:24,080
But George asks Jerry, hey, how's the part-time job as a clown?

2230
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:28,080
And Jerry's like, oh, it's a good opportunity to make some money on the side.

2231
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:31,080
And George's like, what are you going to do with all the money?

2232
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:36,080
And Jerry says, I was thinking about investing in a comic book shop.

2233
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:39,080
Could be a great opportunity to make some real money.

2234
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:43,080
And it's like, that's like the most...

2235
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:48,080
I don't know, just imagine thinking that that's how you're going to make money.

2236
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:50,080
You want to make some serious cash?

2237
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:52,080
One, get a part-time job as a clown.

2238
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:55,080
Two, invest your earnings in a comic book shop.

2239
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:58,080
Like it's a surefire way, surefire hit.

2240
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:04,080
The weirdness of the AI really works with Seinfeld.

2241
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:10,080
It seems like a sort of stupid idea that somebody would come up with in a sitcom.

2242
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:12,080
It does work.

2243
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:20,080
Okay, the other thing is they're all really enthusiastic and down for anything.

2244
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:24,080
Someone will suggest something totally asinine.

2245
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:30,080
Like, why don't we start a part-time job selling cardboard boxes?

2246
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:33,080
And Elaine will be like, that's a great idea.

2247
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:35,080
I think we should do it right now.

2248
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:37,080
I can't wait to start our new business.

2249
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:42,080
It's so many of the episodes are like,

2250
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:45,080
they just heard about a new restaurant that opened.

2251
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:47,080
And they're like, wow, sounds amazing.

2252
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:49,080
What food do they offer?

2253
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:51,080
I hear they have some really weird dishes.

2254
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:53,080
They have spaghetti on sushi.

2255
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:55,080
Spaghetti sushi? That sounds incredible.

2256
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:57,080
I can't wait to try it.

2257
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:59,080
We should get a reservation this weekend.

2258
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:06,080
Yeah, rules. It fucking rules and I love it.

2259
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:15,080
But I learned, I saw on Twitter a snippet of an interview with apparently the developers.

2260
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:19,080
And it seems like the developers of Nothing Forever

2261
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:26,080
genuinely think that this is the next step in entertainment for real.

2262
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:31,080
They think they can actually make a real show like this.

2263
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:37,080
And not have it be like a hilariously bad, like meta commentary.

2264
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,080
Yeah, I saw that.

2265
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,080
They think they can do this for real.

2266
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:47,080
They set out to make, what did they say?

2267
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:51,080
Not a spiritual successor, but like something-something.

2268
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:53,080
I think they said they wanted to make,

2269
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:59,080
they wanted to generate a show that would infinitely generate infinite content of Netflix level.

2270
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:03,080
I think they specifically said like Netflix level quality.

2271
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:11,080
Like this is the first step towards live streams of fake Seinfeld or whatever.

2272
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:13,080
Yeah, well this is the first.

2273
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:19,080
I think in their mind, you would, yeah, you would open up Netflix

2274
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:27,080
and you would navigate to a show and the show has no actors, has no writers, has no nothing.

2275
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:30,080
It's just completely perceived and you just hit it.

2276
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:37,080
And there's just an infinite number of potential scenes it might show you that would entertain you.

2277
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:42,080
They said it's like, what if a show, your favorite show didn't have to end?

2278
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:44,080
Like that's a good thing.

2279
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:46,080
Like that works for every type of show.

2280
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:52,080
Like it kind of works for Seinfeld because Seinfeld is just a show about whatever.

2281
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:56,080
It's about these characters doing stuff, having scenes.

2282
02:06:56,080 --> 02:07:06,080
It works in the sense that like Seinfeld is a status quo show where like everything returns to the status quo at the end of the episode.

2283
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:13,080
Yeah, but beyond that, it's funny and entertaining mostly because of how weird and not human it is.

2284
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:15,080
Yes, yes, that's what I'm going to say.

2285
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:25,080
Like if this is meant to be a proof of concept that like, yeah, we can design a show that just infinitely creates itself as entertainment.

2286
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:28,080
It's like, it's literally like proof against that.

2287
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:36,080
It's proof of the opposite and it's because, yeah, people like nothing forever and it's funny and I like it.

2288
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:38,080
But the reason I like it is not because it's good.

2289
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:45,080
Like the reason it's funny is like the obvious ways that it fails to be what it's trying to be.

2290
02:07:45,080 --> 02:08:00,080
And genuinely, the fact that it was made as a sincere attempt to like create like just straightforward, unironically good like compelling content like you would see on TV is like what makes it even funnier.

2291
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:08,080
Because it's like they really tried, like they really were actually trying to make a real show and this is what they came up with.

2292
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:14,080
And it's like, yeah, all of the appeal is just in how it falls short of being what they wanted it to be.

2293
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:18,080
And knowing that they wanted that is like, I love it.

2294
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:22,080
It's like they must know.

2295
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:32,080
They must know that like this is not a real show and that people are watching it because of how like wrong and off it is.

2296
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:38,080
I think they're not differentiating between views and quality.

2297
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:42,080
Like people don't view everything for the exact same reason.

2298
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:47,080
I think that they must know that they fell short.

2299
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:50,080
They know that they fell short of the goal.

2300
02:08:50,080 --> 02:09:04,080
I was just watching it right now and they had a moment where it had an establishing shot of the apartment and then Jerry's microphone by itself for like 10 seconds, no Jerry at the comedy club or whatever.

2301
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:06,080
And then it cut back to the apartment.

2302
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:07,080
That's awesome.

2303
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:10,080
This is just a scene where Jerry wasn't at his set.

2304
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:12,080
A scene with no content.

2305
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:15,080
And then it goes back to some other thing.

2306
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:17,080
That rules.

2307
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:22,080
Yeah, Jerry's sets, they don't have jokes.

2308
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:33,080
Most of them are just him sort of like wistfully opining on like the state of life and like the nature of being alive and stuff.

2309
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:46,080
I saw one where like him and Kramer asks him if he thinks there's life after death and Jerry's like, well, not much of a philosopher.

2310
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:54,080
But I definitely think there must be more to life than what we see before us.

2311
02:09:54,080 --> 02:10:01,080
I definitely think that we must go somewhere better when we're gone from this world.

2312
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:05,080
This is the end scene.

2313
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:10,080
That's like such a Jerry thing to say.

2314
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:20,080
They must know, they definitely know that this is not like Netflix show quality stuff, that they did not successfully make that.

2315
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:24,080
But they might see the people watching and think, aha, they're watching.

2316
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:29,080
And yeah, the show is kind of funny because it's unintentionally bad now.

2317
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:34,080
But the fact that they're watching it all says that like, okay, this can work.

2318
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:43,080
That we're onto something, even though really in my opinion, yeah, the spectacle is in the failure.

2319
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:51,080
I don't really think it's a successful proof of concept that they could make a real show like this.

2320
02:10:51,080 --> 02:11:03,080
A lot of time there's like, there's so much shit on TV that sometimes you'll just put on the TV and you don't really care what you're watching and it's all daytime television.

2321
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,080
It's low quality.

2322
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:07,080
It's not really that great of anything.

2323
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:09,080
It's just sort of whatever.

2324
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:22,080
And so it's not that hard of a bar to reach, to make some mildly interesting AI generated stripes that you could just put on in the background.

2325
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:29,080
But the idea that this is the future of the high production show is very silly.

2326
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:38,080
You could probably make a somewhat similar argument saying that daytime soap operas almost are.

2327
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:48,080
I mean, they're not literally AI procedurally generated, but they are just kind of whatever they could fucking throw together.

2328
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:53,080
Shot on an incredibly shoestring budget and an incredibly high turnaround.

2329
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:58,080
So it's not like there was like a high, yeah, there's not like a high bar of quality.

2330
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:12,080
It's just sort of a similar to what if there was some funny livestream, some funny television network that, you know, I just need a bit of this and you turn it on.

2331
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:18,080
I can imagine that being the future like, oh, let's check out what's going on on the AI channel.

2332
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:20,080
It has a future, I'm sure.

2333
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:23,080
But like, I don't know.

2334
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:31,080
I don't think it's going to replace shows made by meticulous crafted stuff.

2335
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:35,080
I could see it.

2336
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:43,080
I could see it maybe being involved in some content of some kinds.

2337
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:50,080
It's not going to replace like a scripted.

2338
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:55,080
I mean, all AI tools can be used in conjunction with curation by a human.

2339
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:58,080
Yeah, yeah, that's how they're used usually.

2340
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:05,080
I think that the gimmick with this is that it's automated and it just goes.

2341
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:08,080
Yeah, there's no curation here at all.

2342
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:23,080
You put the characters in and you train the AI a bit so it has a bit of like differentiation between the characters and you set like points where the characters can walk,

2343
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:32,080
points where they do the animation for sitting and you just set all the parameters up and you just let it go.

2344
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:40,080
And I'm like, yeah, I guess like this is this is funny because it's so fucked up.

2345
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:43,080
But I wouldn't watch like a series.

2346
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:46,080
Okay, I mean, it makes sense as a line that just goes on forever.

2347
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:50,080
I did leave it on and watch it passively for like four or five hours.

2348
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:53,080
So I mean, I'm not knocking it.

2349
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:55,080
I genuinely like it.

2350
02:13:55,080 --> 02:14:01,080
Yeah, but I like it for being weird.

2351
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:02,080
Yeah.

2352
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:06,080
I guess our main problem is with the creators taking themselves too seriously.

2353
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:13,080
I mean, I like that they think that they were really trying to do something.

2354
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:14,080
I like it.

2355
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:16,080
I like it as a novelty.

2356
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,080
That's what I'm saying.

2357
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:18,080
I don't like it.

2358
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:27,080
If every show was like this or even like multiple shows were like this, I wouldn't care because like, you know, you watch it and you're like, oh, I get it.

2359
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:33,080
They kind of like randomly combined things and oh, the characters are sort of doing their patterns again.

2360
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:43,080
You know, like the AI can sometimes surprise you by what it comes up with, but it surprises you in like a different way than like a scripted show.

2361
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:48,080
Like a scripted show would might subvert your expectations purposefully.

2362
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:56,080
Whereas the AI will might subvert your expectations by like combining things inappropriately in a way that sort of doesn't make sense.

2363
02:14:56,080 --> 02:15:09,080
I think also that this is obviously piggybacking a lot off of the popularity and notoriety of Seinfeld.

2364
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:16,080
You know who these characters are normally and so seeing them different has a layer of comedy to it.

2365
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:24,080
If it was like brand new show, brand new concept, but all AI generated, it wouldn't have nearly as much mean potential and comedy value.

2366
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:28,080
Yeah, a lot of the value, a lot of the entertainment is in seeing.

2367
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:31,080
Yeah, is in seeing like, imagine Jerry.

2368
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:36,080
Imagine Jerry just being like, hey guys, welcome to my set.

2369
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:41,080
Can you believe that 2020 had a global pandemic?

2370
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:43,080
Never thought I'd have to wear a mask.

2371
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:44,080
Haha.

2372
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:45,080
All right.

2373
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:47,080
Anyone got any funny stories?

2374
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:49,080
Great stories, everyone.

2375
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,080
All right, I'll be here all week.

2376
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:53,080
Have a great night.

2377
02:15:54,080 --> 02:16:03,080
Yeah, it's the gap between that and what Jerry actually is and what he shouldn't do.

2378
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:08,080
It's the same as like edited Garfield strips.

2379
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:12,080
Like Garfield without Garfield or all those other things.

2380
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:16,080
I think some people have tried to make AI generated comic strips of Garfield.

2381
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:19,080
Sometimes it works.

2382
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:20,080
Yeah.

2383
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:22,080
A lot of the time not.

2384
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:29,080
I think there's like taking individual panels and randomly putting them in front of one another.

2385
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:32,080
Sometimes it's funny.

2386
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:35,080
Oh, just like randomly like like mashing panels together.

2387
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:38,080
Yeah, take three random panels and put them together.

2388
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:39,080
I've seen that one before.

2389
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:40,080
Yeah.

2390
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:42,080
I mean, that's not really AI.

2391
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:48,080
That's just a randomization procedure, whatever you call it.

2392
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:49,080
But it's the same sort of thing.

2393
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:51,080
It's like, you know what Garfield should be.

2394
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:56,080
And so the comedy comes from how much it deviates.

2395
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:57,080
Yeah.

2396
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:59,080
I suppose they do sort of say that way.

2397
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:02,080
They say, what if your favorite show never stopped?

2398
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:06,080
If they made, if they made like, oh, Breaking Bad.

2399
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:12,080
But like in this style with like funny little 3D avatars of Walter White and stuff.

2400
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,080
Okay.

2401
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:14,080
Okay.

2402
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:19,080
Then it would not be good as a Breaking Bad show, but it would be funny because I'd seen Breaking Bad.

2403
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:22,080
And this is like, haha, this is so not like it should be.

2404
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:27,080
Part of, but part of what part of what works about this, I don't think you could do it with Breaking Bad

2405
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:34,080
because part of what makes this work is that Seinfeld is so iconically like set in Jerry's apartment.

2406
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:35,080
Right.

2407
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:36,080
Like so much of the show happens.

2408
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:43,080
Like it's these four characters in this specific one setting or maybe like one or two other settings.

2409
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:48,080
They should have had one at the bar at the restaurant where they have like breakfast in the booth.

2410
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:56,080
They, what would make Nothing Forever Perfect is if they had one more set and it's them sitting in the freaking booth.

2411
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:58,080
I think you could do it with Breaking Bad.

2412
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:02,080
It's not because like Breaking Bad.

2413
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:12,080
It's just because it's a serious show and then having them do like just random conversations that don't make sense is comedy.

2414
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:14,080
In the same way that this is comedy.

2415
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:23,080
I think, okay, I think that the fact that Breaking Bad takes, has like a continuous arc and the status quo changes every episode

2416
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:29,080
and that the story takes it through like many, many different settings over the course of the show.

2417
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:39,080
I think that if you tried to do this with Breaking Bad, it would be much harder to recognize any individual scene as, oh, this is Breaking Bad.

2418
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:45,080
Whereas with Seinfeld, it's really obvious when you look at it like that's Jerry's apartment.

2419
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:47,080
This is Jerry and Elaine and George and Kramer.

2420
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:49,080
I mean, you got Walter's house.

2421
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:51,080
What I'm watching is Seinfeld, but it's wrong.

2422
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:53,080
You got iconic places.

2423
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:55,080
You got Los Poyos-Hermanos restaurant.

2424
02:18:55,080 --> 02:19:00,080
You got Walter White's house and the desert.

2425
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:08,080
Like you could have three sets with, you know, cars in the desert or like the lab, Gus's lab.

2426
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:16,080
And it could just be Walter and Jesse talking.

2427
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:24,080
I think it wouldn't be like as good-fitting, but I feel like people would still tune into that just for how stupid it is.

2428
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:31,080
I'm not saying you couldn't do it, but I think it works better with Seinfeld.

2429
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:38,080
It's funny that they seem to think that you could apply this idea to shows unlike Seinfeld.

2430
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:40,080
Yeah.

2431
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:43,080
Because that's what is implied by what they say, like your favorite Netflix show.

2432
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:47,080
There's lots of types of Netflix shows.

2433
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:51,080
It's like this only works.

2434
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:59,080
The other thing about it is that this works with Seinfeld because all Seinfeld is is just characters talking.

2435
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:09,080
So all you have to do is generate an AI text conversation and then have a text-to-speech program read the lines.

2436
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:12,080
Stuff happens in Breaking Bad.

2437
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:19,080
It would not feel anything like an episode of Breaking Bad if they try to do this with Breaking Bad.

2438
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:22,080
No, but I'm saying it would be funny still.

2439
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:24,080
People would find the mean quality.

2440
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:26,080
Yes, it would be funny.

2441
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:34,080
It would be funny in the way that the characters would be acting in a weird, silly way.

2442
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:41,080
But with this, it's like what the characters are doing, it does kind of feel like it's Seinfeld

2443
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:44,080
because what they're doing is the same thing that happens in Seinfeld,

2444
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:50,080
which is the characters just stand around in an apartment and yammer at each other.

2445
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:53,080
It gets close.

2446
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:55,080
Seinfeld is like you get about as close.

2447
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:58,080
You know what? They could probably do it with Star Trek too.

2448
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,080
They could probably do this with Star Trek and it would work really well.

2449
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:03,080
Because Star Trek is just about characters standing around and talking.

2450
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:08,080
Like how do they do AI-generated techno babble?

2451
02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:13,080
Oh, I think freaking duh.

2452
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:16,080
That might be a little bit of a challenge.

2453
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,080
Because there's like two different types of talking.

2454
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:24,080
There's talking about what's happening, the events happening and character drama,

2455
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:30,080
which is you'd need two different bits to have that

2456
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,080
because it wouldn't make sense if somebody says techno babble

2457
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:37,080
and the other person is talking about their feelings, although it would be funny.

2458
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:42,080
I actually think you'd probably have like a pretty robust,

2459
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:48,080
like a system for procedurally generating some techno nonsense.

2460
02:21:48,080 --> 02:22:01,080
You just freaking combine adjectives and nouns into the dilithium fusion reverberator

2461
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:07,080
has been fractured and requires whatever.

2462
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:12,080
And you just make that shit up and it doesn't even really matter what it's called.

2463
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:18,080
You can talk about it because like it's going to do something in space.

2464
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:19,080
I don't know.

2465
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:22,080
Yeah, I mean that might be.

2466
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:27,080
I enjoy this feeling of the chat like going nuts.

2467
02:22:27,080 --> 02:22:29,080
There's 10,000 people watching right now.

2468
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:36,080
You know, I tried watching it on Twitch and I couldn't get it to do it

2469
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:40,080
without a delay between the chat and the stream.

2470
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:44,080
And that kind of made the chat sort of useless.

2471
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:48,080
And also I kind of didn't like the experience of having the chat like roaring

2472
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:50,080
every time like something really weird happens.

2473
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:53,080
I kind of just liked having the little video.

2474
02:22:53,080 --> 02:22:56,080
I was literally playing it like in Discord.

2475
02:22:56,080 --> 02:23:00,080
Yeah, I mean you can turn the chat off, you can like push it to the sides.

2476
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:02,080
Yeah, I liked it with chat off.

2477
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:07,080
I liked it with just, they're just saying weird stuff.

2478
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:13,080
Having like totally pointless conversations.

2479
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:16,080
That was how I was enjoying it.

2480
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:20,080
I wonder if AI could generate a progress in this podcast episode.

2481
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:21,080
Oh my god.

2482
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:23,080
Oh my god.

2483
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:25,080
We're just two people talking.

2484
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:27,080
We don't even have a set.

2485
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:32,080
It would let it, can we, can we get on?

2486
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:33,080
Holy shit.

2487
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:36,080
Can you email them, give us the source code?

2488
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:37,080
Holy shit.

2489
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:41,080
I don't know how, imagine if we could do that.

2490
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:43,080
We could make it a bonus episode.

2491
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:48,080
We could have like a 10 hour fully AI generated bonus episode.

2492
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:52,080
There's no way it could be anything other than awful.

2493
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:53,080
There's no way.

2494
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:58,080
It would probably not be good.

2495
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:59,080
I suppose there's enough.

2496
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:02,080
But nothing forever isn't good.

2497
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:07,080
No, but like, hmm, I wonder how they get, they have transcripts, right?

2498
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:08,080
I think.

2499
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:12,080
They have transcripts for each character and they feed the transcripts into the machine.

2500
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:16,080
They don't like take the audio file of the episode and put that in.

2501
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:20,080
No, I think they have, I think they have script, they have written scripts.

2502
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:27,080
So like we would need a transcript of the procrastinated podcast episodes of you talking

2503
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:31,080
and me talking in order to like feed that into an AI to make it, make any sense at all.

2504
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:37,080
And that's a lot of work unless Google like auto captions works.

2505
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:41,080
Doesn't YouTube like auto caption?

2506
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:44,080
Yeah, but like, it's not that great.

2507
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:48,080
I know it's not that great, but like no one's going to manually caption it.

2508
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:53,080
Here's how I think, if it could be done at all, yeah, I think it would have to be auto,

2509
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:59,080
we'd have to use the YouTube auto captions and we would have to feed that into some,

2510
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:02,080
I don't know, I don't even know how.

2511
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:05,080
If there's anybody in the audience who wants to do that.

2512
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:07,080
If anyone knows how it could be done.

2513
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:08,080
We'll pay.

2514
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:13,080
We'll pay the proceeds from the bonus episode or a flat fee or something.

2515
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,080
I would pay someone.

2516
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:15,080
Cause that's funny.

2517
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:16,080
That's worth money.

2518
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:17,080
That's worth money.

2519
02:25:17,080 --> 02:25:19,080
I would pay someone.

2520
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:24,080
$50.

2521
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:27,080
I don't know.

2522
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:28,080
I know.

2523
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:32,080
I mean, either way, I'm not going to fucking do that because that's,

2524
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:34,080
I got so much other stuff I'm doing.

2525
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:37,080
I think it is theoretically possible.

2526
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:43,080
I know that it could be a lot of work and I'm not willing to do a lot of work on it.

2527
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:47,080
But if someone knows a way that it could be done with only a moderate amount of work,

2528
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:51,080
I might, I do think it would be really funny.

2529
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:56,080
And I'm sure it is doable.

2530
02:25:56,080 --> 02:26:01,080
It's just a question of how hard, how much would be involved in it.

2531
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:04,080
Yeah, okay.

2532
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:07,080
I got canceled for my AI takes on Twitter.

2533
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:09,080
I got unfollowed by everybody.

2534
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:10,080
They hate me.

2535
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,080
Oh, what'd you say?

2536
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:17,080
Well, I said, um, I said that I think that if a computer can do it,

2537
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:19,080
then a computer should do it.

2538
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:22,080
And by it, I mean jobs.

2539
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:25,080
And, uh, yeah.

2540
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:26,080
Okay.

2541
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:36,080
Well, Cheesy retweeted a thing about an anime studio that was using AI for its background art.

2542
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,080
Oh yeah, I saw that.

2543
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:38,080
It was like the boy and the dog.

2544
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:39,080
The boy and the dog.

2545
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:40,080
Or whatever.

2546
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:42,080
Which is my intellectual property.

2547
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:45,080
I have dog and boy in, in canon story.

2548
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:46,080
Hey, yeah.

2549
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:55,080
Um, so it's funny because in the, in this context, like they haven't actually replaced their background art department entirely.

2550
02:26:55,080 --> 02:27:01,080
Like they're using basically an artist draws the background and then an AI sort of like touches it up.

2551
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:08,080
And then an artist like takes the AI version and like touches that up into a real background.

2552
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:12,080
And it's like kind of like, why even bother have the AI step?

2553
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:15,080
Maybe it saves maybe like some labor.

2554
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:16,080
Two hours.

2555
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,080
I guess it saves.

2556
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:22,080
I assume it must save some labor or they're trying it out to see if it saves labor or something like that.

2557
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:29,080
And like, so okay, they really haven't even actually reduced the, the workforce that much by doing so.

2558
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:31,080
My hot take.

2559
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:32,080
Though.

2560
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:35,080
And I think I, and I'll stick with this.

2561
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:44,080
Like if you, if you could get rid of human artists, like if a, if a computer could just like generate a background and it would look good, I think they should just do it.

2562
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:45,080
I think that's good.

2563
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:46,080
And they should do it.

2564
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:47,080
And I don't care if people lose their jobs.

2565
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:48,080
Fuck them.

2566
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:50,080
Fuck artists.

2567
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:51,080
Yeah.

2568
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:52,080
Yeah.

2569
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:57,080
I don't feel the same vitriol for artists having jobs.

2570
02:27:57,080 --> 02:28:02,080
But the, the idea that like if computers can do things.

2571
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:03,080
Yeah.

2572
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:04,080
That's nice.

2573
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,080
I don't have vitriol for artists having.

2574
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:06,080
It's more tools in your tool belt.

2575
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:07,080
Right.

2576
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:09,080
And if you still want to draw, you can.

2577
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:12,080
It's just, there's no money in it, I guess.

2578
02:28:12,080 --> 02:28:13,080
I don't.

2579
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:14,080
And everyone will be out of work.

2580
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:15,080
Yeah.

2581
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:20,080
And that's, it's, it's separate issue, which is a capitalism issue.

2582
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:21,080
Right.

2583
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:22,080
I, okay.

2584
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:26,080
I really think, I really think.

2585
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:29,080
I don't have, I don't have vitriol for artists having jobs.

2586
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:31,080
I think it's nice if someone has a job.

2587
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:34,080
I think that's great.

2588
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:46,080
But, but I really think, I really think when I see people like cheesy, specifically cheesy,

2589
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:48,080
I'm talking about cheesy specifically here and only him.

2590
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:49,080
That's not true.

2591
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:50,080
I see a lot of people doing this.

2592
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:55,080
I think when people get upset about AI stuff, it's coming, it's coming from a place.

2593
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:57,080
I'm sorry.

2594
02:28:57,080 --> 02:29:00,080
I don't, I don't think it's, I don't think it's pure.

2595
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:03,080
I don't think it's pure and logical.

2596
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:05,080
What do you mean pure?

2597
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:10,080
I mean that I think it's, I think, I think they're just, I think when people say, oh

2598
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:16,080
no, AI has taken our jerbs, I think they're just being like, oh no, I wanted to get paid

2599
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:17,080
to do that.

2600
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:20,080
Oh no, I wanted to get paid to do that job.

2601
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:23,080
I wanted to paint a background and get paid by a studio.

2602
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:27,080
Oh no, you mean they're going to need one less fricking artist at Nickelodeon Studios

2603
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:29,080
drawing backgrounds on SpongeBob?

2604
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:32,080
That could have been my cushy animation gig.

2605
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:34,080
It's not a cushy job.

2606
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,080
It is.

2607
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:36,080
It's just drawing backgrounds.

2608
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:38,080
Working at Nickelodeon?

2609
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:42,080
Well, yeah, I mean, better than working independent, but you know what I mean.

2610
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:43,080
Okay, okay.

2611
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:46,080
It's not like a perfectly secure job.

2612
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:48,080
Okay, I mean sure, I mean sure.

2613
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:50,080
But it's a job people want.

2614
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:51,080
Yeah.

2615
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:57,080
And all I'm saying is when people say, oh no, an AI can do it, I think that they're saying

2616
02:29:57,080 --> 02:30:01,080
it because that's a job that they wanted and they thought that could have been me, but

2617
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:04,080
now it can't be you because a robot can do it.

2618
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:06,080
Yeah, all of that is true.

2619
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:12,080
And I get being salty about that, but frankly, I think that if a computer could do what you

2620
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:15,080
were going to do, then fuck you.

2621
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:17,080
There's no point doing it.

2622
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:18,080
Do something else.

2623
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:27,080
I think if you can be replaced by a computer, yeah, you should be replaced by a computer.

2624
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:29,080
Die.

2625
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:31,080
But I like money though.

2626
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:32,080
You like money.

2627
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:34,080
Listen, I do like money.

2628
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:36,080
I do like money.

2629
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:43,080
All right, I'm being a little hyperbolic.

2630
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:46,080
Computers, I don't know.

2631
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:52,080
If a computer can paint a background, then why do we need a human to do it?

2632
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:55,080
First of all, a human can't.

2633
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:57,080
A computer can't.

2634
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:01,080
The background's on Dog and Boy, they don't even look that good.

2635
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:02,080
Oh yeah.

2636
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:08,080
And frankly, yeah, you can see what AI generates and sometimes it generates a decent image,

2637
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:11,080
but usually it only does that by stealing.

2638
02:31:11,080 --> 02:31:16,080
Usually it only does that because it's stealing and copying from other pieces and that's bad.

2639
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:18,080
I think it's entirely bad.

2640
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:22,080
The whole library is based off of other things it's seen.

2641
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:23,080
Yeah, that's true.

2642
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:26,080
I mean, that's kind of why, well, let's see.

2643
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:32,080
I mean, when one of these artists on Dog and Boy, they draw the preliminary and then they feed that in.

2644
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:38,080
I mean, I guess the AI is using that as a basis and then they're filling it in with like texture?

2645
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:40,080
Okay.

2646
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:42,080
I guess they've seen that are similar.

2647
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:44,080
Oh, they recognize this as a tree.

2648
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:47,080
So what do I know a tree looks like?

2649
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:57,080
Let's find something that matches and then random numbers make it not a literal copy of what I've seen before and then put it in.

2650
02:31:57,080 --> 02:32:02,080
That's how I assume a lot of the decision-making works in an AI.

2651
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:11,080
Do you think that it's grabbing that data from people posting on DeviantArt and stuff?

2652
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:13,080
It depends.

2653
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:23,080
I think DeviantArt has a system where you have to opt out of your art being added to AI libraries.

2654
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:31,080
I think it was cheesy or maybe it was someone else that was saying that music is a lot more highly regulated

2655
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:39,080
and AI-generated music draws from a much more tightly controlled database of stuff that is not copyright protected

2656
02:32:39,080 --> 02:32:46,080
because there's much more stringent copyright laws in place for the use of music

2657
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:50,080
and there should be something in place like that for art as well.

2658
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:58,080
Because I think that if it were highly regulated and if there were a higher degree of confidence

2659
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:09,080
that a company, an animation studio, the AIs that they were training were not basically just stealing data from independent artists

2660
02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:11,080
and people that were just posting their stuff online for free.

2661
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:17,080
I don't think that should just be fair game for any corporate entity to just take.

2662
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:24,080
If it were more tightly regulated and they were confident that that weren't happening,

2663
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:28,080
I would be like, hell yeah, replace the artists.

2664
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:37,080
It doesn't make any sense not to use a tool that can just eliminate grunt work from a task like that.

2665
02:33:37,080 --> 02:33:45,080
It's what I've always been saying with this argument is that the root cause of the problem is the capitalism that you need money

2666
02:33:45,080 --> 02:33:50,080
and the people who own the IPs are the ones who profit off of the shows being created

2667
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:59,080
but there's no workforce so all of the creative people, some of whom have work that is being used in AI stuff without their consent,

2668
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:06,080
are not making money and so if AI-generated things did not have copyright,

2669
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:14,080
which I think there's a chance that that could happen because you know the monkey that took a selfie?

2670
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:23,080
That lawsuit set the president that the person who owned the camera doesn't have copyright over that image

2671
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:28,080
because the copyright needs to be, the artist needs to be of a human.

2672
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:35,080
Monkey has the copyright but copyright, you know, it's a monkey, you can't ask it permission for things like that.

2673
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:43,080
So it has to be, they set a precedent that has to be a human to make the art that has the copyright.

2674
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:45,080
In order for copyright to be real.

2675
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:52,080
And so there's an argument that AI-generated stuff is similar and that there is no human involved so you can't copyright the work

2676
02:34:52,080 --> 02:35:00,080
and if you can't copyright it, you can't really, well, you can profit from it but you can't protect it from other people doing it.

2677
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:07,080
Which I think would be better than some rich people who own intellectual property

2678
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:13,080
continuing to make money while all the artists who got them there with the work they made previously

2679
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:17,080
and the brands that they made popular just get thrown away.

2680
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:21,080
That's sad and it sucks and I don't want people to get rich.

2681
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:23,080
So fuck them.

2682
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:25,080
Yeah, yeah.

2683
02:35:25,080 --> 02:35:34,080
I'm not against the tools being created and used but it's the fact that money is the driving force

2684
02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:46,080
and capitalism forces people to need money that makes it like a problem that makes people upset that like it causes all of the strife in the situation.

2685
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:53,080
If you didn't need the job, if you didn't need to be paid, then it wouldn't be even a problem.

2686
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:56,080
That you didn't need to get the job and a computer could have done it.

2687
02:35:56,080 --> 02:36:06,080
Here's, you know, I guess I just, I think about like, I know, you know, I say fuck artists because that's funny.

2688
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:20,080
But back in the day, right, back in the day, people working on, I don't know, the freaking railroads or whatever, right,

2689
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:27,080
the steam engine or whatever, maybe put some of them out of business or something.

2690
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:39,080
You know, the automobile, the creation of the automobile probably put a lot of, you know, horse-related workers out of business or whatever.

2691
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:41,080
Blacksmiths.

2692
02:36:41,080 --> 02:36:43,080
Right, and like that's not good.

2693
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:47,080
It's like, it's not good that those people lost their jobs.

2694
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:57,080
But I mean, that doesn't mean that I'm against, like, that doesn't mean that like the creation of these new devices were like bad,

2695
02:36:57,080 --> 02:37:02,080
or that they should have been like banned in order to like prevent that from happening.

2696
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:08,080
Yeah, that's the thing I don't like is the idea that we should try to suppress and ban the use of the tool.

2697
02:37:08,080 --> 02:37:09,080
Right.

2698
02:37:09,080 --> 02:37:16,080
I think that you should go for the people who can line their pockets with the money and just say,

2699
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:18,080
you can't have copyright because it's AI.

2700
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:19,080
Yeah.

2701
02:37:19,080 --> 02:37:24,080
That would stop a lot of the greed and a lot of the bad shit.

2702
02:37:24,080 --> 02:37:28,080
I agree.

2703
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:30,080
I think I agree with you.

2704
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:32,080
Yeah, I think I agree with you.

2705
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:40,080
I mean, if we abolished copyright, if we abolished copyright, then like what, like sure,

2706
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:51,080
a corporate entity could use AI to maybe steal an artist's work in order to generate content,

2707
02:37:51,080 --> 02:37:59,080
but they wouldn't even own the intellectual property rights associated with that content that they created with that stolen work.

2708
02:37:59,080 --> 02:38:03,080
So that's better.

2709
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:13,080
It's not as simple because like if you got a lot of money and you can put things in front of people and you can sell merchandise,

2710
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:17,080
like how does not having copyright stop you from profiting?

2711
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:18,080
It doesn't.

2712
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:19,080
It doesn't.

2713
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:28,080
If nobody has a copyright for something and everybody makes a product, then the person who has the largest amount of power and capital to make a product that everyone can see and buy,

2714
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:33,080
they will make the product that people will buy that one.

2715
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:36,080
So it's a half measure.

2716
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:44,080
So is actually the answer to just to be more copyright, like enforce copyright more strictly and protect?

2717
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:52,080
Yeah, that's the other way to look at it is to make it so that artists are protected by copyright so people can't put things in AI things.

2718
02:38:52,080 --> 02:39:04,080
But I think that that fundamentally that would completely destroy basically every AI generating thing unless people opt in,

2719
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:08,080
which will be a very small amount of people unless they can.

2720
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:09,080
No, that's not true.

2721
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:10,080
No, that's not true.

2722
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:13,080
What about like public domain?

2723
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:14,080
Well, yeah.

2724
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:19,080
A lot of work is in the public domain and AI could be trained on anything that's in the public domain.

2725
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:20,080
Well, yeah.

2726
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:21,080
Yeah.

2727
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:24,080
I mean, the issue is for currently working artists.

2728
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:33,080
They don't want to lose their ability to continue to make money, but stuff in the public domain is in the public domain because the person who made it is dead for a long time.

2729
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:34,080
Okay.

2730
02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:36,080
Currently working artists.

2731
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:42,080
Yeah, but I mean, how do people have a right to get that cash?

2732
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:43,080
No.

2733
02:39:43,080 --> 02:39:48,080
Oh, I mean, yes, but also no.

2734
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:54,080
Um, do I mean, do people have a right to get the cash?

2735
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:57,080
Well, do people have a right to live?

2736
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:59,080
Yeah.

2737
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:00,080
How?

2738
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:03,080
I don't know.

2739
02:40:03,080 --> 02:40:05,080
They aren't giving it for free.

2740
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:06,080
They need money for it.

2741
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:10,080
So they therefore have a right to be able to make money.

2742
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:20,080
True, but that does not mean that they have a right to have a job as a background artist at an anime studio.

2743
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:21,080
I agree with that.

2744
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:32,080
I just think that the world that that would lead to is everybody having the most boring possible job that they hate because all the creative jobs is taken by AI.

2745
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:35,080
I mean, that's literally already the world.

2746
02:40:35,080 --> 02:40:36,080
That's literally already the world.

2747
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:38,080
We're already there.

2748
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:39,080
Not really?

2749
02:40:39,080 --> 02:40:42,080
What do you mean?

2750
02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:44,080
I mean, yeah.

2751
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:45,080
Okay.

2752
02:40:45,080 --> 02:40:51,080
There are a miniscule amount of jobs as a background artist at an anime studio, but not there's not that many.

2753
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:53,080
There's really not that many of those.

2754
02:40:53,080 --> 02:40:56,080
And if there were even fewer, I don't know.

2755
02:40:56,080 --> 02:40:58,080
So what?

2756
02:40:58,080 --> 02:41:01,080
I think this is just your bias against background artists.

2757
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:02,080
It's not.

2758
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:03,080
It's not.

2759
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:04,080
You hate drawing backgrounds.

2760
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:06,080
You think people who draw backgrounds are freaks.

2761
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:08,080
It's just, it's just an example.

2762
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:22,080
It's just an example of something that, okay, I use background artists because I don't, I think that's one of the few things in the art world that like an AI could even do anything for.

2763
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:31,080
That's just, most things, most things that artists do in the real world are not things that an AI is poised to take over doing.

2764
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:44,080
There's other jobs that are going to be obsolete by AI like way before animators or storyboard artists or script writers or whatever.

2765
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:51,080
So you're saying that it's dependent on how close AI is to taking over.

2766
02:41:51,080 --> 02:42:00,080
So potentially if AI could do more, then more jobs should be lost for people.

2767
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:16,080
I think, I mean, if a computer can do a job, why should a person be made to do it?

2768
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:21,080
Because it muddies the waters when who decides who gets paid.

2769
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:23,080
And that's the only problem.

2770
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:27,080
What do you mean it muddies the waters when they decide who gets paid?

2771
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:28,080
No, it doesn't.

2772
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:38,080
Because if the AI made it, does the person who coded the AI get ownership of the work and get paid through that?

2773
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:40,080
Okay, I see.

2774
02:42:40,080 --> 02:42:45,080
Or is it the person who made the art that gets fed into the AI or like who is it?

2775
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:53,080
And it's a question and then it usually will become the CEO of whatever company is the one who owns it because they can just say that.

2776
02:42:53,080 --> 02:42:58,080
And so rich super people will become big and strong.

2777
02:42:58,080 --> 02:43:00,080
And I don't like that.

2778
02:43:00,080 --> 02:43:01,080
Okay, okay.

2779
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:02,080
Sounds bad.

2780
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:03,080
I see what you're saying.

2781
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:18,080
You're saying that you think that the more AI is used in order to create intellectual property content, the more that consolidates the content and its creation.

2782
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:25,080
Basically, the more that consolidates the means of production under the ownership of the owners.

2783
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:26,080
Yeah.

2784
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:27,080
Yeah, I guess that's true.

2785
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:35,080
You can see that there is not any sort of push to make an AI that can roam a company as a CEO.

2786
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:36,080
Okay.

2787
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:37,080
Okay.

2788
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:38,080
That's true.

2789
02:43:38,080 --> 02:43:48,080
It would be funny if they could do that and like an AI could like take over as a CEO position and make better decisions and all the CEOs go out of business.

2790
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:49,080
An AI?

2791
02:43:49,080 --> 02:43:52,080
And they're all scrabbling on the floor like, no, no, I was in charge.

2792
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:55,080
A computer can never be held accountable.

2793
02:43:55,080 --> 02:43:59,080
Therefore, a computer must never make a management decision.

2794
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:01,080
Okay, I see what you're saying.

2795
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:03,080
And I think I agree with it.

2796
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:05,080
Okay, I do agree with you.

2797
02:44:05,080 --> 02:44:25,080
Level on a societal level, yes, an AI being a thing that a person owns or at least has the rights to operate does basically consolidate power in the owner or operator of that thing, which is bad.

2798
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:26,080
Yes.

2799
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:33,080
So the idea that you can't copyright work that is made through AI is like a step against...

2800
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:40,080
A step that makes it less appealing to the ruling class to invest so heavily in it, I guess.

2801
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:42,080
Okay, okay, okay.

2802
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:44,080
I guess I'm just...

2803
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:51,080
Okay, so in terms of like an economic societal level, yes, I guess it is bad.

2804
02:44:51,080 --> 02:45:01,080
However, in terms of like what we're here to do is to make a show or is to make art, right?

2805
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:10,080
I don't know how much I like the idea that, oh, well, okay, we must not use this thing.

2806
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:13,080
We must not use this thing to do it, even if it would be more effective.

2807
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:27,080
We can't use it because if we used it, then the economics would be worse and people wouldn't be paid and the resources would not be distributed as equally if we use this thing.

2808
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:28,080
I agree.

2809
02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:31,080
That's why I keep saying it's the capitalism problem.

2810
02:45:31,080 --> 02:45:39,080
If people didn't need money, if it didn't matter, then I don't think there would be a problem.

2811
02:45:39,080 --> 02:45:41,080
Yeah.

2812
02:45:41,080 --> 02:45:43,080
I mean...

2813
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:55,080
If it was just you live your life and you draw a little drawing, you don't need a job drawing for a big thing.

2814
02:45:55,080 --> 02:45:59,080
You can have a smaller team of people having a vision and use AI computers to make a big thing.

2815
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:01,080
It's like, oh, this is a cool animated show.

2816
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:05,080
It's like 99% by AI or something.

2817
02:46:05,080 --> 02:46:09,080
And it's like, oh, we get so many cool shows to watch and nobody's starving to death.

2818
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:11,080
That's fine.

2819
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:12,080
I'd be okay with that.

2820
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:18,080
It's just it requires a big safety net that just doesn't exist.

2821
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:20,080
Yeah.

2822
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:41,080
Yeah, in a perfect world, I guess what I wish would happen would be...

2823
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:44,080
Okay.

2824
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:52,080
And all this is assuming that AI can perfectly replicate the work of humans, which I think in very few cases is that true.

2825
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:59,080
But let's just assume that an AI can make backgrounds, animate, write scripts.

2826
02:46:59,080 --> 02:47:02,080
It can do it all, right?

2827
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:05,080
And all by itself without stealing anyone's work.

2828
02:47:05,080 --> 02:47:14,080
In a world where that exists, what I hope and maybe wish would happen would be that, okay, well, we fire all the artists, right?

2829
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:15,080
We don't need them anymore.

2830
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:17,080
This AI makes the content for us.

2831
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:19,080
Yeah.

2832
02:47:19,080 --> 02:47:27,080
So then that happens, but then it's, I don't know, I just feel like that would lead to a situation.

2833
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:34,080
I feel like that would be like a monopoly and I hope that society would shift in order to bust that trust up, right?

2834
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:45,080
I just feel like such an asset should be, I don't know, have a fucking revolution, have a revolution and overthrow fucking Disney or whatever.

2835
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:46,080
Who owns it?

2836
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:47,080
I don't know.

2837
02:47:47,080 --> 02:47:48,080
I know.

2838
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:54,080
Because yeah, it would be such a monopolization of the resources that I feel like it would just be unstable and it couldn't stand.

2839
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:59,080
And it would be hopefully in some way democratized by force, perhaps.

2840
02:47:59,080 --> 02:48:00,080
I don't know.

2841
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:11,080
I can't, I don't know how it, like, I don't feel like there's any, like, inevitability of a revolution if things get bad enough.

2842
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:19,080
I think things will just get bad and maybe people will just live with it and they'll just have worse lives forever.

2843
02:48:19,080 --> 02:48:22,080
Yeah, but I mean, that's fine.

2844
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:25,080
And it's like, that's a possibility I don't really want.

2845
02:48:25,080 --> 02:48:26,080
Yeah, well, that's okay.

2846
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:28,080
No, no.

2847
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:29,080
No, no, no.

2848
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:30,080
I get you.

2849
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:31,080
I get you.

2850
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:32,080
Um, yeah.

2851
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:33,080
Well.

2852
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:37,080
Because the idea, like, computers have not really been around for that long.

2853
02:48:37,080 --> 02:48:43,080
Revolutions have been around forever, but like, the situation is, it feels a little different.

2854
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:44,080
Consider, consider.

2855
02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:55,080
I mean, okay, I mean, let's look to, let's look to the past and see, I mean, in the past, you know, new technologies have emerged that have

2856
02:48:55,080 --> 02:48:59,080
obsoleted certain industries and certain professions.

2857
02:48:59,080 --> 02:49:12,080
And I mean, I don't think it's generally the case that those technologies stay, like, completely monopolized by the owners.

2858
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:24,080
I mean, maybe, maybe sometimes they do, but like, the invention of the computer did not lead to, like, I mean, yeah, IBM became really rich and Bill Gates became a mega billionaire.

2859
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:31,080
But the invention of the computer did not stay in, like, their hands.

2860
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:36,080
It was a technology that became distributed and everyone got their hands on it.

2861
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:39,080
And like, lots of people were able to make use of it.

2862
02:49:39,080 --> 02:49:40,080
Sure.

2863
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:43,080
I mean, yeah, they had to buy them from the manufacturer.

2864
02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:49,080
But I feel like it did not lead to a consolidation of power in the long run.

2865
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:51,080
I think it did eventually.

2866
02:49:51,080 --> 02:50:07,080
Yeah, some people made a whole lot of money off of it and they got really powerful about it, but also the rising tide kind of lifted all ships and everyone was better off because there was, you know, increasingly affordable access to computers.

2867
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:10,080
I hope that that will be the end result.

2868
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:16,080
Like, if it just so happens that AI just gets better and better and there's nothing really anybody can do about it.

2869
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:17,080
Artists keep getting fired.

2870
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:26,080
There's no, they're no longer useful and they have to get boring jobs that are worse.

2871
02:50:27,080 --> 02:50:36,080
If AI is so good that it really can obsolete all those jobs, then yeah, you know what?

2872
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:54,080
If that were true, then what would stop any fucking guy from just also using the AI to generate content of equal quality to what frickin' Disney Corp can make?

2873
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:57,080
Wouldn't that sort of un-monopolize it?

2874
02:50:57,080 --> 02:50:59,080
Wouldn't that sort of democratize it?

2875
02:50:59,080 --> 02:51:05,080
Then anyone could make the same stuff that Disney could make because we're using the same AI?

2876
02:51:05,080 --> 02:51:08,080
Well, if we're allowed to use the same AI, that's the thing.

2877
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:09,080
Well, sure.

2878
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:19,080
What if somebody buys the rights to using the technology and then, you know, they have their AI police come and shoot you in the head if you dare download it somehow.

2879
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:36,080
I think the technology, it might not, there's no guarantee that it would happen immediately, but I do think that eventually it will certainly become more available.

2880
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:40,080
Here's my comment on this.

2881
02:51:40,080 --> 02:51:56,080
If somebody was mad when they invented cars, that their horse business was going under, and it was to a point where they were starving and their family couldn't get any food and there was no other jobs,

2882
02:51:56,080 --> 02:52:01,080
I wouldn't begrudge that person getting mad and wanting to kill somebody and smashing stuff.

2883
02:52:01,080 --> 02:52:05,080
I feel like anger is justified in the moment.

2884
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:14,080
Obviously, times will change and then people will adapt, but if you're suddenly thrown out in the cold, that sucks.

2885
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:22,080
If you've been going to art school for a few years and you're just leaving and now AI is going to take your job,

2886
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:27,080
it's like, wow, I spent all that money and did all that time and now I need to do a different career, I'm pissed.

2887
02:52:27,080 --> 02:52:39,080
I'm sorry, I get you, but let's be real, if you weren't going to art school because you were like, yeah, I'm really going to secure my future.

2888
02:52:39,080 --> 02:52:43,080
I got a high paying job right out of the gate with this one.

2889
02:52:43,080 --> 02:52:44,080
No.

2890
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:46,080
This is a sure thing.

2891
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:48,080
Oh no, and now AI has taken that away from me.

2892
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:49,080
Not really.

2893
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:57,080
I think it does because automation for factories was a thing and it's like, oh, going into a factory,

2894
02:52:57,080 --> 02:53:02,080
a lot of manual labor has been done by computers and robots.

2895
02:53:02,080 --> 02:53:05,080
But then you think, ah, creative work.

2896
02:53:05,080 --> 02:53:08,080
I could still make a living doing that.

2897
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:14,080
Robots can't do that and then once you're ready to get into the industry, they can do that.

2898
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:16,080
Fuck you.

2899
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:19,080
I know right now, but that's the...

2900
02:53:19,080 --> 02:53:27,080
But that's exactly the thing, they can't do it right now and maybe they're getting closer to doing some more things

2901
02:53:27,080 --> 02:53:34,080
and I don't know exactly what extent they will eventually do those things further into the future,

2902
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:41,080
but it's not happening right now and the things that they can do are not made fully obsolete by them right now.

2903
02:53:41,080 --> 02:53:46,080
They're like trends and if you kind of look forward in time, you might see, okay, yeah,

2904
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:53,080
maybe background art, for instance, might be something that becomes less important in the future

2905
02:53:53,080 --> 02:53:56,080
because an AI can maybe do that.

2906
02:53:56,080 --> 02:54:03,080
So that's just one, what am I upset about?

2907
02:54:03,080 --> 02:54:09,080
Yeah, like people, you're mad that people are being mad too early?

2908
02:54:09,080 --> 02:54:13,080
I'm not, no, you're mad, no, you're mad.

2909
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:21,080
Well, where you were talking about someone, you were comparing an art student who now is like, oh no,

2910
02:54:21,080 --> 02:54:29,080
AI has obsolete my field of specialization to someone who used to own horses,

2911
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:35,080
being like, oh no, the invention of the automobile has obsolete my horsemanship.

2912
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:40,080
Right, I don't know whether I explained what I was getting at properly,

2913
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:51,080
but obviously horses are no longer an important part of society as much as they used to be

2914
02:54:51,080 --> 02:54:57,080
and people who tend to horses and make horseshoes and whatever are no longer as necessary as they were.

2915
02:54:57,080 --> 02:55:02,080
So they were on a losing ship.

2916
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:10,080
It's not, I mean, cars are bad for the environment, but automobiles led to other different vehicles.

2917
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:18,080
So it's a benefit for society that that happened and it's bad for that person in that moment.

2918
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:27,080
And if there's no help for them to ease the transition from their profession into some other new profession,

2919
02:55:27,080 --> 02:55:36,080
some other new way of making money and they end up starving or they become destitute,

2920
02:55:36,080 --> 02:55:45,080
that is an undesirable outcome and there should be a smoothing process to make it safe for humans because I care about those guys.

2921
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:53,080
Nobody is a bigger fan of the welfare state than me, all right?

2922
02:55:53,080 --> 02:56:02,080
Let's make that abundantly clear. Nobody here loves the welfare state more than me.

2923
02:56:02,080 --> 02:56:09,080
Yes, okay, I agree. I do agree with everything you're saying.

2924
02:56:09,080 --> 02:56:14,080
I guess...

2925
02:56:14,080 --> 02:56:18,080
No, no, no, stop there. You agree with everything I'm saying.

2926
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:22,080
Yeah, and full stop.

2927
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:25,080
Okay, what else? What are the topics?

2928
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:29,080
Yeah, I guess that's it.

2929
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:35,080
I got blocked by Vito on Twitter. Who cares?

2930
02:56:35,080 --> 02:56:40,080
You see that Mr. Beast cured the blind?

2931
02:56:40,080 --> 02:56:43,080
I feel like we already talked about this on the show.

2932
02:56:43,080 --> 02:56:48,080
No, I don't think so because this has been my notes from this week.

2933
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:51,080
Okay, I didn't watch the video.

2934
02:56:51,080 --> 02:56:53,080
I also didn't watch the video.

2935
02:56:53,080 --> 02:56:57,080
I watched a Mr. Beast video for the first time this week. It was my first time.

2936
02:56:57,080 --> 02:57:04,080
It was the one where he water repellent shoes.

2937
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:08,080
It was not very interesting.

2938
02:57:08,080 --> 02:57:15,080
I think I learned about him when Team Trees was going around. Remember that?

2939
02:57:15,080 --> 02:57:19,080
Oh, hashtag Team Trees as a donation link to Planet Tree.

2940
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:25,080
I remember hearing about Mr. Beast. It was like, oh, Mr. Beast is making his own squid game.

2941
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:29,080
And then I heard about Mr. Beast burgers.

2942
02:57:29,080 --> 02:57:32,080
I had heard of Mr. Beast before the burger thing.

2943
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:35,080
I don't remember what I heard about Mr. Beast.

2944
02:57:35,080 --> 02:57:38,080
Isn't he the biggest YouTuber now? Isn't he past PewDiePie?

2945
02:57:38,080 --> 02:57:42,080
I have no idea. I don't care about view subscriber numbers anymore.

2946
02:57:42,080 --> 02:57:47,080
I believe Mr. Beast is the biggest YouTuber now.

2947
02:57:47,080 --> 02:57:49,080
What a beast.

2948
02:57:49,080 --> 02:57:51,080
He's the beast.

2949
02:57:51,080 --> 02:57:55,080
Did you hear that he's the Antichrist?

2950
02:57:55,080 --> 02:58:01,080
Because he cured the blind and he is a false prophet?

2951
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:03,080
Yes.

2952
02:58:03,080 --> 02:58:09,080
Feeding 6,000 people with one loaf of bread.

2953
02:58:09,080 --> 02:58:12,080
With one loaf of bread, but it's a prank, bro.

2954
02:58:12,080 --> 02:58:17,080
We just have a stack of bread and we just pretend that we do a magic trick.

2955
02:58:17,080 --> 02:58:19,080
Oh, it's more bread or it's the same amount of bread.

2956
02:58:19,080 --> 02:58:28,080
I would respect it so much if Mr. Beast just fully went into doing things that the Jewish scriptures prophesy that the Messiah will do.

2957
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:32,080
But he makes them in these funny YouTube videos.

2958
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:34,080
What's going on, YouTube?

2959
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:40,080
What's going on, YouTube? I got only one fish here to feed my 10,000 friends with.

2960
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:42,080
My 10,000 subscribers.

2961
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:44,080
My 10,000 subscribers.

2962
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:49,080
His name is literally Mr. Beast.

2963
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:52,080
How much more on the nose can you get?

2964
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:55,080
Hey, there. It's me, Mr. Beast. I'm going to go White Savior Africa.

2965
02:58:55,080 --> 02:59:00,080
I'm going to go over there.

2966
02:59:00,080 --> 02:59:02,080
He's going to solve world hunger.

2967
02:59:02,080 --> 02:59:11,080
Hey, everyone. Thanks for tuning in to my 666 million subscriber special.

2968
02:59:11,080 --> 02:59:17,080
You know, I read a little bit about it and I refreshed my memory.

2969
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:23,080
It seems like the Antichrist does not actually refer to one guy.

2970
02:59:23,080 --> 02:59:29,080
It actually just refers to people that don't accept Christ generally.

2971
02:59:29,080 --> 02:59:31,080
Oh, haters.

2972
02:59:31,080 --> 02:59:33,080
Yeah, haters.

2973
02:59:33,080 --> 02:59:46,080
The idea that one guy comes to earth during the rapture and he's the Antichrist and he's the enemy of God or whatever is very much one of those things that American evangelicals just fucking made up.

2974
02:59:46,080 --> 02:59:50,080
And they all just believe even though it's like they just made it up.

2975
02:59:50,080 --> 02:59:52,080
All it is to say.

2976
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:56,080
All that is to say that Mr. Beast probably isn't the Antichrist in my humble opinion.

2977
02:59:56,080 --> 03:00:00,080
It's cool though, the idea of like the Antichrist as a guy.

2978
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:08,080
It is cool. It's a cool idea. It's compelling. It's compelling that a false Jesus comes and everyone thinks he's cool, but he's actually secretly evil in the devil.

2979
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:10,080
It's narratively it's compelling.

2980
03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:13,080
Like Mega Man clone.

2981
03:00:14,080 --> 03:00:17,080
You mean X Kai?

2982
03:00:17,080 --> 03:00:19,080
Yeah, one of them.

2983
03:00:19,080 --> 03:00:21,080
Show, gotta find a picture.

2984
03:00:21,080 --> 03:00:24,080
Which one's the evil Mega Man that becomes a mayor?

2985
03:00:24,080 --> 03:00:26,080
Becomes a mayor?

2986
03:00:26,080 --> 03:00:28,080
Or an empire guy.

2987
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:30,080
Who's the evil Mega Man?

2988
03:00:30,080 --> 03:00:32,080
What the fuck are you talking about?

2989
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:39,080
You made the lecture. Wasn't there like an evil Mega Man that was like it's a clone of the real Mega Man? X?

2990
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:42,080
A clone?

2991
03:00:42,080 --> 03:00:45,080
Or something.

2992
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:48,080
The true one is different.

2993
03:00:48,080 --> 03:01:00,080
There's a pseudo canonical guy called X Kai who is basically an evil alternate universe doppelganger of X.

2994
03:01:00,080 --> 03:01:02,080
But he's not in the games.

2995
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:09,080
I can swear there was like a major story where it's like zero or something.

2996
03:01:09,080 --> 03:01:11,080
Oh, do you mean copy X?

2997
03:01:11,080 --> 03:01:13,080
Yeah.

2998
03:01:13,080 --> 03:01:15,080
Oh yeah, copy X.

2999
03:01:15,080 --> 03:01:17,080
Because he turns evil.

3000
03:01:17,080 --> 03:01:25,080
They just make a duplicate of X in the future and that one turns out evil basically.

3001
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:27,080
Yeah.

3002
03:01:27,080 --> 03:01:30,080
Yeah, copy X. What about him?

3003
03:01:30,080 --> 03:01:32,080
He could be Jesus, Antichrist.

3004
03:01:32,080 --> 03:01:34,080
He is...

3005
03:01:34,080 --> 03:01:36,080
People think it's Mega Man.

3006
03:01:36,080 --> 03:01:38,080
I love Mega Man.

3007
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:42,080
Pretty much everyone sees he's the savior. He's the savior of humanity.

3008
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:45,080
But he's this fucking fascist dictator.

3009
03:01:45,080 --> 03:01:49,080
It's so awesome. So fucking awesome.

3010
03:01:49,080 --> 03:01:51,080
He's big fucking angel wings.

3011
03:01:51,080 --> 03:01:55,080
Oh God, yes. Yes.

3012
03:01:55,080 --> 03:01:58,080
I'm sorry, what was I talking about? The Bible?

3013
03:01:58,080 --> 03:01:59,080
Read it.

3014
03:01:59,080 --> 03:02:00,080
Mr. Beast.

3015
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:02,080
Mr. Beast, watch him.

3016
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:04,080
Watch his content and praise him.

3017
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:06,080
Do not praise God.

3018
03:02:07,080 --> 03:02:09,080
Praise the Beast.

3019
03:02:09,080 --> 03:02:19,080
What do you think about how he cured all those blind people and it's actually bad that he did that because capitalism is bad?

3020
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:27,080
I think that it's a good deed that highlights how fucked things are.

3021
03:02:27,080 --> 03:02:28,080
Yeah, that's true.

3022
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:33,080
There's so many people who need that that can't afford it because medical care is a luxury.

3023
03:02:33,080 --> 03:02:34,080
Yeah.

3024
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:37,080
So it's like...

3025
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:44,080
The way I think of Mr. Beast is that he is a good boy coded, but I wouldn't trust him.

3026
03:02:44,080 --> 03:02:45,080
I wouldn't trust him.

3027
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:47,080
That's a good way to put it.

3028
03:02:47,080 --> 03:02:54,080
You know, he does good things, philanthropic things that are like, yeah, that's unironically a good deed.

3029
03:02:54,080 --> 03:03:06,080
But his bottom line is like a YouTube big video, lots of money coming in from sponsors, etc.

3030
03:03:06,080 --> 03:03:10,080
So if something changes, I don't trust him to stay a good boy.

3031
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:13,080
Oh, definitely. Definitely not.

3032
03:03:13,080 --> 03:03:15,080
He was a little bit slimy.

3033
03:03:15,080 --> 03:03:16,080
I don't know.

3034
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:21,080
Little Joel just made a little video talking about how...

3035
03:03:21,080 --> 03:03:25,080
Yeah, the serfs were like, Mr. Beast does this to make money.

3036
03:03:25,080 --> 03:03:29,080
And Mr. Beast was like, my videos actually lose money.

3037
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:30,080
And like, no, they don't.

3038
03:03:30,080 --> 03:03:33,080
Like, shut the fuck up.

3039
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:34,080
It's got a house.

3040
03:03:34,080 --> 03:03:37,080
It's got a big old house with money inside.

3041
03:03:37,080 --> 03:03:41,080
Like, yeah, maybe a video.

3042
03:03:41,080 --> 03:03:50,080
Yeah, maybe this video specifically will not make back the money you spent on a thousand cataract surgeries in ad revenue specifically.

3043
03:03:50,080 --> 03:03:55,080
But that doesn't matter because it's like, it's part of the larger beast empire.

3044
03:03:55,080 --> 03:03:57,080
And it generates revenue in other ways.

3045
03:03:57,080 --> 03:04:01,080
So like, you're not actually doing this and losing money on it.

3046
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:05,080
Give me a freaking break, bro.

3047
03:04:05,080 --> 03:04:08,080
No, he's slimy and I don't trust him.

3048
03:04:08,080 --> 03:04:15,080
But it's not his fault that capitalism's fucked and these people needed cataract surgery and he paid for it.

3049
03:04:15,080 --> 03:04:16,080
So whatever.

3050
03:04:16,080 --> 03:04:25,080
It's sort of funny image where it's like a Mr. Beast thumbnail and it's like 1000 trans girls touch their vaginas for the first time.

3051
03:04:29,080 --> 03:04:30,080
Awesome.

3052
03:04:30,080 --> 03:04:32,080
I hope he does that one.

3053
03:04:32,080 --> 03:04:34,080
He's too cowardly.

3054
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:37,080
Yeah, that's what the thing is.

3055
03:04:37,080 --> 03:04:43,080
Like, I don't trust him because he's like, he could do a positive political message.

3056
03:04:44,080 --> 03:04:45,080
But he doesn't.

3057
03:04:45,080 --> 03:04:49,080
He's just sort of like doing safe philanthropy.

3058
03:04:49,080 --> 03:04:54,080
He could advocate for communism while he does all these things, but he won't.

3059
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:55,080
He won't.

3060
03:04:55,080 --> 03:04:57,080
He doesn't do trans positive things.

3061
03:04:57,080 --> 03:05:01,080
I don't know whether because he doesn't agree, but either way.

3062
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:06,080
If I were him, I wouldn't do those things just because it would be divisive because it would make certain people mad at me.

3063
03:05:06,080 --> 03:05:07,080
It would be certain people mad.

3064
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:11,080
He only does safe PR philanthropy.

3065
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:14,080
So poor people giving them free shit.

3066
03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:16,080
Well, everyone likes getting free shit.

3067
03:05:16,080 --> 03:05:17,080
So everyone likes that.

3068
03:05:17,080 --> 03:05:19,080
Blind people giving them surgery.

3069
03:05:19,080 --> 03:05:21,080
Everyone likes getting surgery.

3070
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:22,080
Everyone liked that.

3071
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:23,080
Yeah.

3072
03:05:23,080 --> 03:05:24,080
Everybody.

3073
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:25,080
Everyone liked that.

3074
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:27,080
True.

3075
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:28,080
True.

3076
03:05:29,080 --> 03:05:30,080
Shit.

3077
03:05:30,080 --> 03:05:31,080
Where was I going with that?

3078
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:34,080
Subscribe to Mr. Beast.

3079
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:35,080
Yeah.

3080
03:05:36,080 --> 03:05:38,080
And the PCP.

3081
03:05:38,080 --> 03:05:39,080
Yeah.

3082
03:05:39,080 --> 03:05:40,080
Affiliated.

3083
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:41,080
You could do that too.

3084
03:05:42,080 --> 03:05:44,080
You could do that too if you really wanted to.

3085
03:05:45,080 --> 03:05:46,080
Okay.

3086
03:05:46,080 --> 03:05:48,080
I guess that's all I have to say about him.

3087
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:50,080
My best friend, Mr. Beast.

3088
03:05:51,080 --> 03:05:52,080
That's it.

3089
03:05:52,080 --> 03:05:53,080
That's all.

3090
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:54,080
That's my whole list.

3091
03:05:54,080 --> 03:05:55,080
Nice.

3092
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:56,080
And thank God.

3093
03:05:56,080 --> 03:05:58,080
Thank fuck.

3094
03:05:58,080 --> 03:05:59,080
You want to...

3095
03:05:59,080 --> 03:06:01,080
Let's get to voicemails.

3096
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:04,080
I'm going to hit the bathroom and I'll be right back.

3097
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:05,080
And Ellie is art.

3098
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:09,080
Thanks for putting in the little toilet sound whenever anyone takes a bathroom break.

3099
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:10,080
I appreciate it.

3100
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:11,080
I genuinely do.

3101
03:06:11,080 --> 03:06:12,080
Okay.

3102
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:13,080
Here I go.

3103
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:22,080
Okay.

3104
03:06:22,080 --> 03:06:23,080
You're in report.

3105
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:24,080
Little darker.

3106
03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:27,080
Little darker than I'm comfortable with.

3107
03:06:27,080 --> 03:06:29,080
Not like brown or anything.

3108
03:06:29,080 --> 03:06:34,080
Not like distressingly dark, but like a fairly rich golden yellow.

3109
03:06:34,080 --> 03:06:36,080
And like, frankly, that's not what I want.

3110
03:06:36,080 --> 03:06:40,080
I'm good at drinking water and staying hydrated.

3111
03:06:40,080 --> 03:06:47,080
My urine is generally a nice clear to pale, clear to light, faint yellowish.

3112
03:06:47,080 --> 03:06:50,080
So, you know, it's got to drink more.

3113
03:06:50,080 --> 03:06:52,080
It's got to drink more sparkle and seltzer.

3114
03:06:52,080 --> 03:06:53,080
That's the solution.

3115
03:06:53,080 --> 03:06:54,080
Got a drink.

3116
03:06:54,080 --> 03:06:55,080
Got a drink.

3117
03:06:55,080 --> 03:06:59,080
I've been feeling a little dehydrated lately.

3118
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:07,080
When it's cold, I feel like it's harder not to drink, but just to decide to have a cold

3119
03:07:07,080 --> 03:07:10,080
glass of water because I don't want to get colder.

3120
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:16,080
But I don't always want to have a cup of tea or coffee because I don't need all that caffeine.

3121
03:07:16,080 --> 03:07:19,080
So it's like, do I just get a cup of hot water?

3122
03:07:19,080 --> 03:07:20,080
That tastes like nothing.

3123
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:22,080
That's sort of weird.

3124
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:25,080
I mean, yeah, I wouldn't just drink hot water.

3125
03:07:25,080 --> 03:07:29,080
I would just drink regular water.

3126
03:07:29,080 --> 03:07:33,080
But yeah, you know, maybe that is why I didn't drink so much yesterday because it was cold

3127
03:07:33,080 --> 03:07:37,080
and I just didn't feel like drinking as much fluid.

3128
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:38,080
Yeah, maybe.

3129
03:07:38,080 --> 03:07:40,080
Excuse me.

3130
03:07:40,080 --> 03:07:42,080
That's when you get a soup.

3131
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:46,080
That's when you get a nice bowl of soup in your eyes when it's freezing.

3132
03:07:46,080 --> 03:07:48,080
I did eat a lot of salt.

3133
03:07:48,080 --> 03:07:50,080
I did eat a bunch of pickles yesterday.

3134
03:07:50,080 --> 03:07:52,080
Maybe had something to do with that.

3135
03:07:52,080 --> 03:07:53,080
All right.

3136
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:55,080
You don't want a voicemail?

3137
03:07:55,080 --> 03:07:57,080
Yeah.

3138
03:07:57,080 --> 03:08:01,080
Oh, God.

3139
03:08:01,080 --> 03:08:03,080
No, my oatmeal.

3140
03:08:03,080 --> 03:08:06,080
Ew, ew, ew, ew.

3141
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:07,080
Where'd it go?

3142
03:08:07,080 --> 03:08:11,080
A little bit splattered off the spoon.

3143
03:08:11,080 --> 03:08:14,080
I have to lick it up off the floor because it's so delicious.

3144
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:16,080
Horrible.

3145
03:08:16,080 --> 03:08:17,080
Time is it.

3146
03:08:17,080 --> 03:08:19,080
It's 1.35.

3147
03:08:19,080 --> 03:08:21,080
I've only been going for three hours.

3148
03:08:21,080 --> 03:08:22,080
Okay.

3149
03:08:22,080 --> 03:08:24,080
The first voicemail.

3150
03:08:24,080 --> 03:08:25,080
Oh, God.

3151
03:08:25,080 --> 03:08:28,080
It's kind of a lot.

3152
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:30,080
First one is called pantomime.

3153
03:08:30,080 --> 03:08:33,080
Three, two, one, go.

3154
03:08:33,080 --> 03:08:36,080
Gib, have you ever been in a pantomime?

3155
03:08:36,080 --> 03:08:39,080
I read it on TV Troll because it looks fucking sick.

3156
03:08:39,080 --> 03:08:41,080
I went to go with one.

3157
03:08:41,080 --> 03:08:42,080
What do you mean?

3158
03:08:42,080 --> 03:08:44,080
Go in a pantomime.

3159
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:51,080
I don't, I assume they don't mean like participate on stage as an actor.

3160
03:08:51,080 --> 03:08:52,080
Pantomimes are fun.

3161
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:55,080
They're like a Christmas tradition.

3162
03:08:55,080 --> 03:08:57,080
Do you know what a pantomime is?

3163
03:08:57,080 --> 03:09:02,080
I mean, isn't that when like a mime like puts you in a box?

3164
03:09:02,080 --> 03:09:03,080
No.

3165
03:09:03,080 --> 03:09:11,080
Pantomime is a theater performance that is,

3166
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:17,080
it's sort of like for kids and families because it involves the audience a lot.

3167
03:09:17,080 --> 03:09:24,080
There's a lot of the actors interacting with the audience as like a person.

3168
03:09:24,080 --> 03:09:27,080
Kind of like streamers, honestly.

3169
03:09:27,080 --> 03:09:28,080
This is funny.

3170
03:09:28,080 --> 03:09:34,080
I'm just realizing this where they're like, there's a spooky monster behind like the person,

3171
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:36,080
the actors like, where is this thing?

3172
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:41,080
All the kids, people are shouting screaming like, there it is behind you, behind you.

3173
03:09:41,080 --> 03:09:44,080
And then the person on stage is like, where?

3174
03:09:44,080 --> 03:09:47,080
And they like comically look around and miss the monster.

3175
03:09:47,080 --> 03:09:52,080
And it's like, it's like an interactive theater experience.

3176
03:09:52,080 --> 03:09:53,080
It's not as serious.

3177
03:09:53,080 --> 03:09:54,080
Weird.

3178
03:09:54,080 --> 03:09:55,080
It's very campy and fun.

3179
03:09:55,080 --> 03:09:58,080
I've actually never even heard of this before.

3180
03:09:58,080 --> 03:10:01,080
I just thought pantomime is just what mimes do.

3181
03:10:01,080 --> 03:10:02,080
Yeah.

3182
03:10:02,080 --> 03:10:05,080
It's like, what if you didn't take theater so seriously?

3183
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:07,080
What if you had fun?

3184
03:10:07,080 --> 03:10:09,080
And I've been to a few of them.

3185
03:10:09,080 --> 03:10:13,080
It's not a regular thing, but they're pretty good.

3186
03:10:13,080 --> 03:10:22,080
I don't usually, I'm not usually the one who likes to get involved, but the experience is amusing.

3187
03:10:22,080 --> 03:10:23,080
Okay.

3188
03:10:23,080 --> 03:10:25,080
Well, now I know.

3189
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:28,080
Next one is called, please think about it, Ben.

3190
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:31,080
Three, two, one, go.

3191
03:10:31,080 --> 03:10:35,080
So I've been wondering for a while how Nate, Ben, and especially Jesse,

3192
03:10:35,080 --> 03:10:38,080
managed to survive off of like 500 bucks a month.

3193
03:10:38,080 --> 03:10:43,080
And then I remembered that recently I was hanging out with Max and relax and all cool.

3194
03:10:43,080 --> 03:10:47,080
And I found this, this YouTube channel called financial audit with cable power.

3195
03:10:47,080 --> 03:10:52,080
And it's basically this little fucking prep, like sitting there in the studio with an old person

3196
03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:57,080
and they're going over the finances and his job is basically just to rip the new one.

3197
03:10:57,080 --> 03:11:02,080
And I was like, yeah, you're going to die miserably on the Walmart floor because you didn't save for retirement

3198
03:11:02,080 --> 03:11:07,080
and you're drinking $600 of Starbucks a month, you fucking idiot.

3199
03:11:07,080 --> 03:11:10,080
And I thought that's the perfect show for Ben to go on.

3200
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:15,080
Not only because I would personally find it very amusing to see the Ben dome all shined up in that studio,

3201
03:11:15,080 --> 03:11:21,080
but it would also be a great cloud opportunity because that guy, he pays your fucking travel expenses

3202
03:11:21,080 --> 03:11:26,080
because his channel is still small enough to where he basically will take anyone.

3203
03:11:26,080 --> 03:11:33,080
It's also fast growing enough for you to actually get some exposure of like the video spent 50 to 100K views regularly,

3204
03:11:33,080 --> 03:11:38,080
but sometimes if you're like really pathetic, you'll get half a million views.

3205
03:11:38,080 --> 03:11:40,080
Hell yeah, that's me.

3206
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:46,080
So basically what I'm saying is that a video title like this are the son of a bitch, pitiful loser,

3207
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:49,080
bald little freak survives off of 200 bucks a month.

3208
03:11:49,080 --> 03:11:52,080
He makes from like ex-horse lovers online.

3209
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:55,080
He will probably die alone and it's honestly pathetic.

3210
03:11:55,080 --> 03:11:57,080
Like that would be a problem.

3211
03:11:57,080 --> 03:11:58,080
That would get you exposure then.

3212
03:11:58,080 --> 03:12:00,080
Like please think about it.

3213
03:12:00,080 --> 03:12:02,080
Please think about it.

3214
03:12:02,080 --> 03:12:04,080
So okay, I think I found the channel.

3215
03:12:04,080 --> 03:12:08,080
Is it the, is it Caleb Hammer?

3216
03:12:08,080 --> 03:12:10,080
I couldn't hear it too well.

3217
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:12,080
I searched.

3218
03:12:12,080 --> 03:12:18,080
Okay, there's a show, there's a channel called Caleb Hammer and he does some,

3219
03:12:18,080 --> 03:12:21,080
some of the shows have like a subtitle financial audit.

3220
03:12:21,080 --> 03:12:23,080
I think this is the one he's talking about.

3221
03:12:23,080 --> 03:12:30,080
How many, this guy has, he's got 148K subscribers, so he's not huge.

3222
03:12:30,080 --> 03:12:33,080
Uh, that could be funny.

3223
03:12:33,080 --> 03:12:35,080
Can actually be really funny.

3224
03:12:35,080 --> 03:12:37,080
I'm thumb.

3225
03:12:37,080 --> 03:12:39,080
I might think about it.

3226
03:12:39,080 --> 03:12:46,080
Does he have like, does he have like fricking submissions process?

3227
03:12:46,080 --> 03:12:52,080
So wait, you go on this show to show how lame you are?

3228
03:12:52,080 --> 03:12:57,080
Well, I think, well, okay, I would watch the show to see more about it before I did it,

3229
03:12:57,080 --> 03:13:08,080
but it seems to me like he consults with you about your finances.

3230
03:13:08,080 --> 03:13:11,080
And I mean, I don't know.

3231
03:13:11,080 --> 03:13:20,080
I don't think, I mean, I would hope that he's not here to like lambast and berate you.

3232
03:13:20,080 --> 03:13:22,080
I don't know if I'd be interested in that.

3233
03:13:22,080 --> 03:13:24,080
Or need to do, is get kicked in the nards.

3234
03:13:24,080 --> 03:13:26,080
Hmm, okay, I'm listening.

3235
03:13:26,080 --> 03:13:27,080
I'll film it.

3236
03:13:27,080 --> 03:13:28,080
Okay.

3237
03:13:28,080 --> 03:13:31,080
And then I'll put it online and then I'll point at you and I'll put a red arrow

3238
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:33,080
looking at your face as you scream.

3239
03:13:33,080 --> 03:13:36,080
And you'll get so many views.

3240
03:13:36,080 --> 03:13:41,080
Yeah, I think I'm hoping that it's not.

3241
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:51,080
I think it's probably a little bit more constructive than that, but I mean, I don't know.

3242
03:13:51,080 --> 03:14:00,080
Honestly, I don't know if my finances are that interesting.

3243
03:14:00,080 --> 03:14:03,080
Yeah, that's pretty much all I really have to say.

3244
03:14:03,080 --> 03:14:08,080
My finances are pretty much just not a lot of money comes in and also not a lot of money comes out

3245
03:14:08,080 --> 03:14:12,080
and that's that's it.

3246
03:14:12,080 --> 03:14:15,080
Okay, next one is an image.

3247
03:14:15,080 --> 03:14:16,080
I'm going to keep that.

3248
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:17,080
I'll keep that tab open.

3249
03:14:17,080 --> 03:14:22,080
I might give that a watch.

3250
03:14:22,080 --> 03:14:26,080
Okay, voicemailer types.

3251
03:14:26,080 --> 03:14:31,080
I just consumed a video game thoughts.

3252
03:14:31,080 --> 03:14:37,080
Okay, someone who just you can't understand.

3253
03:14:37,080 --> 03:14:38,080
Yep.

3254
03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:41,080
Why is this podcast still going?

3255
03:14:41,080 --> 03:14:42,080
Yep.

3256
03:14:42,080 --> 03:14:43,080
Every now and then.

3257
03:14:43,080 --> 03:14:47,080
I mean, those don't those don't those tend to be commenters more than voicemailers.

3258
03:14:47,080 --> 03:14:50,080
Yeah, the voicemailers have stopped of that type.

3259
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:55,080
I feel like it's too high effort to make a voicemail link to an eight hour long YouTube

3260
03:14:55,080 --> 03:14:58,080
video and no timestamp.

3261
03:14:58,080 --> 03:15:01,080
Yeah, we try to ignore those ones.

3262
03:15:01,080 --> 03:15:02,080
Coughing.

3263
03:15:02,080 --> 03:15:06,080
I don't know why that's.

3264
03:15:06,080 --> 03:15:09,080
Wait, is monkey no longer on the podcast?

3265
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:10,080
What happened?

3266
03:15:10,080 --> 03:15:13,080
Again, those are the commenters.

3267
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:14,080
Do you ever see those?

3268
03:15:14,080 --> 03:15:18,080
Like, it's like every couple episodes, someone's in the comments like, wait a minute, like,

3269
03:15:18,080 --> 03:15:22,080
how come like Nate and Digi Bro and like DeVoo aren't here anymore?

3270
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:24,080
What's going on?

3271
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:26,080
What can someone explain what happened?

3272
03:15:26,080 --> 03:15:29,080
And it's like genuinely they're asking and it seems genuine.

3273
03:15:29,080 --> 03:15:32,080
And it's like, bro, what did you expect?

3274
03:15:32,080 --> 03:15:36,080
You didn't listen for like four years and you're just like, why are things different?

3275
03:15:36,080 --> 03:15:39,080
Like, what do you what do you think the answer is?

3276
03:15:39,080 --> 03:15:41,080
What do you think the answer is?

3277
03:15:41,080 --> 03:15:42,080
Buster.

3278
03:15:42,080 --> 03:15:44,080
What happened in four years?

3279
03:15:44,080 --> 03:15:45,080
I don't know.

3280
03:15:45,080 --> 03:15:49,080
A lot of stuff.

3281
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:50,080
Yeah.

3282
03:15:50,080 --> 03:15:51,080
Music gods.

3283
03:15:51,080 --> 03:15:53,080
It's mostly just oblivion.

3284
03:15:53,080 --> 03:15:55,080
It's mostly just oblivion fall.

3285
03:15:55,080 --> 03:15:56,080
Picture chads.

3286
03:15:56,080 --> 03:15:57,080
Picture chads.

3287
03:15:57,080 --> 03:15:58,080
Yeah.

3288
03:15:58,080 --> 03:16:00,080
I like that picture of a picture chad.

3289
03:16:00,080 --> 03:16:01,080
There's mostly that.

3290
03:16:01,080 --> 03:16:02,080
That's true.

3291
03:16:02,080 --> 03:16:03,080
There's most of that one guy.

3292
03:16:03,080 --> 03:16:06,080
It's mostly the one guy and I don't know who it is.

3293
03:16:06,080 --> 03:16:08,080
I don't have it in the name to put to them.

3294
03:16:08,080 --> 03:16:09,080
I always like a picture.

3295
03:16:09,080 --> 03:16:14,080
Those are the voicemails I like because there's no chance of like diarrhea of sounds.

3296
03:16:14,080 --> 03:16:18,080
I do like a picture, but in particular, I know there's one person whose art style I

3297
03:16:18,080 --> 03:16:19,080
recognize.

3298
03:16:19,080 --> 03:16:24,080
I don't otherwise I don't know who they are, but they just that's the picture chad.

3299
03:16:24,080 --> 03:16:28,080
As far as I'm concerned, virginity status loss.

3300
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:30,080
I repeat virginity status loss.

3301
03:16:30,080 --> 03:16:31,080
Funny podcast.

3302
03:16:31,080 --> 03:16:32,080
Do you copy?

3303
03:16:32,080 --> 03:16:34,080
I think it's been a while since we've had one of those.

3304
03:16:34,080 --> 03:16:35,080
Yeah.

3305
03:16:35,080 --> 03:16:38,080
Those are usually directed towards Nate or something.

3306
03:16:38,080 --> 03:16:44,080
I think we might have had one not that long ago, but it was like the first one in a while.

3307
03:16:44,080 --> 03:16:46,080
Anyway, I mean, what can I say?

3308
03:16:47,080 --> 03:16:48,080
True.

3309
03:16:48,080 --> 03:16:49,080
Mostly true.

3310
03:16:51,080 --> 03:16:52,080
Okay.

3311
03:16:52,080 --> 03:16:55,080
Next one is another image.

3312
03:16:56,080 --> 03:16:58,080
Let's fucking go.

3313
03:16:58,080 --> 03:17:01,080
That's episode 406.

3314
03:17:01,080 --> 03:17:04,080
We know clipped into the back rooms.

3315
03:17:05,080 --> 03:17:07,080
Looks like it's up with my face.

3316
03:17:07,080 --> 03:17:10,080
I don't.

3317
03:17:10,080 --> 03:17:12,080
There's a lot of things going on.

3318
03:17:12,080 --> 03:17:14,080
I don't know what to say about this.

3319
03:17:14,080 --> 03:17:16,080
Old YouTube layout.

3320
03:17:16,080 --> 03:17:18,080
Yeah.

3321
03:17:18,080 --> 03:17:21,080
Kazoovin Sindavi says fake.

3322
03:17:21,080 --> 03:17:22,080
A lot of views though.

3323
03:17:22,080 --> 03:17:24,080
That's a respectable view count.

3324
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:25,080
Is this a reference?

3325
03:17:25,080 --> 03:17:26,080
Damn, look at that.

3326
03:17:26,080 --> 03:17:28,080
Look at that like to dislike ratio.

3327
03:17:30,080 --> 03:17:32,080
Pretty good.

3328
03:17:32,080 --> 03:17:34,080
Pretty good.

3329
03:17:34,080 --> 03:17:42,080
I feel like this is a screenshot of some other video that just this has been pasted onto and it's a reference to something and I don't know the reference.

3330
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:43,080
Yeah, I don't either.

3331
03:17:44,080 --> 03:17:46,080
Okay, next one is called clipped with permission.

3332
03:17:46,080 --> 03:17:48,080
Three, two, one, go.

3333
03:17:48,080 --> 03:17:50,080
You see, this is what I'm talking about.

3334
03:17:50,080 --> 03:17:51,080
This is what I'm talking about here.

3335
03:17:51,080 --> 03:17:53,080
Like, I tried to make it as a YouTuber.

3336
03:17:53,080 --> 03:17:54,080
I really did.

3337
03:17:54,080 --> 03:17:56,080
I tried and I failed.

3338
03:17:56,080 --> 03:17:57,080
Honestly, it's fine.

3339
03:17:57,080 --> 03:17:58,080
I was prepared.

3340
03:17:58,080 --> 03:17:59,080
I got my old job back.

3341
03:17:59,080 --> 03:18:00,080
We're good.

3342
03:18:00,080 --> 03:18:02,080
I have Michelle under my desk sucking me off right now.

3343
03:18:02,080 --> 03:18:04,080
The League of Nate fuckers were right about one thing.

3344
03:18:04,080 --> 03:18:07,080
I don't have enough dick in my ass.

3345
03:18:07,080 --> 03:18:08,080
I'll take any dick.

3346
03:18:08,080 --> 03:18:10,080
Please for the love of God.

3347
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:11,080
Show me some cock.

3348
03:18:11,080 --> 03:18:12,080
Bring out the jizz.

3349
03:18:12,080 --> 03:18:13,080
Bring out the cum.

3350
03:18:13,080 --> 03:18:14,080
Do you hear me?

3351
03:18:14,080 --> 03:18:17,080
I want to like see my face and my bare jiggling ass.

3352
03:18:17,080 --> 03:18:18,080
I thought this was real.

3353
03:18:18,080 --> 03:18:20,080
I thought this was real.

3354
03:18:20,080 --> 03:18:24,080
Put like a little pair of sunglasses on my nuts.

3355
03:18:24,080 --> 03:18:26,080
It's the right thing to do.

3356
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:27,080
You'll get all the clicks.

3357
03:18:27,080 --> 03:18:28,080
This is it.

3358
03:18:28,080 --> 03:18:29,080
This is the future.

3359
03:18:29,080 --> 03:18:30,080
We need to be bred.

3360
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:31,080
I want to be bred.

3361
03:18:31,080 --> 03:18:32,080
Oh, yeah.

3362
03:18:32,080 --> 03:18:33,080
Like fully breaded, dude.

3363
03:18:38,080 --> 03:18:41,080
It's the big brain play, honestly.

3364
03:18:41,080 --> 03:18:43,080
In all seriousness, like we're on what?

3365
03:18:43,080 --> 03:18:46,080
Episode 346 of the PCP.

3366
03:18:46,080 --> 03:18:49,080
Probably 347 when like Ben and Gibb hear this.

3367
03:18:49,080 --> 03:18:51,080
I just want them to know that I'm doing okay.

3368
03:18:51,080 --> 03:18:53,080
I am more than okay.

3369
03:18:53,080 --> 03:18:54,080
I am in their walls.

3370
03:18:54,080 --> 03:18:57,080
I want in Ben Saints balls.

3371
03:18:57,080 --> 03:19:01,080
That's a very well constructed little bit.

3372
03:19:01,080 --> 03:19:02,080
I almost couldn't tell.

3373
03:19:02,080 --> 03:19:06,080
I almost could not tell that it's not the man himself.

3374
03:19:06,080 --> 03:19:08,080
There was something about the way he said Michelle

3375
03:19:08,080 --> 03:19:10,080
sucking me off under the desk that was like,

3376
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:13,080
that's a little robotic of a way to say that.

3377
03:19:13,080 --> 03:19:16,080
Just every once in a while, a little bit of inflection

3378
03:19:16,080 --> 03:19:17,080
is just a little bit off.

3379
03:19:17,080 --> 03:19:19,080
And I'm like, wait, wait, wait, but like it took me.

3380
03:19:19,080 --> 03:19:22,080
But they added the clips of him giggling.

3381
03:19:22,080 --> 03:19:23,080
That sold it really well.

3382
03:19:23,080 --> 03:19:25,080
Yeah, sold it really well.

3383
03:19:25,080 --> 03:19:29,080
That was an excellent dam.

3384
03:19:29,080 --> 03:19:31,080
Forget firing background artists.

3385
03:19:31,080 --> 03:19:32,080
Fire voice actors.

3386
03:19:32,080 --> 03:19:34,080
We just use the clips they gave us already.

3387
03:19:34,080 --> 03:19:37,080
We can just train an AI to do their jobs for them.

3388
03:19:37,080 --> 03:19:40,080
They'll make themselves obsolete, baby.

3389
03:19:42,080 --> 03:19:43,080
That's money.

3390
03:19:43,080 --> 03:19:44,080
That's money in the bank.

3391
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:47,080
I love capitalism.

3392
03:19:47,080 --> 03:19:49,080
Clipped without permission is the next one.

3393
03:19:49,080 --> 03:19:50,080
Okay.

3394
03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:51,080
Let's do it.

3395
03:19:51,080 --> 03:19:52,080
Three, two, one, go.

3396
03:19:52,080 --> 03:19:54,080
See, this is what I'm talking about.

3397
03:19:54,080 --> 03:19:56,080
This is like exactly what I was talking about.

3398
03:19:56,080 --> 03:19:59,080
I will be watching when Princess Celestia shoves her fat

3399
03:19:59,080 --> 03:20:02,080
wobbling ass through the doorway to Ben Saints room

3400
03:20:02,080 --> 03:20:05,080
and forces him to drink all of her hot horsey sun sweat

3401
03:20:05,080 --> 03:20:07,080
right off her dripping pony pucker.

3402
03:20:07,080 --> 03:20:09,080
This is the real future.

3403
03:20:09,080 --> 03:20:11,080
This is the future Elon promised us.

3404
03:20:11,080 --> 03:20:14,080
I mean, it was pretty...

3405
03:20:14,080 --> 03:20:17,080
Has Nate referred to you as Ben Saint that much?

3406
03:20:17,080 --> 03:20:19,080
I feel like he wouldn't say Ben Saint.

3407
03:20:19,080 --> 03:20:21,080
Don't feel like he would say Ben Saint.

3408
03:20:21,080 --> 03:20:23,080
No, I don't feel like he would say Ben Saint.

3409
03:20:23,080 --> 03:20:25,080
We found the floor.

3410
03:20:25,080 --> 03:20:27,080
Yeah, that's the tell.

3411
03:20:27,080 --> 03:20:28,080
That's the tell.

3412
03:20:28,080 --> 03:20:30,080
It's funny.

3413
03:20:30,080 --> 03:20:32,080
It's always funny and I don't blame anyone,

3414
03:20:32,080 --> 03:20:35,080
but it's always funny to me when someone...

3415
03:20:35,080 --> 03:20:39,080
Yeah, when someone refers to me as Ben Saint,

3416
03:20:39,080 --> 03:20:42,080
especially on Twitter or somewhere else,

3417
03:20:42,080 --> 03:20:46,080
when they address me as Ben Saint by my full name,

3418
03:20:46,080 --> 03:20:50,080
it's always funny instead of just calling me Ben.

3419
03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:52,080
But also, I hate it when people...

3420
03:20:52,080 --> 03:20:55,080
When it's someone that I don't know and they call me Ben on Twitter,

3421
03:20:55,080 --> 03:20:59,080
I hate them and I know that they're just doing it to upset me

3422
03:20:59,080 --> 03:21:03,080
and it works every single time because of how disturbing and distressing it is.

3423
03:21:03,080 --> 03:21:07,080
I know that the only reason to address a complete stranger by their name online

3424
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:12,080
is to unnerve and disquiet them and get them off balance

3425
03:21:12,080 --> 03:21:14,080
and it always works.

3426
03:21:14,080 --> 03:21:17,080
What was I talking about?

3427
03:21:17,080 --> 03:21:21,080
Just funny when people call me Ben Saint when they say the whole name.

3428
03:21:21,080 --> 03:21:23,080
That's very funny to me.

3429
03:21:24,080 --> 03:21:31,080
Anyway, the next one is called Nate 2.0 and it's an image.

3430
03:21:31,080 --> 03:21:33,080
Let's look at it.

3431
03:21:33,080 --> 03:21:37,080
It's an AI-generated anime version of that one picture,

3432
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:40,080
which is not that bad, honestly.

3433
03:21:40,080 --> 03:21:42,080
Well, this looks like...

3434
03:21:42,080 --> 03:21:45,080
Yeah, this is when you put an image through the thing

3435
03:21:45,080 --> 03:21:49,080
and it just makes it into an anime.

3436
03:21:49,080 --> 03:21:52,080
I mean, it doesn't... I feel like it didn't change that much.

3437
03:21:52,080 --> 03:21:54,080
No, but that's the impressive part.

3438
03:21:54,080 --> 03:22:00,080
Usually they'd get confused because he was wearing two sets of sunglasses

3439
03:22:00,080 --> 03:22:04,080
and they realized they were two sets of sunglasses.

3440
03:22:04,080 --> 03:22:07,080
Yeah, that would throw off an AI. You're right.

3441
03:22:07,080 --> 03:22:10,080
I am surprised that it didn't fuck it up.

3442
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:12,080
Yeah, it looks good.

3443
03:22:12,080 --> 03:22:16,080
I mean, he's got like vampire teeth, you know.

3444
03:22:16,080 --> 03:22:19,080
He's a girl mouth. He's a chronic girl mouth here.

3445
03:22:19,080 --> 03:22:21,080
Yeah, blushing too much.

3446
03:22:21,080 --> 03:22:25,080
Blushing too much. She's got big pucker-y, big pucker lips.

3447
03:22:25,080 --> 03:22:29,080
He's doing a...

3448
03:22:29,080 --> 03:22:32,080
He's doing a gentle mommy-dom face.

3449
03:22:32,080 --> 03:22:35,080
I don't know.

3450
03:22:35,080 --> 03:22:36,080
I looked at some...

3451
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:38,080
There's this Twitter artist that does what I would call

3452
03:22:38,080 --> 03:22:40,080
gentle mommy-dom.

3453
03:22:40,080 --> 03:22:42,080
And you know, you would think that I would be into it,

3454
03:22:42,080 --> 03:22:43,080
but I'm kind of not.

3455
03:22:43,080 --> 03:22:46,080
I don't like the face. I don't like the face that they make.

3456
03:22:46,080 --> 03:22:50,080
When they look down at you and they squint and they grin a little bit

3457
03:22:50,080 --> 03:22:53,080
in like a slightly sadistic way, that's the gentle mommy-dom face.

3458
03:22:53,080 --> 03:22:57,080
And frankly, I'm not about it. I don't like it.

3459
03:22:57,080 --> 03:22:59,080
I don't like that face.

3460
03:22:59,080 --> 03:23:00,080
Stop looking at me.

3461
03:23:00,080 --> 03:23:03,080
I don't know exactly what you mean, but I have a feeling.

3462
03:23:03,080 --> 03:23:05,080
The shit. I wonder if I just...

3463
03:23:05,080 --> 03:23:08,080
It's just sort of like, haha, you're my little pet.

3464
03:23:08,080 --> 03:23:10,080
And it's like, yeah, you're just a drawing.

3465
03:23:10,080 --> 03:23:14,080
That doesn't make sense. I don't feel it.

3466
03:23:14,080 --> 03:23:17,080
Yeah, it's not quite the vibe.

3467
03:23:17,080 --> 03:23:19,080
It's not quite the vibe.

3468
03:23:19,080 --> 03:23:23,080
But I... Ah, shit, I would show you the artist I'm talking about,

3469
03:23:23,080 --> 03:23:27,080
but I can't remember their name.

3470
03:23:27,080 --> 03:23:30,080
Google gentle mommy-dom.

3471
03:23:30,080 --> 03:23:33,080
I think there's like a...

3472
03:23:33,080 --> 03:23:36,080
You know the GF meme where like they have the GF in the middle

3473
03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:39,080
and then a bunch of traits and quotes just like floating in a cloud around them?

3474
03:23:39,080 --> 03:23:40,080
Yeah, yeah.

3475
03:23:40,080 --> 03:23:43,080
There's one that's like gentle mommy-dom GF and she was making...

3476
03:23:43,080 --> 03:23:45,080
It wasn't that same artist, but it was that face.

3477
03:23:45,080 --> 03:23:48,080
And that's why I call it that.

3478
03:23:50,080 --> 03:23:52,080
You know what? I don't need to show you.

3479
03:23:52,080 --> 03:23:54,080
I think you understand.

3480
03:23:54,080 --> 03:23:55,080
Yeah, basically.

3481
03:23:55,080 --> 03:23:56,080
I'm talking about.

3482
03:23:56,080 --> 03:24:03,080
Okay, next one is called Ben Wormd 321 Go.

3483
03:24:03,080 --> 03:24:09,080
Okay, so like next up, the next thing we got to look at here is a little funny little guy,

3484
03:24:09,080 --> 03:24:14,080
a little fucking squirt bouncing on my knee, the baby boy, a bird even,

3485
03:24:14,080 --> 03:24:21,080
cawing and clawing for his mother's worms, her wormly gift from above.

3486
03:24:21,080 --> 03:24:23,080
The saint, this Ben's saint.

3487
03:24:23,080 --> 03:24:25,080
Ben, I think I'm saying that right.

3488
03:24:25,080 --> 03:24:31,080
This Ben, this communist Ben, this Mr. 48 socialism per second Sam over here.

3489
03:24:31,080 --> 03:24:33,080
What a funny little guy he is.

3490
03:24:33,080 --> 03:24:34,080
I hope he's here.

3491
03:24:34,080 --> 03:24:40,080
I hope he's listening in right now to what I have to say to him because I got to tell you, Ben,

3492
03:24:40,080 --> 03:24:43,080
I got to tell you, I'm going to do it.

3493
03:24:43,080 --> 03:24:45,080
I'll give you what you want.

3494
03:24:45,080 --> 03:24:47,080
I'll give you exactly what you want, Ben.

3495
03:24:47,080 --> 03:24:49,080
I'm going to give you a worm.

3496
03:24:49,080 --> 03:24:51,080
Hungry for words.

3497
03:24:51,080 --> 03:24:55,080
No, hungry for worms.

3498
03:24:58,080 --> 03:25:00,080
What is this voice?

3499
03:25:00,080 --> 03:25:01,080
I don't know what this voice is.

3500
03:25:01,080 --> 03:25:06,080
Is it another AI of like a famous radio guy or a podcaster?

3501
03:25:06,080 --> 03:25:07,080
I think so.

3502
03:25:07,080 --> 03:25:12,080
I think it sounds a little familiar, but I don't exactly.

3503
03:25:12,080 --> 03:25:14,080
I don't know what it is.

3504
03:25:14,080 --> 03:25:16,080
It sounds like something.

3505
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:18,080
I think I've heard it.

3506
03:25:18,080 --> 03:25:20,080
Freakin' somewhere.

3507
03:25:20,080 --> 03:25:23,080
It might be a radio personality.

3508
03:25:23,080 --> 03:25:24,080
All right.

3509
03:25:24,080 --> 03:25:26,080
The next one is...

3510
03:25:26,080 --> 03:25:27,080
Ah!

3511
03:25:27,080 --> 03:25:28,080
Oh, God.

3512
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:29,080
Okay.

3513
03:25:29,080 --> 03:25:31,080
Next one is a vocabruelink.

3514
03:25:31,080 --> 03:25:33,080
Uh...

3515
03:25:33,080 --> 03:25:34,080
Duh.

3516
03:25:34,080 --> 03:25:35,080
Wait a second.

3517
03:25:35,080 --> 03:25:36,080
Okay.

3518
03:25:36,080 --> 03:25:38,080
Three, two, one, go.

3519
03:25:38,080 --> 03:25:40,080
I'm shivering, shivering.

3520
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:43,080
The flames from my balls run down the soles of my hairy feet.

3521
03:25:43,080 --> 03:25:46,080
Throw me a hard cock and I will drink all your cum.

3522
03:25:46,080 --> 03:25:49,080
I want to hear you call me a cum dump slut.

3523
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:53,080
I want to hear you call me a cum dump while you're pissing in my face.

3524
03:25:53,080 --> 03:25:54,080
Slut?

3525
03:25:54,080 --> 03:25:55,080
Clown slut?

3526
03:25:55,080 --> 03:25:59,080
I'm not some clown sex training dream eater that you never use.

3527
03:25:59,080 --> 03:26:00,080
I'm your bitch.

3528
03:26:00,080 --> 03:26:03,080
I'm your ballsucking sexcapade.

3529
03:26:03,080 --> 03:26:05,080
I have a junk that can't be contained.

3530
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:08,080
Now piss on me and make me give you your first shitting ever.

3531
03:26:08,080 --> 03:26:11,080
Welcome to Clownville.

3532
03:26:11,080 --> 03:26:13,080
My first shitting ever.

3533
03:26:13,080 --> 03:26:15,080
Oh, no.

3534
03:26:15,080 --> 03:26:17,080
Hooray.

3535
03:26:17,080 --> 03:26:18,080
I'm intimidated.

3536
03:26:18,080 --> 03:26:24,080
That was a music, that was a music god from the voicemailer types chart.

3537
03:26:24,080 --> 03:26:25,080
Yeah.

3538
03:26:25,080 --> 03:26:29,080
The voicemailer type chart had a little baby with putts and pans.

3539
03:26:29,080 --> 03:26:30,080
It sounded like that.

3540
03:26:30,080 --> 03:26:32,080
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

3541
03:26:32,080 --> 03:26:33,080
Perfect.

3542
03:26:33,080 --> 03:26:36,080
That's prescient even.

3543
03:26:36,080 --> 03:26:37,080
Good.

3544
03:26:37,080 --> 03:26:40,080
Next one is an image, let's...

3545
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:42,080
With a voicemail.

3546
03:26:42,080 --> 03:26:43,080
This voice.

3547
03:26:43,080 --> 03:26:46,080
Oh.

3548
03:26:46,080 --> 03:26:47,080
Oh, right.

3549
03:26:47,080 --> 03:26:48,080
This was from...

3550
03:26:48,080 --> 03:26:50,080
All right, let's listen to the voicemail.

3551
03:26:50,080 --> 03:26:51,080
Three, two, one, go.

3552
03:26:51,080 --> 03:26:52,080
Oh, god.

3553
03:26:52,080 --> 03:26:53,080
Oh, god.

3554
03:26:53,080 --> 03:26:56,080
I can't believe we're still stuck in this era, Ben, for fuck's sake.

3555
03:26:56,080 --> 03:26:57,080
Like, how long has it been?

3556
03:26:57,080 --> 03:27:00,080
How long has it actually been since Trixie was last on the PCP?

3557
03:27:00,080 --> 03:27:03,080
I'm pretty sure, like, it's got to be almost two years at this point.

3558
03:27:03,080 --> 03:27:04,080
Just let her go, man.

3559
03:27:04,080 --> 03:27:05,080
We're sick of hearing about her.

3560
03:27:05,080 --> 03:27:08,080
Move the fuck on, suck my ding dong.

3561
03:27:08,080 --> 03:27:09,080
We get it.

3562
03:27:09,080 --> 03:27:10,080
She's dumb.

3563
03:27:10,080 --> 03:27:11,080
We all know she's dumb.

3564
03:27:11,080 --> 03:27:12,080
Like, come on, man.

3565
03:27:12,080 --> 03:27:13,080
Just come on.

3566
03:27:13,080 --> 03:27:14,080
Move on already.

3567
03:27:14,080 --> 03:27:15,080
I'm done hearing about this.

3568
03:27:15,080 --> 03:27:16,080
It's not healthy for you.

3569
03:27:16,080 --> 03:27:17,080
It's not healthy for her.

3570
03:27:17,080 --> 03:27:18,080
Just let it go.

3571
03:27:18,080 --> 03:27:19,080
I see you agree she's dumb.

3572
03:27:19,080 --> 03:27:20,080
I see you agree she's dumb.

3573
03:27:20,080 --> 03:27:21,080
I'm sorry.

3574
03:27:21,080 --> 03:27:22,080
I'm sorry.

3575
03:27:22,080 --> 03:27:25,080
I think it's cool to point and laugh when people say dumb things.

3576
03:27:25,080 --> 03:27:27,080
There's another AI.

3577
03:27:27,080 --> 03:27:29,080
I don't think that was an AI.

3578
03:27:29,080 --> 03:27:30,080
Yeah, that sounded like a quote.

3579
03:27:30,080 --> 03:27:32,080
No, listen to it again.

3580
03:27:32,080 --> 03:27:34,080
I mean, the beginning was very convincing.

3581
03:27:34,080 --> 03:27:35,080
Wait, really?

3582
03:27:35,080 --> 03:27:37,080
Yeah, listen to it again.

3583
03:27:37,080 --> 03:27:41,080
There's a little bit of a fuzziness to some of the syllables.

3584
03:27:41,080 --> 03:27:42,080
And it's like, oh.

3585
03:27:42,080 --> 03:27:43,080
Oh, God.

3586
03:27:43,080 --> 03:27:44,080
Oh, God.

3587
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:45,080
I can't believe we're still stuck in this era, Ben.

3588
03:27:45,080 --> 03:27:46,080
For fuck's sake.

3589
03:27:46,080 --> 03:27:48,080
Like, how long has it been?

3590
03:27:48,080 --> 03:27:51,080
How long has it actually been since Trixie was last on the PCP?

3591
03:27:51,080 --> 03:27:54,080
I'm pretty sure, like, it's got to be almost two years at this point.

3592
03:27:54,080 --> 03:27:55,080
Just let her go, man.

3593
03:27:55,080 --> 03:27:56,080
We're sick of hearing about her.

3594
03:27:56,080 --> 03:27:58,080
Move the fuck on, suck my ding dong.

3595
03:27:58,080 --> 03:27:59,080
We get it.

3596
03:27:59,080 --> 03:28:00,080
She's dumb.

3597
03:28:00,080 --> 03:28:01,080
We all know she's dumb.

3598
03:28:01,080 --> 03:28:02,080
Like, come on, man.

3599
03:28:02,080 --> 03:28:03,080
Just come on.

3600
03:28:03,080 --> 03:28:04,080
Move on already.

3601
03:28:04,080 --> 03:28:05,080
I'm done hearing about this.

3602
03:28:05,080 --> 03:28:06,080
It's not healthy for you.

3603
03:28:06,080 --> 03:28:07,080
It's at least partially for her.

3604
03:28:07,080 --> 03:28:08,080
Just let it go.

3605
03:28:08,080 --> 03:28:10,080
I don't know what this would be ripped from.

3606
03:28:10,080 --> 03:28:12,080
Did Nate make a podcast?

3607
03:28:12,080 --> 03:28:13,080
I have never heard.

3608
03:28:13,080 --> 03:28:15,080
A BGE monthly cast recently?

3609
03:28:15,080 --> 03:28:18,080
You know, I have never heard.

3610
03:28:18,080 --> 03:28:22,080
I've never heard Nate refer to her as Trixie.

3611
03:28:22,080 --> 03:28:23,080
He always says Digi.

3612
03:28:23,080 --> 03:28:25,080
There's another tell.

3613
03:28:25,080 --> 03:28:27,080
Yeah, I don't know.

3614
03:28:27,080 --> 03:28:30,080
Okay, I'm not sure, actually.

3615
03:28:30,080 --> 03:28:34,080
It sounds like very convincing, but I guess I don't know for sure.

3616
03:28:34,080 --> 03:28:36,080
It might be spliced.

3617
03:28:36,080 --> 03:28:41,080
I kind of hope it's not real because it kind of makes me sad if Nate is calling me Nate

3618
03:28:41,080 --> 03:28:43,080
on the stream.

3619
03:28:43,080 --> 03:28:45,080
Does he stream?

3620
03:28:45,080 --> 03:28:47,080
What was the last thing he made?

3621
03:28:47,080 --> 03:28:51,080
Well, doesn't he do talking pirate?

3622
03:28:51,080 --> 03:28:53,080
Doesn't he stream on Twitch and stuff?

3623
03:28:53,080 --> 03:28:55,080
Oh, yeah, I guess so.

3624
03:28:55,080 --> 03:29:01,080
I guess I don't pay attention to that.

3625
03:29:01,080 --> 03:29:02,080
Well, I don't know.

3626
03:29:02,080 --> 03:29:05,080
It sounds real to me, but it's hard to be sure.

3627
03:29:05,080 --> 03:29:06,080
Okay.

3628
03:29:06,080 --> 03:29:14,080
I'm like 90% sure that that is a fake clip.

3629
03:29:14,080 --> 03:29:17,080
Now I'm not sure what to think.

3630
03:29:17,080 --> 03:29:22,080
But anyway, yeah, the screenshot is me just pointing out this thing.

3631
03:29:22,080 --> 03:29:27,080
This thing that the Trixie said, stupid.

3632
03:29:27,080 --> 03:29:33,080
I'm just reminding everyone that the Trixie's political beliefs are incoherent and fucking

3633
03:29:33,080 --> 03:29:34,080
stupid.

3634
03:29:34,080 --> 03:29:40,080
Okay, next one is...

3635
03:29:40,080 --> 03:29:42,080
How do I find out if it's really not?

3636
03:29:42,080 --> 03:29:43,080
How do I know?

3637
03:29:43,080 --> 03:29:44,080
How will I determine that?

3638
03:29:44,080 --> 03:29:46,080
Put some headphones on and listen to it real close.

3639
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:48,080
I can hear some stuff in there.

3640
03:29:48,080 --> 03:29:50,080
I have headphones on.

3641
03:29:50,080 --> 03:29:52,080
I have headphones on.

3642
03:29:52,080 --> 03:29:54,080
And I can't hear a damn thing.

3643
03:29:54,080 --> 03:29:56,080
I can't hear a damn thing.

3644
03:29:56,080 --> 03:29:58,080
I don't know.

3645
03:29:58,080 --> 03:29:59,080
All right.

3646
03:29:59,080 --> 03:30:00,080
You want to do the next one?

3647
03:30:00,080 --> 03:30:01,080
It's called Anti-Semitic Ben.

3648
03:30:01,080 --> 03:30:03,080
Let's listen to the voicemail first.

3649
03:30:03,080 --> 03:30:06,080
Three, two, one, go.

3650
03:30:06,080 --> 03:30:09,080
So, Ben, you hate Jacob Geller.

3651
03:30:09,080 --> 03:30:11,080
Is it because he's Jewish?

3652
03:30:11,080 --> 03:30:13,080
It is because he's Jewish, right?

3653
03:30:13,080 --> 03:30:14,080
It's okay.

3654
03:30:14,080 --> 03:30:16,080
You can say it.

3655
03:30:16,080 --> 03:30:19,080
Or is it because of his luscious lump?

3656
03:30:19,080 --> 03:30:22,080
He's somewhat unsettling, soft, honestly kind of weird,

3657
03:30:22,080 --> 03:30:24,080
sensuous lips.

3658
03:30:24,080 --> 03:30:27,080
He does have those puffy, hussy lips.

3659
03:30:27,080 --> 03:30:29,080
He really does.

3660
03:30:29,080 --> 03:30:31,080
That's the picture of them.

3661
03:30:31,080 --> 03:30:33,080
Oh, yeah.

3662
03:30:33,080 --> 03:30:34,080
His beard...

3663
03:30:34,080 --> 03:30:35,080
You know what?

3664
03:30:35,080 --> 03:30:36,080
His beard is too neat.

3665
03:30:36,080 --> 03:30:37,080
His beard is too neat.

3666
03:30:37,080 --> 03:30:38,080
I don't like it.

3667
03:30:38,080 --> 03:30:40,080
Don't like his lips.

3668
03:30:40,080 --> 03:30:42,080
Don't like his puffy lips.

3669
03:30:42,080 --> 03:30:44,080
Yeah, I don't like him because he's Jewish.

3670
03:30:44,080 --> 03:30:45,080
Yeah.

3671
03:30:45,080 --> 03:30:46,080
Uh-oh.

3672
03:30:46,080 --> 03:30:48,080
You know what?

3673
03:30:48,080 --> 03:30:49,080
Thinking about it.

3674
03:30:49,080 --> 03:30:52,080
That's probably what it boils down to.

3675
03:30:52,080 --> 03:30:55,080
Next one is called...

3676
03:30:55,080 --> 03:30:56,080
It's an imager.

3677
03:30:56,080 --> 03:30:57,080
An imager.

3678
03:30:57,080 --> 03:30:59,080
An imager.

3679
03:30:59,080 --> 03:31:01,080
Let's look.

3680
03:31:01,080 --> 03:31:07,080
It's Pinkie Pie.

3681
03:31:07,080 --> 03:31:09,080
Spirit cooking general.

3682
03:31:09,080 --> 03:31:12,080
Evil enchantress does evil dances.

3683
03:31:12,080 --> 03:31:16,080
I wonder why the liberal media isn't reporting on this.

3684
03:31:16,080 --> 03:31:20,080
This is for emissive cancer law.

3685
03:31:20,080 --> 03:31:22,080
Oh, no.

3686
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:24,080
Pinkie, what are you...

3687
03:31:24,080 --> 03:31:26,080
Pinkie, what are you looking at?

3688
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:28,080
Pinkie, I see you look non-plus.

3689
03:31:28,080 --> 03:31:29,080
Just close the tab.

3690
03:31:29,080 --> 03:31:30,080
It's not worth it.

3691
03:31:30,080 --> 03:31:31,080
It's not worth it.

3692
03:31:31,080 --> 03:31:35,080
No, this is canon because she does say she's an evil entrant.

3693
03:31:35,080 --> 03:31:37,080
She does evil dances.

3694
03:31:37,080 --> 03:31:38,080
She says those words.

3695
03:31:38,080 --> 03:31:41,080
She was influenced by...

3696
03:31:41,080 --> 03:31:42,080
I can't see what the...

3697
03:31:42,080 --> 03:31:43,080
Wait a minute.

3698
03:31:43,080 --> 03:31:44,080
The website's called...

3699
03:31:44,080 --> 03:31:47,080
Is this where she got that?

3700
03:31:47,080 --> 03:31:49,080
This is how she wrote that song.

3701
03:31:49,080 --> 03:31:54,080
It's because she read about Zecora doing evil dances.

3702
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:56,080
Maybe.

3703
03:31:56,080 --> 03:31:59,080
She's just looking blankly.

3704
03:31:59,080 --> 03:32:01,080
Spirit cooking general.

3705
03:32:01,080 --> 03:32:03,080
This is where she learned it.

3706
03:32:03,080 --> 03:32:05,080
This is where she learned to hate.

3707
03:32:05,080 --> 03:32:06,080
No, Pinkie.

3708
03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:08,080
She learned to hate.

3709
03:32:08,080 --> 03:32:12,080
But Pinkie, your grandma said to giggle at the ghosties.

3710
03:32:13,080 --> 03:32:19,080
But then Slash Pole said evil enchantress does evil dances.

3711
03:32:19,080 --> 03:32:21,080
Makes you think.

3712
03:32:21,080 --> 03:32:22,080
A lot about society.

3713
03:32:22,080 --> 03:32:25,080
It says...

3714
03:32:25,080 --> 03:32:26,080
Okay, next one is called...

3715
03:32:26,080 --> 03:32:28,080
Oh, God.

3716
03:32:28,080 --> 03:32:33,080
Men.wikifeet.com slash Ben.

3717
03:32:33,080 --> 03:32:35,080
Ben, real last name.

3718
03:32:35,080 --> 03:32:36,080
Okay.

3719
03:32:36,080 --> 03:32:39,080
Well, I mean, it's Ben real last name.

3720
03:32:39,080 --> 03:32:42,080
And it's freaking pictures of me at Radcon.

3721
03:32:42,080 --> 03:32:45,080
Ratings 3.3 out of 5.

3722
03:32:45,080 --> 03:32:47,080
I mean, sorry.

3723
03:32:47,080 --> 03:32:50,080
Sorry, my feet aren't better for you.

3724
03:32:50,080 --> 03:32:52,080
Freaking homos.

3725
03:32:52,080 --> 03:32:58,080
I got one 5-star review, two 3-star reviews, and one 1-star review.

3726
03:32:58,080 --> 03:33:01,080
So yeah, yes, the math checks out.

3727
03:33:01,080 --> 03:33:04,080
It does average out to 3.

3728
03:33:04,080 --> 03:33:05,080
This is just from one video.

3729
03:33:05,080 --> 03:33:09,080
This is like from a live stream of Radcon 3?

3730
03:33:09,080 --> 03:33:12,080
This is Radcon 4 because I have the hair.

3731
03:33:12,080 --> 03:33:14,080
Oh, that's right.

3732
03:33:14,080 --> 03:33:18,080
Yeah, this is Radcon 4.

3733
03:33:18,080 --> 03:33:21,080
Man.

3734
03:33:21,080 --> 03:33:23,080
Those were the days.

3735
03:33:23,080 --> 03:33:24,080
I was looking so...

3736
03:33:24,080 --> 03:33:29,080
I was looking so fresh, so young, so full of potential.

3737
03:33:29,080 --> 03:33:30,080
Not anymore.

3738
03:33:30,080 --> 03:33:33,080
Those days are behind me now.

3739
03:33:33,080 --> 03:33:36,080
Indeed, yes, truly.

3740
03:33:36,080 --> 03:33:37,080
Haha.

3741
03:33:37,080 --> 03:33:39,080
Anyway.

3742
03:33:39,080 --> 03:33:44,080
Okay, thanks for the link to my wiki, I guess.

3743
03:33:44,080 --> 03:33:46,080
Oh, I know this one.

3744
03:33:46,080 --> 03:33:51,080
This link to Franken by Splendidland.

3745
03:33:51,080 --> 03:33:53,080
Are you familiar?

3746
03:33:53,080 --> 03:33:56,080
I feel like I've seen this before, but I haven't played it.

3747
03:33:56,080 --> 03:34:03,080
Dunkey did review it, but I know Splendidland from other things.

3748
03:34:03,080 --> 03:34:10,080
Splendidland is one of those people that is just so talented that it makes me want to commit suicide

3749
03:34:10,080 --> 03:34:15,080
because I'll just never accomplish anything, you know?

3750
03:34:15,080 --> 03:34:17,080
Oh, yeah, I know.

3751
03:34:17,080 --> 03:34:18,080
Oh, yeah.

3752
03:34:18,080 --> 03:34:20,080
Yeah, that's Splendidland.

3753
03:34:20,080 --> 03:34:21,080
It's fucking over.

3754
03:34:21,080 --> 03:34:26,080
I see Splendidland and I'm just like, it's over, it's over.

3755
03:34:26,080 --> 03:34:30,080
These are cute little guys.

3756
03:34:30,080 --> 03:34:31,080
It's a good...

3757
03:34:31,080 --> 03:34:39,080
I watched the Dunkey video of it and it seems like it's a funny, cool, well put together little game.

3758
03:34:39,080 --> 03:34:42,080
Link 30 minutes to an hour.

3759
03:34:42,080 --> 03:34:43,080
Yeah.

3760
03:34:43,080 --> 03:34:45,080
I could spend an hour.

3761
03:34:45,080 --> 03:34:48,080
The Dunkey video was like five minutes long.

3762
03:34:48,080 --> 03:34:50,080
Yeah, short game.

3763
03:34:50,080 --> 03:34:51,080
Short game.

3764
03:34:51,080 --> 03:34:52,080
Looks cool.

3765
03:34:52,080 --> 03:34:54,080
Hey, remember Big Mode or whatever the fuck?

3766
03:34:54,080 --> 03:34:55,080
Yeah.

3767
03:34:55,080 --> 03:34:56,080
That was?

3768
03:34:56,080 --> 03:34:57,080
Yeah.

3769
03:34:57,080 --> 03:34:59,080
What's going on with that?

3770
03:34:59,080 --> 03:35:01,080
Big Mode.

3771
03:35:01,080 --> 03:35:03,080
Big Mode.

3772
03:35:03,080 --> 03:35:05,080
Let's see.

3773
03:35:05,080 --> 03:35:08,080
I never got an email back saying, fuck you and your stupid pumpkin alley game.

3774
03:35:08,080 --> 03:35:09,080
Oh, did you submit?

3775
03:35:09,080 --> 03:35:11,080
I didn't submit anything.

3776
03:35:11,080 --> 03:35:12,080
I did.

3777
03:35:12,080 --> 03:35:14,080
It felt like it was worth a shot, you know?

3778
03:35:14,080 --> 03:35:15,080
Why not?

3779
03:35:15,080 --> 03:35:17,080
First, our first game announcement.

3780
03:35:17,080 --> 03:35:19,080
We're excited to share our first game announcement.

3781
03:35:19,080 --> 03:35:22,080
Take a look at this dense and atmospheric open well game.

3782
03:35:22,080 --> 03:35:26,080
And remember to wishlist animal well.

3783
03:35:26,080 --> 03:35:28,080
Hmm.

3784
03:35:28,080 --> 03:35:29,080
Looks nice.

3785
03:35:29,080 --> 03:35:31,080
You looking at it?

3786
03:35:31,080 --> 03:35:33,080
Yeah, it's sprites.

3787
03:35:33,080 --> 03:35:34,080
Sprite work.

3788
03:35:34,080 --> 03:35:35,080
A very good...

3789
03:35:35,080 --> 03:35:37,080
Pixelated wonder, rendered in intricate audio and visual detail.

3790
03:35:37,080 --> 03:35:43,080
Hatch from your flower and spelunk through the beautiful and sometimes haunting world of animal well encounter.

3791
03:35:43,080 --> 03:35:49,080
Lively creatures, small and large, helpful and ominous as you discover unconventional upgrades and unravel the well's secrets.

3792
03:35:49,080 --> 03:35:55,080
This is a truly unique experience that can make you laugh in fear, surprise or delight.

3793
03:35:55,080 --> 03:35:57,080
What?

3794
03:35:57,080 --> 03:35:58,080
Hmm.

3795
03:35:58,080 --> 03:36:01,080
Laugh in fear.

3796
03:36:01,080 --> 03:36:03,080
Weird.

3797
03:36:03,080 --> 03:36:04,080
Oh, you can click on...

3798
03:36:04,080 --> 03:36:11,080
Down at the bottom, you can like click on the little statues and their little lights turn red.

3799
03:36:11,080 --> 03:36:12,080
Okay.

3800
03:36:12,080 --> 03:36:14,080
I think you just hover over them.

3801
03:36:14,080 --> 03:36:15,080
Oh, no.

3802
03:36:15,080 --> 03:36:17,080
They do go red.

3803
03:36:17,080 --> 03:36:18,080
Okay, so you...

3804
03:36:18,080 --> 03:36:20,080
Okay, so it's like a platformer.

3805
03:36:20,080 --> 03:36:23,080
You jump around and do platforming.

3806
03:36:23,080 --> 03:36:24,080
Ooh.

3807
03:36:24,080 --> 03:36:26,080
Hey.

3808
03:36:26,080 --> 03:36:28,080
This reminds me of...

3809
03:36:28,080 --> 03:36:29,080
What's that?

3810
03:36:29,080 --> 03:36:31,080
Rain world?

3811
03:36:31,080 --> 03:36:35,080
Oh, if you click the towers in the right order, you get a secret.

3812
03:36:35,080 --> 03:36:37,080
No fucking way.

3813
03:36:37,080 --> 03:36:38,080
Okay.

3814
03:36:38,080 --> 03:36:43,080
But if I move my mouse to a different tower, the first one goes out.

3815
03:36:43,080 --> 03:36:45,080
Nah, there's a...

3816
03:36:45,080 --> 03:36:54,080
If you get it right, if you get it red, that means it's wrong, but if it's green or if it's white, I think it stays.

3817
03:36:54,080 --> 03:36:55,080
But they all...

3818
03:36:55,080 --> 03:36:58,080
Oh, oh, oh.

3819
03:36:58,080 --> 03:37:03,080
Okay, so it's seahorse, ostrich, frog, wolf.

3820
03:37:03,080 --> 03:37:04,080
Oh my god.

3821
03:37:04,080 --> 03:37:06,080
Holy shit.

3822
03:37:07,080 --> 03:37:09,080
There's a little rabbit.

3823
03:37:09,080 --> 03:37:10,080
There's a little rabbit down there.

3824
03:37:10,080 --> 03:37:11,080
Holy shit.

3825
03:37:11,080 --> 03:37:14,080
This actually looks really cool.

3826
03:37:14,080 --> 03:37:15,080
I don't know if it'll be a good game.

3827
03:37:15,080 --> 03:37:17,080
It might be a good game.

3828
03:37:17,080 --> 03:37:18,080
Might be a good game?

3829
03:37:18,080 --> 03:37:19,080
Might be a good game.

3830
03:37:19,080 --> 03:37:20,080
Okay, hey.

3831
03:37:20,080 --> 03:37:21,080
I had forgotten about big mode.

3832
03:37:21,080 --> 03:37:22,080
Well, they're making a game.

3833
03:37:22,080 --> 03:37:24,080
Well, they're making a freaking game.

3834
03:37:24,080 --> 03:37:30,080
Well, they're not making a game, but the person is making a game and they're saying, oh, look at this.

3835
03:37:30,080 --> 03:37:33,080
I assume there's funding involved.

3836
03:37:33,080 --> 03:37:35,080
That's the idea of big mode, but...

3837
03:37:35,080 --> 03:37:39,080
Yeah, I would assume.

3838
03:37:39,080 --> 03:37:50,080
Well, okay, they're making one game, which is, you know, better than zero games, so it's interesting.

3839
03:37:50,080 --> 03:37:52,080
Okay, they're doing it.

3840
03:37:52,080 --> 03:37:58,080
I would have appreciated an email saying this sucks, go away, but they'd never got back to me, so I don't know.

3841
03:37:58,080 --> 03:38:04,080
Maybe I'm on a very, very, very long list of maybe we'll look at this.

3842
03:38:04,080 --> 03:38:06,080
It should be.

3843
03:38:06,080 --> 03:38:09,080
Maybe you should keep sending them emails.

3844
03:38:09,080 --> 03:38:10,080
Perhaps.

3845
03:38:10,080 --> 03:38:11,080
I don't know.

3846
03:38:11,080 --> 03:38:14,080
I feel like...

3847
03:38:14,080 --> 03:38:18,080
I don't know how this works.

3848
03:38:18,080 --> 03:38:23,080
But, yeah, Franken, Splendidland.

3849
03:38:23,080 --> 03:38:27,080
Did they make any other games?

3850
03:38:27,080 --> 03:38:30,080
I think they put this game out like a year or two ago.

3851
03:38:30,080 --> 03:38:33,080
Oh, did somebody buy my game?

3852
03:38:33,080 --> 03:38:37,080
No, I got to follow. I got to follow on itch.

3853
03:38:37,080 --> 03:38:40,080
Yeah, that's good.

3854
03:38:40,080 --> 03:38:44,080
Okay, next one is called...

3855
03:38:44,080 --> 03:38:45,080
Imager Link.

3856
03:38:45,080 --> 03:38:47,080
It's an Imager album.

3857
03:38:47,080 --> 03:38:51,080
Let's check it out, shall we?

3858
03:38:51,080 --> 03:38:54,080
Munchie fighting for his life right now.

3859
03:38:54,080 --> 03:38:56,080
It's Brock the Investigator.

3860
03:38:56,080 --> 03:38:58,080
Oh, right.

3861
03:38:58,080 --> 03:39:01,080
I think we got to let Investigator go.

3862
03:39:01,080 --> 03:39:04,080
I think we got to let Investigator go.

3863
03:39:04,080 --> 03:39:06,080
Now, I just need to change the name.

3864
03:39:06,080 --> 03:39:09,080
Call him Cock.

3865
03:39:09,080 --> 03:39:10,080
You know what?

3866
03:39:10,080 --> 03:39:12,080
They probably thought, let's call him Croc.

3867
03:39:12,080 --> 03:39:13,080
No, that's dumb.

3868
03:39:13,080 --> 03:39:16,080
Let's change the first letter to B, and it'll be Brock.

3869
03:39:16,080 --> 03:39:17,080
Yeah.

3870
03:39:17,080 --> 03:39:19,080
So it's not a crocodile, it's a brocodile.

3871
03:39:19,080 --> 03:39:21,080
Well, it doesn't make any...

3872
03:39:21,080 --> 03:39:27,080
Frankly, it's insulting that you would think to call an Investigator Croc

3873
03:39:27,080 --> 03:39:29,080
because those are two different animals.

3874
03:39:29,080 --> 03:39:30,080
It's not even...

3875
03:39:30,080 --> 03:39:34,080
Everyone makes the deliberate choice to conflate them.

3876
03:39:34,080 --> 03:39:36,080
Not me.

3877
03:39:36,080 --> 03:39:38,080
I choose...

3878
03:39:38,080 --> 03:39:40,080
I choose kindness.

3879
03:39:40,080 --> 03:39:42,080
Next one is called...

3880
03:39:42,080 --> 03:39:47,080
Scottish Independence from Callum Weaver 98.

3881
03:39:47,080 --> 03:39:52,080
Three, two, one, go.

3882
03:39:52,080 --> 03:39:56,080
Scotland do not want to become independent.

3883
03:39:56,080 --> 03:39:58,080
They had a vote less than 10 years ago.

3884
03:39:58,080 --> 03:40:03,080
A public referendum, and the majority of the Scottish people voted no

3885
03:40:03,080 --> 03:40:06,080
to the question of becoming independent.

3886
03:40:06,080 --> 03:40:10,080
You know, you can't have any of these referendums every year.

3887
03:40:10,080 --> 03:40:13,080
We have to respect the mandate of the Scottish people.

3888
03:40:13,080 --> 03:40:17,080
A recent poll suggests that if there was another referendum,

3889
03:40:17,080 --> 03:40:22,080
they would vote no again, especially after Nicola Sturgeon's

3890
03:40:22,080 --> 03:40:26,080
trying to push through the recent trans-reform bill.

3891
03:40:26,080 --> 03:40:30,080
We have to respect it in popular with the Scottish people.

3892
03:40:30,080 --> 03:40:36,080
So, as for the question of independence, it's a mogus for now.

3893
03:40:36,080 --> 03:40:37,080
It's a mogus.

3894
03:40:37,080 --> 03:40:39,080
It's a mogus.

3895
03:40:39,080 --> 03:40:41,080
I mean...

3896
03:40:41,080 --> 03:40:45,080
Well, that was before Brexit, the last Scottish independence referendum, wasn't it?

3897
03:40:45,080 --> 03:40:46,080
I think Brexit...

3898
03:40:46,080 --> 03:40:48,080
Yeah, 10 years ago.

3899
03:40:48,080 --> 03:40:53,080
That's the argument I've seen, is that the Brexit has changed the situation quite a lot.

3900
03:40:53,080 --> 03:40:59,080
It's likely that people would have changed their opinion on Scottish independence.

3901
03:40:59,080 --> 03:41:00,080
Well, this guy...

3902
03:41:00,080 --> 03:41:01,080
I don't know whether that...

3903
03:41:01,080 --> 03:41:04,080
This guy says that polls indicate that it's still unpopular.

3904
03:41:04,080 --> 03:41:05,080
Oh, polls?

3905
03:41:05,080 --> 03:41:06,080
Okay, I didn't hear that.

3906
03:41:06,080 --> 03:41:10,080
I mean, that might be true.

3907
03:41:10,080 --> 03:41:18,080
I mean, I would be surprised if the trans bills were enough to make Scotland

3908
03:41:18,080 --> 03:41:21,080
actually go like separatists.

3909
03:41:21,080 --> 03:41:24,080
That would be a lot, but...

3910
03:41:24,080 --> 03:41:26,080
That would be cool, though.

3911
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:28,080
Yeah.

3912
03:41:28,080 --> 03:41:33,080
Did anything else happen with that whole situation?

3913
03:41:33,080 --> 03:41:42,080
It got blocked by the British government in an unprecedented use of the government's

3914
03:41:42,080 --> 03:41:47,080
power to block Scottish Parliament's votes on things.

3915
03:41:47,080 --> 03:41:52,080
Scotland usually just makes their decisions about Scottish things, and the UK says, yeah,

3916
03:41:52,080 --> 03:41:57,080
that's fine, but they have the power, if they need it, to shut down the Scottish Parliament

3917
03:41:57,080 --> 03:41:59,080
and say, no, we're in charge.

3918
03:41:59,080 --> 03:42:06,080
And they used that for the first time, I don't know, ever, probably just in a very long time,

3919
03:42:06,080 --> 03:42:08,080
but it was a big thing.

3920
03:42:08,080 --> 03:42:10,080
But then after that, I haven't heard anything.

3921
03:42:10,080 --> 03:42:16,080
I think it's just sort of like the Scottish politicians are looking to set the wheels in

3922
03:42:16,080 --> 03:42:22,080
motion to go to court and sue, like take it to court and figure it out there.

3923
03:42:22,080 --> 03:42:26,080
So there's nothing happening currently, but it's in the works.

3924
03:42:26,080 --> 03:42:28,080
All right, makes sense.

3925
03:42:28,080 --> 03:42:33,080
I guess these things have a lot of moving parts.

3926
03:42:33,080 --> 03:42:39,080
I don't have a lot of faith in humanity with regards to trans rights.

3927
03:42:39,080 --> 03:42:49,080
I think people who are otherwise nice about it don't know what they're voting for if a vote is put to them.

3928
03:42:49,080 --> 03:42:59,080
So even if people can be like pro-trans, they might vote against it in a referendum or some sort of vote on something.

3929
03:42:59,080 --> 03:43:05,080
Because it's veiled in some kind of like, oh, this is for women's rights or whatever.

3930
03:43:05,080 --> 03:43:09,080
This is for women's rights to ban men from bathrooms or whatever.

3931
03:43:09,080 --> 03:43:12,080
Oh, yeah, okay, sure, yeah.

3932
03:43:12,080 --> 03:43:15,080
I don't want people to get harassed in the bathroom.

3933
03:43:15,080 --> 03:43:17,080
Yeah, that's bad.

3934
03:43:17,080 --> 03:43:25,080
It's silly because specifically that stuff, people can already go into the bathroom

3935
03:43:25,080 --> 03:43:28,080
and harass people if they're going to commit a crime.

3936
03:43:28,080 --> 03:43:30,080
It's literally like banning.

3937
03:43:30,080 --> 03:43:33,080
Should we make crime illegal?

3938
03:43:34,080 --> 03:43:38,080
Should we make crime even more illegal?

3939
03:43:38,080 --> 03:43:48,080
It's all hanging off the assumption that a trans woman is inherently likely to be a rapist based on no evidence at all.

3940
03:43:48,080 --> 03:43:52,080
It's entirely, what if the gays are evil?

3941
03:43:52,080 --> 03:43:53,080
We should kill them.

3942
03:43:53,080 --> 03:43:56,080
We should stop them at all costs for no reason.

3943
03:43:56,080 --> 03:43:57,080
On the one hand.

3944
03:43:57,080 --> 03:44:03,080
It's just bigotry bleeding the charge and it's sad that I don't see it getting better soon.

3945
03:44:03,080 --> 03:44:08,080
On the one hand, what if the gays are evil and maybe we should kill them?

3946
03:44:08,080 --> 03:44:11,080
On the other hand, what if they're not?

3947
03:44:11,080 --> 03:44:13,080
I say we meet in the middle on this one.

3948
03:44:13,080 --> 03:44:15,080
I say we compromise.

3949
03:44:15,080 --> 03:44:18,080
We kill half of them.

3950
03:44:18,080 --> 03:44:26,080
Okay, next one is called Dick M from the same email, three, two, one, go.

3951
03:44:26,080 --> 03:44:32,080
So you were ripping on Dick Masterson's new crypto patron alternative?

3952
03:44:32,080 --> 03:44:33,080
Yeah.

3953
03:44:33,080 --> 03:44:36,080
The reason is different from his old project.

3954
03:44:36,080 --> 03:44:49,080
Because he's concerned about credit card providers, payment, you know, flyders, just banning people because him himself has been banned by Visa and Mastercard at some point.

3955
03:44:49,080 --> 03:44:55,080
So it's all good patron banning you, but if the card providers ban you, you're screwed.

3956
03:44:55,080 --> 03:45:04,080
So that's the reason why he is doing this in crypto because apparently he can't be banned from crypto and all that stuff.

3957
03:45:04,080 --> 03:45:05,080
So yeah, that's it.

3958
03:45:05,080 --> 03:45:17,080
I do vaguely remember him being banned from like his system for like getting around patrons, setting up his own thing and then Mastercard and Visa said, you can't do that.

3959
03:45:17,080 --> 03:45:21,080
And they stopped the, blocked him specifically.

3960
03:45:22,080 --> 03:45:25,080
He's blocked from what?

3961
03:45:25,080 --> 03:45:28,080
From using Visa and Mastercard?

3962
03:45:28,080 --> 03:45:30,080
Yeah, the credit card company.

3963
03:45:30,080 --> 03:45:31,080
I don't know.

3964
03:45:31,080 --> 03:45:34,080
Like I haven't heard of stuff like that happening before, but apparently.

3965
03:45:34,080 --> 03:45:35,080
How is that?

3966
03:45:35,080 --> 03:45:36,080
How is that?

3967
03:45:36,080 --> 03:45:37,080
How is that?

3968
03:45:37,080 --> 03:45:38,080
How can that be?

3969
03:45:38,080 --> 03:45:39,080
I don't know.

3970
03:45:39,080 --> 03:45:49,080
I mean, like they control the transaction somehow and they just blocked his account, his person because they deemed him.

3971
03:45:50,080 --> 03:45:54,080
Sus, I don't really know too much about the specifics.

3972
03:45:54,080 --> 03:45:57,080
I just remember him saying that at some point.

3973
03:45:57,080 --> 03:46:00,080
I mean, I've never, ever heard of that happening.

3974
03:46:00,080 --> 03:46:01,080
Who knows?

3975
03:46:01,080 --> 03:46:03,080
Maybe he made it up.

3976
03:46:03,080 --> 03:46:10,080
I don't want to say, I don't want to say that he made it up without the evidence.

3977
03:46:10,080 --> 03:46:12,080
It sounds made up.

3978
03:46:12,080 --> 03:46:14,080
It doesn't sound real.

3979
03:46:14,080 --> 03:46:17,080
But I mean.

3980
03:46:17,080 --> 03:46:24,080
It is kind of odd because it's like Alex Jones doesn't seem to have had a problem with that.

3981
03:46:24,080 --> 03:46:30,080
And he's like a way more of a notorious bad guy figure.

3982
03:46:30,080 --> 03:46:31,080
Okay.

3983
03:46:31,080 --> 03:46:32,080
Yeah.

3984
03:46:32,080 --> 03:46:36,080
Probably if a credit card company could, they would try to block his income.

3985
03:46:36,080 --> 03:46:42,080
You're telling me that Visa and Mastercard won't take Dick Masterson's money?

3986
03:46:42,080 --> 03:46:43,080
Why?

3987
03:46:43,080 --> 03:46:48,080
Why would that happen?

3988
03:46:48,080 --> 03:46:51,080
Because he got canceled.

3989
03:46:51,080 --> 03:46:53,080
I guess.

3990
03:46:53,080 --> 03:46:56,080
He's not that canceled.

3991
03:46:56,080 --> 03:46:57,080
Okay.

3992
03:46:57,080 --> 03:46:58,080
Okay.

3993
03:46:58,080 --> 03:46:59,080
Sounds bizarre.

3994
03:46:59,080 --> 03:47:06,080
I guess if there's more to it that I'm missing, I guess someone's going to have to clue me in.

3995
03:47:06,080 --> 03:47:16,080
I think it may not have been Dick Masterson himself, it's just that making a Patreon alternative

3996
03:47:16,080 --> 03:47:23,080
involves dealing with credit card people and somehow they determined that this project was bad

3997
03:47:23,080 --> 03:47:30,080
and they wouldn't support it, not necessarily him, but I don't know.

3998
03:47:30,080 --> 03:47:31,080
I guess.

3999
03:47:31,080 --> 03:47:32,080
Okay.

4000
03:47:32,080 --> 03:47:34,080
I mean, if that's the thing.

4001
03:47:34,080 --> 03:47:41,080
I mean, first of all, isn't it just a question of whether they'll just...

4002
03:47:41,080 --> 03:47:50,080
I've never heard of a credit card company being like, we simply will not allow payments to this person

4003
03:47:50,080 --> 03:47:52,080
or this business.

4004
03:47:52,080 --> 03:47:55,080
I guess it's not completely impossible.

4005
03:47:55,080 --> 03:47:56,080
Sounds really far-fetched.

4006
03:47:56,080 --> 03:47:57,080
Sounds bizarre.

4007
03:47:57,080 --> 03:48:04,080
Someone clue me in if there's more to it that I don't understand.

4008
03:48:04,080 --> 03:48:06,080
I mean, okay.

4009
03:48:06,080 --> 03:48:08,080
Yeah, I guess.

4010
03:48:08,080 --> 03:48:09,080
Sure.

4011
03:48:09,080 --> 03:48:14,080
I guess if every other financial institution bans you from using their platform, then I

4012
03:48:14,080 --> 03:48:17,080
guess I can't fault you for using crypto.

4013
03:48:17,080 --> 03:48:22,080
Sounds like a really crazy far-fetched scenario that would never happen, but sure.

4014
03:48:22,080 --> 03:48:24,080
Okay.

4015
03:48:24,080 --> 03:48:30,080
The next one is called Nocturne, the Braphog.

4016
03:48:30,080 --> 03:48:31,080
The Braphog.

4017
03:48:31,080 --> 03:48:32,080
Braphog.

4018
03:48:32,080 --> 03:48:33,080
Oh, God.

4019
03:48:33,080 --> 03:48:35,080
Well, let's listen to the voicemail.

4020
03:48:35,080 --> 03:48:37,080
Three, two, one, go.

4021
03:48:37,080 --> 03:48:38,080
Well, well, well.

4022
03:48:38,080 --> 03:48:40,080
If it isn't my arch nemesis.

4023
03:48:40,080 --> 03:48:41,080
Ben Sainte?

4024
03:48:41,080 --> 03:48:43,080
Are you in there, little guy?

4025
03:48:43,080 --> 03:48:44,080
I'll click the image.

4026
03:48:44,080 --> 03:48:45,080
You can read along.

4027
03:48:45,080 --> 03:48:48,080
It's a cute little PCP you have.

4028
03:48:48,080 --> 03:48:51,080
Did your mom make it for you?

4029
03:48:52,080 --> 03:48:54,080
Is this thing on?

4030
03:48:54,080 --> 03:48:55,080
Wow.

4031
03:48:55,080 --> 03:48:56,080
Tough crowd.

4032
03:48:56,080 --> 03:49:01,080
I guess the world is ready for the likes of a real comedian.

4033
03:49:01,080 --> 03:49:03,080
Ben Sainte.

4034
03:49:03,080 --> 03:49:09,080
Perhaps if your IQ was a little high, you wouldn't be such a stinky little boy.

4035
03:49:09,080 --> 03:49:12,080
No, I'll always be a stinky little boy.

4036
03:49:12,080 --> 03:49:15,080
No matter how high my IQ gets.

4037
03:49:15,080 --> 03:49:17,080
What a cutie pie.

4038
03:49:18,080 --> 03:49:19,080
Oh, Ben.

4039
03:49:19,080 --> 03:49:20,080
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

4040
03:49:20,080 --> 03:49:21,080
That's it.

4041
03:49:21,080 --> 03:49:23,080
Well, are you jealous of Ben Sainte?

4042
03:49:23,080 --> 03:49:24,080
A little old Ben.

4043
03:49:24,080 --> 03:49:26,080
Never gets a sniff of his favorite.

4044
03:49:26,080 --> 03:49:27,080
Perhaps.

4045
03:49:27,080 --> 03:49:28,080
Poor little Ben.

4046
03:49:28,080 --> 03:49:29,080
Poor little Ben.

4047
03:49:29,080 --> 03:49:30,080
Poor baby Ben.

4048
03:49:30,080 --> 03:49:31,080
Ben Sainte.

4049
03:49:31,080 --> 03:49:33,080
More like Ben Breast.

4050
03:49:33,080 --> 03:49:34,080
Oh, Bimber Raps.

4051
03:49:34,080 --> 03:49:35,080
Bimber Raps.

4052
03:49:35,080 --> 03:49:39,080
Sniff, sniff.

4053
03:49:39,080 --> 03:49:46,080
The Rappening is among us.

4054
03:49:46,080 --> 03:49:49,080
That was a voice now.

4055
03:49:49,080 --> 03:49:51,080
It was deeply uncomfortable.

4056
03:49:51,080 --> 03:49:53,080
It was deeply uncomfortable.

4057
03:49:53,080 --> 03:49:57,080
I believe this is an oblivion for first.

4058
03:49:57,080 --> 03:50:04,080
Oblivion was fucking around with an AI voice generator and he made an AI voice with his own voice.

4059
03:50:04,080 --> 03:50:11,080
I think this is text to speech of his voice in an AI thing.

4060
03:50:11,080 --> 03:50:14,080
It doesn't sound that much like him.

4061
03:50:14,080 --> 03:50:15,080
I can hear him.

4062
03:50:15,080 --> 03:50:20,080
I can hear him in it.

4063
03:50:20,080 --> 03:50:21,080
Okay.

4064
03:50:21,080 --> 03:50:24,080
The next one is called I'm Sorry Nocturne.

4065
03:50:24,080 --> 03:50:26,080
Three, two, one, go.

4066
03:50:26,080 --> 03:50:27,080
Okay.

4067
03:50:27,080 --> 03:50:30,080
First off, first off, this guy, this Nocturne the Brap Hog guy.

4068
03:50:30,080 --> 03:50:31,080
Look, I'm sorry.

4069
03:50:31,080 --> 03:50:33,080
You can't have any of my Braps.

4070
03:50:33,080 --> 03:50:34,080
I get it.

4071
03:50:34,080 --> 03:50:35,080
You're a nice guy.

4072
03:50:35,080 --> 03:50:40,080
You're a charming fellow and all, but I'm just, I'm just not into you.

4073
03:50:40,080 --> 03:50:41,080
Sorry.

4074
03:50:41,080 --> 03:50:42,080
That's you.

4075
03:50:42,080 --> 03:50:43,080
Yeah.

4076
03:50:43,080 --> 03:50:44,080
I don't like you, but.

4077
03:50:44,080 --> 03:50:49,080
You don't think it's, I'm not, I can tell it's me.

4078
03:50:49,080 --> 03:50:53,080
It sounds more, the Nate one sounded like spot on.

4079
03:50:53,080 --> 03:50:57,080
This one, something sounds a little off and maybe I'm just more sensitive to it because

4080
03:50:57,080 --> 03:51:00,080
it's my own voice, but something's a little off.

4081
03:51:00,080 --> 03:51:01,080
I think something's a little off.

4082
03:51:01,080 --> 03:51:02,080
Okay.

4083
03:51:02,080 --> 03:51:03,080
It's close.

4084
03:51:03,080 --> 03:51:06,080
I can tell that it's me.

4085
03:51:06,080 --> 03:51:11,080
And I would, it's that I would never say that I'm not attracted to Nocturne and that's

4086
03:51:11,080 --> 03:51:12,080
the tell.

4087
03:51:12,080 --> 03:51:15,080
I just, this is out of character.

4088
03:51:15,080 --> 03:51:16,080
Okay.

4089
03:51:16,080 --> 03:51:18,080
Next one is called PS three, two, one go.

4090
03:51:18,080 --> 03:51:26,080
I just wanted, I really just wanted to say that I love, I really, really love cock.

4091
03:51:26,080 --> 03:51:27,080
I love cock.

4092
03:51:27,080 --> 03:51:30,080
I love big wide, big wide black cocks.

4093
03:51:30,080 --> 03:51:35,080
They call me big black Ben back at the ranch, the black ranch owned by black.com.

4094
03:51:35,080 --> 03:51:36,080
Yeah.

4095
03:51:36,080 --> 03:51:37,080
That's me.

4096
03:51:37,080 --> 03:51:38,080
I love cock.

4097
03:51:38,080 --> 03:51:40,080
You know, come give, give, give me all of your cum.

4098
03:51:40,080 --> 03:51:41,080
No.

4099
03:51:41,080 --> 03:51:48,080
You're in Cummy Link ski.

4100
03:51:48,080 --> 03:51:54,080
The text to speech part where they're like making you repeat words and like parts of sentences

4101
03:51:54,080 --> 03:51:57,080
is very accurate.

4102
03:51:57,080 --> 03:51:58,080
Yeah.

4103
03:51:58,080 --> 03:52:04,080
The, the, the, you know, the, the, the fact that so many of these voicemails have been

4104
03:52:04,080 --> 03:52:07,080
text to speech, make me think that maybe that one Nate one was fake.

4105
03:52:07,080 --> 03:52:13,080
It makes more, makes it more likely cause it's, it's amid all these other like, so

4106
03:52:13,080 --> 03:52:17,080
maybe, maybe you were right.

4107
03:52:17,080 --> 03:52:22,080
But that, that, that's, these, these are pretty good.

4108
03:52:22,080 --> 03:52:24,080
These are, these are pretty good.

4109
03:52:24,080 --> 03:52:25,080
All right.

4110
03:52:25,080 --> 03:52:28,080
Is the next one, are we going to get another one?

4111
03:52:28,080 --> 03:52:32,080
They got, I got to download the last one and then I got to download this one.

4112
03:52:32,080 --> 03:52:33,080
Okay.

4113
03:52:34,080 --> 03:52:37,080
Which arc is better?

4114
03:52:37,080 --> 03:52:39,080
Live PCP or dead PCP?

4115
03:52:39,080 --> 03:52:41,080
Which arc is better?

4116
03:52:41,080 --> 03:52:42,080
I don't know.

4117
03:52:42,080 --> 03:52:43,080
You tell me.

4118
03:52:43,080 --> 03:52:47,080
Live arc was an arc downward.

4119
03:52:47,080 --> 03:52:48,080
Dead arc.

4120
03:52:48,080 --> 03:52:56,080
The live arc meaning like, oh, we're like, we're all friends and we're looking at PCPHQ.

4121
03:52:56,080 --> 03:52:57,080
We're all optimistic.

4122
03:52:57,080 --> 03:52:58,080
Yeah.

4123
03:52:58,080 --> 03:53:00,080
I think I, by live arc.

4124
03:53:00,080 --> 03:53:01,080
Yeah.

4125
03:53:01,080 --> 03:53:07,080
I think it means before the change that was heralded by the switch to the graveyard is

4126
03:53:07,080 --> 03:53:10,080
a banner image.

4127
03:53:10,080 --> 03:53:13,080
So to me, that's an arc downward.

4128
03:53:13,080 --> 03:53:16,080
Now we've got nowhere to go but up.

4129
03:53:16,080 --> 03:53:17,080
I guess so.

4130
03:53:17,080 --> 03:53:19,080
Perfect comic party.

4131
03:53:19,080 --> 03:53:24,080
Perfect comic party is an upward trend and also we're still going.

4132
03:53:24,080 --> 03:53:25,080
So, right.

4133
03:53:25,080 --> 03:53:27,080
It's like, there's, there's more quantity.

4134
03:53:27,080 --> 03:53:30,080
There'll be more quantity at some point.

4135
03:53:30,080 --> 03:53:31,080
Yeah.

4136
03:53:31,080 --> 03:53:36,080
Remains, remains to be seen how the, how the dead arc plays out.

4137
03:53:36,080 --> 03:53:37,080
Okay.

4138
03:53:37,080 --> 03:53:41,080
Next one is called 333321 go.

4139
03:53:41,080 --> 03:53:44,080
What country has the best flag?

4140
03:53:44,080 --> 03:53:45,080
The best flag.

4141
03:53:45,080 --> 03:53:47,080
I have a big fan.

4142
03:53:47,080 --> 03:53:51,080
I'm sorry if this is a contrarian take, but I really like the Nepalese flag.

4143
03:53:51,080 --> 03:53:53,080
I think it's cool.

4144
03:53:53,080 --> 03:53:55,080
Nepalese is the triangle one.

4145
03:53:55,080 --> 03:53:57,080
That's the two triangles.

4146
03:53:57,080 --> 03:53:58,080
Yeah.

4147
03:53:58,080 --> 03:53:59,080
It's a funky shape.

4148
03:53:59,080 --> 03:54:00,080
It is.

4149
03:54:00,080 --> 03:54:01,080
It is funky.

4150
03:54:01,080 --> 03:54:02,080
Here.

4151
03:54:02,080 --> 03:54:05,080
I'll, I'll post it in the thing.

4152
03:54:05,080 --> 03:54:06,080
The best.

4153
03:54:06,080 --> 03:54:07,080
Okay.

4154
03:54:07,080 --> 03:54:08,080
You know what?

4155
03:54:08,080 --> 03:54:10,080
I gotta, I gotta say a flag that I hate.

4156
03:54:10,080 --> 03:54:12,080
I think I've complained about it before.

4157
03:54:12,080 --> 03:54:14,080
Worst flag Philippines.

4158
03:54:14,080 --> 03:54:15,080
Dog shit.

4159
03:54:15,080 --> 03:54:18,080
I will set one.

4160
03:54:18,080 --> 03:54:22,080
Who puts yellow, yellow sun on a white field?

4161
03:54:22,080 --> 03:54:24,080
Like, are you fucking kidding me?

4162
03:54:24,080 --> 03:54:25,080
Oh, yeah.

4163
03:54:25,080 --> 03:54:28,080
It looks similar to some other flags, but with a little sun on it.

4164
03:54:28,080 --> 03:54:35,080
The sun, the pale yellow sun on the white frickin, whatever you call that triangle.

4165
03:54:35,080 --> 03:54:37,080
There's a name for that triangle.

4166
03:54:37,080 --> 03:54:40,080
And I, and I forget it.

4167
03:54:40,080 --> 03:54:42,080
It's, it's terrible.

4168
03:54:42,080 --> 03:54:43,080
It's freaking.

4169
03:54:43,080 --> 03:54:44,080
Yeah.

4170
03:54:44,080 --> 03:54:45,080
It doesn't look.

4171
03:54:45,080 --> 03:54:46,080
It doesn't read.

4172
03:54:46,080 --> 03:54:47,080
It doesn't read.

4173
03:54:47,080 --> 03:54:52,080
I genuinely did not, for years, I thought that the Philippines flag only had three colors.

4174
03:54:52,080 --> 03:54:53,080
One day I was like, wait a minute.

4175
03:54:53,080 --> 03:54:54,080
There.

4176
03:54:54,080 --> 03:54:55,080
Oh shit.

4177
03:54:55,080 --> 03:54:56,080
There's a sun.

4178
03:54:56,080 --> 03:54:57,080
Oh shit.

4179
03:54:57,080 --> 03:54:58,080
There's a sun in there.

4180
03:54:58,080 --> 03:54:59,080
I couldn't even see it.

4181
03:54:59,080 --> 03:55:03,080
My favorite flag is the Albanian flag.

4182
03:55:03,080 --> 03:55:08,080
It's bright red with a black bird, two-headed bird on the middle.

4183
03:55:08,080 --> 03:55:10,080
Oh, that is a good one.

4184
03:55:10,080 --> 03:55:12,080
Oh, that one's cool.

4185
03:55:12,080 --> 03:55:13,080
Yeah.

4186
03:55:13,080 --> 03:55:15,080
That one's pretty, pretty freaking cool.

4187
03:55:15,080 --> 03:55:21,080
Oh, there's one, there's one African flag that I thought was really cool.

4188
03:55:22,080 --> 03:55:23,080
Yeah.

4189
03:55:23,080 --> 03:55:24,080
I was trying to think of one.

4190
03:55:24,080 --> 03:55:25,080
There's one with a sun.

4191
03:55:25,080 --> 03:55:27,080
There's one with a sun in the middle.

4192
03:55:27,080 --> 03:55:32,080
It's called a, it's the flag of, okay, there's different versions of it.

4193
03:55:32,080 --> 03:55:39,080
Like they changed flags a couple of times, but it's Malawi, the flag of Malawi.

4194
03:55:39,080 --> 03:55:41,080
I like their old one.

4195
03:55:41,080 --> 03:55:46,080
They have a new one that has like fewer colors and I think is worse.

4196
03:55:46,080 --> 03:55:49,080
This is the new one and it's fine.

4197
03:55:49,080 --> 03:55:52,080
Oh, Saudi Arabia has a great flag.

4198
03:55:52,080 --> 03:55:57,080
I don't like the just two colors flags, but I like Saudi Arabia.

4199
03:55:57,080 --> 03:56:01,080
The old one was this and I think this one is fucking sick.

4200
03:56:01,080 --> 03:56:02,080
Yeah, that rocks.

4201
03:56:02,080 --> 03:56:05,080
Yeah, it rocks.

4202
03:56:05,080 --> 03:56:10,080
Saudi Arabian flag is, I just like how unique it is.

4203
03:56:10,080 --> 03:56:16,080
It's very unique and I would say it's iconic even, but text on a flag though.

4204
03:56:16,080 --> 03:56:20,080
Text on a flag is an ugly thing.

4205
03:56:20,080 --> 03:56:24,080
That's why I don't like the Massachusetts flag because it's got that banner with like the words written on it.

4206
03:56:24,080 --> 03:56:26,080
I just think it's sloppy.

4207
03:56:26,080 --> 03:56:34,080
Well, you see I'm racist Ben and so I see the writing and I see, oh, it's not words, it squiggles.

4208
03:56:34,080 --> 03:56:37,080
It's just a funny shape.

4209
03:56:39,080 --> 03:56:42,080
Let's see, Saudi, let me get a closer look.

4210
03:56:42,080 --> 03:56:43,080
It's got a sword.

4211
03:56:43,080 --> 03:56:45,080
The sword is cool.

4212
03:56:45,080 --> 03:56:47,080
The sword is cool.

4213
03:56:47,080 --> 03:56:49,080
Okay, you know what?

4214
03:56:49,080 --> 03:56:53,080
Honestly, yeah, I don't know what that freaking words say.

4215
03:56:53,080 --> 03:56:54,080
I can't read it.

4216
03:56:54,080 --> 03:56:59,080
It looks just like a weird stuff to me.

4217
03:56:59,080 --> 03:57:00,080
I guess it's probably calligraphy.

4218
03:57:00,080 --> 03:57:04,080
It's probably like very like fancy writing.

4219
03:57:04,080 --> 03:57:09,080
It's not like Times New Roman or Comic Sans or whatever.

4220
03:57:09,080 --> 03:57:11,080
Do you know what it says?

4221
03:57:11,080 --> 03:57:14,080
Probably some sort of religious thing.

4222
03:57:15,080 --> 03:57:17,080
Let me look it up.

4223
03:57:17,080 --> 03:57:18,080
I'm curious.

4224
03:57:18,080 --> 03:57:21,080
The Saudi Arabian flag words.

4225
03:57:21,080 --> 03:57:28,080
The inscription on the flag written in the calligraphic Thuluth script is the Shahada or Islamic declaration of faith.

4226
03:57:28,080 --> 03:57:31,080
There is no God but Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of God.

4227
03:57:31,080 --> 03:57:34,080
Okay, actually incredibly, incredibly cringe.

4228
03:57:34,080 --> 03:57:35,080
Unbelievable.

4229
03:57:35,080 --> 03:57:36,080
I hate it.

4230
03:57:36,080 --> 03:57:39,080
Actually, it honestly is God.

4231
03:57:39,080 --> 03:57:40,080
You're totally right.

4232
03:57:40,080 --> 03:57:41,080
It looks awesome.

4233
03:57:41,080 --> 03:57:43,080
It looks iconic, but I hate it.

4234
03:57:43,080 --> 03:57:44,080
Yeah.

4235
03:57:44,080 --> 03:57:47,080
I like it though.

4236
03:57:47,080 --> 03:57:48,080
I can't help it.

4237
03:57:48,080 --> 03:57:49,080
A sword on a flag?

4238
03:57:49,080 --> 03:57:51,080
I mean, it's pretty cool.

4239
03:57:51,080 --> 03:57:53,080
A sword on a flag is cool.

4240
03:57:53,080 --> 03:57:56,080
Oh my God, they made a freaking gay version.

4241
03:57:56,080 --> 03:57:57,080
Gave?

4242
03:57:57,080 --> 03:57:58,080
What?

4243
03:57:58,080 --> 03:58:01,080
I don't think that's actually a gay version.

4244
03:58:01,080 --> 03:58:07,080
I think that's meant to illustrate the different words.

4245
03:58:08,080 --> 03:58:15,080
To highlight which symbols or which words in the calligraphy.

4246
03:58:15,080 --> 03:58:22,080
Yeah, flag of Saudi Arabia in order of writing, layer over, but it looks gay.

4247
03:58:22,080 --> 03:58:23,080
I don't know where you're looking.

4248
03:58:23,080 --> 03:58:24,080
Did you post it?

4249
03:58:24,080 --> 03:58:27,080
Yeah, I posted it.

4250
03:58:27,080 --> 03:58:33,080
Yeah, it's meant it separates the words out in the symbology.

4251
03:58:33,080 --> 03:58:35,080
I could have told you that except like...

4252
03:58:36,080 --> 03:58:37,080
Ah, fuck.

4253
03:58:37,080 --> 03:58:43,080
I'm trying to think if there's any other really great ones that I like.

4254
03:58:43,080 --> 03:58:46,080
I honestly think that the flag of the...

4255
03:58:46,080 --> 03:58:47,080
Wales.

4256
03:58:47,080 --> 03:58:48,080
We talked about last week, but I do like Wales.

4257
03:58:48,080 --> 03:58:49,080
Wales is cool.

4258
03:58:49,080 --> 03:58:50,080
It's got a dragon.

4259
03:58:50,080 --> 03:58:51,080
Yeah, and it's pretty iconic.

4260
03:58:51,080 --> 03:58:53,080
I think the UK flag is pretty good.

4261
03:58:53,080 --> 03:58:54,080
I like the UK flag.

4262
03:58:54,080 --> 03:58:57,080
I like that it's a bunch of other flags like superimposed over each other.

4263
03:58:57,080 --> 03:58:58,080
I think that rules.

4264
03:58:58,080 --> 03:58:59,080
It's pretty good.

4265
03:58:59,080 --> 03:59:00,080
Yeah.

4266
03:59:00,080 --> 03:59:03,080
I always liked it.

4267
03:59:03,080 --> 03:59:11,080
I like it's association with punk stuff, like tattered Union Jack with the chains and stuff.

4268
03:59:11,080 --> 03:59:13,080
Like, oh, yeah, fucking whatever.

4269
03:59:13,080 --> 03:59:14,080
Yeah.

4270
03:59:14,080 --> 03:59:17,080
I mean, I guess so.

4271
03:59:17,080 --> 03:59:18,080
I'm a tartan.

4272
03:59:18,080 --> 03:59:23,080
I think that's not really so much the flag being cool as punk being cool.

4273
03:59:23,080 --> 03:59:24,080
Oh, yeah.

4274
03:59:24,080 --> 03:59:26,080
But I mean, I can't help it.

4275
03:59:26,080 --> 03:59:28,080
I associate things.

4276
03:59:28,080 --> 03:59:31,080
Yeah, I guess so.

4277
03:59:31,080 --> 03:59:39,080
Okay, I think that's a sufficient answer.

4278
03:59:39,080 --> 03:59:41,080
Next one is called...

4279
03:59:41,080 --> 03:59:45,080
Oh, well, it's an imager.

4280
03:59:45,080 --> 03:59:48,080
Logic puzzle from Brazil stumps nearly everyone.

4281
03:59:48,080 --> 03:59:51,080
Assume that both of the following sentences are true.

4282
03:59:51,080 --> 03:59:53,080
Pinocchio always lies.

4283
03:59:53,080 --> 03:59:56,080
Pinocchio says all my hats are green.

4284
03:59:56,080 --> 04:00:03,080
We can conclude from these two sentences that Pinocchio has at least one hat.

4285
04:00:03,080 --> 04:00:07,080
Pinocchio has only one green hat.

4286
04:00:07,080 --> 04:00:10,080
Pinocchio has no hats.

4287
04:00:10,080 --> 04:00:12,080
Pinocchio has at least one green hat.

4288
04:00:12,080 --> 04:00:17,080
Pinocchio has no green hats.

4289
04:00:17,080 --> 04:00:21,080
Pinocchio says all my hats are green.

4290
04:00:21,080 --> 04:00:25,080
So it means that if he has hats, they're not all green.

4291
04:00:25,080 --> 04:00:28,080
That's the only thing that does say, right?

4292
04:00:28,080 --> 04:00:31,080
He may or may not have hats.

4293
04:00:31,080 --> 04:00:35,080
But if he does have hats, not all of them will be green.

4294
04:00:35,080 --> 04:00:39,080
There will be at least one non-green hat.

4295
04:00:39,080 --> 04:00:43,080
Yeah, he might...

4296
04:00:43,080 --> 04:00:44,080
I think it's...

4297
04:00:44,080 --> 04:00:47,080
Yeah, there's a little vagueness in what it means by a lie.

4298
04:00:47,080 --> 04:00:51,080
So, like, if he says all my hats are green but he doesn't have any hats, is that a lie?

4299
04:00:51,080 --> 04:00:56,080
I guess I would say yes.

4300
04:00:56,080 --> 04:01:01,080
So we can't conclude C because he may have hats.

4301
04:01:01,080 --> 04:01:07,080
We can definitely conclude E.

4302
04:01:07,080 --> 04:01:14,080
No, because he may have, like, three hats and two of them are green.

4303
04:01:14,080 --> 04:01:17,080
But not all of them are green.

4304
04:01:17,080 --> 04:01:20,080
So we can't do E, we can't do C.

4305
04:01:20,080 --> 04:01:30,080
So, okay, he could have at least one hat that's not green or he could have no hats.

4306
04:01:30,080 --> 04:01:36,080
Um, I don't think... can we conclude any of these things?

4307
04:01:36,080 --> 04:01:40,080
Pinocchio, like, Pinocchio has at least one green hat.

4308
04:01:40,080 --> 04:01:43,080
He could have no green hats, so that's not true.

4309
04:01:43,080 --> 04:01:46,080
Pinocchio only has only one green hat.

4310
04:01:47,080 --> 04:01:52,080
We don't know that he has any hats.

4311
04:01:52,080 --> 04:01:57,080
If he has hats, then at least one is not green.

4312
04:01:57,080 --> 04:02:01,080
And yeah, that's none of these.

4313
04:02:01,080 --> 04:02:06,080
I feel like I've seen a video explaining this one and they said there is a correct answer

4314
04:02:06,080 --> 04:02:08,080
and I'm like, fuck you, there isn't.

4315
04:02:08,080 --> 04:02:11,080
The question is incomplete if that's the case.

4316
04:02:11,080 --> 04:02:13,080
I think the question is too vague.

4317
04:02:13,080 --> 04:02:19,080
I think the question is vague in what exactly counts as a lie.

4318
04:02:19,080 --> 04:02:26,080
If we knew that he had hats, we could conclude only that at least one of them is not green,

4319
04:02:26,080 --> 04:02:29,080
which is none of these answers.

4320
04:02:29,080 --> 04:02:31,080
Yeah.

4321
04:02:31,080 --> 04:02:33,080
We don't know that.

4322
04:02:33,080 --> 04:02:35,080
And yeah.

4323
04:02:35,080 --> 04:02:37,080
They say logic puzzle from Brazil.

4324
04:02:37,080 --> 04:02:42,080
Does that mean there was a translation mix up into English that made it so vague?

4325
04:02:42,080 --> 04:02:48,080
That would make it really shitty if that were the problem.

4326
04:02:48,080 --> 04:02:54,080
Okay, correct us if we're wrong, voicemailer, but we're not.

4327
04:02:54,080 --> 04:03:00,080
Next one is called, is Ben's occasional reminder played Delta Room Chapter 2?

4328
04:03:00,080 --> 04:03:02,080
Okay.

4329
04:03:02,080 --> 04:03:04,080
The one after that.

4330
04:03:04,080 --> 04:03:06,080
Imgur, let's fucking look.

4331
04:03:06,080 --> 04:03:08,080
Let's behold.

4332
04:03:08,080 --> 04:03:12,080
UPCB background for trans part.

4333
04:03:16,080 --> 04:03:21,080
I mean, what more can I say?

4334
04:03:21,080 --> 04:03:25,080
Yeah, this is just a photo of Radcon 4.

4335
04:03:25,080 --> 04:03:27,080
True.

4336
04:03:27,080 --> 04:03:30,080
Okay, next one is another image.

4337
04:03:30,080 --> 04:03:35,080
I can't wait to behold its glory.

4338
04:03:35,080 --> 04:03:37,080
We should improve.

4339
04:03:37,080 --> 04:03:42,080
We should improve the PCB website, yet you haven't.

4340
04:03:42,080 --> 04:03:46,080
This is the image behind the platform.

4341
04:03:46,080 --> 04:03:49,080
Yeah, the fucking plan.

4342
04:03:49,080 --> 04:03:52,080
Sorry.

4343
04:03:52,080 --> 04:03:55,080
No, I think we're going to have to remake it from scratch.

4344
04:03:55,080 --> 04:03:58,080
I think we're just going to have to do that.

4345
04:03:58,080 --> 04:03:59,080
Yeah.

4346
04:03:59,080 --> 04:04:02,080
Oh, oh God, no.

4347
04:04:02,080 --> 04:04:03,080
What?

4348
04:04:03,080 --> 04:04:04,080
No.

4349
04:04:04,080 --> 04:04:06,080
What?

4350
04:04:06,080 --> 04:04:08,080
No.

4351
04:04:08,080 --> 04:04:15,080
Oh, there's just a recommended image that was really sad and the Imgur recommended images and newest and most viral.

4352
04:04:15,080 --> 04:04:17,080
Oh, look at this.

4353
04:04:17,080 --> 04:04:19,080
Oh God, Jesus.

4354
04:04:19,080 --> 04:04:21,080
What could it be?

4355
04:04:21,080 --> 04:04:23,080
My liver is failing.

4356
04:04:23,080 --> 04:04:24,080
I have lupus.

4357
04:04:24,080 --> 04:04:25,080
I have pancreatitis.

4358
04:04:25,080 --> 04:04:28,080
My body is hurting so much and I don't know if I'm going to live or die.

4359
04:04:28,080 --> 04:04:30,080
The worst thing about it is my old best friends.

4360
04:04:30,080 --> 04:04:34,080
Years ago, we hadn't talked and my best friend said, please don't talk to me.

4361
04:04:34,080 --> 04:04:35,080
I'll reach out to you.

4362
04:04:35,080 --> 04:04:36,080
I'm not sure what I did.

4363
04:04:36,080 --> 04:04:37,080
I haven't seen him in four years.

4364
04:04:37,080 --> 04:04:39,080
Not even this will get him talking to me.

4365
04:04:39,080 --> 04:04:41,080
I'm scared and need my best friend.

4366
04:04:41,080 --> 04:04:42,080
Who wrote this?

4367
04:04:42,080 --> 04:04:45,080
Why?

4368
04:04:45,080 --> 04:04:47,080
That's terrible.

4369
04:04:47,080 --> 04:04:48,080
I just saw.

4370
04:04:48,080 --> 04:04:51,080
Why would you recommend this to me, Imgur?

4371
04:04:51,080 --> 04:04:52,080
Why?

4372
04:04:52,080 --> 04:04:56,080
Because the algorithm says it's very engaging.

4373
04:04:56,080 --> 04:04:58,080
Oh God, I freaking.

4374
04:04:58,080 --> 04:04:59,080
Oh, no.

4375
04:04:59,080 --> 04:05:01,080
I go down in the replies.

4376
04:05:01,080 --> 04:05:02,080
I'm sorry.

4377
04:05:02,080 --> 04:05:08,080
I go down in the replies and I see freaking sending virtual hug and there's something

4378
04:05:08,080 --> 04:05:11,080
so infuriating about that.

4379
04:05:11,080 --> 04:05:12,080
There's something.

4380
04:05:12,080 --> 04:05:18,080
When I see a sad post and down in the replies, I see sending virtual hug or I see that gif

4381
04:05:18,080 --> 04:05:28,080
of freaking Murray from Monsters Inc hugging the girl and I'm just like, drives me fucking

4382
04:05:28,080 --> 04:05:29,080
insane.

4383
04:05:29,080 --> 04:05:31,080
Yeah, just trying to show sympathy.

4384
04:05:31,080 --> 04:05:32,080
I know.

4385
04:05:32,080 --> 04:05:33,080
It's not enough.

4386
04:05:33,080 --> 04:05:34,080
It's not enough.

4387
04:05:34,080 --> 04:05:35,080
Yeah.

4388
04:05:35,080 --> 04:05:39,080
Why did I even do?

4389
04:05:39,080 --> 04:05:41,080
Why did I even look at this?

4390
04:05:41,080 --> 04:05:42,080
I don't know.

4391
04:05:42,080 --> 04:05:43,080
I'm so stupid.

4392
04:05:43,080 --> 04:05:44,080
Hey.

4393
04:05:44,080 --> 04:05:45,080
Oh, wait.

4394
04:05:45,080 --> 04:05:47,080
Did you hear about Shafrila's?

4395
04:05:47,080 --> 04:05:54,080
Shafrila's the YouTube video guy who does videos about movies?

4396
04:05:54,080 --> 04:05:55,080
Yes.

4397
04:05:55,080 --> 04:05:56,080
Yes.

4398
04:05:56,080 --> 04:05:57,080
Yes.

4399
04:05:57,080 --> 04:05:58,080
Did you hear?

4400
04:05:58,080 --> 04:05:59,080
No.

4401
04:05:59,080 --> 04:06:00,080
Oh God.

4402
04:06:01,080 --> 04:06:03,080
They have lived or failure?

4403
04:06:03,080 --> 04:06:05,080
What's what happened?

4404
04:06:05,080 --> 04:06:12,080
Well, it turns out and I didn't know this, but they're actually a team of three guys.

4405
04:06:12,080 --> 04:06:14,080
There was the guy who reads the scripts.

4406
04:06:14,080 --> 04:06:16,080
I think his name is James.

4407
04:06:16,080 --> 04:06:22,080
And then there was his brother whose name I forget and their friend, Chris.

4408
04:06:22,080 --> 04:06:27,080
And like the name Shafrila's comes from like combining their two last names.

4409
04:06:27,080 --> 04:06:30,080
It's like Shafr and Shilas or something.

4410
04:06:30,080 --> 04:06:31,080
They combine it into one.

4411
04:06:31,080 --> 04:06:35,080
They had a car accident and two of them are dead.

4412
04:06:35,080 --> 04:06:36,080
Oh my God.

4413
04:06:36,080 --> 04:06:37,080
Yeah.

4414
04:06:37,080 --> 04:06:41,080
James is the only one that survived.

4415
04:06:41,080 --> 04:06:42,080
Yeah.

4416
04:06:42,080 --> 04:06:45,080
That's a...

4417
04:06:45,080 --> 04:06:50,080
They were all three of them were in a car and I don't know what happened.

4418
04:06:50,080 --> 04:06:51,080
That sucks.

4419
04:06:51,080 --> 04:06:52,080
Yeah.

4420
04:06:52,080 --> 04:06:54,080
No, it's so fucking bad.

4421
04:06:54,080 --> 04:06:56,080
It's so fucking bad.

4422
04:06:56,080 --> 04:07:04,080
I found Chris's fiance's Twitter and I saw their Twitter and that was terrible.

4423
04:07:04,080 --> 04:07:20,080
And I found frickin, I saw James tweeted that like he's going to keep making videos because he's just got to keep working because it's the only thing he can do now and like, okay, respectable.

4424
04:07:20,080 --> 04:07:31,080
And apparently frickin, they had frickin filmed like video cameos from like Chris and like there's footage of Chris that's going to be in like a video that like is still coming out.

4425
04:07:31,080 --> 04:07:32,080
No.

4426
04:07:32,080 --> 04:07:36,080
I know.

4427
04:07:36,080 --> 04:07:39,080
What do you, what is, what can you, what do you do?

4428
04:07:39,080 --> 04:07:40,080
What do you do?

4429
04:07:40,080 --> 04:07:43,080
I, yeah, I keep going I guess.

4430
04:07:43,080 --> 04:07:58,080
He's just, I mean, when Weird Al's parents died of frickin asphyxiation while he was on tour, he just kept touring because like, what can you do?

4431
04:07:58,080 --> 04:07:59,080
Yeah.

4432
04:07:59,080 --> 04:08:02,080
And I guess, I guess that's what James is doing.

4433
04:08:02,080 --> 04:08:07,080
Yeah, I heard this was like, this was like Monday this week.

4434
04:08:07,080 --> 04:08:10,080
It was like a couple, this was like half a week ago.

4435
04:08:10,080 --> 04:08:11,080
Yeah.

4436
04:08:11,080 --> 04:08:12,080
It's all over Twitter.

4437
04:08:12,080 --> 04:08:14,080
I'm surprised you didn't see it.

4438
04:08:14,080 --> 04:08:17,080
I guess I just follow different people.

4439
04:08:17,080 --> 04:08:31,080
I saw it like it was like, maybe it's just my Twitter, but yeah, it was like the top recommendation or like the top trending thing or like one of them for like a couple days there.

4440
04:08:31,080 --> 04:08:34,080
Anyway, that's fucking cool.

4441
04:08:34,080 --> 04:08:37,080
Anyway, let's look at the next voicemail.

4442
04:08:37,080 --> 04:08:40,080
It's a voice, it's an image.

4443
04:08:40,080 --> 04:08:45,080
It's an image of the channel customization.

4444
04:08:45,080 --> 04:08:47,080
Oh yeah.

4445
04:08:47,080 --> 04:08:51,080
I should probably, I should probably just do that.

4446
04:08:51,080 --> 04:08:54,080
This is telling me how to change the channel.

4447
04:08:54,080 --> 04:08:59,080
Because you know ours right now is like procrastinator's podcast 3692 or whatever.

4448
04:08:59,080 --> 04:09:01,080
Oh.

4449
04:09:01,080 --> 04:09:09,080
I think I tried to change it and like it didn't let me because like procrastinators had been taken or something.

4450
04:09:10,080 --> 04:09:19,080
Or maybe, or no, it seems to say that it's, this image seems to suggest that procrastinator's podcast is free.

4451
04:09:19,080 --> 04:09:24,080
So maybe we should do that.

4452
04:09:24,080 --> 04:09:29,080
Maybe we should call it, maybe we should call it, we could always call it the perfect comic party.

4453
04:09:29,080 --> 04:09:31,080
We could fully rebrand.

4454
04:09:31,080 --> 04:09:35,080
I mean it's still a podcast on YouTube.

4455
04:09:35,080 --> 04:09:37,080
It is still a podcast on YouTube.

4456
04:09:37,080 --> 04:09:41,080
The perfect podcast people.

4457
04:09:41,080 --> 04:09:45,080
Maybe we should change the name to the procrastinator's podcast.

4458
04:09:45,080 --> 04:09:49,080
Like change the actual channel name as well as the handle.

4459
04:09:49,080 --> 04:09:52,080
Yeah, we could.

4460
04:09:52,080 --> 04:09:54,080
Makes, makes sense.

4461
04:09:54,080 --> 04:09:59,080
The procrastinators isn't really an important distinction.

4462
04:09:59,080 --> 04:10:06,080
Should we call it procrastinator's podcast or the procrastinator's podcast?

4463
04:10:06,080 --> 04:10:14,080
I think the procrastinator's because it implies that we are the procrastinators rather than this is a podcast for people procrastinating.

4464
04:10:14,080 --> 04:10:18,080
Which it may also be, but it's not like a self-help thing.

4465
04:10:22,080 --> 04:10:23,080
Yeah, okay.

4466
04:10:23,080 --> 04:10:26,080
Alright, alright.

4467
04:10:26,080 --> 04:10:31,080
Next one is called make it more parasocial.

4468
04:10:31,080 --> 04:10:34,080
Three, two, one, go.

4469
04:10:34,080 --> 04:10:38,080
This takes seriously every single stupid idea for the rebranding.

4470
04:10:38,080 --> 04:10:41,080
I am loving it.

4471
04:10:41,080 --> 04:10:44,080
Also Jesus fucking cries, holy fucking shit.

4472
04:10:44,080 --> 04:10:56,080
Ben still didn't play Delta Run, but at this point just wait for the new chapters and play everything over again, I guess.

4473
04:10:56,080 --> 04:11:00,080
Why would I play it over again?

4474
04:11:00,080 --> 04:11:03,080
I'll just play the new one when it come out.

4475
04:11:03,080 --> 04:11:09,080
When chapter three comes out, then I'll finally play chapter two and then when four comes out, I'll play three, et cetera, et cetera.

4476
04:11:09,080 --> 04:11:14,080
And then you won't be able to talk about it with everyone.

4477
04:11:14,080 --> 04:11:16,080
Everyone will be like, oh, hype about the new thing.

4478
04:11:16,080 --> 04:11:18,080
You're like, hey guys, you heard of Queen?

4479
04:11:18,080 --> 04:11:21,080
You heard of Spamton?

4480
04:11:21,080 --> 04:11:23,080
And everyone's like, yeah, of course.

4481
04:11:23,080 --> 04:11:25,080
Anyway.

4482
04:11:25,080 --> 04:11:28,080
Anyway, whatever, yeah.

4483
04:11:28,080 --> 04:11:29,080
Well, that's fine.

4484
04:11:29,080 --> 04:11:30,080
I hate everyone.

4485
04:11:30,080 --> 04:11:37,080
Why would I want to talk about a video game with them?

4486
04:11:37,080 --> 04:11:38,080
Okay.

4487
04:11:38,080 --> 04:11:40,080
What about the Continental Procrastinators podcast?

4488
04:11:40,080 --> 04:11:42,080
I love the procrastinators podcast.

4489
04:11:42,080 --> 04:11:47,080
I love subscribing to patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

4490
04:11:47,080 --> 04:11:51,080
Oh, next one is called VVV Next installment.

4491
04:11:51,080 --> 04:11:53,080
Oh, here we go.

4492
04:11:53,080 --> 04:11:58,080
Is Vinnie back?

4493
04:11:58,080 --> 04:11:59,080
It is.

4494
04:11:59,080 --> 04:12:01,080
Yeah, it looks like it.

4495
04:12:01,080 --> 04:12:03,080
Yeah, it looks like it.

4496
04:12:03,080 --> 04:12:05,080
020422.

4497
04:12:05,080 --> 04:12:08,080
They re-entered town and here's where we left off.

4498
04:12:08,080 --> 04:12:11,080
This is whatever Normie places on the main.

4499
04:12:11,080 --> 04:12:15,080
This is what, oh, wait, who?

4500
04:12:15,080 --> 04:12:17,080
Oh, you're green and I'm...

4501
04:12:17,080 --> 04:12:20,080
Am I green?

4502
04:12:20,080 --> 04:12:24,080
No, I thought I was pink.

4503
04:12:24,080 --> 04:12:28,080
Oh, Simsie is black because he says blimey.

4504
04:12:28,080 --> 04:12:29,080
Yeah, so you're green.

4505
04:12:29,080 --> 04:12:31,080
I guess I'm green.

4506
04:12:31,080 --> 04:12:33,080
There is whatever Normie places on the main street here

4507
04:12:33,080 --> 04:12:37,080
or actually I know a good hole in the wall place to get oriental food.

4508
04:12:37,080 --> 04:12:41,080
I wouldn't say oriental food.

4509
04:12:41,080 --> 04:12:44,080
Fish and chips is fish and chips no matter how.

4510
04:12:44,080 --> 04:12:46,080
I'm up for whatever mates.

4511
04:12:46,080 --> 04:12:50,080
But a little hole in the wall sounds nice.

4512
04:12:50,080 --> 04:12:53,080
All right, it's down a quaint little alleyway.

4513
04:12:53,080 --> 04:12:56,080
Oh boy, a quaint American alleyway.

4514
04:12:56,080 --> 04:12:58,080
Yeah, I love.

4515
04:12:58,080 --> 04:13:00,080
We just love a quaint American alleyway.

4516
04:13:00,080 --> 04:13:02,080
Blimey.

4517
04:13:02,080 --> 04:13:05,080
Yeah.

4518
04:13:05,080 --> 04:13:07,080
Oh, someone's watching.

4519
04:13:07,080 --> 04:13:09,080
Is that a pony?

4520
04:13:09,080 --> 04:13:12,080
Tee hee.

4521
04:13:12,080 --> 04:13:14,080
What the fuck?

4522
04:13:14,080 --> 04:13:17,080
Whoosh, whoosh.

4523
04:13:17,080 --> 04:13:19,080
Hello, Ben St. Miss Gibb and Take.

4524
04:13:19,080 --> 04:13:23,080
This is your welcome to the hometown, to the hometown USA.

4525
04:13:23,080 --> 04:13:26,080
I'm Roxanne Kaiser and this is Julien, my Julien,

4526
04:13:26,080 --> 04:13:31,080
my super special son.

4527
04:13:31,080 --> 04:13:34,080
Don't introduce me as that baka.

4528
04:13:34,080 --> 04:13:36,080
La Mal.

4529
04:13:36,080 --> 04:13:38,080
We're here in place of Munchie and Kazi.

4530
04:13:38,080 --> 04:13:43,080
They requested their likeness not be illustrated.

4531
04:13:43,080 --> 04:13:45,080
Respectable.

4532
04:13:45,080 --> 04:13:50,080
I wonder if Vinny actually asked them.

4533
04:13:50,080 --> 04:13:53,080
Like actually reached out to them and asked and they said no.

4534
04:13:53,080 --> 04:13:55,080
I think that happened.

4535
04:13:55,080 --> 04:14:01,080
Okay.

4536
04:14:01,080 --> 04:14:04,080
Uh, sure.

4537
04:14:04,080 --> 04:14:07,080
What the, you fucking guys popped out to give some meta bullshit.

4538
04:14:07,080 --> 04:14:10,080
You're hijacking my comic.

4539
04:14:10,080 --> 04:14:12,080
Tee hee.

4540
04:14:12,080 --> 04:14:14,080
All that is really to get to this.

4541
04:14:14,080 --> 04:14:17,080
Julien and I will have a place for you to sleep at night.

4542
04:14:17,080 --> 04:14:19,080
Give and take, room and board will be provided.

4543
04:14:19,080 --> 04:14:21,080
No expense to you, of course.

4544
04:14:21,080 --> 04:14:23,080
You can find us in place of Munch House,

4545
04:14:23,080 --> 04:14:25,080
which Ben St. knows the location of.

4546
04:14:25,080 --> 04:14:29,080
With that being said, we should.

4547
04:14:29,080 --> 04:14:32,080
We shall bid au revoir, Gibb.

4548
04:14:32,080 --> 04:14:34,080
Oh.

4549
04:14:34,080 --> 04:14:37,080
Ha ha, thank you.

4550
04:14:37,080 --> 04:14:41,080
This is so weird.

4551
04:14:41,080 --> 04:14:43,080
Okay.

4552
04:14:43,080 --> 04:14:45,080
There's my quaint American alleyway.

4553
04:14:45,080 --> 04:14:47,080
Seems nice and quaint.

4554
04:14:47,080 --> 04:14:49,080
All right, all right, mate.

4555
04:14:49,080 --> 04:14:51,080
Quaint hee.

4556
04:14:51,080 --> 04:14:53,080
We're walking down the quaint American alleyway.

4557
04:14:53,080 --> 04:14:56,080
Took a little bit to get into the swing of it with my tablet.

4558
04:14:56,080 --> 04:14:58,080
Hopefully I can keep these regular again.

4559
04:14:58,080 --> 04:15:00,080
Just keep in keeping regular comic content.

4560
04:15:00,080 --> 04:15:03,080
I'll jump into the perfect comic podcast too.

4561
04:15:03,080 --> 04:15:05,080
I don't know if I'll submit this comic to it,

4562
04:15:05,080 --> 04:15:07,080
but we'll see as it goes.

4563
04:15:07,080 --> 04:15:09,080
Oh my God.

4564
04:15:09,080 --> 04:15:12,080
We want to be a part of the perfect comic party.

4565
04:15:12,080 --> 04:15:14,080
Oh God.

4566
04:15:14,080 --> 04:15:16,080
I would say yes.

4567
04:15:16,080 --> 04:15:18,080
I would say we have a space.

4568
04:15:18,080 --> 04:15:20,080
I don't know. This is so embarrassing.

4569
04:15:20,080 --> 04:15:22,080
I don't know.

4570
04:15:22,080 --> 04:15:24,080
I don't know.

4571
04:15:28,080 --> 04:15:33,080
It hits that specific cringe itch.

4572
04:15:33,080 --> 04:15:35,080
I don't...

4573
04:15:35,080 --> 04:15:38,080
Listen, it's about the comics.

4574
04:15:38,080 --> 04:15:40,080
It's not about me.

4575
04:15:40,080 --> 04:15:42,080
It's not about me and you.

4576
04:15:42,080 --> 04:15:44,080
It's not about art.

4577
04:15:44,080 --> 04:15:47,080
It's about unrestrained creativity.

4578
04:15:47,080 --> 04:15:49,080
I think this is pretty creative.

4579
04:15:49,080 --> 04:15:51,080
I...

4580
04:15:51,080 --> 04:15:53,080
I guess, but it...

4581
04:15:53,080 --> 04:15:55,080
It's not...

4582
04:15:55,080 --> 04:15:57,080
I don't want...

4583
04:15:57,080 --> 04:15:59,080
I don't like that I'm a character in it.

4584
04:15:59,080 --> 04:16:01,080
I don't know.

4585
04:16:01,080 --> 04:16:03,080
Okay, one for one against.

4586
04:16:03,080 --> 04:16:05,080
My...

4587
04:16:05,080 --> 04:16:07,080
My publication does not need...

4588
04:16:07,080 --> 04:16:09,080
Okay, whatever. Yeah, fine.

4589
04:16:09,080 --> 04:16:11,080
Gotcha.

4590
04:16:11,080 --> 04:16:13,080
Laying in bed guy.

4591
04:16:13,080 --> 04:16:15,080
3, 2, 1, go.

4592
04:16:18,080 --> 04:16:22,080
Hey, can you guys finally make the next recording

4593
04:16:22,080 --> 04:16:24,080
five hours long?

4594
04:16:24,080 --> 04:16:28,080
Some of us want something to listen to.

4595
04:16:28,080 --> 04:16:30,080
No.

4596
04:16:30,080 --> 04:16:32,080
They're just laying in bed thinking about nothing.

4597
04:16:32,080 --> 04:16:34,080
Okay, next.

4598
04:16:34,080 --> 04:16:36,080
Die. We're only at four and a half hours

4599
04:16:36,080 --> 04:16:39,080
and we're probably not going to make five, so get owned.

4600
04:16:39,080 --> 04:16:42,080
Get totally destroyed.

4601
04:16:42,080 --> 04:16:44,080
Get obliterated, stupid.

4602
04:16:44,080 --> 04:16:46,080
That's what you get for listening to our...

4603
04:16:46,080 --> 04:16:48,080
So you get for listening to our content.

4604
04:16:48,080 --> 04:16:50,080
You fucking jerk.

4605
04:16:50,080 --> 04:16:52,080
You wake up and you merely have four and a half hours

4606
04:16:52,080 --> 04:16:54,080
to lay in bed and listen to the PCP

4607
04:16:54,080 --> 04:16:56,080
before you have to get up.

4608
04:16:56,080 --> 04:16:58,080
Next one is called

4609
04:16:58,080 --> 04:17:00,080
laying in bed guy.

4610
04:17:00,080 --> 04:17:02,080
3, 2, 1, go.

4611
04:17:05,080 --> 04:17:07,080
Hey, laying in bed guy.

4612
04:17:07,080 --> 04:17:11,080
So that this five hour mark is much easier.

4613
04:17:11,080 --> 04:17:15,080
I suggest you guys talk about something that's lengthy.

4614
04:17:15,080 --> 04:17:17,080
Well, we don't have one piece this week.

4615
04:17:17,080 --> 04:17:19,080
Probably not one piece. God, I hate that.

4616
04:17:19,080 --> 04:17:20,080
Fuck you.

4617
04:17:20,080 --> 04:17:22,080
Talk about Trixie, any Trixie drama.

4618
04:17:22,080 --> 04:17:24,080
That's always funny.

4619
04:17:24,080 --> 04:17:26,080
I love Benz reaction.

4620
04:17:26,080 --> 04:17:28,080
That's hilarious.

4621
04:17:28,080 --> 04:17:30,080
You're welcome.

4622
04:17:30,080 --> 04:17:32,080
So let's try to hit that five hour mark.

4623
04:17:32,080 --> 04:17:36,080
That four, 59 on 59 seconds.

4624
04:17:36,080 --> 04:17:39,080
What is this amateur hour?

4625
04:17:39,080 --> 04:17:41,080
Laying in bed guy.

4626
04:17:41,080 --> 04:17:43,080
Another voicemail.

4627
04:17:43,080 --> 04:17:48,080
Another colorful voicemail character in the bag.

4628
04:17:48,080 --> 04:17:52,080
Okay, next one. Yeah, 3, 2, 1, go.

4629
04:17:52,080 --> 04:17:54,080
Oh, my apologies. I forgot.

4630
04:17:54,080 --> 04:17:56,080
Happy birthday, Ben.

4631
04:17:56,080 --> 04:17:57,080
Have a good one.

4632
04:17:57,080 --> 04:17:59,080
Happy birthday.

4633
04:17:59,080 --> 04:18:00,080
Not my birthday.

4634
04:18:00,080 --> 04:18:01,080
Happy birthday, Ben.

4635
04:18:01,080 --> 04:18:05,080
Thanks. Thank you.

4636
04:18:05,080 --> 04:18:07,080
And that was it.

4637
04:18:07,080 --> 04:18:12,080
I think that people should be nicer to me.

4638
04:18:12,080 --> 04:18:13,080
Nicer?

4639
04:18:13,080 --> 04:18:16,080
In general, yeah.

4640
04:18:16,080 --> 04:18:18,080
What could be done, Ben?

4641
04:18:18,080 --> 04:18:20,080
I think people shouldn't make fun of me.

4642
04:18:20,080 --> 04:18:23,080
Just because I make fun of Trixie on Twitter.

4643
04:18:23,080 --> 04:18:25,080
That tweet got a lot of likes.

4644
04:18:25,080 --> 04:18:27,080
That tweet got 60 likes. That's not bad.

4645
04:18:27,080 --> 04:18:29,080
That was a good tweet.

4646
04:18:29,080 --> 04:18:31,080
Okay, fuck the haters.

4647
04:18:31,080 --> 04:18:33,080
All right.

4648
04:18:34,080 --> 04:18:40,080
That's all I have to say.

4649
04:18:40,080 --> 04:18:45,080
Well, yeah, there's no, if we had one piece,

4650
04:18:45,080 --> 04:18:48,080
it would have probably pushed it to five hours.

4651
04:18:48,080 --> 04:18:50,080
Oh, easily.

4652
04:18:50,080 --> 04:18:52,080
But there is no none.

4653
04:18:52,080 --> 04:18:54,080
Good week did not have one piece, honestly.

4654
04:18:54,080 --> 04:18:56,080
Yeah, I guess so.

4655
04:18:56,080 --> 04:18:59,080
It's about it for the show.

4656
04:18:59,080 --> 04:19:02,080
Become a patron.

4657
04:19:02,080 --> 04:19:07,080
And maybe we'll make an AI bonus episode if someone can tell us how to do that

4658
04:19:07,080 --> 04:19:10,080
and do it for us.

4659
04:19:10,080 --> 04:19:16,080
We need an AI to like figure out how to use AI software.

4660
04:19:16,080 --> 04:19:22,080
Yeah, if only we had like an artificial man made of metal

4661
04:19:22,080 --> 04:19:28,080
that had like free will and like a strong sense of justice that could like learn it for us.

4662
04:19:28,080 --> 04:19:33,080
He needs a strong sense of justice so that he won't steal other people's content

4663
04:19:33,080 --> 04:19:37,080
when he's training the stable diffusion models on.

4664
04:19:37,080 --> 04:19:39,080
Mm-hmm.

4665
04:19:39,080 --> 04:19:42,080
That would be wrong and unjust.

4666
04:19:42,080 --> 04:19:44,080
You see.

4667
04:19:46,080 --> 04:19:50,080
Become a patron for bonus content.

4668
04:19:50,080 --> 04:19:58,080
And, you know, updates will be coming soon on the Perfect Comic Party.

4669
04:19:58,080 --> 04:20:00,080
Yeah.

4670
04:20:00,080 --> 04:20:02,080
Working on Clarissa.

4671
04:20:02,080 --> 04:20:04,080
Yeah.

4672
04:20:04,080 --> 04:20:06,080
Gonna work hard.

4673
04:20:06,080 --> 04:20:09,080
Gonna draw.

4674
04:20:09,080 --> 04:20:15,080
I'm gonna say I hope to get some time this week

4675
04:20:15,080 --> 04:20:19,080
to work on Beescapades since I have to do that.

4676
04:20:20,080 --> 04:20:25,080
I'll have to think about like, I'll have to plan out

4677
04:20:25,080 --> 04:20:27,080
like a more specific like a chunk of it.

4678
04:20:27,080 --> 04:20:30,080
Because kind of before I sort of like would do a couple panels

4679
04:20:30,080 --> 04:20:33,080
and then I would ask for like, you know, reader feedback or whatever.

4680
04:20:33,080 --> 04:20:37,080
This time I'll probably change it so like I'll do like a big chunk

4681
04:20:37,080 --> 04:20:42,080
and then I'll end with like a reader question like what should he do or whatever.

4682
04:20:42,080 --> 04:20:47,080
I'm doing like 20 pages because that's how long the chapter is

4683
04:20:47,080 --> 04:20:52,080
like where it cuts off in a narratively sensible place.

4684
04:20:52,080 --> 04:20:59,080
But there's no reason for like the weekly Beescapades to be like a long thing.

4685
04:20:59,080 --> 04:21:01,080
No, it doesn't. No.

4686
04:21:01,080 --> 04:21:03,080
It wouldn't have to be like long, long.

4687
04:21:03,080 --> 04:21:09,080
But it would be, you know, instead of just like kind of whenever

4688
04:21:09,080 --> 04:21:13,080
I would have to sort of pick a spot and be like, OK, I'll call this.

4689
04:21:13,080 --> 04:21:14,080
This will be the end of the piece.

4690
04:21:14,080 --> 04:21:18,080
Like this is where I want to end it for now and ask an open-ended question

4691
04:21:18,080 --> 04:21:21,080
like should he go here or here or whatever.

4692
04:21:21,080 --> 04:21:23,080
Yeah. Yeah.

4693
04:21:23,080 --> 04:21:26,080
People can respond in the somehow.

4694
04:21:26,080 --> 04:21:29,080
Send in fan mail, send fan letters and we open them.

4695
04:21:29,080 --> 04:21:34,080
I should probably open a, I'll have to think about how I want to like what

4696
04:21:34,080 --> 04:21:39,080
what I should set up to like take a reader suggestions.

4697
04:21:40,080 --> 04:21:45,080
Something to pick something could be it.

4698
04:21:45,080 --> 04:21:49,080
OK.

4699
04:21:49,080 --> 04:21:50,080
All right.

4700
04:21:50,080 --> 04:21:51,080
I guess we're done.

4701
04:21:51,080 --> 04:21:52,080
I'm done. I'm done.

4702
04:21:52,080 --> 04:21:55,080
I've had enough. I've had enough.

4703
04:21:55,080 --> 04:21:57,080
I'm actually I'm actually feeling really tired.

4704
04:21:57,080 --> 04:22:03,080
I'm feeling really, really tired, exhausted, defeated, demotivated, demoralized.

4705
04:22:03,080 --> 04:22:05,080
All of a sudden it's coming over me.

4706
04:22:05,080 --> 04:22:06,080
Oh, no, it's not good.

4707
04:22:06,080 --> 04:22:08,080
It's over. It's over. It's over.

4708
04:22:08,080 --> 04:22:11,080
The procrastination podcast is over.

4709
04:22:11,080 --> 04:22:15,080
It's OK. I just I have like I know exactly what I got to do.

4710
04:22:15,080 --> 04:22:16,080
I got to do it.

4711
04:22:16,080 --> 04:22:20,080
There's like there's like last night I finished like I finished like saving

4712
04:22:20,080 --> 04:22:22,080
all the pages in the new format.

4713
04:22:22,080 --> 04:22:26,080
And what I need to do now is going to need to like resave them in the color

4714
04:22:26,080 --> 04:22:27,080
filtered version.

4715
04:22:27,080 --> 04:22:31,080
I need to apply the color filter that I designed to maximize how they look

4716
04:22:31,080 --> 04:22:36,080
when they're printed in CMYK as opposed to on the screen in RGB.

4717
04:22:36,080 --> 04:22:39,080
So I need to do that.

4718
04:22:39,080 --> 04:22:44,080
And that's just a nice little like easy task that I can have very measurable

4719
04:22:44,080 --> 04:22:47,080
like I have to do this 200 times.

4720
04:22:47,080 --> 04:22:50,080
And then I'll do it 200 times and then I'm done and I can check it off my list.

4721
04:22:50,080 --> 04:22:51,080
And that'll be good.

4722
04:22:51,080 --> 04:22:52,080
That feels good.

4723
04:22:52,080 --> 04:22:53,080
Yeah.

4724
04:22:53,080 --> 04:22:54,080
That's OK.

4725
04:22:54,080 --> 04:22:56,080
That's the end of the show.

4726
04:22:56,080 --> 04:22:58,080
Bye.

4727
04:22:58,080 --> 04:23:01,080
All right. Goodbye. See you next week.

4728
04:23:01,080 --> 04:23:03,080
OK. That's it.

4729
04:23:03,080 --> 04:23:05,080
The end.
