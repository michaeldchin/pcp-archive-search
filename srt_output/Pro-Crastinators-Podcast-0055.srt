yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

15
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:54,880
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

16
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:24,880
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

17
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:54,880
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

18
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,480
yccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccg

19
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,820
Okay, well here was the problem that I ran into it was like put in your tax information

20
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,180
I put in all my tax shit, but then like it said like it auto-completed my name to Ben sain

21
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,420
But then down in the name category

22
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,380
It was like okay type your first name and last name and I did and it was like name must match

23
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,140
And I said but but that's not my name. That's not my real name

24
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,260
So eventually so I was typing my real name and it said it does it has to match

25
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:31,220
That's not okay, and finally I was like okay fine fuck it, and I just typed my name as Ben sain, and you know what it said

26
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,020
Said Nate it said name has to match

27
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,780
Even though I did no I made it match, and it's still didn't I don't I don't understand any of this shit

28
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,900
Can I just say as the last issue here? I've the problem. I've been facing maybe someone else can help

29
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,100
This is a desperate attempt to get someone to fucking help out in the audience

30
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Bouncy now that

31
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,860
Yeah, I will give you I will give you money out of my pocket if you can help me solve this problem my personal money

32
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,180
I will do it this has been a headache for years literally years

33
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,060
One of the problems I've been facing is this whole thing where you can't have more than one account guys like

34
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,820
Munky are easily are able to tie you know all their different channels to get their AdSense money to like their main account

35
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,220
Like that's not a problem because they're all attached to one Google account the problem is I have had to make multiple Google accounts

36
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,700
You know things that involve different people myself and then procrastinators without everybody

37
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,340
So if you know how to fix this please for the love of God help me

38
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
And that's it

39
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,460
My rant wasn't over that was oh

40
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,420
That's all like relevant. That's all the sort of stuff like okay. That's what I was going through but it was it's like

41
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,140
For you and and all that stuff. That's like important money. That's like PCP money

42
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,180
That's AdSense for your channel and PCP

43
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,180
That's like big amounts of money for for people that people need to have I mean I've been I've been going through yeah

44
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,380
It's it's bigger. It's bigger than it's bigger than the literal zero dollars

45
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,980
I would make off Twitch which is this is my point like that the fact that like I would have been fine

46
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,540
Never making money on Twitch, but the fact that they said I could potentially get money

47
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,660
Right, let me on this part of this two-day past still hasn't been fixed

48
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,700
I have to now wait for 24 hours for this account to get re

49
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,900
Like you know reset itself so that I can input my number again, and maybe it will work

50
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:24,780
I don't think it will but maybe it will I don't know but it's just like agony like it just eats away at me like just

51
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,340
Thinking about the fact that I could be making like a dollar every two years on this twitch account

52
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
The fact that there's a revenue stream that is

53
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,700
From you gotta open up really just open up those passive revenue streams

54
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,060
It just makes it it just really makes me think it's like I I do this twitch stream for the passion and now that there's money

55
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,420
It's really makes me annoyed that it doesn't work

56
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:54,860
And now everything is fucked, and I'm really angry and I want to kill everyone and myself included and I fucking

57
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,700
I hate that money has done this to me, and it's it's shit

58
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:03,300
You know that's a perfect segue to some of the definitions of money over on Urban Dictionary

59
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,780
Oh, thank God. Thank God for this segment before you do that. I just wanted I just wanted to end with a twitch TV slash give and take

60
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,140
Do you want to go?

61
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,380
Everyone go watch I'm on there sometimes we play Minecraft or is that munchies? I can't remember no it's yours, and it's super fun

62
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,380
I I love it. I we should do that more we didn't do it yesterday, and I'll hate you forever for it

63
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,100
anyway

64
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,620
That that's true

65
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,260
I rather I sat there all night with my arms crossed to my brow frode staring at the screen

66
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,220
Why are they inviting me to play Minecraft? Why stay with fucking inviting me to play that's that's me every day

67
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,580
And there's there's a whole bunch of definitions by the way for money over on Urban Dictionary

68
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
So I'm going to cherry pick the ones I like

69
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,580
So definition four of money is the root of all evil

70
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,700
Where's another one number three here?

71
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:55,940
We go paper and coinage that can be used to exchange for goods and services more of it equals power and chicks

72
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,740
And and number two is a good one a money that which allows lazy people to do stupid things without painful consequences

73
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,780
Thus keeping them forever stupid. I know devu would not appreciate these definitions

74
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,460
He might appreciate the second one that was that I thought that was pretty fair pretty pretty even-handed

75
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Let's go with that one. Let's go with that one that works

76
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,700
So, uh, I guess let's just get into our thoughts on on I mean we're all creators here, right?

77
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,460
We're all art kind of guys. So there's always a struggle going on. Well, not bad

78
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,940
Yeah, I mean, you know everybody I have I have the rest of us have artistic integrity of the story. Yeah

79
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,100
And so, uh, there's there's always the struggle of trying to

80
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,340
Decide what's appropriate to to you know make for what you do like avenue revenues

81
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,420
Fucking avenues for revenues is what I was trying to say and I mean guys like me

82
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,900
I'm really trying to do it. Can everyone hear the fucking tractor out my window

83
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
No

84
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,940
Well, maybe it's fine here. I'm I'll just kill myself. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. I'll sort that out

85
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,900
I know not everybody thinks of like doing their art

86
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,660
professionally like to support themselves like like mage for example

87
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,540
At least it doesn't look like you're making, you know, particularly strident moves to try to like support yourself entirely with your art

88
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,260
She did start. She did start a patreon at patreon.com slash lethal aurora mage

89
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
Tragically underfunded at the moment

90
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,260
What's what's your goal with that mage? Let me just ask you what would you hope to get out of uh, your your patreon?

91
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,380
I just some extra spending money just as to get as compensation or you look into, you know

92
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,300
Be professionally and support yourself entirely. Oh not not with just patreon, but in general all all your stuff all your own gosh

93
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
And complicated question. Um

94
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,020
Let me let me quickly think about it. Well, um, I've been debating on getting patreon for like

95
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,060
A while I actually made the patreon account like several years ago back when I was doing phony stuff

96
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
but I never got around to actually

97
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,180
Implementing it because I kind of felt bad for charging people for like the shit I do. Oh, let's talk about that

98
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,620
Let's talk about uh that later charge feeling bad about charging people for stuff willingly, but okay, we'll get into that

99
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:14,180
Yeah, so, uh, but right now I kind of need the extra spending money just on like better food for myself and

100
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,540
Yeah, sometimes sometimes I mean I might need extra spending money because that's the only

101
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,220
Job I have kind of but I'm not like in particular dire need or anything

102
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,740
Um, I don't know mage. You say that you need the money for better food. That honestly sounds pretty dire

103
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,940
I mean, I I'm still getting food. It's just not very good

104
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,340
Well, maybe if she didn't buy as much pocky and ramune from her local anime shop, she'd be in the fucking green come on

105
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
I wish I had an animation

106
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,740
I under you know, I I understand mage

107
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,900
I know that a significant a significant chunk of your income needs to go to patreon.com slash ben sain every month

108
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,180
It has to come out of something

109
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,740
That's right

110
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,780
But yeah, like I'm not I'm not in like super dire needs

111
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,780
So I'm not like advertising like hey guys, please give me all of your months right now or else

112
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,100
I'm gonna die tomorrow. I'll say it everyone give major months, please

113
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,060
No, no, it's okay

114
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,500
Like I I I'm like I'm giving an option for people who do want to support me

115
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,980
And that's you know, that's fine. They don't have to I don't I don't want to pressure people into doing it because then I'll feel

116
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,260
Really responsible about doing content and stuff

117
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,140
Which I really don't want to pressure myself into doing because then I'll just start procrastinating

118
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,620
and hating myself

119
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,500
Yeah, I want to procrastinator hates himself intensely. That's true. I want to talk about that because like

120
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,500
I

121
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,420
This month on my on hypocrite

122
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,260
I haven't made a single video for the channel for for patreon for april

123
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,260
So I'm not charging anybody for april

124
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,460
I haven't really thought about I mean I've thought about the fact that I'm not charging anybody

125
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,420
I'm not making a video

126
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,580
But I'm I'm more concerned about the fact that I'm not putting out a video in april

127
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,140
That the the charging people money is just like a thing that I don't think about as much

128
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,380
Because when I feel bad and procrastinate, it's because I don't want

129
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,300
You know the the video to not be good enough. I don't want but it's not because people are paying for it

130
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,340
It's just because I don't want to make bad videos. I don't want to make like videos that I don't think are good enough

131
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
And that's why I don't make anything like

132
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,860
There's like a there's a there's a different thing like I don't know how how the rest of you feel

133
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,580
About whether it's charging the people money for it that makes you feel bad and procrastinate or whether it's the quality of the thing itself

134
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,500
Whether it's probably it's probably both actually. I don't know. I definitely my philosophy on that in general

135
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,780
Yeah, you can come in after this, but like I just want to state my philosophy about patreon in general

136
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,460
I sincerely believe that when it comes to patreon specifically

137
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,380
Any money that you get out of the people willingly?

138
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,540
I mean you can't lie and tell them that you're gonna do something and not do it that that's not good

139
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,940
But whatever content you provide legitimately that people are willing to give you money for I think I would find it

140
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,660
Ridiculous to criticize anyone for doing so. It's not that I like if you make, you know

141
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,420
Like shitty art and people pay for it. It's not like I'm gonna like the art there

142
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:19,300
I just find absolutely no moral objection to to like you getting any amount of money that people find worth in that

143
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,260
Yeah, like no matter what like no matter what people have have opted into it

144
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,500
Like yeah, people have opted in hardcore to support you on patreon. You can't you can't like swindle someone on patreon

145
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,620
That's right. I don't unless you lie. I don't think you know

146
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,660
Yeah, well like that's the whole thing even if let's say you are releasing a bunch of stuff on patreon

147
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,380
Then you do a hard left and you do something different like people can just say I don't want to pay for that and they don't have to

148
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,780
That's right. They have the option at any time. It is your responsibility as a patron to say, okay, this content is no longer good

149
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,220
I'm not going to support them anymore. That's that's you. That's up to you entirely

150
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,340
Yeah, there is no like what can the creator do to like help with that never change their content

151
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,540
No, I've never I've never heard of a of like a patron being like you fucking cheated me

152
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,300
to anyone

153
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:12,260
But I have heard other people claim that like others are like cheating people with their patreon. You hear that with like kickstarter all the time

154
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,740
Yeah, I feel like I feel like that's more of a case of like people being new to patreon and not realizing that you know

155
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,780
Yeah, like they do it and then they they get surprised when they they realize they've been charged for stuff that they didn't really care about

156
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,660
and they forgot to like set the cap or

157
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,460
You know like because that was a thing for a while forgetting to set your cap as a thing

158
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,100
But like that's not on the person you're pledging. Yeah. Yeah, it's totally on you right

159
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,820
Yeah, it is on the person

160
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,980
But I think I feel like the the small instances in which patrons have gotten mad at creators is because it was a new thing

161
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,740
And then now people know a bit more about it so that they know

162
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
Well, I can just leave so

163
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,860
That's what i'm gonna do. It's it's a bit similar to getting mad at like, you know

164
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,780
Sort of like the owner like I you know, I'm a member at a gym and like when I joined this gym

165
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,660
They it's a it's a fantastic gym. I absolutely love it. Um, and it's got all this wonderful stuff

166
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,460
Um, but like I was very clear because I've had a lot of experience with different gyms to ask like, okay

167
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,860
Tell me about the joining fees the leaving fees like the the the monthly payments like is that ever going to go up?

168
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,020
Like what is the uh, you know, like at what points am I allowed to leave the plan?

169
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,700
It's like I've got a yearly plan

170
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,060
So I cannot leave before that point like you just have to understand the situation you're getting into and know that

171
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,900
You know like what fees you can expect to see and uh, you know

172
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Just make your as a as an aware consumer or customer or supporter

173
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,740
You just have to be savvy about the costs and about like any

174
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Issues that could come up. It's your responsibility

175
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:53,460
Okay, okay. So like I have people pledging to me. Thank you guys by the way if you're listening and um

176
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,180
so I I made a video and I charged people for it and

177
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,620
If like they said they're only gonna like charge them at the beginning of the month

178
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,300
So

179
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,180
If if they wanted to they could back out

180
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,820
But like, you know, if it was a private video, which is it isn't but if it was a private video

181
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,260
They could have seen it and then back out with and I don't know. I think would they be charged?

182
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,540
No, I think I think if it if the charge doesn't go through it doesn't count as a payment

183
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,100
I think like so, I mean mage what you're asking for is if you had gated content

184
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,620
That was behind like your patreon that people had to be a patron to get

185
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,940
Could someone because it because you get charged at the beginning of the next month could someone come in

186
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,140
Say they're gonna pledge watch the stuff and then bail before the money goes through. Is that the question? Yeah

187
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,500
It can't you can do that. I've had people do that to me before

188
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,300
Um, it's it's dumb the way to get around it the patreon in response to that

189
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,940
They have a new thing now, which I suggest everybody do is when you you can set up your account

190
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,940
You can set it so every new patrons automatically charge as soon as they sign up

191
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,820
So like if they sign up for a $50 pledge instead of

192
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,860
Waiting till the end of the month to charge if they're instantly charged for that as soon as they sign up

193
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,780
So that's the way to do it. If the pcp one isn't like that

194
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,180
It should we should adjust it to be like that immediately

195
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,540
Mine is like set up per video rather than per month though

196
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,300
Right the same thing you just got your own system because because the way patreon works

197
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,780
Even if you're set up per video instead of charging as they come out at the end of the month

198
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,300
They'll collect all of the the content you have to upload four videos

199
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,260
They're gonna charge people four times or attempt to charge people four times at the end of the month and then give it to you a week later

200
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,060
Yeah, so they're gonna charge at the end of the month rather than whenever I post videos

201
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,780
Correct guys. I don't know how much we should go down the rabbit hole of you know, patreon minutia here

202
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,100
I was waiting. I was waiting to say I think we've gotten a bit far afield of the topic of

203
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,180
I was just curious. Sure. Yeah. No, not that I don't think this is talking about it

204
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,340
podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay, so

205
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,660
Teach me some pies

206
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,140
Do doing it doing it for the money versus doing it for the the love of the game

207
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,180
Um, I I guess I have I guess I have a relevant uh topic to say I've been

208
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,220
um, I've I've been doing like

209
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
All right, I've I've been I've been pretty slow

210
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
I've been pretty slow with my main content

211
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,220
Recently and I have a couple of reasons for that

212
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,940
One of it is like personal stuff because I've been like getting ready to move and all that

213
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
um, and the other is just like

214
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,740
I've been I've just

215
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,860
Just been focusing nice looks. Yeah. Yeah, I've been I've been focusing on that and it's been and it's been terrible

216
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,300
It's been terrible and I can't wait for that nightmare to be over almost done. I'm so close. Oh god

217
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,460
But I have I I took I took a little bit of commission work and it's just I found

218
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,940
I found that it's so hard like drawing. Yeah commissions is so hard

219
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
because like

220
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,180
Like no matter what the commission is like even if even if what they're asking for is like fine

221
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,220
Like I don't know when when you're when you're making something yourself and you're drawing yourself you're doing it

222
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,820
You're like I don't know like you're you're doing it in accordance with like what you want to see

223
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
But like right right

224
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,420
When it's a commission when you're doing it for someone else for you know when you're doing it for the money

225
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,420
I guess as opposed to for the passion. It's like

226
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,540
Every step of it is like this slog and like I don't know right the more the more

227
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:29,460
Like I sketched out this image that this person wanted and then you know, I was like, okay that sketch looks pretty good

228
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,220
It's pretty rough whatever it's got most of the stuff and then I started finishing it and and like

229
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,860
Finishing it was such a nightmare because it's like I worked and worked because I had to like

230
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,980
Put in more details and stuff and like this is not how I would design this thing and like right

231
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,780
The more I worked at it like the more it resembled what I had been asked to do

232
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,140
But the less I liked it because I was going against my like natural instincts. It was such an uphill battle

233
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,420
Commissions are just such like a psychologically such an uphill battle and it's just so much less

234
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,860
Good

235
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:06,900
That's similar to like when I first started my patreon. I had reward tiers some of which were like drawing a thing

236
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,380
For a person and and I found those really difficult as well because

237
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,180
Well mostly because I was lazy, but also because I didn't like having to do something

238
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,860
at all

239
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,660
So I don't do rewards because like it really is exactly doing something for the money

240
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:27,860
Like I'm doing this because you pledged because there's a reward. I'm not doing this because I would have done it

241
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,060
Yeah, and that's why in my patreon now. There's no rewards at all

242
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,420
Which is probably making me lose a bit of money, but I think it's worth it

243
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,660
I don't like having that hanging over me. I know I know that I know that I owe

244
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,500
I know that I owe like a handful of people some reward art that like I have been sitting on for a while

245
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,220
and that is

246
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,500
Yeah, I'm gonna get I'm gonna get to that like probably after the nuzlocke's end

247
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,740
I like that's like on my plate because I have to do that at some point because I feel terrible

248
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,660
I feel terrible owing people art

249
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,340
I feel like some of them have probably forgotten that I even owe them art in the first place

250
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,620
But I know I do and I have to at least try like I have to at least be like hey, you still you still want this

251
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,300
Let's let's let's get this sorted out so I can feel like a person again

252
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,100
It's really annoying

253
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:16,180
It's really it's really weird when they forget and then you feel bad about it still so you have to you have to decide

254
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Well, I could just do I could just forget about it, but I feel bad about it

255
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,500
Maybe they don't forget maybe they just don't say anything you want to be nice

256
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,820
Well, there is at least one person who I have explicitly emailed and been like hey

257
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,380
I owe you some art because you you gave to my I think it was for my um

258
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,420
Indy might go fund me like what do you want and they didn't answer and I'm like well

259
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,620
You're in the clear. I think I've done all I can do

260
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,220
And absolutely I did the same thing because when I started my patreon way back in like what 2014

261
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,460
I had a tier where I just did commissions and it was a nightmare because I had like 15 commissions to do all of a sudden overnight

262
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,740
Yeah, and I was like, yeah great

263
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,340
I'm making money, but like I made the money to support the videos I was making at the time

264
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,620
But now I've given myself all of this like basically freelance work on top of the work that I was trying to fund in the first way

265
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,340
So I fucked myself over hardcore it sucks and all these pictures are fucking stupid. I don't want to do them anyway

266
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,780
So it's eventually what I just did is I just like people who weren't responding because it took me forever to get them done

267
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,500
So I was like I just put out a big thing on patreon

268
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,620
I was like these are the people I have left to do if you don't respond within two weeks

269
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,380
I'm knocking you off the list and like half the people didn't respond. I'm like, you know what?

270
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,820
Fuck it

271
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,380
Yeah, when it's when it's something. Yeah, when it's something that someone else wants to see rather than what you want to be drawing

272
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,420
It's just harder like it just makes it harder to do

273
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:41,060
You know this this feeling you've been described is exactly why I have I offer exactly zero perks on my patreon

274
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,140
Exactly zero all that you get is that you get to feel support

275
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,420
Uh for you know best guy ever and you um like that I actually like that a lot

276
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,220
It is completely ideologically pure the only reason to to to you know

277
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,860
Yeah, the only reason to patron me is because you like the content and you want to support it because I make it very clear in my

278
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,700
In my you know on patreon.com slash best guy ever that the money goes to me being able to do this as a career

279
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,900
That's what that's what my whole life is geared towards. That is the only goal

280
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,540
I have in life being able to leave my job and and do more of this shit as fast as possible

281
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:21,140
Yeah, and um rewards either because like I don't produce that much content and I feel like if I had rewards

282
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,500
I would spend more time working on the rewards, which which is bad for everybody which is bad for everybody

283
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,100
of speaking of like the goal of like

284
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:36,420
Doing this as a living I feel right okay get on the subject of like like money versus passion

285
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,860
I'll just I'll just lay out my belief on this subject, which I think everyone is probably going to agree with

286
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,260
I don't think anyone's going to find this too controversial

287
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,700
um

288
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:52,020
Um, I don't I don't care about money at all except in so far as it lets me live

289
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,380
The way that I want to live so like as long as I'm making enough money

290
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:04,660
Like I I I I need money up to the point that I have all my shit taken care of and I can and I can do art

291
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,820
And then beyond that it's all it's all superfluous right agreed

292
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,460
Yeah, I think we all agree on that except some of us have standards of lilings that go slightly above

293
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,060
You know eating a discarded pizza hut out of the dumpster from behind the thing

294
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,700
Well, you know some of us buy our own pizza. Well

295
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:29,060
You know I've had I've had to get closer to that point. I've had to yeah, I've I've lowered my standards of living

296
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,420
I've yeah, I'm not joking like I'm low

297
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,500
Like I've like I've lowered my costs and I've lowered my expectations to like as low as they can possibly go

298
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,940
Because I just want to hit that equilibrium point where I'm making enough money that I can live

299
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,780
And not have to do any other bullshit except make the shit that I want to make

300
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,980
And like anything that I could anything that I could do to scrape more money out of my art or

301
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,260
Lower my fucking cost of living like anything that gets me closer to there is worth doing like

302
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,500
Everything I respect that actually I think that's it's the only thing. It's the only thing that makes sense to me. You know, right?

303
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,620
Yeah, I the way I work is is exactly that like

304
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:15,620
But the problem that comes with that is that I sort of go in and out of phases of certain things that I want to do

305
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,300
Like um

306
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,580
Like recently this month instead of doing hypocrite videos

307
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,860
I did like a whole series of drawing brisker, which is you know, it's it's I'm going to continue doing that

308
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,140
But I then then I was like, oh, you know what my little pony started

309
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,340
I'm going to do a my little pony podcast with Jesse and I was like that's another thing

310
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,980
And then there's like vlogs and and anything anything and anything that isn't like a main channel video because I have been working on one

311
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,260
But it's sort of like

312
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,300
I have to play the other whole game and take notes and it's taking long

313
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,540
And it it it sort of drains me out. I just want to do other stuff

314
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
I I want to make other videos

315
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,580
I could have if I worked on it if I had the the the wherewithal the passion that the drive

316
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,300
To make a couple smaller videos on hypocrite and that would have been great for everyone

317
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,540
but I didn't because I

318
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:08,580
I do it so much for the passion that if I don't have the the passion then I won't make any money and that's just how it is

319
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,340
Yeah, um, I hate I hate that about myself because I do at least want something at the end of the month

320
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,940
But I don't know devout devout chimes in

321
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,020
Quote life is like a video game and money is like points

322
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,260
I want to achieve fun and interesting goals while also seeing how high I can get my score

323
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,420
People in the stock market and billionaires and shit. I think this is their entire goal

324
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,100
Most of them seem to like making money way more than they like spending money

325
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,300
That's that's accurate. Yeah, he's living living living that living that gamified life. He's living

326
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:45,460
He's living the gamification dream your passion is making money. I think I would argue that must become addicting at some point

327
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,460
It's oh, oh, absolutely

328
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,180
I'm sure but I was I was gonna say in response to sort of ben's point and you know, everybody gives as well

329
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,660
About you know wanting to achieve the equilibrium of you know, lowering your standards to to just like be able to do what you want

330
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,540
I would argue that. Oh, well, I guess I wouldn't argue anything. I'm just I would put in that. I have an additional

331
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,700
um, like like uh, sort of point in that equation something that I feel should also be addressed

332
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,140
And that is I mean and then here comes Nate's quote. We uh, what is it a weird utilitarianism?

333
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,420
Yeah, I feel like I feel like there there should be some

334
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:24,580
Like net gain from your life or you know, you should strive to achieve that like there is no fucking such thing as like

335
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,420
There's how you say that how the fuck do you measure that? Uh, well, there's lots of ways. All right

336
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,780
I know I know what you're gonna say is does it close to get us closer to starfleet?

337
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,540
Well, no, I was okay. No, this is how do you fucking know?

338
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,620
You can you can wait wait wait wait wait wait. There's a net gain

339
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:48,740
By purview of like already by the fact that we didn't exist before and now exist and some people like what we made

340
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,500
Right, that's already a net gain. So you're talking about a big like long-term people would argue that isn't even like a legacy, but yeah

341
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Uh, I yes, I mean, I yes, I am operating from the standard. I fully admit I am operating from a human

342
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,300
Centric utilitarianism standpoint. Yes, that's where I'm coming from

343
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,980
But so is it is it I don't but you're not talking that you want to have a legacy because you

344
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,020
This isn't a but no, it's not about any individual person ego

345
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:19,380
You're trying to like give back to the community on a more macro scale. I'm rooting for team human here. That's just what I'm doing

346
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:25,540
There's no there's no like there's no standard of like what is progress and like what is what is a

347
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,180
Hard to quantify that is absolutely untrue. You're absolutely untrue

348
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,380
There's so many ways we can all agree that the world gets better

349
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:39,140
Is the world better if we create a vaccine that eliminates a specific disease objectively? Yes. Oh my god

350
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,900
Everyone go out and invent a vaccine. I guess what is your bet is your point that I'm wrong because you're just I'm just my point

351
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,260
Is that you're not true? You're fucking literally throwing out some fucking un

352
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,500
Indefensible unfalsifiable like crazy shit like how like we can't

353
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:01,860
No, we cannot have according to the standards you're laying out because they're incoherent you you are such you're so dense here

354
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,100
All that is is an example showing you

355
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Dude, you'll get your

356
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:15,860
Ben you are saying that I am objectively wrong across this uniform view and I'm showing one example to show how that's untrue

357
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,460
That's all I'm doing. That's all I'm doing one example is like so specific

358
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
And that's exactly that's fine

359
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:32,980
Guys we're getting off track the the point is Nate. Well, yeah, but you're never gonna go anywhere with that

360
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:40,740
Like the whole thing is that Nate wants his videos to lead to something greater than his videos in the long term of humanity

361
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,420
And that's that's just he's just thinking he's just thinking way bigger than we are

362
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,740
I don't really particularly that's true. I'm just I think bigger than everybody

363
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,580
I don't think that's like a necessarily better thing to do. I just think that you know, that's what he does

364
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,740
If you're an artist

365
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,860
Yeah, if you're a if you're a doctor then yeah, okay, sure you you can you you're creating vaccines

366
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,020
You're doing cancer research or you're adding to like the sum of human knowledge or something. That's fine

367
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,220
If

368
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,260
Relevant example do our discussion today if you're a fucking artist

369
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,060
How do you measure whether you're fucking shit has has a fucking net gain on society?

370
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,420
Look, I would argue

371
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,940
I would argue that every person intrinsically does it whether they know it or not

372
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,460
They are trying to basically do exactly what i'm saying. They just aren't aware of it

373
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:28,740
Like why does an artist create, you know, like a big mural of like, you know, martin Luther king or like or like

374
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,580
Inspiring people from their community. They do it because they want okay one time

375
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,260
This is my sound bite for the podcast art is a self-indulgent practice. It is

376
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,860
Absolutely. It is. I I think I think I think

377
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,740
Even if I sit here and say I want to make a piece of art that says something

378
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,940
Relevant the only reason I want to say that thing that's relevant because I believe it and I want people to believe what I believe

379
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:59,220
So it's entirely a self-indulgent practice. Well, I don't think I will say I will say that um, I've just realized in this that

380
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,100
Nate

381
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,980
Aside from his analysis videos is not an artist per se. He doesn't make stuff

382
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,700
Self-indulgingly in that way. He likes explaining why something is good

383
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,540
He likes explaining art more than he likes making why Nate is right about something and why he is the best guy ever is

384
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,780
Incredibly self-indulgent

385
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,420
Right, but but I I do that because I think that there is something valuable to be gained through that process

386
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,220
Davoo says, why does Nate always come to this? Nate? I also want videos to lead to something great

387
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,540
But I don't need to bring it up every goddamn week

388
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,620
It's

389
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,100
It's it's almost like it's almost like that's kind of the core philosophy to everything else I do

390
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,980
It's almost like that Davoo. Wow. You're such a brilliant guy Davoo. You're so smart always making these

391
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,740
I just want to kill you. I just want to make one more point about this subject like

392
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,940
Nate I think that you're I think that your logic is fuzzy here on two levels because one

393
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,860
I think that everyone is going to disagree about what constitutes progress

394
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,740
I agree and be I think that it's going to be like like even a really

395
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,740
Like it's going to be really like no matter what standard you choose

396
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,380
There's going to be cases where it's going to be hard to determine whether or not progress was actually made

397
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,540
That doesn't mean that we shouldn't try or make an effort to to get that way

398
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:20,420
What I really want to understand because this is the thing that's that's always like made it seem fuzzy is that I don't know

399
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,380
Quite exactly what your plan is to make like

400
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,740
Specifically what your videos and what your plan is in life to make a change for the better

401
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,780
What do you want to happen due to your involvement in you know the universe?

402
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,060
What what what do you want your impacts to be?

403
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,260
Based on what you're doing now and what you plan to do in the future

404
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:46,900
Well, I fully admit and there's really no other way that anyone can operate that like I am approaching things from my perspective

405
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,980
As what I think the right way to go is and I have thought about it for a long time

406
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,420
And I legitimately hold these beliefs so things like in the gurren login video

407
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:00,260
What I'm doing in that video is pointing out how this show is is sort of encapsulating an idea that I think is valuable

408
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,180
And I wish people would consider more as they conduct themselves or in their daily lives

409
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:11,780
And it's you know, like it's an anime analysis showcasing an idea that I think is really good and explaining why I like the show that you know

410
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,860
Has that bit in it like that's that's what I'm doing and I want so what

411
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,740
So you would say maybe that you're like a preacher using the medium of youtube analysis

412
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
I okay. I mean I say this

413
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Yeah, I say this all the time. He's a bard. He's a bard

414
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:32,020
Yeah, like I I'm all about that thing that hui freeman talked about in that fucking episode of the boondocks where he puts on the christmas plate

415
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,420
Like he had this idea and he wants to explain to people

416
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,780
I don't know whatever it was in his case like the real jesus or something

417
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:42,580
And why you know everyone's wrong about jesus and like nobody gave a shit until he put like fucking

418
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:48,740
Uh, I don't know like I don't know who was it like kanye west or like people that are just like famous and just like are cool

419
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,220
And he put like songs and he put sword fights and he put all this flashy shit in order to like

420
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:59,780
Make a sweet pill that people would swallow to get the medicine that's inside it like the important message to get people talking about it

421
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,660
That's what i'm all about. That's what i'm all about. That's hui's law as i call it all about that blue pill

422
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,660
I'm totally it's not a blue pill

423
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,940
I'm totally sweet pilled. I'm totally sweet pill dog. It's

424
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,260
I get it now that you're just you're just trying to spread uh, good messages good vibes christ consciousness

425
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,580
You know, that's right. All that good stuff. Damn right. That's it. You're just you're just trying to tell people

426
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,180
The cool stuff look ben ben. I really just to go back to this

427
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,220
I really think that there are even if you you think that it's like

428
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,300
Hopeless that there's too many things that people are going to disagree on and we can't get anywhere

429
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:39,940
I would still I would say that you have to say that there are at least some things that I think that we can form a consensus on

430
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,620
Like like just as an example come vaccines like things like that

431
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,540
But how is that?

432
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
Guys because I want to make a statement

433
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,380
Wait, wait, I just let me mage mage. Let me just answer what he just said quick

434
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,780
he's

435
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,780
Go on ben. He said

436
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,180
The like that's such a specific example like that. Yeah, that's who the fuck is gonna be like i said

437
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:05,140
Who the fuck is making vaccines like like i'm like what i'm doing in my life is not going to lead to the creation of

438
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,500
Giant corporations giant, you know like medical corporations are making vaccines. How does that fucking how does that fucking inform?

439
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
How the average person should live their life?

440
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,820
Maybe they should work for that company

441
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,900
About this discussion anymore and it's certainly going to be losing us money if we keep going so mage

442
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:27,780
What's up? I just wanted to like agree was tell me that when he said earlier about this whole self-indulgent thing

443
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,460
Like, uh, I I do art because it makes me happy

444
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,300
Like i've always been drawing regardless of whether people saw it or not

445
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,860
And even if I wasn't popular or even if people didn't like my art

446
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,780
I would probably still be drawing but the fact that there's a lot of people

447
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,780
Out there that like my art and and they they're happy because the you know, they got to see what i'm doing

448
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,980
Kind of makes me happy and it kind of motivates me to do more

449
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,260
But regardless of that I would still be doing what i'm doing with or without the people

450
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,340
That leads me into the point

451
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,620
I wanted to make about this discussion of money versus passion and how I think

452
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,060
There is another aspect that people operate on that we're totally leaving out of this equation and that's a tension

453
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,940
I think more than even money. I think people do things for attention. I think that's a huge motivator

454
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,140
honor and

455
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:20,260
Glory they're similar in the sense that you know, like one is sort of economic capital and the other is social capital

456
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,060
And both can be sort of used to gain advantage like social capital for a lot of people is probably more valuable

457
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,140
I think okay. Sure. Sure. That's fine. That's fine

458
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:33,300
I totally is but I think there's like I think there's so many people who just like shitposts and do like random crap on the internet

459
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,060
Just because they they're looking for attention even though they know it's not going to make them any money

460
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,620
Whereas there are things that could make you a lot of money that people don't do

461
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,780
So I think I think a lot of people operate just under like they want attention

462
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:50,180
I would start hiding and doing things whenever I would give like a lot of attention because I got scared of being like

463
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Really I line light

464
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,500
I I will say that mage you say you say that you would draw even if no one was watching and

465
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,740
I

466
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,660
Honestly, I'm pretty sure that if I didn't if I didn't think anyone would see it

467
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,380
No, I would never draw anything because what would be the point

468
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,100
I could just imagine the image in my head and then I'd have seen it and I wouldn't need to share it

469
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,340
I wouldn't need to create it to share it with anyone

470
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,220
I feel sort of similarly to Ben and I would say I advocate for sort of like a

471
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,940
Sort of like a benevolent

472
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,420
capitalism on this front

473
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,060
What was the other thing? What was hippo gonna say? Sorry. Yeah. Go ahead. Oh, well, uh,

474
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,020
I don't know. I was gonna say something

475
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:38,020
about like like like not understanding Nate's position before but now kind of understanding that yeah

476
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
He's thinking about that that sort of thing and I think

477
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Art, uh, when you're making it

478
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,540
It's it's it's everybody does it for a different reason some people do it because they want attention

479
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,820
Some people do it because they need money, but also because they kind of like it

480
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,540
Some people just love it so much that they can't not do it

481
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,500
You know, I think we all have like the the reason I make my my reviews of video games is because

482
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:06,020
I feel good when people reacts positive positively to them. I also like it when I can tell people about

483
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,420
Um, cool video games and have them play and have fun. So I like spreading the the fun and you know on another level

484
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,060
I like understanding understanding in myself why something is good

485
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,060
Which is why there's always a lot of analysis even though I'm mostly a comedy guy

486
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,180
I try to figure out for for real exactly why a game is good so that I can say to myself. Yeah

487
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,460
I figured it out finally and it's it's all those

488
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,700
Little different things the reasons that I like doing what I do

489
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:40,100
And the money is is a is a much lower on the on the scale really to the point where I probably would still make them

490
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,180
Even if I didn't make that much money that it would always be a hobby of mine to do that

491
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:50,260
Um, you know, if I got like a real job or something or a different source of revenue and hypocrites

492
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,820
Just sort of the died or it never gained any sort of big popularity

493
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,100
I would still probably just be slowly making them until I'm dead

494
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:04,660
Is it is it going too far to say that really when it comes to a question of doing it for passion versus doing it for money

495
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,980
Is the heart of that doing it because you want to do it for yourself versus doing it for other people

496
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
Is that really what it comes down to?

497
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,780
Well, everything's selfish everything's selfish in the end

498
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,380
You might do it for other people because other people make you feel good about yourself for having made it for them

499
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,540
Go on

500
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,420
Okay, let's hold on to your thought. Don't forget it. Yeah

501
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,740
So for me like, um, it's a little uh, when we talked earlier a bit about the whole, you know

502
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,500
You said, you know, you wouldn't do it because no one would see it like for me

503
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,620
I've like I said, I've always been drawing ever since I was little and not a lot of people saw it

504
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,500
Like the fact that people did see like a few friends, maybe family family not so much friends, I guess

505
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,300
Uh, it it was definitely like a motivator to you know, sort of show off and share it

506
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:59,700
But I it just I couldn't not draw like even if no one saw it. It's just it's just part of my life for me

507
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,380
um

508
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,060
That's like is that, you know, the people saw see it and they like it

509
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,620
That's definitely like motivating me to make more. However, there is a point where

510
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,980
The attention turns into expectations and that's where I get like really uncomfortable

511
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,020
And then I kind of backpedal and not do anything because I don't like people expecting stuff from me

512
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,380
like um

513
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:28,180
And and like this is what's bothering me because my most recent video like the animation meme it blew up like a lot more than I

514
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:34,900
Expected it too and people were like, oh man, this is so good. I'm subscribing like I can't wait for more quality memes

515
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,380
animation memes and I'm just like

516
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,980
How I'm gonna live up to this

517
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,660
I see I see

518
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:49,620
Like I did this meme like just because I wanted to for the most part like I could have oh my god 152,000 views

519
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,780
Jesus christ and less than a week. Exactly. That's uh, really good. I mean

520
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,620
It took me several days

521
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:01,620
But I I did it because I really wanted to make it look a little different than the other uh copycat memes

522
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:08,020
It wasn't like because I wanted it to get a lot of attention or like make a lot of months out of it

523
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,340
Silly boys. Don't look at my meme animations. I hear you mage

524
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,900
No, no, no, no, I mean like yeah, I wanted to put it out there and I wanted people to see it

525
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,140
But it was like I wanted to do this. That was my main motivator. I

526
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,060
This is the meme I want to do and this is how I want to go about it

527
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,420
And I did stress about it sometimes and I did change several things and some things didn't turn out the way

528
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,820
You know, I wanted to and in the end I'm not too happy with it

529
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,580
But kind of proud of it. I'm proud enough to put it up. But then like

530
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,340
You know, it was for me mostly for me

531
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,620
I'd like I like the people did like it and shared it and now that he's getting a lot of attention

532
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,700
I am getting scared

533
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:57,300
And at the base it was it was just because I wanted to do it not because other people wanted me to do it

534
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,980
Yeah, I think that I think when you when there's like

535
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,100
Reasons to make something everything's on sort of like a slider the more you slide something to one end

536
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,900
You know the other ends like you know a percentage of the reason you want to do it sometimes like gender like gender

537
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,020
You're somewhere along the slider. Yeah, okay. We're on the same page, right? Like like

538
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,820
It's like a percentage thing like or a pie chart. I don't fucking know how to to visualize this but like

539
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,420
That's like

540
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,940
Yeah

541
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,460
There's like, uh, there's uh making it because you want it to exist

542
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,100
That's like every every time I think of something. Oh, wow, that doesn't exist. I want it to exist

543
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,100
And I make it sometimes said something like very similar to this. I'll read this after you're done

544
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,660
But yeah, so there's like making something because you just wanted to exist and you haven't seen it yet

545
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:46,580
And you just that's the drive the other thing is like making it because uh for attention slash money because like

546
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:52,900
It's basically the same thing you you want like validation in some form. Um, and then the other one is like

547
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,780
Uh, something I don't fucking know. I I I I ruined my own idea

548
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,180
I'm with you though. I'm with you. Well, well, DeVuz DeVuz comment is I have a Venn diagram

549
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:07,540
The things I want to make circle is so big and vast that I am left demoralized at the futility of picking one

550
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,940
When I examine the things people will like and things that will turn a profit and

551
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,340
Things that I have the skills for fields and figure out what is contained within all of them

552
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,700
I am presented with a glorious few paths to choose from

553
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,580
Summed it up pretty good. I think I like think I'm into that metaphor or it's not a metaphor

554
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:29,540
Hey, uh, I'd like to I I'm also acting as the voice piece in this case for monkey who just asked

555
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:35,620
Where is DeVuz typing this shit? I want to post fun notes. Okay, never mind. No, I owe this to DeVuz

556
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,420
I owe this to DeVuz. I'm I'm being subsumed. Yeah. Well, because he left me his microphone

557
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,580
And he was like, oh, that's right. He was no, he was like, I kind of want to be on this cast

558
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:50,420
But I kind of don't so I'll just let you use my microphone and in return in return just read my DMs in

559
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,220
In the thing. I was like, well, I guess I can't say no

560
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:58,980
Yeah, what the hell like we could never ever have a podcast with Ben and and DeVuz on it because

561
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:07,060
We did last week and I just used my shit mic and it sounded like garbage. You gotta buy one my friend. No, but I don't want to

562
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,780
Yeah

563
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,100
How will I how can I buy a new mic like that's going to come out of the funds I'm saving up for that oculus rift

564
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,660
If anyone yeah, let us know in the comments if you understand what the fuck i'm talking about when I say that

565
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:36,900
That's that's a deep it should stay a deep a deep hidden. Yeah, deep hidden. Yeah, that's the deep layer

566
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,020
So you know on that on that pcp like depth chart that should be like that's pretty fucking deep

567
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,820
It's maybe not the deepest but it's down there. Um, okay

568
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,820
So about what we're saying about like things you want to make versus what people want to see for for me

569
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:57,940
Being an artist is all like the satisfaction of being an artist is all about making the thing that you want to make and then

570
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,980
Putting it out there and seeing what other people think about it. So like I'm

571
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,300
Like like I'll do like I'll do commissions or stuff whatever because I need money like like I said like like money

572
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,820
Doesn't motivate me at all except in so far as it lets me do the things I want to do

573
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,060
What really does motivate me is attention and I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that but there you go

574
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:22,180
I just want people to see my shit. I want I want I want people to see my shit and I just want to see

575
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,820
I want I want to make the thing

576
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,140
I want to make the thing that's in my head and put it out there and see what it is

577
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:35,540
And I want to make things that are like honest and like represent like my actual self in some way and put them out there

578
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,980
And get like the and see what see what happens, you know

579
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:44,340
Like there would be no point in doing it. There would be no point in doing it with anything other than like what is really

580
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,820
my

581
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,340
self, you know

582
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:54,340
Any like I wouldn't like I have I have no interest in like catering my content or something to be more popular because

583
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,540
If it's not if it's not the thing that I want to make then I don't care

584
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:02,660
If it's not the thing that I want to make then I don't care how what people think about it or how popular it gets because it's not

585
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:08,580
Really mine if you're just gonna if you're just in it for the money might as well do a job that actually pays more than that

586
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,980
Yeah, exactly like if you're in for the money, there's no reason really being an artist

587
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:19,140
You're kind of kneecapping your your main desire right there. Yeah. Yeah, what when it when it comes to things that I want to make

588
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,780
I think this is the reason I'm a jack-of-all-trades and I'll never be like really good at any one thing

589
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:30,820
I'll just make a loads of different things because I have like ideas that you jump cut jack-of-all-trades my favorite character

590
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,220
I'm so glad you're here jump cut jack-of-all-trades. Yes

591
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,780
and and it's like

592
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,500
You know, I want certain things to exist and they don't exist and I don't want to pay for them because I don't have really

593
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,540
I don't really have money for that if I did have money even if I did have money

594
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:49,460
I would feel weird paying somebody to make certain things like like art or whatever

595
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,020
So like I've considered like writing a book because I want to I want to have like a book

596
00:50:54,340 --> 00:51:00,180
I just I just want it. I I've written like a little thing and I'm gonna I'm gonna make it eventually

597
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:05,620
And there's like a video game. I want I want playstation 2 style graphics to become the next big thing

598
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,820
I want to bring it back

599
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:12,900
So I want to work with my brother to make a playstation 2 game just to just because I want that to exist because there isn't one

600
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,740
There isn't one on steam that you can buy in the scooter. There is no playstation 2 game. God damn it

601
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,540
PlayStation 2 has no games in yeah, that meme has been going on

602
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,620
Really annoys me

603
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,980
You know and things like that even like pornography like there's certain pornography

604
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:33,700
That I I think in my head and I'm like, oh wow, that'll be cool, but it doesn't exist. Nobody draws it and it's it's annoying

605
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:39,460
I feel like I gotta I gotta get better at drawing anatomy so that I can I can make that for myself just be like, oh, yeah

606
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,300
Yeah, I did it

607
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,820
I did it. I did it. I

608
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,780
It was in my head and now it's on paper and I don't have to think about it anymore

609
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,780
I could just look at it, you know, it's just all these things. I want to do everything

610
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,220
I want to make a rock album or I want to make a rap album or I want to make everything

611
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:58,340
And it just it kills me because I'm just I just don't focus on any one thing for any

612
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,100
You know a good amount of time to make the things that are in my head because I just

613
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,500
Yeah, I have so many comic ideas that I want to do I don't want to do comics

614
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,100
I don't want to make a game as well

615
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,860
But I don't know like I don't know the first thing about like programming shit

616
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,780
I could do the arts

617
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,660
I'm I'm lucky that I have a brother who is a programmer so I can

618
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:26,820
I can have him do it. I I wanted help. I have you said you're good at programming

619
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,900
Not uh, yeah, I'm you know, I pretty much stick to my lanes that I use at work and like I like

620
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,940
When I was younger, I was into game design and planned on doing it

621
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:41,220
But like I've I I basically just do the corporate kind of shit and do not spend my free time doing it

622
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,620
So like I'm not really a game programmer or anything like that kind of show

623
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:49,460
I I want to expect that I had I had I had a bunch of I had a bunch of champion stuff that I really wanted to do

624
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,060
And like I'll probably still do it

625
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:55,620
But like like I had I had like the next three chapters planned out and I had like a side chapter

626
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,060
That I was gonna thinking of like maybe paying someone else to draw

627
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,900
It's like a little side story and I thought about making like a little like a game

628
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:08,180
I thought about like programming like a really simple game that related to it or something and then all it all kind of got

629
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,540
I fucking I started the second nuzlocke and then I fucking

630
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,780
I don't know I put I don't know

631
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:18,020
I feel like my effort went into that instead and I deeply regret it and I hated and it was the biggest mistake in my life

632
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,380
It wasn't worth it

633
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:23,780
But like once I started it I had to finish it and well you're almost done

634
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,100
And once that's done you can reassess all your priorities at your leisure and I hope you make

635
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:34,340
I hope you make choices that will uh support you financially and then once you have more, you know leveraged there

636
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:39,380
My find it'll be easier to do whatever you want. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, that's all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's good

637
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,580
It's gonna be good. It's gonna be good

638
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,100
I feel like I feel like I'm really coming to a point where I can finally just like

639
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:48,180
Fuck everything else like I'm gonna have time like soon

640
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,620
I'm gonna have the time and like the ability to like just do the shit that I want to do and it'll be fun

641
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:57,700
Once once I get some stuff out of the way like some commission stuff and

642
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:03,540
Fucking getting people other rewards because I need to fucking get everyone their rewards before I can feel comfortable with anything

643
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:09,780
I feel like how did I even get on this fucking tangent? Never mind. It's not important. No one knows. Nobody knows. Nobody cares

644
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,900
What were we talking about?

645
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:19,300
Money I hate it. We're talking about stuff and it's so hard and I don't like how difficult it is and it's gonna take

646
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,140
40 years before I

647
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:25,860
Feel good about it. You guys were talking about all this this, uh, you know doing stuff because you want to do it

648
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,420
Let me just put it out there that I don't give a shit about anyone's feelings

649
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:36,740
The fact that artists want to make what they make could not care less about, you know, people doing what they want to do

650
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:43,700
I'm only interested in your uh, and you know, like the the the productivity the productivity units that you are, uh,

651
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:48,020
Putting into the human machine. That is what I'm interested. That's what I see people when I walk around

652
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:51,860
I just see units of of value and some people have more some people have less

653
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:58,660
You're crazy, Nate. You're fucking crazy. No. No, Ben. Yeah, Ben. I'm the one who's called the communist

654
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,220
This is something a little communist. Here's the thing here's the thing with this

655
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:06,340
I'm on Nate's side here because I I understand that his point of view is that and there's no

656
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,260
Owners on me to give a shit about his desires as a person

657
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:15,860
So if he wants me to like if he doesn't care that I'm doing what I like, right?

658
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,660
I mean that doesn't change anything about what I'm doing. No, I'm doing what I like

659
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:26,420
That's not what's crazy about it. What's what's like I'm all for not giving a shit about about other people or about what they want

660
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,380
but

661
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,580
Measuring measuring them and here's measuring them in utiles

662
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:38,580
Like like giving them like a utility using some kind of utility calculus to like objectively determine their marriage is

663
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,540
Nonsense, that's a meme. That's a meme. But what I'm really saying is I am not interested

664
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,220
I like I don't agree with Ben Shapiro on a ton of stuff

665
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,500
But one thing that I do totally agree with him on is that I am totally disinterested with how other people live their life

666
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:58,180
But I want them to have the total freedom to do whatever they want as long as they contribute in some way to the whole

667
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,500
So this this is a purely capitalistic system

668
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,780
I'm talking about here where I want you to have the freedom to do whatever you want to do

669
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:08,500
You just have to find a way to make people give a shit about it and and just in addition to that

670
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,700
I would like it

671
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:14,260
This is where like my personal thing is I would just really like it if everyone had as a priority that like

672
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,740
Okay, I'm gonna find a way to make my way in the world

673
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:23,220
But I'm going to keep in mind that my overall goal is to like also try to make things better in general in whatever way

674
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,540
I define that as I'm gonna try to make it better and obviously there's gonna be conflicts as to what makes things better

675
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:32,500
But that's what I want. That's what I want. So say say I make all my art stuff and it's like, you know

676
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:37,140
It never gets super big but people like it and it's and it is people liking it

677
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:43,540
It's people being feeling happy about the fact that that I they're watching or listening or reading the thing that I made

678
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:50,180
That the happiness level has gone up. They've got happiness points. Is that progress? Is that like what you think is a good idea?

679
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,940
I'll tell you exactly what usefulness art and and all that shit has there

680
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:59,300
There are times when human beings can no longer do the work that makes them valuable members of of society

681
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:05,380
At those times it is appropriate for them to do things like in consume art or or play video games

682
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:10,340
Or which is art. I'm not making the distinction there or just like do you know things that make the relax listen to music

683
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:16,100
Whatever to de-stress so they can wake up the next day and continue to be a slave to the to the human machine

684
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,660
That's what that's what we need them to be. So there's totally a place for that. Here's here. I agree with that

685
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,700
Okay, I just I just don't think of it like that. I just don't think I like to think in cold

686
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:33,140
Mechanical terms because I don't think of it like benefiting society. I just think oh, you know what? I'm glad that people enjoy myself

687
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,420
I'm glad I'm making a few people's lives a little better every so often

688
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:44,660
It's really funny. I don't care about making anyone's life better. Like I like I don't I don't care

689
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,180
People Ben is far more amoral than me consider

690
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,260
No, I'm completely amoral, but I just think that

691
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,780
I think the I think that I don't like the tone. I'm using that's all you're no here's what I say

692
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:03,540
You see I admit to being completely amoral, but you claim that you have some kind of moral compass

693
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,700
And I'm over here highest moral. I'm over here trying to dismantle it and show you that actually

694
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,540
You're not because your moral compass doesn't actually make any sense or point anywhere

695
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,940
Um, the right. That's what you're trying to do. That is what I'm trying to okay. It's spectacularly

696
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:21,220
Yeah, by okay by saying that like people should keep in mind like the greater good

697
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:27,380
You're just you're just asking people to go against human nature and it's just pointless like everyone human nature is weak

698
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,700
Human nature can't be trusted. We have to rise above it. Everyone you can't you can't rise above human nature

699
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,700
You just can't do it everyone by nature

700
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:40,100
That's a great like acts in a way acts in a way that like maximizes their own fucking good and like their own

701
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,020
So there's so much evidence. There's so much evidence that humans can in fact rise above human nature

702
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:48,340
Take for example the founding of the united states of america. It broke away

703
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,260
It was it was created by the enlightenment as a secular state in

704
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:56,900
Direct defiance to the old aristocratic systems of europe that shit was garbage

705
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,220
Yeah, they did it because they wanted to and nate. What does that mean?

706
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:05,540
Of course, they wanted to they were reacting to things they found in just because we have elevated our morality

707
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,540
And we're continually working all the time in philosophy to keep elevating human morality

708
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,460
I'm not I'm not gonna work through that. I'm not gonna work through this whole fucking

709
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:21,460
Thing i'm just gonna like just viewers at home just try as an extra try as a homework exercise to think about in what way

710
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:26,740
In what way the creation of the united states of america could have been, you know, what's the word?

711
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,540
Pragmatically motivated like for the Kurds creators like in what way could they have been driven?

712
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:37,140
Like, you know in in in some way that that serves their own self-interest. I'll bet you could think of a few

713
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,580
I don't throw jefferson and washington and adams under the bus

714
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:47,620
It's just saying saying saying that people should work for the greater good is just it's just asking the fucking impossible

715
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:52,820
Because people don't do that people people people act in accordance to maximize their own benefit

716
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,740
And like it just so happens. Well, not it's not entirely an accident

717
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,580
It's like I don't know just the way of things or whatever. It's a way things shake out that like

718
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:07,220
Generally people acting in their own benefit will will benefit the group at large, but not only it's a group

719
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,060
It's benefiting all the individuals. I will admit I will admit in a second that

720
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:17,540
No one is not selfish every single act we do is a direct action done in order to make our own lives better

721
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:22,020
I will happily admit that. Yeah, I just want people to consider the the large-scale ramifications of that

722
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,180
when I said when I said that um

723
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:28,100
Like where people like be people feeling happy about my stuff

724
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,860
Like that that isn't like a reason that I make anything. That's just a happy little bonus like a little extra

725
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,100
Like every time I get a comment saying man, this is really good. I really like this. I'm like, ah, cool

726
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:45,140
That's nice. You know and and and I and I I do admit that I sometimes make content because I know that people will like it

727
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:50,660
But not that's not ever the only reason I do it. It's never money. It's never other people

728
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,620
It's mostly to do with the fact that me wanting it to exist and it just so happens to benefit society

729
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:00,500
I don't think of it as as a like a thing that in in my head that I'm thinking all the time

730
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:05,300
Like it's strange that you think about it all the time, but it's fine. It's weird. I don't I don't do art

731
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,820
I don't do art for my own satisfaction because if no one was watching it

732
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:13,780
I wouldn't do it and I don't do art for other and I don't do art for other people's benefit because I don't care if it

733
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:18,980
Makes them happy. What I like. I don't know. I guess I do. I guess I do it to get their reaction or something

734
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,100
I guess I do it because I'm interested in people's reaction to it

735
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:27,060
I guess you get it like I do it because you want people to take you know to to value your opinion and I think that you're cool

736
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:32,500
I also just want to say that Davoo says that he agrees with Nate on the American Revolution and also with the enlightenment the rise of science

737
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,900
The way we swapped out right. I don't know what I'm already airing for slightly less terrible ideas like multiculturalism

738
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:42,980
Sometimes me and Davoo are absolutely on the same wavelength. Anyways, go ahead. Okay. Here's here's the thing

739
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:48,660
I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I'm still kind of sleepy. I'm man. It's been hours. I'm still sleepy. God damn, age wake up

740
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:53,860
Come on. No, no, no. Listen. Okay. Listen. I have this I have this idea. I don't know where I'm going with this

741
01:01:54,180 --> 01:02:00,580
Okay, so there was this dude in his side to find out he was he was he was like super good at painting right and

742
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,140
Hitler

743
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,060
Yes

744
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,220
Oh

745
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:18,500
So he was he was really good at painting and he just if he just went with that instead of like trying to benefit

746
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,860
Society because he was a patriot and he wanted to like help the German people initially

747
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:35,220
So what is this lovey-dovey bullshit? Oh art will fix all the problems of the world. No, that's not that's not how it works

748
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,340
Also is very good at painting. What is your point? There's no way he's good

749
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,500
Nate I have a question to you about your about your mentality and okay

750
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,620
My thing is just listening to this whole time because I haven't really been saying much is that

751
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:55,700
I can understand you saying that you want people to consider and try and have some sort of motivation when they create things to

752
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,700
for the greater good and

753
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:04,820
pushing humanity forward but my question is do we as individuals even have the capacity to truly understand the

754
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,060
the grand impact of anything we do

755
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,220
Because like we I

756
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:12,340
Who knows what's going to happen with our content, you know

757
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,780
Even like 10 years after we're dead or 10 years down the road from now

758
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,220
Like we don't know how it's going to go out there and proliferate into the world

759
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,140
So we can't really see the far-reaching impacts of anything we do. So

760
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,140
Is it

761
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:32,660
Is it I think outside the scope of human perception to understand the grand impact of anything that we do has in the world and beyond that

762
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,940
I think it's it's it's um

763
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:42,100
It's it's something that the the fact that Nate is the one that's saying this and he's not an artist

764
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:47,780
Means he has like the time to think about that like artists. I mean, I'm not a fucking like drawing artist. That's true

765
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:52,500
I would consider my what I what I what I mean by that is that I think I think for us

766
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:59,220
Um thinking about the greater good, you know, it's not worth thinking about it's just an extra taxing thing

767
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:05,780
Like oh, how will this benefit humanity you just you just have to let it happen if it does happen to benefit humanity

768
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,780
That's great. Whatever

769
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:15,220
Sorry, I would rather let I would rather let Nate think about that and just just just you know

770
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:21,220
Think about that in in the big grand scale and just let me do my little dinky thing in my in my own little head

771
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:26,420
Just just going along doing whatever I'm doing and if it just so happens to benefit humanity, that's good

772
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:29,300
I don't want to have to think about what I'm doing. You can't think about that

773
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:35,620
You can't think about the greater good with in everything you do because you you never know what the fucking larger

774
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,500
Amifications are going to be you can have some idea, but you'll never really know

775
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:45,220
It's totally fine. There's no objective standard of what to work for and fucking it's just not even fucking human nature

776
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:50,900
Like you're if you're a human being you're going to be doing what you think is going to fucking just get you the best outcome

777
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,620
And like yeah for for a lot of people

778
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:56,980
Yeah, benefiting the whole is going to benefit the individual

779
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,500
But in that case

780
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:04,580
They're they're going to do what benefits the whole of humanity just naturally because it also benefits them like okay

781
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,660
That's just it's it's all you can do is just kind of go with the flow and follow your fucking human nature

782
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,500
And most of the time just the way that just the way that it happens to shake out

783
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:20,340
Most of the time if you if you do that most people what they do will benefit the the larger fucking society

784
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:23,220
Usually and that's the best that's the best we can hope for

785
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,700
I would say I would say that

786
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:31,220
Largely largely it's a pipe dream to imagine that everybody could be thinking about the greater good all the time

787
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,300
Like if hitler was thinking about the greater good

788
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,900
Maybe he wouldn't have done what he did like maybe he would have like

789
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:42,180
You know put german resources to to fixing the economy without having to kill a bunch of people

790
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,660
In his mind he was saying the greater good

791
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:51,140
Well, I mean yeah, but like the the greater good for like the entirety of humanity like like you can't imagine

792
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,100
I can't I can't imagine a world where people

793
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,660
Like all like the majority of people will be working towards the goal of that

794
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:02,980
You just have to have these few people because like most people they just they're just dumb

795
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:08,100
We're we're apes we you know, it's pessimistic to say and to think that

796
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:15,940
Like everybody will not be able to be on the same page of humanity, but I think sometimes you just have to concede that not

797
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:20,020
You know expecting other people to take on your worldview like that

798
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,500
Um and use it and think about it

799
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:28,980
Hang on hang on no, I am not I'm not expecting people to adopt my same world

800
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:34,580
I'm fucking sick of this subject. Fuck you Nate. This sucks. I hate this. How is this my fault?

801
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:40,420
I just said my opinion and everyone's freaking out about it's not my responsibility. It's funny. It's funny. It's a funny meme

802
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:46,820
I'm over it. I just want to say all I want to say is just that ben we clearly and I don't think this is totally fine

803
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:52,740
We clearly have a different view. Yeah of like the capabilities of human beings and all our differences stem from basically the fact that

804
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:58,420
You know, I sort of think that people can aspire to higher things or like can perceive it and you don't and I believe

805
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:04,980
There is a level above talented above loyal that a nigger can aspire to

806
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,580
That is a great quote from negi huga. Okay, uh,

807
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,460
I wanted to say that for the most part

808
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,620
I think most of humanity the best they can do is just not get in each other's way

809
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:22,100
But there are you know, several people that can actually greatly benefit humanity

810
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:27,220
And you have to sometimes realize which person you are and do that

811
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,940
I'm one of the people that I don't want to

812
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:34,500
Kindre other people and I'm just gonna do my own thing in my own little corner

813
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,460
Well, that's exactly what I would hope for if you think that you're an obstacle get the fuck out of the way

814
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,540
That's perfect. That's exactly right

815
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,700
I have like an obstacle

816
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:51,220
Hey, mage called herself an obstacle not man. She's she's our old ball and chain. She's the old ball and chain

817
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:55,380
Of the whole pcb. Excuse me. I identify as purple

818
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,100
Purple purple ball and chain

819
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:05,300
Yeah, purple isn't an object purple is a concept. Yes, exactly. I am a concept. Oh, okay a wavelength. She's a wavelength

820
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:11,220
Yeah, I have a cool cool ending statement for the whole podcast

821
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,300
Before if we get if if nobody has

822
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,740
Yeah, I think we're wrapping up in those part. Are we we've already been going for like an hour

823
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:20,420
Well, we need to do questions for a while and you know, we can make statements, but yeah

824
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:25,540
Yeah, I have a good ending statement. I would say that as as we are in the pcp

825
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,380
Um

826
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:33,220
In general we are more passionate than we are money-grubbing. Yeah when it comes to to our art. Yeah, but

827
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:39,300
Um, we are all very much procrastinators in making that art. That's true. That's true

828
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,620
We're always just sort of fucking around

829
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:48,020
Yeah, and that that's the that's the story of the pcp the procrastinators. That's our origin

830
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,220
Yeah

831
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:55,460
Fade out. Yeah fade out credits roll. Well fade out and then fade back in because we gotta do questions. Yeah, that's right

832
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:59,300
Okay, let's uh, all right. That feels pretty good. Let's let's just pull these questions here

833
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,180
Uh, let's see what we got I that came on so suddenly I didn't have a time to actually look at them ahead of time

834
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,820
Like I normally like to do so. Okay. Let's see what we got

835
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:14,820
Okay, here's a filler question while I look for a better one at jen is maku domaro this this guy's always had some questions

836
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:21,540
Um, that guy that guy helps me with pokemon. Shit. That guy gave me. Yeah, that guy gave me a that guy gave me a

837
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,100
shiny a shiny rallet

838
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,980
Yeah, he gave me a score for my birthday. He gave me a shiny rallet and a name

842
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:48,900

Okay, so, uh, jen is maku tomorrow asks, uh, what would you guys like the next from software game to be?

846
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,580
They're all done with dark souls forever pirate game pirate game pirate game with dark souls physics

847
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:16,180
I want I want but dark souls but pirates. I want to bet the best. Well, I want it. I want it to be like the

848
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:22,980
I just want it to be dark souls but on pirate ships. I just want pirate ships. I there's never been a good pirate game

849
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:27,380
They've all been sort of okay, but never really good. They would be the best people to make a pirate game

850
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:33,140
I've always held this opinion. I love uh, yeah, they could they could they're great. They can do mech games

851
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,140
They can do you know medieval games

852
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:38,180
I don't see the connection to like yes, they make good games

853
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,820
But why specifically are they the best ones to make a pirate game?

854
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,540
Is it just because you like pirates and you like from software?

855
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,980
So obviously they're their games going to be the best. They made they made a great

856
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:52,420
If they made bloodborne if they made bloodborne but with pirates and pirate ships like moving ones then

857
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:58,580
You know, well, I'm just saying I basically like any any genre like with the dark souls formula applied to it

858
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:02,980
With the level of craft they put in I would pretty much instantly love because I love playing this game so much

859
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:06,500
I really want to make demon souls last night. I really want them to make kingsfield 4

860
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:12,500
Or whatever you played any of the kingsfield though. Yeah, I played one on digi bros that is like months late and hasn't come out yet

861
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:17,220
I think oh and boy. I think it was kingsfield 1 or 2. It fucking sucked

862
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,860
It was so bad

863
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:27,940
Well, here's here's another question at monkey away our frequent commenter says uh hitler used meth. Why don't you use meth?

864
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:33,460
Well, you know relevant solid. I mean just look at the benefits. Just look at the benefits

865
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:39,620
You got to you know, unite the german people. I know I know why it's because I just I don't have the courage

866
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,060
I don't have the courage that hitler had

867
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:47,060
I I agree. I feel like that with a lot of hard drugs and just drugs in general

868
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,540
Your cowards your cowards don't even don't even do meth like hitler

869
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,060
You're goddamn right. I have a joke for this bit. Yes

870
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,420
No, I don't

871
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:07,380
Well, the joke was you the joke was you I guess shout out to hitler for being a special member of this podcast

872
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,540
Yeah, shout out to hitler

873
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,540
Ha

874
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,100
Another guy at

875
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:19,700
Ladder and at the ladder analyst who's a guy I see commenting on just asked like your favorite adolf hitler quote

876
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,860
What's all the hitler questions?

877
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,940
I guess he is a popular guy monkey jones

878
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,580
Well, no, well, maybe it was because his birthday was only nine days before the recording of this podcast

879
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:34,340
Really? That's true. Yeah, April 20th shares his birthday with christian weston chandler as a matter of fact

880
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,220
Everyone was born on weed day. Yeah

881
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,780
That's that's great. Oh, and divu divu says that hitler's death day is tomorrow

882
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:48,340
Really? Oh, wow. What a celebration. Well, he's not actually dead. He's not actually dead. This was not intentional

883
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,420
And I did not know all the days

884
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:58,580
Also divu's birthday weird. I'm just saying mage. You were you were born in europe, which is basically like being born in germany

885
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:03,220
It's basically like being hitler. So i'm just saying it's very similar. It's very simple

886
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:09,060
Hey, here's a here's a super relevant question for today's episode. Uh at tpcrasnators

887
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:14,820
Uh, what's the name? Oh at jamie step 47 says ever considered getting a sponsor for the podcast

888
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,980
What is that? I'd certainly consider it. What would that even mean?

889
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:22,260
Like what would that be about us? I would just have like a solid like 10 minutes of hitler references and then someone asked about a sponsor

890
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,580
Oh, our sponsor for today's episode mind comp

891
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:29,940
Like in the middle of the podcast we take a minute and plug harry's razors or whatever

892
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:35,700
Yeah, that'd probably be it. I I'd do it man. I'd do it if the product was good. I would do it for the money

893
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:39,620
Yeah, I would do it for money. Yeah, I would do it for money. I don't care

894
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,540
Like I don't think we're losing a lot of integrity by doing that on this particular show

895
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:46,500
You know like like splicing that into there's none to lose

896
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:50,100
The pcb doesn't have much integrity to give up in the first exactly

897
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:55,460
Something like a like a I don't know like a fancily edited anime analysis video for example

898
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:58,500
Like there's not I don't see a place for like an ad in that but here

899
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:01,940
Yeah, I don't see the problem. I'd do it in a heartbeat if there was a good a good offer

900
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:09,060
Thing that I really like that I haven't bought for myself in a while. There's like these this little box and it has like yes

901
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,060
It's food

902
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:15,060
But it's like healthy food, but it's also very tasty food and it's and it comes in the box

903
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:20,020
And I forget what it's called. So I guess that's good because you know, I'll be I'll be kid cuisine

904
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,460
And no, no, no, it's like it's a very cute short name any here

905
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,700
Kid cuisine

906
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:32,260
It's some sort of insert word box. Uh, I don't know my nerd box. There we go

907
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:41,380
Get a nerd food delivered straight to your mouth or something like that. I know bento box. Yeah. No, not bento. I'm not

908
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:46,020
You were just saying you wanted you wanted the anime star

909
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,620
Yeah, because that would be cool anyhow

910
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,660
I'd like a box called get bento

911
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,300
I

912
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:00,100
Agreed. Oh, that would be good. Yes. It's just a asian bart simpson on the cover

913
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,300
Just just like uh, mr. Sparkle dr. Sparkle. Yeah. Yeah

914
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,780
Mr. Sparkle

915
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:14,420
Yeah, simpson. Yeah, I would be I would be fine with like, you know being sponsored by dad because I freaking love the thing

916
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:20,260
And I love the food they have because it's healthy and it's tasty. We should we should email every every corporation

917
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,340
It's a product you believe in. Yes, right

918
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,980
Uh, yeah, maybe we should look into that. Uh, okay

919
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,460
Here's a question that might be my favorite question

920
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:31,060
We've ever gotten and I know this is just because it pertains to my interest. You guys might not agree

921
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:41,540
But uh at gregory barry 2 says, uh, at what point do you feel analyzing an artwork crosses the line into conspiracy slash headcanon territory?

922
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,340
immediately

923
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:51,700
I I mean uh that uh to me that that feels like kind of like ben's pornography test

924
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,500
We're like it's hard. You like you just have to use common sense

925
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:56,900
You know, there's no like definition of when you're going too far

926
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:02,660
But you really just have at some point you need to step back and say like this is not what makes the pornography test up

927
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:07,940
By the way, that's not my invention. Don't be so humble ben. Don't be so well. I won't I would say

928
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,140
I would say it's probably if you ever have to even like

929
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:16,980
Tangentially reference anything outside that that's not in the text directly. You're probably crossing a line

930
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:20,180
Says the man who analyzed big horse at great detail

931
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,620
Well

932
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:27,140
That was total bullshit. I'm yeah, exactly. But it was the best thing ever. I'm not saying it loses value

933
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:31,060
Yeah, it goes from analysis to something else. That's pretty good

934
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:35,940
Like that's a pretty good guideline like if if you're referring if you're referring to something else

935
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:41,700
Like to inform your reading of the text something that is like not actually suggested in the text at all

936
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,700
then yeah, you're probably reaching and

937
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:50,100
Like unless you have really good reason like like unless like you knew that like the author was like friends with some

938
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,820
Other guy who wrote something and maybe they were tight or something

939
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,340
Unless you can't point to the thing itself and show me

940
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:03,220
I think yeah, I think yeah, I think it's fine as I think it's fine as long as at the end you say well, it's just a theory

941
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:19,380
Evangelion yeah that one and because they thought it was cool and whatnot and then

942
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,740
Trying to find meaning and

943
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,180
Reasons and whatever but like yeah, it was just because people thought like the creator side. It was cool

944
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:31,780
I would say that it's totally fine to have a yeah go ahead. You can go first

945
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:37,380
That's going into like like uh, are you reading the the the the thing right?

946
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:41,140
And I think it's it's fun to analyze like oh, what does this mean like thinking about it?

947
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:46,340
If it's in the thing you can you can ponder it. I don't mind people pondering something. Here's here's the thing. Yeah, okay

948
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:52,820
No, no you go. Okay. I was just gonna say that I am totally fine with people coming up with whatever cockamamie schemes

949
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:58,100
They want you know like like some of that game theory shit about like nests being sands like like you can go nuts

950
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:05,220
Go ahead and do it, but like I feel like the crucial step that is missing ben. Stop vaping stop fucking vaping god damn it

951
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:12,980
He's vaping for the passion man. You gotta let him do it bad

952
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,180
Yeah, yeah, you think I do you think you think I do this

953
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:20,180
For the money

954
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,860
It's for the craft it's for the craft for the love of the craft the artisan my artisan my artisan juice

955
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,100
Artisan vapes artisan juice

956
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:33,060
That I steeped myself in a still in in my in my granny's basement

957
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:37,140
Oh god, okay, but here's what I was gonna say that what I feel okay

958
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,140
So go ahead and come with ever crazy schemes you want

959
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:44,420
But I feel like the step that people forget so often is like after you've presented all this stuff

960
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:47,380
You have to do take the final step and say like okay

961
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:54,020
Now that we've brought all this information up does this actually seem reasonable in the slightest if the answer is no

962
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:57,540
You then say okay into the trash it goes. We were reaching on all of that

963
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:03,700
Please forget it like just you can keep in mind, but it was not true. So just move on it's not do not keep this here

964
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:08,500
When people reach it's when they reach like that and then pretend that they're not reaching

965
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:13,780
When they obviously are sure and it's even worse when a video like that like gets really big

966
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,500
And then everyone just starts quoting it as gospel when it's like

967
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,580
Anytime somebody's headcanon becomes popular

968
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:25,300
Um, that's when people start getting angry that the headcanon is real is not real

969
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,860
You know what that's the only time it's really bad

970
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:36,180
Yeah, major that whole I can relate to this so bad because the whole like uh, hey meditons ghost was a female shit

971
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:39,540
It's not it was never stated. It was never proven

972
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,660
But someone headcanon it it became popular people are now

973
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:47,700
Pronouncing it as the gospel and I have to deal with this cannon for years

974
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,100
I have to deal with this on my on my

975
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:55,460
Most popular video that has almost one million views and people just chime in it is like oh

976
01:19:55,540 --> 01:20:00,980
The mediton ghost was the female so is he male or female and I have to deal with this every single day

977
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,620
Yeah, mediton is david bow

978
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,860
Okay, but you know what you know what?

979
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:10,980
I don't blame people sometimes because like things like solar and like people thought he was the son of guin

980
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:16,260
Like there there was reasons to come up with that conclusion and the thing is like dark souls is deliberately vague

981
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:22,100
So like I I totally excuse stuff like that like they were just thinking about that and then like when when dark souls 3 comes out

982
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:27,780
And just proves like no incorrect like that was never the case. Yeah, well, it's always there's only a problem when

983
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:30,180
That's fine. I love heads too

984
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:37,220
Yeah, yeah, but that's the thing a lot of people they get a headcanon and then they get upset instead of surprise when it's not real

985
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:40,900
Like being a woman like the thing about crocodile and one piece being a woman, but yeah, yeah

986
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:43,380
Come on people. Come on. There's no evidence at all

987
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:47,780
Like if it ever comes like saying if say hey, are you were you ever born a woman?

988
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:51,060
Like for some reason this character is talking about that and he says actually no

989
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:55,540
I was born a man as you can see I'm still a man and then it's like everyone's going. Oh

990
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,380
Oh

991
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:02,100
Okay, like I it'll be okay. It'll be okay if they just say oh, well, I guess that's not real

992
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,300
But some people will get mad and they'll be like fuck this

993
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:07,860
Show

994
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:14,900
Drop like when it comes to like reading into like like theory crafting like I think you can

995
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:21,220
I think you can read whatever like meaning into the work you want like you can like you can read a thing and

996
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:25,620
And look at like I don't you you can you can take whatever lesson from it that you want

997
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:30,020
Or like you can you can look at it and be like uh, like when the when the characters do such and such

998
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:33,940
They you know, they're they're that's an embody like they're doing what they're doing there is like

999
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:38,580
Ah, it's typified by the Dunning Kruger effect or something or you can but then like

1000
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:43,700
You can't it's not fair to do you like you do that with your own interpretation of the work

1001
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:47,220
But it crosses the line when you read that into like the author's intentions

1002
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,700
And like

1003
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,420
Intention versus interpretation

1004
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:58,660
Yeah, it's not you you can't you can't just you can't like put shit on the author if you don't have like real good thing

1005
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:04,980
Like real like real solid like textual or like or like like word of god reasons to think them. It's not fair

1006
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,900
The the most pointless arguments people can have is like

1007
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:14,900
Which canon is the correct one? It's like my head canon is the correct one. No, my head canon is the correct one

1008
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:20,020
Well, that's just pure masturbation guys. Did you know that everyone in undertale is a black gay trans woman?

1009
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:24,020
I read human tana dude. I'm a big fan of human tail actually

1010
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:29,940
Wait, is that like an actual comic? I thought it was a tumblr. It was a tumblr. Yeah

1011
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:34,500
What else would it be? Let's be honest when when you uh

1012
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:40,100
Yeah, like when like when so like when someone like game theory comes out with like uh

1013
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:45,940
Is sands and papyrus you see you see sands and papyrus are very

1014
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:53,380
Similar to like the theory of the two halves of the brain to the left brain and the right brain like you can like

1015
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:58,020
You can interpret that if that way you you can look at that and be like

1016
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:04,740
Huh the dichotomy of sands and papyrus kind of reminds me of the left brain right brain dichotomy like that's fine

1017
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:10,500
But and I and I and I don't even think that that game theory is a particularly bad offender at this

1018
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:14,100
Like there are much worse people about this, but then if you go on to be like

1019
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:21,380
Like that was the point then you're retarded like then you're retarded like unless there's textual unless there's textual evidence

1020
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,380
Unless unless there's textual or metatextual evidence linking

1021
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:29,060
Like somehow suggesting that some kind of connection with the brain

1022
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:34,260
You're just stupid if you think if you then go on to be like oh, I see this is what it was meant to be

1023
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:40,740
Like I actually I actually quite like game theory because I like to see how he's connecting things

1024
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:46,900
Yeah, I don't actually mind game theory that much. Yeah, I love I love a man perform mental gymnastics for you know

1025
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:52,500
Like 20 minutes at a time. I've never watched game theory and really thought that they were trying I was being sarcastic by the way

1026
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:56,980
I actually really like they're one about the simpsons about finding spring field. It's actually really good

1027
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:59,940
And I like it that that one is good. Yeah, sure. So we're good

1028
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:04,580
I do generally like a game theory or two that the mental gymnastics is fun

1029
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:08,020
Like just to see how far you can connect the dots if you felt like it

1030
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:13,220
But how am I with fucking mental pirouettes? Can I do off this goddamn fucking it's it's it's an exit

1031
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:17,940
It's a brain exercise. It's like yeah, all those things. Yeah, I like but then I like it out there

1032
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:21,380
I like an out there interpretation of things. I think that's valuable. Yeah

1033
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:27,540
Yeah, I never like accepted them as like true for whatever. It's really fun to see how he can you know

1034
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:31,460
All I'm saying is watching games theories like watching ancient aliens

1035
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:37,140
Yeah, all I'm saying is people just just keep that final step where you say, okay, we heard all this

1036
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:43,140
Is this reasonable? If not, you know, treat it just a theory. Yeah, treat it just a theory

1037
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,820
Thank you, uh, Gregory Barry for that incredibly juicy question

1038
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:49,700
I'm gonna put that down as my favorite question. We've ever gotten everyone

1039
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:53,620
That's the standard of a question that you should be asking. I'm here. Oh, let's clap it

1040
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,500
What was the question how what was the phrasing of it?

1041
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:05,300
The the phrasing was uh by at gregory berry 2 at what point do you feel analyzing and artwork crosses the line into conspiracy slash headcanon territory?

1042
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,540
Real solid

1043
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:09,860
But we yeah, yeah

1044
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:17,060
Uh, okay. Let's yeah, I got like two more little ones. Uh at pond pondi dator at pondi dator asks

1045
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:21,300
I have literally no friends or aspirations. What do I do here?

1046
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:25,220
Don't recommend suicide unless you have a simple and easy method to suggest

1047
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,060
make some

1048
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:31,300
Yeah, make some friends or some aspirations. You gotta have that's really easy to say though

1049
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:36,100
Okay, well, actually surely you can do one or the other

1050
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:40,260
I think aspire to make a friend. There you go. We solved one of the problems right there

1051
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,820
You can't just say that like if he's actually

1052
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:50,580
Like seriously though, I think something to do if you don't have aspirations is to kind of just start like consuming a lot of media

1053
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,260
And then kind of start

1054
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:56,980
I think he probably does that looking looking for ins maybe but like doing it in a way that you're kind of like looking

1055
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:02,180
For something to kind of resonate with you beyond the fact of just like i'm sitting here passively consuming something

1056
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:06,900
I think that's like that idea. Yeah, most of my ideas come from the desire to emulate something

1057
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:12,980
I find really impressive although that is a bit skewed towards the idea that this person should have artistic aspirations

1058
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:15,140
Maybe he could start reading. Well, I mean, I mean, you know

1059
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,820
Because like if you watch if you watch like an anime or something about basketball

1060
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:22,980
You're just like, man, I want to go fucking shoot some hoops. Like you can do that too basket. Yeah. Yeah, I guess

1061
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:27,460
I think I think the the the thing you should do if you're in a situation like that

1062
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,460
You don't know if you have any

1063
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:35,140
Any because I felt like this if you don't know that you have any aspirations any goals any desires to have a skill

1064
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,620
In any, you know way

1065
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:43,780
Just think of about what you already do and what you enjoy doing and if you know if it's you know something

1066
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:48,580
You know, you you probably have one thing that you think well, I could never make a career of that

1067
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:52,020
But maybe you could just look into it. I was something like eating

1068
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,820
If it's something like I really like

1069
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,540
Um eating then maybe I don't know become a chef

1070
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:04,900
Something something just just choose anything that you like already and then work with start doing something you like

1071
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:11,620
Yeah, yeah, even if you think oh, I'm not really good at this or whatever. Uh, don't let that you know

1072
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,420
Be

1073
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:21,220
Hold on words. Just good. Yeah. Yeah. Don't don't don't don't let that don't just try to say is don't let your memes be dreams

1074
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,300
Get out there and live them. Yeah

1075
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:30,420
Don't let the lack of quality if you might think, you know, you lack of quality discourage you because like your lack of quality

1076
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:34,020
Because honestly a lot of people

1077
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,820
Especially artists like to be down on themselves thinking. Oh, they're not good enough for whatever they're doing

1078
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:45,700
And the feeling of not being good enough is probably gonna haunt you and a lot of other people myself included probably until

1079
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,500
The days end for me. So

1080
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,540
I don't think you'll ever reach the point

1081
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:57,540
At least a lot of people probably will never reach the point where they're satisfied with themselves and their quality of content

1082
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:02,740
No, but it's the journey. Yeah, it's the journey. That's right. That's right seeing yourself improve over time

1083
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:07,220
Sometimes like oh, hey taking like a drawing from two years ago and comparing to a current drawing

1084
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:11,780
Oh, like, hey, I never noticed how much I've improved. That's kind of very satisfying

1085
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,420
And like I will say about

1086
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:19,380
About like watching yourself improve. Don't think about that. Don't don't think consciously

1087
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:24,500
Oh, if I do stuff, I'll improve because then you'll you'll you'll you'll see like one week ago

1088
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:28,900
And then you'll find no improvement and you'll feel like nothing is changing and then you'll get

1089
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:35,620
Just just do what you'll do. Yeah, do whatever you enjoy doing and just do it over and over again

1090
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:39,780
And then in a couple years just see what's gonna happen because something will probably happen

1091
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:44,580
Whatever you whatever you feel like doing whatever you want to do take just take it one like mini projects at a time

1092
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:47,940
Just set yourself like one little goal like I'm gonna draw this really small

1093
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:54,100
I'm gonna I'm gonna draw this thing or I'm gonna sing this thing or something and then just do don't worry about anything else

1094
01:28:54,100 --> 01:29:00,020
Just do whatever it takes to make it happen. Just just do it make it happen be like, okay. This is how that came out

1095
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:05,540
Um, let me now. Let me try this this next thing. Yeah, just just focus just focus on the task at hand

1096
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:10,260
Yeah, and if it's like some sort of like little something that you put on like on the internet

1097
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:15,220
And like if no one pays attention to it at first or like, you know, you get some discouraging comments

1098
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:18,660
Don't pay mine to those everyone who starts

1099
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,620
Like at the beginning has to deal with it

1100
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:25,460
I would say I would say just like just set yourself set yourself

1101
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:28,580
Just set yourself a goal just just set yourself some little goal

1102
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:34,260
Just think of something you can do some attainable goal that you think that you're confident you can reach and then

1103
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:39,700
Do it for yourself do it because you want to and yeah, I would suggest even if you're starting at something

1104
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:44,020
And it is something that's like post-able online. I would say like don't put it online like immediately

1105
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:48,740
I think if you just kind of keep it to yourself for a while like and let your it was an interesting

1106
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,300
Kind of metaphor that someone once said that like

1107
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:55,060
Like your creativity when it's young is like kind of like a person when they're young when they're a baby

1108
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:58,900
They have like the fontanella in their head and it's soft and like if it gets hurt it can like kill you

1109
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:05,060
Your creativity is the same way if someone fucking like shoots you down right when you're starting and you're still kind of soft

1110
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,220
It could destroy all of your like

1111
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,660
Motivation to keep going

1112
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:13,140
But if you just like keep it to yourself and just kind of like take pride in your little steps forward over and over again

1113
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:14,100
In like six months later

1114
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,540
Then you start to post things online as someone comes by and is like oh, it's gay

1115
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:21,220
It's like, you know, you've been doing it enough that you've had enough confidence in yourself. It's like, I don't fucking care

1116
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:26,100
You're gay and if you're just and if you're just starting out don't compare to like pros because there's no point

1117
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:29,620
All right, just just compare to yourself just only and compete with yourself

1118
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:31,060
and like

1119
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:36,500
Dad, I want to say I want to say because we've only been talking about skills the the friend thing

1120
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,740
I will

1121
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:46,100
It's really it's really important to know to know like if you if you find skills too

1122
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:51,460
Troublesome and you're like, I don't know I just want to I just want to have a friend like if you have one or the other

1123
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:54,420
Here's how you make a friend you either if you if you go to school

1124
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:58,660
You just act like a complete retard and hope somebody notices like go out

1125
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:04,820
Go out expecting to be a laughing stock and nobody likes you because that's how you already feel

1126
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:07,860
You already feel that nobody likes you. So if you just do some loud shit

1127
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,820
He hates himself. Good. It's only up from here

1128
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:15,380
Yeah, but you have to you have to make your help yourself be heard because if you're just like a quiet person

1129
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,300
You don't talk to anyone don't have any friends

1130
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,660
People will just think of you as the person who doesn't want to talk to anybody

1131
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:24,500
If you go out into the world and you like

1132
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:27,220
Display a willingness

1133
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,700
To make a fool of yourself and not give a shit

1134
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:33,940
Even if you do in fact make a fool of yourself like you still look like the cool guy

1135
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:39,380
Because because you were willing to do it like making making a fool of yourself is no big deal

1136
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:45,140
But like not giving a shit about making a fool of yourself is is is is the big deal and everyone likes that and also

1137
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:49,300
Also for people who are not in school if you're if you're like not in school

1138
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:52,260
You're you're just living at home. You don't have a job. You don't know what you're doing with your life

1139
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:56,500
You don't know you don't know any people you don't you can't just hang out in a bar or whatever

1140
01:31:56,820 --> 01:32:02,100
Uh get a job like go just get a menial job and you will meet a coworker and that will be your friend

1141
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:07,060
You you'll you'll just work through it like that. Oh wait, that's always there's always smaller steps to go to to find

1142
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:11,940
Let me let me get a job is actually great advice. I was gonna say nothing else going on

1143
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:16,900
What I was going to suggest is just like I'm going to assume that you are a uh an able-bodied

1144
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,340
You know like like high school or college age person

1145
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:23,620
And and that you're in the situation like that and you have the ability to do these things

1146
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,780
So that being the case I would say yeah

1147
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:32,100
Like find first of all you got to find an interest and then just go find the group around that is involved in that interest

1148
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:32,900
Like a club or something

1149
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:35,700
But really the essence here is to put yourself in situations

1150
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:39,860
Where people cannot ignore you where you where you are imposing on people

1151
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:44,020
So they have to deal with you because like it or not those people will become your friends

1152
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,140
And they leave them no choice in the matters leave them no choice

1153
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:53,140
I just want to input a caution like don't get too emotionally invested in the first person you make friends with

1154
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,660
And like don't get too attached as well

1155
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:01,380
Like even if it's a friend online, especially if it's a friend online don't get too attached with them initially

1156
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:03,940
Even if you're hitting off very well because

1157
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,620
Some people are crap and sometimes some people might feel

1158
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:12,580
Like like you're smothering them and they might start, you know backing away from you. So

1159
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:18,820
We should probably have like a whole podcast of friends. Like how to make friends. That's a good one. That's a great idea

1160
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:24,020
Yeah, there's a lot there's a lot to unpack there may just may just really write about that because like you can

1161
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:28,660
You got to get like a starter friend sometimes like a ben saint and work your way up to like the best guy ever

1162
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:38,820
Don't worry ben there is so sometimes you can train your ben saints to be better sometimes you can elevate them too

1163
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,220
sometimes

1164
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:44,180
That's such a sick burn. I can't even

1165
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,940
Okay, well, I'm not even I'm not even mad. I'm just like

1166
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:53,780
I just want to I just want to close out that question if we're done with that

1167
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:56,260
Okay, that because he said like, you know, I don't know if I'm ever gonna

1168
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,780
You know have a passion or have friends, um, especially with passion

1169
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:03,300
But also with friends too, uh, if if it's bothering you that you don't have it

1170
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:06,580
That means that you can because if you had no passion, you wouldn't be worried about it

1171
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:12,020
Yeah, so there is there is a passion there waiting to be unlocked. You just haven't stumbled upon it yet

1172
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:17,300
Also like movies anime and whatever media like to romanticize the whole passion thing

1173
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:19,940
Like love is never like how you know

1174
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:25,300
The movies describe it and same with like friendships and passions like you don't have to be super into it

1175
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:29,700
It doesn't have to consume your whole life and you don't have to tear yourself over it

1176
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,780
Like if you're just like, you know happy with what what little you have

1177
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:40,260
That's fine. Don't don't stress yourself like for not caring more or wanting to do more or whatever

1178
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,740
Do it in your own pace

1179
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,900
And and very very last thing on this subject. I just wanted to say that I have a last thing as well

1180
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,700
Okay, I'll say my first last thing you can say your last last thing

1181
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:54,580
Uh, I was just gonna say keep in mind you're I I'm getting I would guess that you're fairly young

1182
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:57,860
Or at the very least like you haven't really established yourself in the world yet

1183
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:02,100
Like the the confidence to you know go out and do things that comes with just like

1184
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,660
Doing like having achieved things in your life

1185
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,580
Uh really makes the rest of this a lot easier like the rest kind of just falls into place

1186
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:13,220
So I would emphasize achieving some goals like find out what you want to do and work towards that

1187
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:19,060
And even just the act of working towards it will give you inherent confidence to like just get better all this whole life

1188
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:24,580
Shit, you'll be better off right and the last thing I want to say is that if you if you do actually want to kill yourself

1189
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,660
Here's a here's a quick

1190
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,220
No, no, no, no

1191
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:33,940
Bring that up. Well, yeah, he's like don't recommend suicide unless you have a simple and easy message

1192
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:37,780
Here's the easy way to do it right get all the savings you have

1193
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:42,820
And then buy a one uh one uh one way plane ticket to a third world country a random third world country

1194
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:47,700
And then just uh exist and if and if you're okay if you can if you can survive then

1195
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:52,100
You deserve to to live and then you can do cool things and you'll be like real cool

1196
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,140
Uh, that's a cool idea because like if you're about to kill yourself

1197
01:35:55,220 --> 01:36:00,340
Like just Jesse was saying this the other day instead just start a new life somewhere else and see how it goes

1198
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:04,900
Using like all your money because like then you're not dead. You get to try again at the very least might work out

1199
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,980
I've literally I literally

1200
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:12,260
I I did the I went to google earth and I did uh show me a random place and I clicked on it

1201
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:16,580
I was like, yeah, I could go there. I guess because I was feeling real down at the time

1202
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:19,220
I was thinking I could I could just buy a plane ticket there. I have the money

1203
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,780
But then I kept spinning it and then it was like

1204
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,740
There's too many

1205
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:30,980
And now i'm looking at that too many to choose and beam in my room real enticingly. That's uh, I don't have any beams in my house

1206
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:33,060
That's why I'm

1207
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:38,580
Oh, thank god for the new code standards. No no exposed beams

1208
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:44,420
Uh, okay. Well, let's go to our last question here by at mr. No name 2001

1209
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:50,180
Asks, what's the worst thing any of you have ever done? The answer is this podcast

1210
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,340
That's for a listen everybody

1211
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:54,420
The answer the answer is um

1212
01:36:54,740 --> 01:37:00,180
The answer is my little pony analysis and if you want to hear more of my my thoughts on that go listen

1213
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:04,340
Go listen to the latest fucking uh rowdy fuckers cop killers where we dive deep

1214
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:10,420
We dive deep into our innermost feelings on that subject. I actually have a story. I want to say I think that's the worst thing

1215
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:15,380
I was like six or seven years old and there was this girl and she had a lot of like

1216
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:20,660
Little miniature animal things and I was really big into those little miniature animal things

1217
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:26,740
And like she had like I think I saw like all of them and they were really cute

1218
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:31,860
But um one day I was walking around and I saw it was dropped like somewhere on the street

1219
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:35,380
And I knew it was hers because no one else had like this little zebra one

1220
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,940
And I picked it up and I was like

1221
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:42,740
You know what if you're not going to take care of it. I might as well keep it and I never gave it back

1222
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:50,020
Give it to a good home. Yeah. Hey, hopefully you took care of it. I I mean that's basically what ash did with charmander

1223
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:54,900
That's true. Hey, okay. You know what I've got one since this reaction down

1224
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:59,300
This is I think this is actually the the evilest thing I've ever done one time when me and ben were kids

1225
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:04,660
We were just kind of like lying on the couch sort of like parallel to each other and then just for absolutely no reason

1226
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:08,580
I just heel dropped ben in the stomach for no reason. I just thought it would be funny

1227
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,540
Really funny

1228
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:22,100
It was very funny actually no, I was terrified because I really felt my slip myself slip into sociopathy for a second there

1229
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:28,020
I really just lost all all you know, like companionship with humankind and just decided to hurt someone for fun

1230
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:32,020
No, not okay. Don't don't do it. Very. I'm sorry ben

1231
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:38,020
Yes, I'm not notice. I'm not forgiven notice. I'm not forgiven. No

1232
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:43,140
We'll we'll we'll see about that. I'm gonna hold that one over you for a little longer

1233
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:48,260
Do you remember that ben? Do you actually remember that? I'm just curious not like I remember

1234
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:54,100
I think I remember like the day that it happened. I don't really remember like it was that traumatic it happening

1235
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:59,060
I because it like I didn't see it coming. You know, yeah for no reason. It was yeah

1236
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:03,780
Yeah, it was just like a sudden like oh god. I am in so much pain and I can't breathe

1237
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,500
I was such a bad ass back then

1238
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:10,580
Go back. I have to go back. Yeah

1239
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,980
to those days

1240
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:18,820
Yeah, I've always stretched this for almost two hours. Oh, all right. Hang on. I I have a I have the worst thing

1241
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,900
I ever did. Okay. It's a pretty big one

1242
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,860
The when I was a little boy and then the school cafeteria

1243
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:25,060
um

1244
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:28,340
You have like your meal and then you can have like a pudding a dessert thing

1245
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:31,860
And I always chose the crackers because I liked I like savory things

1246
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:34,500
So I chose the crackers there's a little two pack of crackers

1247
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:36,820
You put them on the on your tray you go and eat them

1248
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:40,740
But I I always I always wanted to eat them in the playground afterwards

1249
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:44,660
So I put them in my pocket and I ate them in the playground even though I'm not allowed to

1250
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,820
That's the worst thing I've ever done. Wow

1251
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:48,820
And uh, I still feel remorse

1252
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:49,620
Really?

1253
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:53,060
You're such a bad ass dude. Did you did you only do that once? Actually, no

1254
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:56,580
There's actually more to that because I used to do that all the time until

1255
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:02,100
To the point where the lunch lady would search my pockets for it because I wasn't allowed to to eat it in the playground

1256
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:09,380
In no repeat offender in in I know like all throughout like elementary school middle school and high school

1257
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:10,180
um

1258
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,300
I like

1259
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:16,100
You could you could buy lunch at school and lunch came with like a roll and you would like take your tray

1260
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:20,420
And you would go through the thing and you would take one item from each thing and like the first station was like rolls

1261
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,300
And I would just go and like take rolls all the time

1262
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:27,540
I would start in the line get in the line take a roll and then leave the line and go back to my seat

1263
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:32,340
And like I just did this like my for so long because I love that bread. I fucking love it's great

1264
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:36,420
That bread was so good. It was so like doughy and just like yeah powdery and just like

1265
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:41,220
It's just so succulent and like people would always tell me like ben. You're just stealing you're just stealing there

1266
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:43,460
And I would be like I don't I don't like I don't care

1267
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:48,660
Yeah, like for a while I tried to justify like no the roll is not actually lunch like it's not a part

1268
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:51,860
It's like it's it's like its own thing. It's just like a thing that comes with lunch

1269
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:54,020
I don't have to really buy it

1270
01:40:54,020 --> 01:40:56,820
But eventually I was just like lunch is not lunch. Let's be serious

1271
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,860
Eventually I was just like I just want it and I don't want to pay for it

1272
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:04,340
So I'm gonna take it because I think I deserve to have the things that I want without paying for them

1273
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:09,140
I think that that is about pirating games. Yeah, I just do it. I don't care. I do not care. Yep

1274
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:13,700
All right, does tom want to share a story. Are you a bad person to tom?

1275
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:16,420
Let's see. I think my story is kind of similar to mage

1276
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:19,940
I think but I don't know is like it's like taking advantage of stupid people really a crime

1277
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:20,900
I don't know

1278
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:25,940
Because what what I did is is that back in the day when pokemon cards were huge you made a patreon

1279
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:31,700
Well, that was a terrible mistake as you can clearly see now now all my passions become about the money

1280
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:36,580
No, so I pokemon cards were a big thing and I didn't have any pokemon cards

1281
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:39,140
But what I did have at the time what's a boy to do

1282
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:41,860
Exactly it was it was a big problem

1283
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:45,540
So I well the only things I had that even slightly resemble pokemon cards

1284
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:48,660
I remember like back when before anyone knew what pokemon was

1285
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:51,860
Kentucky fried chicken had little like kids meals that came with pokemon stuff

1286
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:56,900
And one of them was a deck of playing cards like just like regular deck of cards. I had pokemon on them

1287
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:58,660
I don't know how this worked

1288
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:04,980
But I had the the brilliant idea of writing in sharpie just like fake stats and moves on all these pokemon cards

1289
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:12,260
And then traded them to people for real pokemon cards and it worked. That's their fault. That is their fault

1290
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:16,740
What did you trade them for pokemon cards? It was it was just like from kfc

1291
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:19,860
Like you know, they get like they have like kids meals that come with little toys

1292
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:23,460
It was a deck of like playing cards like ace and five of clubs and shit like that

1293
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:28,580
But I just wrote in marker pokemon moves on them and traded them to people for real pokemon cards

1294
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,020
And it worked

1295
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:33,780
Okay, but I went I got advanced later a couple years later

1296
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:38,180
Uh like the third set or something came out and my neighbor at the time who was a dick and we hated him

1297
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:40,580
But we had to hang out with him because he was the only kid in the neighborhood

1298
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:44,420
He had lieutenant surge ritu and I thought it was the coolest shit ever

1299
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:47,620
And I was like I want this fucking card and he wouldn't trade for it

1300
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:52,260
So me and my sister devised the perfect plan to get it from it because because he was an idiot

1301
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:55,140
what we did is we went home we went on my dad's computer and

1302
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:59,540
We looked up an image of the card and I drew it on a piece of paper

1303
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,140
And then I drew it

1304
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:06,820
I copied it down as like in like crayon and pencil or whatever and then I we went to his house and we convinced him that

1305
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:12,900
It was the original card that they eventually made copies of and traded him the fake one for the real one and it worked

1306
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:19,540
It was amazing. Oh my god. That's the ultimate. My dad works for a nintendo story. That's the ultimate

1307
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:24,420
That's crazy that that worked. So you have you have a literal history of forgery. I do

1308
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:26,500
Yep

1309
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:29,140
I'm working on drawing my hundred dollar bill right now

1310
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,620
Going to go down in the bank. It's going to be great

1311
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:39,380
In crayon, of course. Yeah, exactly. That's working. Awesome. No. No those people all deserved it. They all deserved it

1312
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:43,060
I don't care. Crayons should die. How do why why do we have crayons?

1313
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:49,780
Yeah, good questions. Crayons are great. I want crayons right now. They're good. They're good crayons, but they're not the kind you're

1314
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:54,420
accustomed to, you know, like pastels are technically crayons, I think aren't they?

1315
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:58,980
I'm talking like the like oil pastels. If they're not called crayons, they're not crayons, my friend

1316
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,700
Crayon is the brand. Well

1317
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:07,060
Squares are rectangles. Maybe pastels or crayons. I don't know. Squares were rectangles

1318
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:11,620
Okay, well before we go for another three hours on this, uh, you know, this is some deep shit, man

1319
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:16,820
This crayons conundrum. Let's uh, let's wrap this up. So everybody send us more questions at tpcrasnators
