1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Mmmmmmmm, it's another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm starting, I guess. I guess I'm starting.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Another week has gone by, another week down the toilet, as always, and it's just me again.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But you know what? Rain or shine, neither hail nor sleet nor fog of war can stay these couriers from their appointed podcast.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's episode, whatever, 309.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And it's the old, what do you call it, the old Bencast, haven't had one of these in a while, but sometimes you just gotta do it.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So it's time for me to bloviate and waste both of our time to fill air.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's not true, I won't do that. I will touch upon some things that happened this week, and then I will go to voicemails and we'll just see how long that takes naturally.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's see, what happened? What was the week of April 10th like for me? It was my birthday on Thursday.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It was my birthday and I went to my parents' house and they, we got my eyes tested. I did an optometry appointment.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That was fine. That was great. They blew a little puff of air into my eye, which I don't remember that one.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't remember that one happening before. It felt weird. I didn't like it, but oh well.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I have the opportunity to pick some new frames when I get new glasses, but I don't know if I will.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know if I can really improve my classic look, which is just the kind of thick rectangular dark frames. I like them.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't think, I don't think it gets much better than that for me.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My prescription, I hadn't been to the optometrist in like 10 years, thereabouts, but apparently my prescription has not changed hardly at all.

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She said just a minor tweak, so that's pretty good. Glad I'm not deteriorating, at least not in that department.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
One place that I am deteriorating, in a sense. I've been, I've lost a bunch of weight again.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is, I guess this is now a pattern for me, is that I gain like 50 pounds and then I lose like 50 pounds.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm down to, I weighed myself either than I was down to 170. I was almost, no I think I was briefly above 200, maybe around Christmas or so.

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now it's April, or like three months into the year and I've lost like 30 pounds about, so I don't know, I guess I should just stop doing that.

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I should just, I should just stop doing that. I don't see any need for it.

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I've not been really exercising that much, I've just been dieting, but I guess that's sufficient.

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It would probably, it would be better if I was lifting. I still haven't started lifting again.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I know I've been saying I was going due since the start of the year and it's been three months.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think I've now been not lifting for probably about as long as I was lifting before New Year's and then I stopped because I got sick.

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Everybody got sick with COVID.

28
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Then you put it off and you put it off and you put it off and this is what happens.

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Another week down the toilet and another and another and another.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ah well. What else, what else?

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, I got, I got a funny video of my mom playing Phantom's Revenge.

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It was very funny. She, I might, I'll probably post it or I'll probably, I'd like to post it somewhere.

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Like maybe I'll cut it down to like some funny bits when she like talks about dabbing and stuff.

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That was pretty funny. She thought she was not going to be able to play it and I said, and I said, no, it's just menus.

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like you don't have to be like a gamer. It's just like a puzzle to solve.

36
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
My mom likes puzzles. So maybe that convinced her.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But she, I mean, she, we didn't spend too long on it. I think she was, she was playing it for maybe like half an hour.

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And, you know, she, she kept, she kept forgetting which button was like, oh, what's this?

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hello.

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh my God.

41
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hello, Ben.

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hello, Giv. You sound like you've been punched in the throat.

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes. It's just a bit of a throat. Don't worry about it.

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was streaming. I was streaming Elden Ring. I forgot. I didn't notice.

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You were streaming Elden Ring?

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I sure was.

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That can't be legal.

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, you've been living under a rock, Ben St. There's so many. There's so many streams.

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's committing 60 frames a second of copyright infringement.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I wouldn't say 60 frames.

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's, that's FromSoft's intellectual property.

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What are they going to do? Come to my house and congratulate me on being such a cool person?

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Here's what they're going to do. They're going to come, they're going to come to your house.

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They're going to stand outside the fog door at your front door. They're going to walk through.

56
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They're going to start chucking dung pies and black fire bombs.

57
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They're going to dodge roll through your, through your attack, and then they're going to punish you for heavy damage.

58
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They're going to put their divine weapon from the back.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They're going to chop your tail off and receive the mighty, the mighty spear that, you know, obviously would result from such a thing.

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And then they're going to apply a pine resin, gold pine resin to their weapon and electrocute you.

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then won't you feel stupid?

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But I have a phase two, though.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, shit.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And that's where I, that's where I jump up onto the ceiling and I delete the floor and the floor is gone and they fall to their death.

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How'd you get a phase two? I want a phase two.

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Mom, wait, how does, how does that thing go? Like, how G-Wiz?

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
G-Wiz, how come, G-Wiz, Bill, how come your mom lets you have two phases?

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

69
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I was just, I was just complaining about my week.

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The Hulk based.

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It was based. I know, right? Tell me about it.

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What did I say? I was saying, I got my mom to play Phantom's Revenge and it was pretty funny.

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, what did she think?

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I recorded some of it.

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She thought, I think, well, I think she was, I think she thought it was pretty cool.

76
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think she thought it was like, wow, how does a person even make a video game?

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Which is fair.

78
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And she, I was saying, she felt, she was like, oh, I'm not a gamer. There's no way I can play it.

79
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I said, no, it's just a puzzle. It's just menus.

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And she, and indeed, she died twice.

81
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But like her second death, she made it, she made it further the second time.

82
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She, she knew what she had to do. She just messed it.

83
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Like she knew she had to take out the Soniches with the guns.

84
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
She just messed up and didn't select the right one.

85
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So she accidentally killed one without a gun.

86
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And so Virginia got shot and she was like, ah, darn, I lost it. I wasn't supposed to do that.

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That was as far as I saw her get.

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But she could have beat it with perseverance.

89
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's the easiest game ever made.

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Even my mom can play it.

91
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The easiest game.

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, I suppose it doesn't have reflex requirements. You just need to click on the right things.

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Exactly. There's no iframes.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
God, Elden Ring. All right. I don't want to talk too much about Elden Ring.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But I will say, very nice.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay.

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Very nice.

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I am, I might, I might get Elden Ring at some point.

99
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think my computer could probably handle it.

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What was the last big game with lots of detail that you played?

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know that I have ever played such a game on my computer.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Not even any other Dark Souls or on your current computer?

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, I have not played any Souls on my computer.

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Wow. So cool.

105
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I played Bloodborne on a PS4.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's not your computer though.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not, it's not.

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't, Hades is like the most, the most graphics game.

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, you've played Noita, isn't that like intensive just because of the amount of pixels doing things?

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It can be, yeah. It can be a bit intense on the old hard drive.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And I mean, it runs fine. Sometimes it crashes, but everybody's like, I don't know.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I feel like it's probably fine.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I mean, you could turn the settings down in Elden Ring and it'll be fine probably.

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I was thinking of going on sale, but I asked on Twitter and people said it would probably be a while until it went on sale.

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So maybe I should just buy it.

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean, I was wondering that as well.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I expected it to go on like, oh, Steam Summer Sale, special Elden Ring as soon as I had already bought it.

118
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But like, it's the Steam Summer Sale is currently happening. It's not there.

119
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So like, yeah, probably, probably it'll be a Christmas thing if that.

120
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Hmm. Yeah.

121
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I would be willing to wait like two months for like $30 off or something.

122
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But do I want to wait like eight months?

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I just said fuck it because I wanted to have a fun time.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a good reason to do anything.

125
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I went, I've been like, I made punk and she's going to be a dagger assassin with a bow.

126
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
She's going to stab people in Elden Ring. Yeah.

127
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
She's going to stab people. I've been stabbing people in the back. I've been sneaking past things.

128
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The stealth, right? Dark Souls, it's linear.

129
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You go through it and you're expected to at least encounter all the enemies.

130
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But with the stealth mechanic in this game, you can like just get past a lot of dangerous looking things.

131
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's quite fun figuring out how I can like not trip the aggro range and like sneak past a whole group of enemies and climb a ladder.

132
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know, I haven't really seen anyone play in stealth.

133
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I've seen like spellcasters and I've seen like I've heard people talk about like strength faith builds.

134
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah. I mean, big swords are cool.

135
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But I've increasingly found that I prefer in any Souls game the ability to do an attack that takes the fewest animation frames possible before I'm allowed to roll.

136
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So that's why I'm choosing a dagger. So it does like you can do like one attack in like a very short time and then have plenty of time to dodge out of the way of the incoming.

137
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Slice.

138
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Interesting.

139
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You could go in and stab them a little bit, jump back, stab them a little bit.

140
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And that makes it easier for me. It takes longer, I think, unless the dagger's really good.

141
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But there's bleed damage build up and occasionally they just explode in blood. That's great.

142
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Mmm. I like the sound of that exploding with blood.

143
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Mmm. Getting hungry. Just thinking about it.

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah. I haven't played a Souls since. I played some Bloodborne but not that much.

145
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And I played Dark Souls 1 and like half of Dark Souls 2. So it's been a while.

146
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But I like the idea of just exploring.

147
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh yeah.

148
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think I would just like exploring the world and I might get a little mad at some bosses but I can deal with it.

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's basically what I've been doing.

150
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You get your Horus at some point. I think I sequence broke and just walked the wrong way and missed a lot of the tutorial at the beginning.

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But I found my Horus and it came to me.

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And then it was really just fun to look at the rolling hills and cliffs and be like,

153
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
oh, there's a cool looking church at the top of that thing. How do I get there and scanning the horizon?

154
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay, maybe if I go at the bottom of that ravine, it looks like I can go up.

155
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So you find your way down the ravine, up the ravine and it's just like traversing the environment.

156
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And occasionally there's a bunch of scary little gremlins who go ran and you can jump over them or you can attack them.

157
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And I've been exploring a lot of the game past the point where I should have really stopped to fight some bosses.

158
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was skipping a lot of dangerous encounters and bosses and castles.

159
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I skipped the first main castle, which apparently you're supposed to go there.

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You're told to go there and there's a big boss with many hands and he's got a big old thing.

161
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But I just found a way around the castle and then I explored the second area of the game under levels and under equipped.

162
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But it was fun because you can still run away from lots of stuff.

163
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So I explored tons of the map and it was just fun.

164
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It was just fun being scared and running away from everything.

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That sounds cool.

166
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You're doing that on the Pump character?

167
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

168
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That sounds fun. Sounds cool.

169
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm hoping to find a fire spell so I can be Pump on character.

170
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was joking that it was like this new patch for Pumpkin Alley.

171
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I made this and this is the new game.

172
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:04,000
When people talked about Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3, I always got the feeling that what they were mostly talking about was boss fights.

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's fine and all, but I like that it seems like exploration is more important in Elden Ring.

174
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I think that appeals to me more.

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It feels more like you're role playing in a big open world.

176
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I mean, I guess it is. That's the idea. It's an open world game.

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The whole Dark Souls boss sort of bragging rights, I guess.

178
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, first try. I killed them and it's cool.

179
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's like a high skill bar to reach some bosses and it feels great when you get through a lot of them.

180
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But at the core of the experience, I prefer not that I don't like bosses, but I feel more comfortable sneaking around in castles and dungeons and taking out enemies and figuring out whether I can make it through with the amount of healing items I have

181
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and whether I should distract this guy and run past him or defeat all of them so that they don't come and run after me.

182
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Decisions like that. When you're one-on-one with a boss, it's a different sort of game, which I still like.

183
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But I love the exploration. It's really good.

184
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, I should probably give it a little word.

185
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Give it a shot. Take it for a little test drive for one of these dang days.

186
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Although I haven't quite 100% of the Hades and I kind of want to do that. I'm getting pretty close.

187
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So maybe as soon as I'm done with all that bullshit, I have a little in-game anecdote, a little joke that I laughed really hard at in Hades.

188
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I haven't mentioned it, but it killed me.

189
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:22,000
In Hades, you get keepsakes from NPCs. When you give them gifts, sometimes they give you things you can equip that give you a special buff or whatever.

190
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And in the endgame, you can get one from Hades. He'll give you a pin or whatever. It makes you invisible.

191
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And when Zagreus uses keepsake, he calls out the name of the person that gave it to him.

192
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And so when he uses the Hades keepsake, he yells out, Father!

193
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, the final boss of the game is Hades. And so I learned that when you use Hades keepsake against Hades, Zagreus yells out, Father!

194
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And Hades just says, What? I'm right here. Yes, I can hear you fine. It's so fucking good.

195
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Father!

196
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Father! What? What is it? Yes. I couldn't believe it.

197
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There's so much fucking dialogue, and I've played that game for like 85 hours, and I still have new dialogue every time I restart.

198
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Every time I go back to the house, every character's got a new thing to say. I have not exhausted any of it. It's insane.

199
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's wild.

200
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah.

201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Gaiman.

202
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Gaiman.

203
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Gaiman!

204
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
First we made games, then we played them.

205
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's... That's how you do it.

206
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Did you want to talk about Nika?

207
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, yes, yes. Okay, so you caught up with one...

208
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I was kind of... I didn't read this week's chapter.

209
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh, well, neither did I. I didn't know it was out.

210
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm not sure. I'm up to 10.45.

211
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Did you actually come out on a Wednesday?

212
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Hold on.

213
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Let's see, is 10.46 out yet?

214
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't even remember which website I read it on.

215
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
There's a few. 10.46.

216
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay, oh, 10.47 is out now. Well, I haven't read the last two then.

217
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh shit, there is... Okay, yeah. Well, whatever.

218
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Probably the things we were about to talk about could be explained in those chapters.

219
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But yeah, with regards to Nika, the Gear 5,

220
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
spoilers for One Piece, if you didn't hear about it before.

221
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Big spoilers for One Piece.

222
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So I listened to the last episode. You and Sims, you talked about it.

223
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And I forget... I wanted to insert myself into the conversation,

224
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
say, no, no, no, you see, you see, blah, blah, blah, One Piece, blah, blah, blah.

225
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But now I can't remember what I would have said in response to you.

226
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So I'll just say what I think.

227
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay, 10.47 is coming soon.

228
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

229
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I like the thing you were saying with the themes.

230
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Like it's thematically similar to what Luffy's power has always been thematically about.

231
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The freedom, sort of.

232
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Being like a rubbery, squash and stretch cartoon guy.

233
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, it's like funny, and Oda likes comedy and silly things.

234
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And it's sort of like, of course, he would make it as silly as possible.

235
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I always liked when Gear 3rd was like ridiculous looking.

236
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And then Gear 4th was like, oh my God, it's Gear 4th.

237
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He's going to be so powerful. And he's like, is a gorilla?

238
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He's like a weird, funny gorilla with tattoos.

239
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And it's like, it's inherently silly looking.

240
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But it's so cool because he's so strong.

241
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
4 is where it's like...

242
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't even know why he looks like this.

243
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But I guess when he looks like that, he's really strong or whatever.

244
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So, okay.

245
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, I can't remember.

246
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah, it's just sort of like...

247
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's kind of like whatever.

248
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Gear 4 is a little bit like, oh, he went super, super, super Saiyan God mode

249
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
so his hair is blue now and that means he's stronger.

250
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Is his hair blue?

251
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I've never seen him in color.

252
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
No, I'm talking about in Dragon Ball.

253
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
In Dragon Ball Super, their hair turns blue for some reason.

254
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The next one that has going to turn green.

255
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It turns blue, but if he's...

256
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Simsie was explaining, but if it's an alternate reality, like evil,

257
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
possessed version, if his hair would turn blue, it turns pink instead.

258
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And that's different, but it's the same.

259
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's kind of how I feel about 4.

260
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
4, yeah.

261
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I mean, I don't get the meaning of the tattoos and the...

262
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I see that it's inspired by Japanese-type design things with the tattoos

263
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and the cloud around him.

264
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
He's like some sort of a Buddhist thing, maybe.

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah.

266
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But I don't know why exactly that is what he looks like from his perspective.

267
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Absolutely no idea.

268
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He's got the black armament hacky going all over him.

269
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And he's fast, like Gear 2nd, but he's not giant like Gear 3rd.

270
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So it's just sort of like Gear 2nd 2, I guess.

271
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But I don't really mind it too much.

272
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's just whatever.

273
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But Gear 5, this new one, they've been talking about Devil Fruit Awakening.

274
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And the idea that you use your fruit in a way that goes beyond your own body, I guess, is usually...

275
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Have we seen other awakened paramecias before?

276
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

277
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I mean, in this whole fight, there's been a kid has used his magnetic one to turn Big Mom magnetic

278
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
so that he could stick all that metal to her because that's his thing.

279
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
He controls magnetic fields and then he can make someone else magnetic with his Awakening.

280
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Law also has awakened his Devil Fruit, but I don't really understand the metrics, like what the fruit is normally

281
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and then how the Awakening is different.

282
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You could just do a bunch of stuff.

283
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Is his Awakened ability not the thing where he can make someone immortal one time if he dies?

284
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't know if that's the Awakening or just like an ability he could use.

285
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah.

286
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
How would you know?

287
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
How does he know that he has that ability?

288
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I think it was something in his like backstory.

289
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I mean, Law is like a bit of a too cool for school character.

290
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He truly is.

291
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
His inclusion has always been a little bit baffling.

292
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I like him, but like it is like the sort of like he's a teen favorite.

293
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
All the kids are like, oh, they love Law.

294
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I see myself in him because he's always frowning.

295
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah.

296
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Shadow the Hedgehog.

297
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's like whatever.

298
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's fine, but it's like whatever.

299
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
He's not like the coolest guy ever and his powers are a bit confusing.

300
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay, so do you want?

301
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Also, who else?

302
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What's his name?

303
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The guy in Wano, not Wano, the whole cake who fought Luffy.

304
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Katakuri?

305
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Katakuri.

306
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
His Awakening was to turn the environment around him into mochi.

307
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, he was a Logia, right?

308
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
No, he was a Parameshia, I think.

309
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, okay.

310
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I think there was like a brief comment about it being a special Parameshia,

311
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
which is like who knows what that means?

312
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'd like to know where people get all this information about the devil fruits.

313
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Is there like devil fruit scholars who have written down these things?

314
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Honestly, yeah, me too.

315
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's like, that's one of the most intriguing parts of the world of One Piece for me.

316
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And sometimes I get the distressing feeling that it's all just being completely made up

317
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
as it goes along and there's very little like thought put into it.

318
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah.

319
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Sometimes it's so weird and obscure that it feels like,

320
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
okay, there's like something going on here that I'm not privy to,

321
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
but there's more to it than meets the eye.

322
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And other times it's like, no, it's just too fucking weird and stupid.

323
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I mean, I can imagine Oda was like, okay, I'm going to have a bunch of different funny powers.

324
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Sometimes you can turn into an animal, sometimes you can turn into like an intangible

325
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
or like a usually non-solid object, like light or water.

326
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I don't know if there's a water log here, but like smoke and fire and all that.

327
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah.

328
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And then a catch-all for every other type of thing where you're not,

329
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
you're neither a beast nor a smoke.

330
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Right.

331
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And he's just like, yeah, that'll do.

332
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That won't need clarification or like anything.

333
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Nope.

334
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Nothing confusing about that.

335
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And then he just makes a bunch of like cool powers and he's like,

336
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
well, which ones do these fit into?

337
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Some of these are potentially could like cross over halfway.

338
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And he's like, ah, yeah.

339
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Because he's already set the rules in place.

340
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
There's three types.

341
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And he's like, well, this one's a special one of those that makes it different.

342
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I don't care.

343
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I just wanted to cool power.

344
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And it's like, I can see his priority is just making the powers funny and cool.

345
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Do you want a minor spoiler for chapter 1046?

346
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I mean, I could look at it right now.

347
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah.

348
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Shall we read it?

349
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm just, I just skim through it and I just see the part at the end where he's like

350
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
grabbing lightning bolts out of the sky.

351
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like he's going to throw them like Zeus.

352
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
That's weird.

353
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You're talking about.

354
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is that Luffy?

355
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah.

356
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Luffy.

357
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Nika Luffy is just like throwing lightning bolts like Zeus.

358
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay.

359
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Why not?

360
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Uh, sure.

361
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I don't really want to like sit here for like a bit and digest this chapter before we keep

362
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
talking.

363
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But I also don't want to not know what's going on.

364
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That's just me.

365
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I was just, I was just looking, I was just looking through.

366
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Um, but yeah, the Nika, I like the way it looks.

367
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I like the fact that it's Tom and Jerry cartoon, Popeye, like silly, wacky, zany, uh, goofy.

368
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And, uh, it's exactly the sort of thing.

369
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's the sort of, it's exactly the sort of thing gear five should be and the powers of

370
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
the awakening devil for being able to turn things rubber.

371
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So like being able to punch someone like a cartoon, uh, through their chest in a way

372
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that they would kill them if it was real.

373
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But if they're made of rubber and it doesn't matter, um, then it's fine.

374
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So he punches Kido through the head really hard.

375
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah.

376
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Because he turns Kido into rubber.

377
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Stretches.

378
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah.

379
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah.

380
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's just like, that's, that's exactly the right cool thing that it could be, should be.

381
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah.

382
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Um, that's great.

383
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And, uh, I think that I think you and Simsie also had this problem just that it's like

384
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
a little asinine that the fruit is like so special and important.

385
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It could have just been, this is what Luffy's Awakening does.

386
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah.

387
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It could have done, it could have done all the same things and the, and the explanation

388
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
could have been, oh, he's awakened his, his devil fruit.

389
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
He can turn other things into rubber and I guess it makes his hair turn into steam.

390
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah.

391
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Just because.

392
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I feel like the, the reveal that the other gurus say talking about the fruit being joy

393
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
boy related or joy boys fruit or something relating to liberator, the liberator, the

394
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
freedom fruit, the special one that is so important to the world government.

395
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's, it's.

396
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They can't let anybody have it.

397
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And it's like.

398
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Okay.

399
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
To the point where they would sacrifice one of their CP zero members to stop Luffy from

400
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
winning the fight.

401
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah.

402
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's like, uh, but weird.

403
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I don't really understand why they didn't do that.

404
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I mean, lots of fruits are like really, really powerful.

405
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Like, sure, I guess, I guess this Nika fruit is pretty good, but like, you know, Kaido's

406
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
dragon fruit is also like a really powerful fruit that probably if I was the world government,

407
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I would think it was really important not to let some pirate eat it.

408
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Uh, you know, same for like a hundred other fruits.

409
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah.

410
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Turn you into a fucking like island killer level threat just by having it.

411
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah.

412
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I mean.

413
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's like, like is Luffy's is the Nika is the is the Nika fruit.

414
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Is it is it much more dangerous than the Gura Gura fruit, which lets you destroy a whole

415
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
island just if you want to.

416
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I, I, well, I think the fact that they mentioned liberator and like freedom and joy boy.

417
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
When they talk about that fruit is implying that the damage it can do is not physical

418
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
necessarily, but it's like, like could upend their society politically.

419
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So, but like, I don't understand how the fruit specifically does that.

420
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I feel like that either implies that the power Luffy has is the power to rouse people to fight

421
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
against their oppressors or something, which is like has nothing to do with being silly

422
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and goofy and he's not exhibiting any like power that does that as far as I know.

423
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Like what it literally does is what you would expect an awakened gum gum fruit to do, which

424
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
is turn things into wacky rubber.

425
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I guess maybe it could have some secondary effect of freedom, whatever that means.

426
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's just sort of annoying.

427
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Well, yeah, well, yeah, it is annoying because the idea of like being the king of the pirates is like the

428
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
most free you can be and that's and Luffy wants that because he wants freedom and he

429
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
hates people being trampled over and not being able to do what they like.

430
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And so he punches guys who stop freedom from happening.

431
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's right.

432
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You know, he beat the shit out of crocodile, not necessarily because crocodile was starting a war,

433
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
but because it made VV upset that she was trapped in this, you know, it's more of a personal thing.

434
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
He wasn't trying to be a hero.

435
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
He was just trying to be free and that's just what he felt like doing.

436
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And so I from what I like from reading the whole manga, it felt like Luffy has that sort of that attitude

437
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
that inspires people to fight for their own freedom as well.

438
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And that's why like at the end of Dressrosa, he's got like an army following him because they are inspired

439
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
by him to like fight back against people that otherwise would not get challenged.

440
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And it's like, oh, he's got this army.

441
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
He doesn't care about the army.

442
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
He doesn't want it, but they're doing it anyway.

443
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And it's sort of like Luffy as a person is inspiring change.

444
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
He's changing people's minds.

445
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He's making it so that the world can overthrow the world government and reveal the void century information.

446
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But remember, one piece is not political.

447
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It has no political messages in it at all.

448
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It doesn't mean anything.

449
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Don't get it twisted now.

450
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
No.

451
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay.

452
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I hear you.

453
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The sort of the sort of thematic obvious direction it's going is like,

454
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
king of the pirates equals freedom.

455
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So to become the king of the pirates, you must make the world free kind of.

456
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So the world government will be toppled or at least the dismantled, disbanded, the Marines will not be bad people.

457
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I mean, they're good people in the Marines.

458
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So they'll probably still be there at the end being like, oh, now we're good cops.

459
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That's fine, whatever.

460
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But like the obviously slave enslavement of like people in Marishwa and all of the super higher ups and whatever was happening in the void century that they're trying to cover up is gets revealed and everybody around the world hears that.

461
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And they're like, oh my God, I hate the world government now.

462
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Revolution.

463
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And it's like, but like, you know what?

464
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's great.

465
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That's great.

466
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I just don't like the implication that that is because Luffy ate a fruit and not because he himself is inherently like he inspires people inspiring through his actual character trait.

467
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Like is the fruit doing anything or is it not?

468
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's, you know, I feel like that they might never specify.

469
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It might maybe, maybe, maybe, I mean, maybe Joy Boy was this like liberator God because of the fruit or maybe he just was like that.

470
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And he also happened to eat the same fruit.

471
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I mean, it could be like the devil fruits were created with the will of people in them.

472
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And this one was created by Joy Boy and it has Joy Boy's will in it.

473
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But it still, it still feels like that means that Luffy is not himself doing all of the good he's doing.

474
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
He's doing it because he has a fruit that he ate.

475
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It could also, if I'm going to be charitable, I think what they're going for, what it is going for is like the fruit chooses the wizard Harry Potter.

476
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
The fruit shows Luffy because he was exactly the right person to be the guy who has that fruit power.

477
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That's probably what it is.

478
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Maybe in the same way that maybe the flame fruit chose Sabo or something.

479
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
There's some kind of destiny at work that's like Sabo got Ace's fruit.

480
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, I don't know.

481
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I guess there'll be more to be revealed.

482
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Initially, the reveal was like, oh, that's cool, but why is that extra thing there?

483
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I suppose it could be good.

484
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It could be good.

485
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I am, yeah, it makes me wonder about all that stuff, about the nature of fruits and powers and all that.

486
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah, until we know really what the fruit is doing, I guess I'm not sure what I think.

487
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:41,000
If it turned out that the Nika fruit just made Luffy into this freedom fighter dude and it was just the fruit acting through him and controlling his destiny, I would be like, ehh.

488
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I feel like there's no chance that that is the intention, but it might be an unintentional implication if they don't make it more obviously something else.

489
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah, I hear it.

490
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I just want to know.

491
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Tell me more about fruits, Oda, please.

492
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Tell me where do they come from?

493
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Who made them?

494
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Why?

495
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
How?

496
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
What's up?

497
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I would imagine the fruits were invented in the Void Century.

498
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You know who I really wish didn't die was Odin's wife, because she was from the Void Century.

499
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You pick up on that?

500
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

501
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
She traveled into the future.

502
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:44,000
She was from 800 years ago and that's when the Void Century was, so like, dang, would have been really good if she just traveled forward in time one more time and didn't get killed.

503
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Okay, I forget if this was ever mentioned in that flashback.

504
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Did she tell Odin what all of that was?

505
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Did she tell him the secret?

506
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
All of what?

507
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The Void Century stuff.

508
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I don't think she ever really brought it up.

509
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's just mentioned that that's how old she is and that just happens to line up with how long ago the Void Century was.

510
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I feel like there's a reason that that was the case.

511
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, the number is not arbitrary.

512
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So, like, information of the Void Century from her past to Odin could be if it could be past to Momonosuke or Kyori.

513
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah, absolutely.

514
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It seems really important to me that she just happens to be the same age as when the Void Century happened.

515
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That seems like that's there for a reason and there's going to be something with that.

516
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's the sort of thing that would be like after Wano is finished and people are sitting around being like, wow, what a battle, huh?

517
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That shit was crazy.

518
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Everyone's like, damn, remember when we all collectively hallucinated that Luffy had a weird mythical zoan fruit that turned his hair white?

519
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That was like a crazy trip.

520
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Good thing it was just a dream.

521
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah, and they're having a feast and then whatever.

522
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And then Momonosuke's there and offhandedly just mentioned something about the Void Century and then Niko Robin's eyes wide and she's like, huh?

523
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Well, wait a minute.

524
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I've heard about that in the Ponyglyphs, but I wasn't sure what it meant.

525
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Could you tell me?

526
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And then she talks to him.

527
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
She gains more knowledge and that's like that would be a little scene.

528
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I love it when Niko Robin gains knowledge.

529
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
She's so fucking smart.

530
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's so fucking hot when she gets smarter.

531
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You know, I apparently was confused.

532
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I had thought, and I guess I was wrong, but I had thought that Momosuke, is it Momonosuke?

533
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Is that the kid's name?

534
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Momonosuke, yeah.

535
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I thought that Momonosuke had eaten a smile.

536
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I thought his dragon was from a smile, but I guess it's not.

537
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
No, no.

538
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It was from a failed recreation made by Vegapunk.

539
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Isn't that the same thing?

540
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Isn't that what a smile is?

541
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I think Vegapunk lied about it being a failure.

542
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah, because it just gave him the exact same fruit as Kaido had.

543
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It's the same dragon.

544
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's clearly not a failure.

545
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Vegapunk probably would have lied.

546
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I feel like Vegapunk is not a bad person deep down.

547
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He works for the government because he has to.

548
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Hard to say.

549
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:51,000
When the idea of the world government getting in control of an exact copy of Kaido's dragon fish fruit,

550
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
that would be very dangerous, and he doesn't want the world government to actually...

551
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh, it was a failure.

552
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'll throw it away.

553
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah, it just made him a little dragon.

554
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It sucks.

555
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Don't even worry about it.

556
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I mean, Alkiji and Akainu came onto the punk hazard and they started their fight and they had to leave.

557
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Hey, Oblivionfall.

558
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Hello, I'm recording.

559
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Hey, Oblivion.

560
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Should we all sync, by the way?

561
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
We didn't sync when you joined.

562
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Yeah, let's sync.

563
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Let's do that right now.

564
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
On the count of three, say sync.

565
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
One, two, three, sync.

566
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Sync.

567
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
One, two, three, sync.

568
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Sync.

569
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Okay.

570
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
We're just talking about one piece, Oblivion.

571
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What the fuck?

572
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
There's one of those...

573
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Are you up to date?

574
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Well, actually, we're not up to date on the most recent chapter.

575
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm one chapter behind.

576
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I know nothing at all, but I also cannot comprehend.

577
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That means we can spoil everything and you can say it by the time you read it.

578
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Exactly.

579
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, let me tell you.

580
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I mean, you know that it's about a boy made of rubber, right?

581
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's about rubber ross, the pirate.

582
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's what I mean.

583
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's correct.

584
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Well, the big thing lately is that it was revealed that the gum gum fruit, which turned

585
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
him into rubber, was not actually the gum gum fruit.

586
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's the gum gum fruit.

587
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Oh, sure.

588
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That's true.

589
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It was a mythical fruit that gave him the powers of the liberator, sun god, Nika.

590
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And that's what it is, actually.

591
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
The rubber stuff was just kind of a side effect.

592
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Damn.

593
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
He's he's this like it's like a god power, basically.

594
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So it's pretty wacky.

595
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
He's the wacky inflatable arm man in real life.

596
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
He is.

597
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
He is all that and more.

598
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I got to say when I like now that I've figured out what he's meant to be like his hair is

599
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
white because it's made of steam in the same way that like the gears had like steam coming

600
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
out of him.

601
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I think it's cool.

602
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I think about it the cooler.

603
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I think that is like a design wise.

604
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I think that's part of it.

605
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I also think if you might be like he's like aging his body rapidly is the implication

606
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
another implication you could take because there's like one power where he's like, oh,

607
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm so fucking old because this is taking a toll on my body.

608
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And then he goes, no, I'm going to fight.

609
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm going to keep fighting.

610
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
But that's when he he like goes on Nika and his hair turns black again.

611
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
He's like takes too much energy.

612
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
No, you're right.

613
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Never mind.

614
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah, I think it's just more like steam.

615
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
This turns into steam.

616
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's cool.

617
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I like it.

618
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
He's so white.

619
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Oh my God.

620
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
He's the whitest king there ever was.

621
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
He's the white.

622
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
He's the whitest kid you know.

623
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
True.

624
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
If you think about it.

625
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What's up oblivion?

626
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
What's going on?

627
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I remembered the topic but I forgot to talk about a few weeks ago when I was on.

628
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That was so mad about because I forgot about it.

629
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
That's one reason I'm here.

630
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It feels like feels like a while since I don't even remember it was like two months ago.

631
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Last time was like maybe three weeks ago.

632
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It wasn't that long ago.

633
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
No, I swear it was.

634
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
No, I'm going to the PCP.

635
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You're a big liar.

636
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You're going to prison.

637
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Let's see.

638
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
PC prison.

639
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Let's see.

640
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Three weeks ago, Phantom Revenge is out.

641
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Feet oblivion fall.

642
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Got him.

643
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh, I don't remember that.

644
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I think it's when we had the...

645
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Phantom Revenge?

646
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
What's that?

647
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
What?

648
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
What?

649
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It was when we talked about wheels and doors.

650
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh, that's right.

651
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
If you can believe it.

652
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Oh, sure.

653
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But now the other reason I'm here is that my project's done.

654
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's not out, but it's done.

655
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
The video?

656
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah, all the animation, all the compositing and effects.

657
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I finished them up yesterday.

658
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh, the site to site.

659
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

660
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It'll maybe come out later today.

661
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Well, a couple days ago for when people see this, but...

662
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I've been waiting.

663
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I've been...

664
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I haven't been...

665
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I've been edging.

666
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I've been edging.

667
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I haven't seen you around much.

668
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So I've been assuming that you've probably had your nose to the grindstone.

669
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Oh, yeah.

670
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah.

671
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Well, actually, for two weeks, I couldn't work on it because I had to work on a video

672
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
for DA Games.

673
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I had to do this big five-minute-long music video in 3D that I made in like two weeks.

674
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Funny, I can make those projects in two weeks, but my own project's taken me months.

675
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I know how it is.

676
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
What's it called?

677
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Actually, what's the name of it?

678
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
The DA Games one, I can link it.

679
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
No, I meant your video.

680
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's gonna be...

681
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Oh, my video is Ancazonexcomzone.

682
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Okay.

683
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think that's the title I'm going with.

684
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
All right.

685
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
You know, that meme from like September, it's been like seven months since that was the

686
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
game.

687
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I don't know that meme from September.

688
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Damn.

689
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It was a zone?

690
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah, it was zone and minus A.

691
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Zone animated, Anca.

692
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Oh, Anca from Animal Crossing.

693
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

694
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It was like music and then she just had sex on camera and then all of the little kids'

695
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
babies on Twitter, they're like, oh, my God, I've never seen sex before.

696
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
What the fuck?

697
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh, my God, that's literally me.

698
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And they're like, oh, my God, what the fuck?

699
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And that became a meme because people were freaking out over that.

700
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And then they were like, no, she's just dancing.

701
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And then Zone made a dancing video and that's like everyone pretends it's their original.

702
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I see.

703
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Fascinating.

704
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
That was kind of funny.

705
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Hmm, okay.

706
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I do remember that Anca animation.

707
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I didn't know there was like a story to go with it.

708
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I didn't know a thing happened.

709
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
All the YouTube comments were like, whoa, when you realize she's not dancing.

710
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Wah, she's actually fucking.

711
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Wah, sex cat.

712
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Wah.

713
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Wah.

714
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Wah.

715
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Crazy.

716
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And then they learned their lesson.

717
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
They now find the bowling pin having sex with the, no, the bowling ball and sex with the

718
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
bowling pin and they can't handle it.

719
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
What do they think of next?

720
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's like, I mean, you say what do we think of next.

721
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Technology sure is amazing.

722
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I mean, it was just another one of those instances where Totally Spies did it first.

723
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah.

724
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Yeah.

725
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I mean, look, wait, general or links.

726
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Where do I put stuff?

727
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Uh, general, I guess.

728
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

729
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Um, yeah, Totally Spies did it.

730
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I looked up the clip.

731
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
There's a video for it too.

732
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah, it's exact.

733
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It's actually did it twice.

734
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
These pins are hotter.

735
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
These pins are hotter than that white one.

736
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You would say that.

737
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That food fight looking pin is gross.

738
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I don't like it.

739
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yeah, we did it a second time with a different aesthetic.

740
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
We just keep doing it.

741
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah, and I've been thinking about like, has anyone like actually made a video going like

742
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
if I watch every episode of Totally Spies and like write down every single fetish that it

743
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
like started or at least contributed to because I know, but it sounds like the kind of video

744
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
that would get clicks.

745
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I clicked on a random video and there was like hyper muscle growth like in there.

746
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
There's just an episode on YouTube called like the incredible bulk and I'm like, let

747
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
me guess, it's going to be like some hyper muscle shit.

748
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And I clicked on it and there was and then at the end, the one of the girls goes muscular

749
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and she has like, she has like titties and it's like sex and I'm like, damn.

750
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That's crazy.

751
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I can't believe they would do that.

752
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It's weird because I remember Totally Spies.

753
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I only watched like a few episodes, but like, I could tell that it was like sexual because

754
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
they were in tight spandex the whole time.

755
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Wasn't that sexual?

756
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
No, but I was young.

757
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I was like, I don't know, 13 or 14.

758
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I was like, there's some sort of thing with girls here and I'm thinking something.

759
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
But like, I don't remember anything like ridiculously fetishistic going on.

760
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I saw girls in tight jumpsuits and I said, this is too political for me.

761
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I'm out.

762
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I didn't really watch it that much.

763
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I watched like, yeah, I watched a little bit of it.

764
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Don't remember it.

765
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't remember it being weird, but maybe in hindsight, I could be like, remember how

766
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
every time anyone got tied up in rope in my little pony, people would be like, oh my

767
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
God, it's bondage fetish.

768
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I mean, there is plenty of that in Totally Spies too.

769
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Of course.

770
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Of course there is.

771
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Yeah.

772
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
They're spies.

773
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
They're going to get like strapped to a table with like a laser that's going to cut them

774
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
in half.

775
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That's just what spies do.

776
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Totally.

777
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Which is hot.

778
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Totally.

779
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, I agree.

780
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
One fetish that I like, I just saw one artist like drawing it and it was like, and they

781
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
draw it a lot.

782
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So it's clear they're fetish.

783
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I found an image that's not too sexual to show off what I'm talking about.

784
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I think the artist is Frank Tonius.

785
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It's not a fetish I get, but it's like, we're like, you've swapped body parts with different

786
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
people who have like different shades of skin.

787
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Like the arm might be like slightly brown.

788
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Like your leg is black or something.

789
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And that, I saw this artist, I followed them for big titties and I saw them drawing this

790
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
stuff on the side and I'm like, wait, Totally Spies has an episode where I did that.

791
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
There was like a woman who like every body part was like a slightly like different shade

792
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
of skin color.

793
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Boy, that's really weird.

794
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
She had like stolen body parts from so many people and I'm like, damn, Totally Spies did

795
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
this too.

796
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I'm sure there's more.

797
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm sure if I watched the show, I'd find like hundreds.

798
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I gotta be honest.

799
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I've never heard of this particular fetish before, which is surprising.

800
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I feel like I've heard it all.

801
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I mean, I think I've only really seen this artist do it.

802
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It's not like a super popular one, but it's one.

803
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It sure is.

804
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Oh, wait.

805
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Hang on.

806
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Oblivion.

807
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You haven't done the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter backer reward survey.

808
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
There's a survey.

809
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
There's a survey.

810
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I need it so that you, I know your address.

811
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I can send you the thing.

812
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Oh, right.

813
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
It should be in your email somewhere.

814
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I see the issue.

815
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I think I'm looking at our DMs.

816
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I think I may have been like just waking up in bed looking on my phone when I saw that

817
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and then when I got to my computer, the notification was gone.

818
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
That makes sense.

819
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I need to remember what fucking email I used so I can find it.

820
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yeah.

821
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'm worried that like a number of people don't remember their login details and as such have no way.

822
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
There probably will be.

823
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Probably at least a handful of people will simply never respond to the query.

824
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's just the way it goes.

825
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
You just got to make your own best faith attempt to reach them.

826
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And if they don't, then you know, you just got to let them go.

827
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
You just got to give up and let them fall into the abyss where they belong.

828
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah.

829
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But yeah, oblivion for you are one of the people who I could contact otherwise.

830
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
The rest of them, I don't know what their names are on Discord or Twitter.

831
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So if they don't respond to the email, that's the end and I can't get them their thing.

832
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah.

833
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I, oh my God, I have so many fucking emails.

834
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
You know what would be in the like the subject line so I can search for it.

835
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Well, it would be from Kickstarter.

836
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Oh, true.

837
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'll narrow it down.

838
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It doesn't seem to be associated with that email address.

839
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Let's try this one.

840
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Oh, yes, here it is.

841
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Blah, blah, blah.

842
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Well, you should be able to log into your Kickstarter account and you should see an

843
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:40,000
activity you should have gotten like a notice that's like a request for a survey response.

844
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I mean, I'm logged in.

845
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Messages.

846
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Verify password.

847
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Okay.

848
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I mean, I'll try and forgive us all.

849
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Blah.

850
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Anybody listening who is also a backer.

851
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Please check your email because there's like like 17 people left.

852
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Hey, aren't you coming to the US and like, I think we were talking about it yesterday.

853
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Aren't you coming in like six weeks or something like not that long?

854
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm coming in May.

855
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So yeah, I guess so.

856
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah, that's pretty close.

857
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That's next month.

858
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Oh boy.

859
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
That's fucked.

860
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I'm going to see people.

861
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I'm going to be in person.

862
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm going to be terrifying.

863
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And then I will have the, and then I will, I will get, I will, I will be that the Pluture

864
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
who has the zine, has the plush, has the comic.

865
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yes.

866
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Yeah, finally.

867
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I'll be that guy rubbing my hands together.

868
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It was so satisfying.

869
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:58,000
The last few big sets of sending out the Lord of Ghost comic and the plush.

870
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Getting all those boxes and envelopes sealed and writing on the serial numbers and the

871
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
printing out the labels and sticking them on the customs things.

872
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It's like, ah, I was a machine.

873
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I was doing everything.

874
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Got so many done per day.

875
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And there's like, let me check.

876
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
There's like four or five like completely empty boxes that had comics in them.

877
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And it's a few more left.

878
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You did it.

879
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Almost.

880
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I did it.

881
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I almost, I basically did it.

882
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
There's a few people in Australia, a few people in America.

883
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I want to do the American and Australian together in one big like collection because it's better

884
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
that way.

885
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I still have some packages from like a year ago that I was supposed to go to Australia

886
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and I still haven't sent them because they have, as far as I'm aware, they have not

887
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
resumed first class mail to Australia from the US yet.

888
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So I just can't, yeah.

889
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I got, I got like a Blu-ray and like maybe a Vapors copy and like, oh no, it was a road

890
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
to Radcon.

891
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
There's just like two envelopes sitting here, just waiting for them to be like, okay, we'll

892
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
mail to Australia again.

893
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Thanks.

894
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Okay.

895
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So the last email I got like sending me a link to the survey was on January 23rd.

896
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So anyone listening, if he wants to do a survey, look for emails around that date, I guess.

897
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I found it.

898
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I just had to scroll a lot.

899
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
All right.

900
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You know what?

901
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I'm, my project for this week, I have a, I mentioned it last episode, but I'm, I'm drawing

902
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
a Tales Get Strolled page.

903
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Oh yeah.

904
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Yeah.

905
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I just, I just started it yesterday.

906
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I put it off for a few days.

907
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I have until, I think I have to, I have to draw it in the next four days, which should be

908
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
doable.

909
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I think there's like 18 panels.

910
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
This is not that bad.

911
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,000
These are set in, in the, they're in the world.

912
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Well, some of them are in the world inside of Coyote's book, which I had forgotten what,

913
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
what it looks like, but it's like a purple like nighttime land with like gravestones

914
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
everywhere.

915
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I must confess, I have not finished, not got caught up with Tales Get Strolled.

916
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I also had to like reread the like the latest chapters because I was not caught up either.

917
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I genuinely can't remember where I stopped.

918
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I remember Pac-Man.

919
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Yeah.

920
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And I think Tales has just finished their, their training.

921
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Did you get to the part with Cheeto Man and the big like mass grave?

922
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I forget.

923
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I know Cheeto Man was there.

924
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
You meet Cheeto Man earlier, but then he becomes like a big.

925
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Yeah.

926
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
The mass grave.

927
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
That sounds very fun.

928
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
That's a highlight for sure.

929
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Yeah.

930
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Fucking Tales Get Strolled.

931
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Fucking Tales Get Strolled.

932
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
The, the, yeah, there's a, there's Satan.

933
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Like half of my pages are like Coyote and Demaro and Gary's soul in Coyote's book realm.

934
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And then the other half of them are Satan, sort of like monologuing in hell.

935
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So that's pretty exciting.

936
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Gary is a, it's funny, like there's, I have like some disagreements.

937
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I have some slight disagreements with the way that some of the other guest artists have drawn Gary.

938
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
The last, the person who's drawn the most, Gary, sort of gave him like link hair.

939
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
He sort of has like a frilly sort of like link cut and I don't agree with that.

940
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I don't think that's what his original art was meant to look like.

941
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
So I'm sort of giving it my own interpretation.

942
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Gary, Gary is the guy who, he sort of has like an Android face for a lot of the comic.

943
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And then he gets even more of his face destroyed and replaced with Android parts.

944
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And then there's the part where he fights Demaro and he like covers himself in like magma armor because he's an earth bender.

945
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And he almost beats Demaro, but then he dies.

946
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And then his soul gets eaten by the eye monster in Demaro's forehead.

947
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And then Coyote manages to free his soul.

948
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And now his soul is just kind of hanging out and being a dick and like insulting Demaro because he's mad that he died.

949
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Hmm. Yeah, sounds reasonable.

950
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You know. And then Coyote, so actually Coyote has Gary's body.

951
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And so Coyote is controlling Gary's body and Gary's soul is just kind of hanging out and like watching him do that.

952
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Coyote is like, hey man, could you explain to me like how your powers work so I can use them?

953
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
And he's like, fuck you, man. You're a bitch.

954
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's pretty, it's pretty weird. It's pretty funny.

955
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Coyote is like, I don't know.

956
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I think this is after the part that I got to in my lecture.

957
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Like I think this all happens after, but Coyote is like, he's like covered in wounds now.

958
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Like he's got his ears got chopped off and like his neck got cut open and like his back, his spine got sliced open.

959
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And so he had to like put his, his like weird like neutral soul strings and he had to use them to like stitch his body back together.

960
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
So now he's got all these like scars all over him that are like he's got these glowing yellow strings holding him together.

961
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
It's awesome. They're rules.

962
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Great, great, great, great comic.

963
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Happy, happy to be doing a page for it.

964
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I do have the physical comic, but it's falling wild.

965
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Really? I didn't, oh, I didn't get it. I wanted it, but I forgot to buy it.

966
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Yeah, it's on the shelf. I mean.

967
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Sorry, isn't it?

968
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
It's on a different shelf.

969
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Okay.

970
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Okay, I don't know if these pages correspond to the actual panel or pages of the comic, but I'm on 135.

971
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
What chapter is it? Because it's divided into chapters that are like 20 pages each.

972
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Let's see.

973
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
The silver hedgehog.

974
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Everybody's favorite.

975
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh, chapter six.

976
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Yeah, there's like, there's like 25 chapters now.

977
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Lol. Okay. Yeah, this is volume one. So it's not the whole thing.

978
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Yeah.

979
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I mean, some of the, some of the guest art in like chapter, chapter four is like really good.

980
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,000
They got some, they got some dudes. Hold on, let me, let me find it. Let me find a really good one.

981
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I was, I was, I was, I was refreshing my memory of the story and I was going through, I think it was in chapter 24.

982
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I was like, yow. Yowza.

983
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,000
When a young man is suddenly trolled by two individuals from a nation of real life internet trolls.

984
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It initiates a chain of events leading to an all out war between several opposing factions, influencing the lives of hundreds of characters.

985
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
True that.

986
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The TGT saga chronicles the profound human drama resulting from these events, while at the same time providing an in depth examination of the themes contained therein,

987
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,000
including morality, vengeance, camaraderie, betrayal, romance, dark magic, drug use, and more.

988
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Drugs.

989
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It's, it's, it's, it's got, it's got all that and more. Okay. It's not letting me copy paste because the image is too big here.

990
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Image is too fucking powerful.

991
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:24,000
What if volume two is out? I don't know if, if a CC is working on that.

992
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I'm sure he's working on it to some extent. I don't know. I'm sure I would have heard about it if it were out though.

993
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Okay, I got to just shrink this image a little bit so I can change image resolution.

994
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I forgot Batman was part of the secret society.

995
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:54,000
There's, there's Batman, there's Cheeto Man, there's Dexter, Hello Kitty, Kermit the Frog, Ronald McDonald, Spyro, Vivian, and Woodstock.

996
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Vivian from Paper Mario and Woodstock from Peanuts.

997
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, I remember, I remember most of those. I kind of forgot about Batman. He's not that important.

998
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Ronald McDonald, obviously, the unhinged psychopath.

999
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Frogger and leapfrog.

1000
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:24,000
How, how is it that I take a JPEG, shrink it, and then save it as, save the shrunken image as a JPEG and it ends up with a bigger file size than the original?

1001
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
How does that work?

1002
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Bad.

1003
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Bad file.

1004
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
How can this be? This isn't, this is not logical.

1005
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Alright.

1006
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Encoding us the word.

1007
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I just, I just want to show some of this cool, uh, here, I'll just, I'll just screen grab it.

1008
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:59,000
There we go. Look, look at this shit. There's, there's like, there's like a lot like this. There's a big section at the end of Chapter 24.

1009
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Oh no, Road Runner.

1010
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, they got Road Runner.

1011
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Is that the canonical end of, of, you know, the Road Runner cartoons? Is this?

1012
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:20,000
No, I think he's, I think he's back. You know, all, all Coyote has to do is like, stitch his frickin' body back together and he's just fine.

1013
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Cause he's just, he's just a corpse being puppeted.

1014
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Here we go.

1015
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Meep, meep.

1016
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:34,000
This one's a pretty, I guess he's killing Sonichu here. I forget why he's doing that.

1017
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Phantom, Phantom, Phantom Horn and Coyote. The two things they've got in common is the Kill Sonichus.

1018
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It's a new, a new show, Phantom Horn and Coyote.

1019
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Yeah. Best, best friends.

1020
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Uh, uh, uh.

1021
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
What if Phantom Horn was in Tales Get Strolled?

1022
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:03,000
We gotta get, we gotta get him in. I gotta get, uh, I gotta convince, uh, uh, I almost, I almost said Saber Spark.

1023
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Laserbot.

1024
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Saber Spark.

1025
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Saber Spark, the creator of Tales Get Strolled.

1026
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Ah.

1027
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Phonely.

1028
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Uh.

1029
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
He wishes, he wishes.

1030
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Instead, he's only the creator of giving Tom a good mattress.

1031
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Is that a euphemism?

1032
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:39,000
No, I watched a recent video of Saber's and like at the end there's this little, uh, funny little segment where it's like, ha ha, I have a friend Tom, his back fucking sucks, uh, but I'm using my mattress sponsorship to give him a good back and there's like this little

1033
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
freedy like animation of Tom and he, it was like a PNG and he just falls over or something and it was funny.

1034
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
That's very funny actually.

1035
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Tom.

1036
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Do you remember which episodes that is? I kind of love it.

1037
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It was very recent. Um, I'm gonna, I must subscribe to Saber Spark. I'm gonna go to his channel.

1038
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Was it on the Saber Spark 64 channel or was it on the main channel?

1039
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
It was the Pinocchio movie video.

1040
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I'm pretty certain.

1041
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So it was on his main channel. Um, it was at the end of this.

1042
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Um, I just giggled at the visual of the little freedy Tom like just falling on the floor or something.

1043
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Let me, oh my god, there it is.

1044
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It's at like 16 minutes.

1045
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Yeah, yeah.

1046
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Oh my god.

1047
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
16 minutes?

1048
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah.

1049
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Or 15, 55 ish.

1050
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Poor old Tom.

1051
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
He was originally sleeping on an air mattress and I was like,

1052
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Just silently lying down.

1053
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Nearly a million people saw him.

1054
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Absolutely not Tom.

1055
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Okay, I got my terrible little screen grab here.

1056
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Tom, what happened?

1057
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
This is like an insane person room.

1058
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,000
He's fallen and he's staying down by choice because these Helix mattresses are so comfy.

1059
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
They sure are.

1060
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000

1062
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Use our promo code.

1063
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I hate Helix.

1064
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It sucks.

1065
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I have no opinion of such a product.

1066
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I'm sure it's fine.

1067
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I'm sure it's the best mattress I've ever slept on in my entire life.

1068
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I mean, I hope it's fine.

1069
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
My bank account.

1070
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
My bank account skyrockets.

1071
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I'm sure there is a very big difference between like a $50 mattress and a $2,000 mattress.

1072
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Sure.

1073
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Considering you spend a third of our lives sleeping, it's probably good to invest in a good one eventually when I can afford it.

1074
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Not a $2,000 one.

1075
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I don't know.

1076
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Maybe not.

1077
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Yeah, like a $1,000 one.

1078
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I think it's like, I heard someone say like, I forget the exact number.

1079
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It was something like the quality of like a steak tapers off after like $60 or something.

1080
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
You never need to spend more than $60 on a steak.

1081
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Yeah.

1082
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
There's only so good.

1083
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
There's only so much love they can cook it with.

1084
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yeah.

1085
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
The next thing up is like to boil it in molten gold or something.

1086
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah.

1087
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Or I think Munchie said something about like, I think, this was obviously a few years ago when Munchie was on the podcast.

1088
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
He said something about like, he wore like a pair of $100 shoes once and he was like, oh, shit.

1089
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It's actually good.

1090
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's actually a different experience.

1091
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But like, there probably wouldn't be much of a difference between like a $100 pair and like a $1,000 pair.

1092
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Like I think by the time you hit like a hundred or maybe even like a little lower than that, you've like reached peak shoes already.

1093
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And then everything extra is just for show, I guess.

1094
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Just to brag about how much you spent on them.

1095
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Yeah.

1096
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I wonder what the threshold is for mattresses.

1097
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Got to hit the low end of like the good quality.

1098
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I feel like a pretty like basic mattress is like, what, like 200 bucks?

1099
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
For like, not a shitty mattress, but not like a good mattress either.

1100
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Just like a normal mattress.

1101
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah.

1102
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I have no complaints about my mattress, which I think was like 200.

1103
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I mean, my mattress is fine.

1104
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It's probably not even a hundred.

1105
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
But like my back also fucking sucks all the time.

1106
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:17,000
If I did like shell out like 800 bucks or something for like a pretty nice one, it would probably improve my quality of life.

1107
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I used to sleep on a mattress that was too soft and I had back pain all the time.

1108
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And now I don't.

1109
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Too soft.

1110
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
It was too soft.

1111
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
It was too soft.

1112
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
How would you lay?

1113
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
What would happen?

1114
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Well, I would just, I would lie down.

1115
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I sleep on my stomach usually.

1116
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So I would just be lying down and my back would just hurt.

1117
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And sometimes I would try to like support my middle back.

1118
01:11:48,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I would try to like put like pillows underneath my like stomach to like sort of prop up the middle of my back to sort of prevent it from like kind of bowing down in the middle, you know.

1119
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And that didn't work.

1120
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The mattress just did not support me.

1121
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And I think it was sort of bowing under my weight because it was too soft and it led to me sleeping with a bent spine and I would be in pain all the time.

1122
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I don't often sleep.

1123
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Actually, I find it very difficult to sleep face down.

1124
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I usually sleep face down.

1125
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
That's just how I've always done it.

1126
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I like sleeping on my side.

1127
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
That's the perfect.

1128
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
So sometimes I sleep on my side.

1129
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
No, I usually sleep.

1130
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
No, face down.

1131
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Face down for life, baby.

1132
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
That just makes it easier for somebody to suffocate you.

1133
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Because your nose is already in the pillow.

1134
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I suffocate myself.

1135
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I sleep face down and I pull the covers all the way up over my head like a fucking freak.

1136
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Damn.

1137
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
You like your little cave system?

1138
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Yeah.

1139
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And I'll have a little gap.

1140
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I'll have a little gap in the between the sheet and the mattress to let my nose poke out so I can breathe air.

1141
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I remember when I was young, I had this idea to make a sauna out of my duvet.

1142
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So I would wrap it tight so that there was no air coming in so that it would just get hotter and hotter as my body heat just reverberated around.

1143
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:36,000
And it became like a sauna in there and I would just stay there for a long time and then I would open it up and I would like, oh, wow.

1144
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I don't know why I did that.

1145
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Wow.

1146
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
But it was a fun experience.

1147
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
That sounds terrible.

1148
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I would hate to be like wrapped up in a blanket and get really hot and sweaty because of my body heat.

1149
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I don't think I would do it to go to sleep.

1150
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I think I would just do it sometimes.

1151
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Obviously, to sleep, I would not put myself in a suffocatable situation.

1152
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Understandable, yeah.

1153
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah, it's not what you want.

1154
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Sorry, I'm still looking at Tails Get Strolled.

1155
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I'm still looking at all these cool coyotes.

1156
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I think I'm going to draw a coyote.

1157
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,000
A lot of these artists draw him with like very, he's like muscular.

1158
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Like he's got like a very human sort of like musculature.

1159
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I don't think I'm going to do that.

1160
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I think I'm going to draw him like he looks in the cartoons, you know, noodley.

1161
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It's just seems more canonical.

1162
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
This is my opinion.

1163
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I think that's what I'm going to do.

1164
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Also, it's easier because drawing muscles is hard.

1165
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Hey, do you want to see a very early Gib drawing from 2007?

1166
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Sure.

1167
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Because I was looking through a bunch of my old art and I wanted to like try and figure out using context clues

1168
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
on where it was stored and what the skill level looks like, how old it is.

1169
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And I believe that this, this is 2007.

1170
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Whoa.

1171
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
This is so like Dominic Deegan.

1172
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You know what that is?

1173
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I don't know.

1174
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I was a big fan of Dragon Ball and I think some other things.

1175
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I think I was reading one piece as well.

1176
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I made an anime character and I didn't know how to draw their eyes,

1177
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
but I think I drew them here better than I do currently.

1178
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Dominic Deegan is an old webcomic that was very like how to draw manga looking.

1179
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It was controversial for a number of reasons, not least of which was that his art never improved

1180
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
despite years and years and years of practice.

1181
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Well, when you've reached perfection immediately.

1182
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Exactly.

1183
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Exactly.

1184
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So 2007 I would have been,

1185
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
what the fuck is year?

1186
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Well, that was 2007.

1187
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I would have been 14.

1188
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
It was 14 year old Gib art.

1189
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Wait, are you 29?

1190
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Will be this year, yeah.

1191
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Okay, okay, yeah.

1192
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I guess that checks out.

1193
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Who is this sword guy?

1194
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Girl?

1195
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
It's supposed to be a guy.

1196
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I think I drew the jacket like that because it's supposed to be like loose,

1197
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
like it's like loosely hanging,

1198
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
but I didn't understand that it should be hanging lower.

1199
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
So it looks like a breast.

1200
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
It does kind of.

1201
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
That's how wacky.

1202
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
How wacky.

1203
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And those double swords.

1204
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I think I was like, I was writing a manga.

1205
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I had drawn a bunch of panels,

1206
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
which I still need to like scan in,

1207
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
which I think were also around 2007, 2008,

1208
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
where I think I watched Princess Mononoke

1209
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
and I had been reading Dragon Ball in one piece

1210
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and I decided I'm going to make a manga.

1211
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And it's, I'm discovering it again.

1212
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
It's like, oh, this was cool.

1213
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I had like a notebook of like the story beats of the entire story.

1214
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And it's like, they go into the future at one point

1215
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
and it's basically Jack and Daxter too, exactly the same.

1216
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Yeah.

1217
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And it's like the future city,

1218
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
but these guys are, it's, I think it's like,

1219
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
it starts off as Princess Mononoke with that sort of

1220
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
the old, the spirits in the forest

1221
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
and the town with the log walls.

1222
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And then they go into, they fight stuff as demons.

1223
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Then they go into the future and it's Jack too.

1224
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And in the future, Jack too, there's also demons.

1225
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
They're the metalheads,

1226
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
but they're called something different because I made them

1227
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
and it's my idea actually.

1228
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
That's right.

1229
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And then it goes further into the future.

1230
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
No, it doesn't, it goes into a different dimension,

1231
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
which is real life, human world,

1232
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
where a character who is a self-insert,

1233
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
who is like really upset and gets bullied and hates everyone,

1234
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
gets infected by demonic powers

1235
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
and becomes venom from Spider-Man, essentially.

1236
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And then they fight and they fight.

1237
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I can't remember what happened,

1238
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
but there's also a Darth Vader character

1239
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
and there's space and I want to make that.

1240
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I want to make a real comic.

1241
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I want to make the stupid 14-year-old idea real

1242
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
because I have the power.

1243
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Do they come to the real world

1244
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and they find your self-insert

1245
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
who's sitting there drawing the comic

1246
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
and they're like, hey, stop putting bad,

1247
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
stop putting conflict in our story

1248
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and you're like, no, I'm edgy and I'm going to take it out on you.

1249
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Raw and you turn into a venom and then you fight.

1250
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That character, I don't think it was like a literal self-insert.

1251
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
It wasn't my name, but it was like the character,

1252
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I was designing a character and I'm like, okay,

1253
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
so they're a teenager and they get bullied a lot

1254
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
and they're very quiet and it's just a list of things that are me

1255
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
and they hate life and they hate everyone.

1256
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
They would kill and the demon energy,

1257
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
they would kill if they could, but they can't.

1258
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
But then from the past, from another dimension, the demons come in,

1259
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I get bitten by a demon and it is fueled by rage

1260
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
and because I'm so angry, this character I need,

1261
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
this character is so angry.

1262
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
They involve the demonic power and they become super powerful.

1263
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:19,000
But at some point, they become a good guy like Vegeta

1264
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
because they learn to be friends, they learn to have friends

1265
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and that's what it's all about.

1266
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But they still retain the ability to turn into an evil angry venom

1267
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
so they become like a useful character in the fights

1268
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
against the Darth Vader called Lord Zenith

1269
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
because he's like, I looked in the dictionary

1270
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
for something that began with Zenith and Zenith sounded cool

1271
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
and it also meant really like the most.

1272
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It's like, Lord Zenith, that's my main guy.

1273
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It's not the worst name I've ever heard.

1274
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Ah, it's so cool, look at all those notes.

1275
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
My handwriting is abysmal.

1276
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I can't write a single letter correctly.

1277
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
But I could still read it somehow.

1278
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Well, la di da.

1279
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Yeah, I'm something of an artist.

1280
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I've been drawing since I was one.

1281
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Look who made a little notebook about some stuff.

1282
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yeah, look at it.

1283
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Look at me.

1284
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
See?

1285
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Yeah, all right, done.

1286
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Crazy.

1287
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Okay, what else?

1288
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
What else we got?

1289
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Topics.

1290
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
The thing I wanted to talk about a few weeks ago.

1291
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Yeah, you mentioned that fucking hour ago.

1292
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Oh, I didn't want to go into it immediately.

1293
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
No, no, no, I mean, yeah, sure.

1294
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I watched a show, a very good show,

1295
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
about animation that came out two years ago.

1296
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
So I'm late to the party, but keep your hands off Isoquin.

1297
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

1298
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Oh, I still haven't seen that one,

1299
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
but I've been recommended it by a number of people

1300
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
and it sounds like it probably would like it.

1301
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Yeah, well, I watched the first episode.

1302
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Yeah.

1303
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Yeah, I watched the first episode when it like first aired

1304
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
and I gave it a 10 on Mal

1305
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
and then I'm like, I'll watch for rest of us later

1306
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and I didn't actually watch it until my birthday in February.

1307
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
But it's really good, obviously, that's no surprise

1308
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
because I'm an animator.

1309
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I'm going to be biased to a show that's entirely

1310
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
just a giant love letter to animation and everything.

1311
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
But the part of a show I didn't expect to love

1312
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,000
was just how much focus there was on cutting corners

1313
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,000
as an art form to make your animation production better.

1314
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
You didn't like that?

1315
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I do like that.

1316
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Okay, good.

1317
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I like that, too.

1318
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
The characters go on big monologues,

1319
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
like very passionate monologues in one episode

1320
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
about how like, well, for this shot,

1321
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
we can just use a still image

1322
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
and we can just pan the camera a bunch of times

1323
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
to like imply motion and that way we can get a shot done

1324
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
in like just a couple of hours

1325
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
and then this shortcut we can take, we can do this

1326
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
and like it's just a whole bunch of like

1327
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
ways to like do things efficiently with less effort

1328
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and I'm like, damn, this is the opposite

1329
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
of what I've been doing my whole life

1330
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
and it's real obvious shit that I know already

1331
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
but I've never had it presented by good anime women

1332
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
telling me to do it.

1333
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
That's all I needed was to be told by good anime women.

1334
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Yeah.

1335
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Kanamori is the non-creative technically.

1336
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Yeah.

1337
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Like she's not an artist

1338
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
but she gets the other girls into shape

1339
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and tells them there's, you know,

1340
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
like totally practically minded

1341
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:05,000
and is like really strong, like strong force of will.

1342
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
She whips those idiots into shape.

1343
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
They're thinking.

1344
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Exactly.

1345
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
But my magical mythical special thing

1346
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
and she's like, shut up.

1347
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
We've only got one month to do this.

1348
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
You can't do that.

1349
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
You can't do it.

1350
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I know.

1351
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
That's great.

1352
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
All the people who are artists

1353
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
who struggle with, you know,

1354
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
killing babies and all that.

1355
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Yeah.

1356
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Watch this and they were like, oh my god.

1357
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I wish I had a baby killer like her.

1358
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I know, I wish I had.

1359
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
That was my first thought.

1360
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I just send a picture of Kanamori to my friend.

1361
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I'm like, I need her in my life.

1362
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And he's like, for sex?

1363
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And I'm like, no.

1364
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Fuck you.

1365
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
No.

1366
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I just need someone to keep my ass in shape

1367
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
and keep me focused on my work.

1368
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Yeah.

1369
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I need that.

1370
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
It's what I've been.

1371
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
It's the piece I've been missing

1372
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
because I'm the overambitious.

1373
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Like every single thing has to be fucking extra.

1374
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And for the current project I'm working on,

1375
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I was already a bit too late

1376
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
because I'd already like gotten too deep

1377
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
into things being over the top, like complex.

1378
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So I was able to like reuse some animations

1379
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
just with different camera movements

1380
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
to get like extra shots

1381
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise

1382
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
that ended up looking really cool.

1383
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
So that was still something I was able to do.

1384
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Thanks to this.

1385
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
But yeah, I feel a lot better

1386
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
about approaching other projects in the future

1387
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
because this project I started seven months ago.

1388
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Granted, the first three months,

1389
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I had like no time to work on it,

1390
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
due to pencilmation being taken up my time.

1391
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And then having to finish all my commissions

1392
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
and then edit the one, the PCP episode

1393
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
with the voicemail reveal

1394
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and then edit a bunch of drawcast episodes

1395
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
before that got streamlined

1396
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
and then do a DA games video.

1397
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And I've had so much shit getting in the way,

1398
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
but I feel like when I do work on Comzone 4,

1399
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
which is going to be a much bigger production,

1400
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I think I'll really like storyboard it out

1401
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
from the start to have lots of shortcuts

1402
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
that look good.

1403
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And thanks to Azokin,

1404
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
which is also just such a fucking charming

1405
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and good show, even without all the

1406
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
really good practical like advice for animators

1407
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
that's in there.

1408
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Yes.

1409
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It's just a very pretty location to have.

1410
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So that is probably like

1411
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
easily top three favorite shows of all time

1412
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
for me right now.

1413
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I want a fucking another season.

1414
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Yeah, I love that.

1415
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I've been meaning to watch it for like two years.

1416
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Maybe I should give it a shot.

1417
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Oh, I watched the whole thing in one day.

1418
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Oh, wow.

1419
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Yeah, how many episodes is it? 20?

1420
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I think it's 12.

1421
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Oh, yeah, it's a short little thing.

1422
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Yeah, it's a short.

1423
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Okay, well, what's my excuse then?

1424
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Just watch one episode, see how you feel.

1425
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
No.

1426
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
No, I'll only watch 12 at a time.

1427
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right.

1428
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I have to commit to six hour block.

1429
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I mean, I'm not an animator,

1430
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
but in comics as well,

1431
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
shortcuts are base and yeah,

1432
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I love to cheat.

1433
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I love to cheat at everything.

1434
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
It's just, it's just good.

1435
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I like the concept of cheating,

1436
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
but I don't do it enough.

1437
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Yeah, because it's presented

1438
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
to the audience.

1439
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
It's something to aspire to,

1440
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
but you should be proud of.

1441
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And that's the thing that I'm like, yeah.

1442
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
The art form part of it is like

1443
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
knowing when to do it

1444
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
for maximum efficiency

1445
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
of time and resources.

1446
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
So like, you could skimp on

1447
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
the most important panel

1448
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
and have it be underwhelming.

1449
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Or you could skimp on like

1450
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
dialogue scenes, which is much more

1451
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
like, you know,

1452
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
like, you know,

1453
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
scenes, which is much more like

1454
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
a smart thing to do.

1455
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Skimp on everything that isn't like the money shot.

1456
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And then people will remember

1457
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
the money shot and they won't mind

1458
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
that there's so many panels

1459
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
or sort of like whatever.

1460
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Yeah, basically.

1461
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I don't know if that's what I was thinking

1462
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
when I did Clarissa,

1463
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
but I did draw that after

1464
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
watching Isoken, I think.

1465
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
That was 2020.

1466
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Clarissa has like, occasionally

1467
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
a cool big panel where she's got a gun

1468
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
shooting, tooting.

1469
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And then a lot of the other ones are like,

1470
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I just need to show that she's going

1471
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
into this door. It doesn't matter.

1472
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Yeah, that's

1473
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
really, you can

1474
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
when you

1475
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
when you block out a panel,

1476
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
right, you can get away with little

1477
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
or no background like

1478
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
90% of the time.

1479
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
And it's always better

1480
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
to do that.

1481
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
One of the problems I had

1482
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
when I was trying to do,

1483
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I was trying to simplify things for my

1484
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
pony animations back in

1485
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
2016. I'm like, I'm going to do motion comics.

1486
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Because comic dubs

1487
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
are like a really popular way

1488
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
to get millions of views.

1489
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
You just take a comic and you like

1490
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
speak over it. I'm like, I could do that,

1491
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
but like, just have things

1492
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
like move subtly

1493
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
by like creating them in flash.

1494
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
But I would always like do full on

1495
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
backgrounds and shit and it's like,

1496
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
why?

1497
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Why?

1498
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
You probably got like half as many done as you

1499
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
could have.

1500
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
That was like 80% of my time

1501
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
was spent working on the backgrounds and shit

1502
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
just posing the character rigs,

1503
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
was the fucking easy part.

1504
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And no one cares except you.

1505
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
No one cares. Honestly, it looks worse

1506
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
that way. It would have been better simplified

1507
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
because it's too much visual clutter.

1508
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Oh, but fidelity.

1509
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Fidelity.

1510
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Oh, no, but the perfect

1511
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
parallax scrolling

1512
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
of the layers of the background.

1513
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Scientifically accurate.

1514
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Or whatever.

1515
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Fidelity.

1516
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Yes.

1517
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I remember, you know, I think

1518
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
the thing about

1519
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
that one of them

1520
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
that whips the others into shape just reminds me

1521
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
of a sentiment that I have

1522
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
repeated recently

1523
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
a few times, which is that

1524
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I miss

1525
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
working on

1526
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
stuff with like a group

1527
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
or in like a thing

1528
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
where it was like

1529
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
with T-Bap, it was me and Nate doing

1530
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
stuff and we would both be like, okay,

1531
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
you got to do this and I'll do this

1532
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
and like, what can we get done

1533
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
in like one day? Okay.

1534
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Can we do this? All right.

1535
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
We agree. We will take these

1536
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
tasks and this is our responsibility.

1537
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Okay, break. Let's go do them.

1538
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And we'd figure out

1539
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
like how much can we feasibly

1540
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
do in one day?

1541
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Okay, that's what we'll do. That's the episode.

1542
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
That sounds fun.

1543
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
The deadline

1544
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
is

1545
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
something that cannot be changed.

1546
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And so all you can do is plan

1547
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
your time

1548
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
as effectively as possible.

1549
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
That's how it was. The episode would come out.

1550
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
We'd be like, well, we want to get the T-Bap

1551
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
about it done like the same weekend.

1552
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
So how much can we do

1553
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
before Sunday?

1554
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
All right. Yeah, I think I would just

1555
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
leave it as like as long as it comes out

1556
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
before the next episode, then

1557
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
whatever.

1558
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Not timeliness. Timeliness was

1559
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
part of the T-Bap mission statement.

1560
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Yeah, I probably would have got more subscribers

1561
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
if I was quicker.

1562
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Perhaps.

1563
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Anyway, it's good to be part of a team.

1564
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
It's good to be part of a well-oiled machine.

1565
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Not like the PCP.

1566
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Not like the PCP.

1567
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Instead, I'm just a

1568
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I'm just a

1569
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
lone freak.

1570
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I'm just a lone

1571
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
gunman.

1572
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Just a lone sniper

1573
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
in the tower.

1574
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I don't know what that means.

1575
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Pointing your gun at Eleazar.

1576
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
He's how you get episodes out on time.

1577
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
You just chuck it at him.

1578
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Eleazar is very reliable.

1579
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Eleazar slaving over a hot

1580
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
PCP.

1581
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I can just say Eleazar.

1582
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
With a red dot, like sniper dot around

1583
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
dangling around his neck

1584
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
from across the street.

1585
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
He's so easy to

1586
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
manipulate. I can just say Eleazar

1587
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
puts Saul Goodman

1588
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
on screen and he'll do it.

1589
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
He knows where to find it.

1590
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
He's doing it right now.

1591
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I saw some

1592
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
sprite art of

1593
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Saul Goodman

1594
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
in Ace Attorney.

1595
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Like him banging the desk like Ace Attorney.

1596
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Oh.

1597
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
That sounds cool.

1598
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Was he in the style of Ace Attorney?

1599
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

1600
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It was just him in the scene

1601
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
instead of, I guess, Edgeworth.

1602
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
But it looked like him in that

1603
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
style and it looked, I was like,

1604
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I know that guy. He would.

1605
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
He would do

1606
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
law.

1607
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I was disappointed that the

1608
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Saul Goodman

1609
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
from Attack on Titan

1610
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
didn't look like

1611
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
him much in the anime

1612
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
when they got to it.

1613
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I was annoying.

1614
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I'm not familiar with that guy.

1615
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
You know, I never finished

1616
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Better Call Saul

1617
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
now that I think of it.

1618
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Well, it's the last season

1619
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
is about to come out in like a week.

1620
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Oh god, it's not done.

1621
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
It's not done. It's good.

1622
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It's pretty fucking good though.

1623
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Probably one of my favorite shows

1624
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
with live action shows ever, definitely.

1625
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Bob Odenkirk is like

1626
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
pretty, he's pretty old, right?

1627
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Maybe like 60 something.

1628
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Maybe not 60.

1629
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Didn't he like collapse on set

1630
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
this past year? Like he had a health

1631
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
scare or something?

1632
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
He had a heart incident

1633
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
quote unquote.

1634
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I mean,

1635
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
most people are just like heart attack.

1636
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
He's like, well, technically,

1637
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
doctors say incident, but I mean,

1638
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
what difference is it?

1639
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Yeah.

1640
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
It was well filming the final

1641
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
season of Better Call Saul.

1642
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Wow. Okay.

1643
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Yeah, this

1644
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
the manga one just

1645
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
looks exactly like Bob Odenkirk.

1646
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Yeah.

1647
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
What?

1648
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Why does he do that?

1649
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
What is that tech on Titan?

1650
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I think he must

1651
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I feel like, yeah, he could have just been

1652
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
looking at Bob Odenkirk and

1653
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
it's close enough that I feel like

1654
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
this could be not an accident.

1655
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Aren't the Titans

1656
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
usually have no hair

1657
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
at all or very little hair?

1658
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
It depends. This feels like a very deliberate

1659
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
hairstyle to give a Titan.

1660
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It does. The hairstyle's spot on.

1661
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
And the face and even the expression

1662
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
just feels in character

1663
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
a little bit.

1664
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I mean, I heard Better Call Saul is,

1665
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I heard that it's really popular in China.

1666
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
It's possible it's popular in Japan too.

1667
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I don't know.

1668
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Better Call Titan.

1669
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Better Attack Saul.

1670
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Maybe when the last season comes out,

1671
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I will try and remember how far

1672
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
through it I was and

1673
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
go back and finish it.

1674
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I like Bob.

1675
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I like Bob and David.

1676
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
He's a good man.

1677
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Fun fact.

1678
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Before I had seen Breaking Bad

1679
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
or Better Call Saul,

1680
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I saw an animation called Better Call Saul.

1681
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Which is

1682
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
a Monsters Inc. version.

1683
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Oh, Better Call Sully?

1684
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Yeah.

1685
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Call him as in quell him.

1686
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
As in excise him.

1687
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Better Call Saul.

1688
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It's literally just

1689
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
a scene

1690
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
like the scene from the end of season one

1691
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
just with Monsters Inc.

1692
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And it's like word for word.

1693
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Exactly the same.

1694
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Except they only changed

1695
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
the names of a few characters.

1696
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
They just swapped a couple of words around.

1697
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
But most of the dialogue is identical.

1698
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And it's accurate

1699
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
to both franchises.

1700
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Which is really funny.

1701
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And so after I saw that,

1702
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
not knowing anything about the show,

1703
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I'm like Better Call Saul. More like

1704
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Better Fuck Chuck.

1705
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And of course- Better Feed Snead.

1706
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Better Feed Snead.

1707
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I didn't know that there was a character called Chuck

1708
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
in the show who does get fucked.

1709
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
And my friends thought that was very funny

1710
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
that I didn't understand

1711
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
the clever joke I made.

1712
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
His brother is Chuck, right?

1713
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Yeah, his brother.

1714
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
His funny brother.

1715
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So yeah, this is made by

1716
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Yukino Joe who I recently

1717
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
found out

1718
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
is a bit of a crazy person.

1719
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Wait, is this the guy who made the

1720
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Dog of Wisdom?

1721
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
He did the...

1722
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I'm my original character, Blonic.

1723
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
You know?

1724
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I found... I recently

1725
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
saw someone

1726
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
bemoaning the fact that the guy

1727
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
who made the Dog of Wisdom was like

1728
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
a weirdo NFT dude or something.

1729
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Yes, it's not just that.

1730
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
If you look at his Twitter, it's like

1731
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
he's trying to speedrun

1732
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
having every single bad take imaginable.

1733
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Alright, let's see here.

1734
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
He's attacked... I need to find his account.

1735
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Because

1736
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I don't know exactly what it's called

1737
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
but I did like

1738
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
some people responding to him calling him out.

1739
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Is it Cool the Joe?

1740
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Yeah, Cool the Joe sounds right.

1741
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
It's linked on his YouTube.

1742
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
He was attacking...

1743
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
He's only got 2,000 followers on Twitter.

1744
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Yeah, I'm assuming it's in a Twitter account

1745
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
he doesn't advertise much.

1746
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
But he had a bunch of tweets attacking

1747
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Disney employees who were criticizing

1748
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Disney River anti-gay stuff

1749
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and he was on the side of

1750
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
he was attacking them for criticizing

1751
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Disney which is like, why?

1752
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
He was attacking animators

1753
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and storyboarders who wanted

1754
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
the new deal for animation

1755
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
or whatever it's called.

1756
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I see him being a little whiny, a little

1757
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
bitch about it here.

1758
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
He just seemed to be attacking animators

1759
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
and storyboarders who want better

1760
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
workers rights

1761
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
and promoting NFTs

1762
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and all his NFTs got stolen too apparently

1763
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
but he still supports them.

1764
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
He's just doubling down.

1765
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
No, NFTs are good.

1766
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I swear.

1767
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Well...

1768
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Die.

1769
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
That's all I gotta say.

1770
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
He's got a Hexagon

1771
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Icons

1772
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
but I'm not sure

1773
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
if it's like actually

1774
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
an NFT or if it's just

1775
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
a regular one that just happens to be

1776
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Hexagonal

1777
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I can't tell.

1778
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
No, when I scroll up

1779
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
it has a circular outline.

1780
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
It's a fake Hexagon.

1781
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Why fake Hexagon?

1782
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Is it because NFTs got stolen?

1783
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
That would be so funny.

1784
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
If he's like, well I know they got stolen

1785
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
but I'm still going to use it.

1786
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I'm just going to make it a Hexagon.

1787
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I don't know.

1788
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Look, that's all poor little psycho troll

1789
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
didn't like that I called her out for being

1790
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
a horrible friend and a lazy ass shit animator

1791
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
You're a fucking slime.

1792
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Whoa, slime.

1793
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Sorry.

1794
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Wait, slime? What?

1795
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
What?

1796
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Hold on.

1797
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I see him saying what the fuck

1798
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
to Ross's

1799
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
he put animators

1800
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
into Family Guy?

1801
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Yeah, he's just been like

1802
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
attacking every animator.

1803
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
That was just a thing I read earlier.

1804
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I don't even know what he's responding to here.

1805
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I don't know what he's responding to

1806
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
but I just

1807
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
discovered a couple weeks ago that he's like

1808
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
attacking animators.

1809
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
He's attacking people in the industry.

1810
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
He's complaining that

1811
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
people want Disney to not be

1812
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
homophobic. He's complaining

1813
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
that people don't like NFTs.

1814
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
T's?

1815
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
NFTs.

1816
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I don't know. It's just weird.

1817
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Show the animator. I lost all my NFTs

1818
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
frown face.

1819
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Is that a tweet from this guy?

1820
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
That's his tweet.

1821
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
And he retweeted it, I guess.

1822
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Why would you

1823
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It's

1824
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
the Cuphead show

1825
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
February 22nd. The Cuphead show

1826
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
is terrible and NFTs are good.

1827
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Okay.

1828
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Yeah, that's weird.

1829
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
That's a weird take too.

1830
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
The war is bullshit.

1831
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Hulu Animaniacs pushed for

1832
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
this war. Animation workers

1833
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
do not deserve a new deal.

1834
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Okay.

1835
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
What? Is he talking about the war

1836
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
in Ukraine? Probably.

1837
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Is he blaming on Hulu Animaniacs

1838
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
reboot?

1839
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Maybe. I feel like that can't be it.

1840
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
He's got to be referring to the

1841
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
animation stuff as a war going on.

1842
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Animators want better pay.

1843
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Oh, how dare you start a war.

1844
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I wonder what he meant by this

1845
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
just screenshotting Biden

1846
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
mentioning that we're back in the Paris climate agreement

1847
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
and he just

1848
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
screenshotted it and didn't say anything. What does that mean?

1849
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Did Biden put a fucking

1850
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
It's weird for

1851
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
the POTUS to put a little

1852
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
colon P. I'll give him that.

1853
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I'll give him that.

1854
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
That's not real.

1855
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
That doesn't feel real.

1856
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Is that real?

1857
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Is that real?

1858
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I think

1859
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
it's impossible

1860
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
and therefore I will not look into it.

1861
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Hold on. We're

1862
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
back in the

1863
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Paris climate

1864
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
agreement colon P.

1865
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
No results.

1866
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I don't think it's real.

1867
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
So that just makes the tweet

1868
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
even more mysterious.

1869
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
What is he trying to say with this?

1870
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
He probably found it

1871
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
and assumed it was real and then he was like

1872
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
look at this fucking president.

1873
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Look at this

1874
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
groomer president using emojis

1875
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
to make

1876
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
to sexualize children

1877
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
somehow.

1878
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Typical Democrat.

1879
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
He's being all cutesy

1880
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
but he's got an agenda.

1881
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
He's trying to turn me gay with this little

1882
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
with this little tongue sticking out emoji.

1883
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Well it's not going to work.

1884
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I'm going to turn him gay first.

1885
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Then we'll see.

1886
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I had an opportunity to put

1887
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Dog of Wisdom on Disney Channel.

1888
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
I made an NFT instead of doing that.

1889
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
NFTs don't seem that sick when compared to the

1890
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
acceptable idea of success

1891
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
where big money feels entitled to be so invasive

1892
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
and then drag your corpse around

1893
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
when you're gone.

1894
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I don't give a fuck what people say.

1895
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I've been condescending for a year.

1896
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I made the right decision.

1897
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
What?

1898
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
He made a tweet

1899
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
where he says I'm against NFTs now.

1900
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Okay.

1901
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Wait, did he say that?

1902
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
He literally said that.

1903
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It wasn't April Fools.

1904
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
It was November 4th.

1905
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
November 4th.

1906
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Last year.

1907
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I don't know, I'm just scrolling.

1908
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
He's a hard man to figure out.

1909
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I like his animations.

1910
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
They're funny. They tickle me.

1911
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
The man, though.

1912
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Seems like he's mad.

1913
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Seems like he kind of made the wrong choice

1914
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
by making an NFT instead of

1915
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
working for Disney.

1916
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Maybe he's mad that he did that.

1917
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
But he's got to double down.

1918
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Because then he lost all his NFTs.

1919
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Lol.

1920
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Okay, what a weirdo.

1921
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Okay, seems like...

1922
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
You know what?

1923
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Seems like he's coming from a place

1924
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
where things did not go so well for him.

1925
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And I think that's

1926
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
funny.

1927
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I genuinely hope whatever is

1928
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
going on in his head

1929
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
he calms down.

1930
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Because it just seems like

1931
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
he's living a stressful life and he doesn't have to.

1932
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
He does seem

1933
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
miserable

1934
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
and confused.

1935
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I'd like him to not be miserable

1936
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
and confused.

1937
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
It's not too late.

1938
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Alright, well

1939
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
we got to kill him.

1940
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
What I'm saying, the way we can fix this

1941
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
is to end him.

1942
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Execution.

1943
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Let me boot up Elden Ring.

1944
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I'm going to go find him.

1945
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Draw him into your comic.

1946
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Draw him into my...

1947
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Are you that guy who did that dog

1948
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
in a bar?

1949
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Yes, stab.

1950
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
He says,

1951
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
and I'm also a demon

1952
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
with demon powers.

1953
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Prepare to fight.

1954
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Prepare to fight.

1955
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I'd rather not prepare.

1956
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Dies.

1957
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Alright.

1958
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Let me check my little notes.

1959
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Did I have anything else

1960
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
to mention today?

1961
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
No.

1962
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Yeah,

1963
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I...

1964
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Lord Ghost things,

1965
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
people put the backer surveys.

1966
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Please fill them out

1967
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
after I get like a few more.

1968
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
If there's like three people left

1969
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
that just haven't responded

1970
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
then I'll just send what I can

1971
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
and deal with it later.

1972
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
How did we get

1973
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
on the subject of the dog man?

1974
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
We mentioned

1975
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Better Call Saul

1976
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
and then Better Call Saul

1977
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
and then the guy who made it.

1978
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
And I'm playing Elden Ring.

1979
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I'm streaming Elden Ring by the way.

1980
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
If you want to watch me play Elden Ring

1981
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
for the first time and not know what is happening,

1982
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
you can go to

1983
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
twitch.tv.com

1984
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
and watch that.

1985
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Yeah.

1986
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Maybe what I can do

1987
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
because my project will be done...

1988
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I mean, it's basically done.

1989
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
It'll be possibly out today

1990
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
and maybe the NSFW version

1991
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
will be done before Friday.

1992
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I could be streaming Pumpkin Alley.

1993
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Maybe I could try and arrange it

1994
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
to stream it when this

1995
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
PCP comes out.

1996
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Or two hours after whenever people get to this part

1997
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
in the episode so that they know

1998
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
to go watch me right now.

1999
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
That's assuming my husband doesn't have plans

2000
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
and I looked with that but I could try.

2001
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Please do.

2002
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I'd watch that.

2003
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I would.

2004
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I try to watch every video and stream

2005
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
of people playing Pumpkin Alley.

2006
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I know.

2007
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I was watching at fucking everything

2008
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
when the PCP dating sim came out.

2009
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
That was such a...

2010
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
The two weeks after we released that

2011
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
was so nice just watching everything

2012
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
seeing all the reactions and stuff.

2013
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Yeah.

2014
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
That was so fun.

2015
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
That was so cool.

2016
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
That was radical.

2017
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I should have retweeted

2018
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
the dating sim on April Fools.

2019
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Oh yeah.

2020
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Two year anniversary at this point.

2021
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Yeah.

2022
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Guys, it's officially been two years

2023
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
since the PCP was good.

2024
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
That's what they say.

2025
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
It's been longer than that.

2026
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Let's be honest.

2027
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
You have to keep turning back the clock

2028
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
like, when is it going to be good?

2029
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I knew it was good.

2030
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Surely it was.

2031
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
The horse cast is still not good.

2032
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
What the fuck?

2033
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
You turn the last page and you're like,

2034
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
huh?

2035
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
What?

2036
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
The horse cast is good.

2037
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I do like it a lot.

2038
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
What have I been doing for seven years?

2039
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
It's scary how British

2040
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
you sound in the horse cast,

2041
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Kim.

2042
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
That's because I don't

2043
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
know how I sound now.

2044
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I sound like me.

2045
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
But I definitely...

2046
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I haven't noticed the difference, but maybe it's been gradual.

2047
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It's definitely gradual.

2048
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I didn't talk much

2049
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
at all.

2050
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
But I certainly didn't talk

2051
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
much at all on

2052
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
the internet

2053
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
before we started doing podcasts.

2054
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
But I didn't talk

2055
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
to Americans ever

2056
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
before I was doing stuff like that.

2057
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
So it was like

2058
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I'm surrounded by different accents.

2059
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I sort of picked them up over time.

2060
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
My voice

2061
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
sometime in like the first or

2062
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
second year of the PCP

2063
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
changed. There's like an

2064
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
old Ben voice

2065
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
and I don't know

2066
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
I don't know. There's like

2067
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I can tell it's like, oh, that's how I used to sound

2068
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
and this is how I sound now and there's

2069
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I don't know what happened to

2070
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
change it, but like my voice used to be

2071
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
like deeper.

2072
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Your beard is made

2073
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
deeper and now it's gone.

2074
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
It's kind of coming back, actually.

2075
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
It's looking good.

2076
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Looking good. I'm down to 170 pounds.

2077
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
My beard is coming

2078
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
in.

2079
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Things are looking up.

2080
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I've got

2081
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
it's all going

2082
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
for me. It's all coming my way.

2083
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
It sounds like you're about to cry.

2084
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Well, I mean

2085
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
no.

2086
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Shut up.

2087
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
It's all coming up.

2088
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Things are finally

2089
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
going to go well for me.

2090
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Okay.

2091
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
What was I talking about?

2092
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Do you want to do voicemails?

2093
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Yeah.

2094
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I have a feeling that some of them might

2095
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
be bad and I am going to

2096
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
not acknowledge those.

2097
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
So

2098
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I

2099
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
understand.

2100
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Yes.

2101
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
You

2102
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
wait.

2103
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Okay, we had

2104
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
all right. Here we go.

2105
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
The first voicemail

2106
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
of the day. I'm going to post these in

2107
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
general, I guess.

2108
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
It is called, let me find

2109
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
the number

2110
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
uh

2111
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
five seven

2112
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
four four five seven.

2113
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
This is called Breaking News, sorry.

2114
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Uh oh, what?

2115
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Kingdom Hearts 4

2116
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
trailer.

2117
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I saw a

2118
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
screenshot of

2119
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Sora's new design. I was wondering

2120
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
what that was from.

2121
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
That's gotta be fake.

2122
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
What the fuck?

2123
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Let me, this is the tweet

2124
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I saw.

2125
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
He's got normal sized shoes

2126
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
now. He's no longer

2127
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
chubby shoes, Mickey Boy.

2128
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Is that Kyrie?

2129
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Nah, it's a sallyoop.

2130
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
They made this in response to that really

2131
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
long video, Shitting on Kingdom Hearts 3.

2132
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I bet they did. Kingdom Hearts 3

2133
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
is a waste of time.

2134
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I think that's the video, yeah.

2135
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I've been hearing everyone talk about it for the past two weeks.

2136
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I love that video. I've watched it like four times.

2137
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
A waste of effort, I think.

2138
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
A waste of effort. That's what it is.

2139
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Wait, that's eight months ago. Why did I only hear people talk

2140
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
about that video a couple weeks ago?

2141
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
That video was okay, but it was very...

2142
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I didn't understand

2143
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
what he was getting at.

2144
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I'll be honest, I didn't play

2145
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Kingdom Hearts 3,

2146
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
so I don't even have that strong an opinion.

2147
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Oh, no.

2148
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I saw it. I saw

2149
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 being played in my living room

2150
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
when it was brand new

2151
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
and

2152
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
there was something off about it,

2153
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
and then we found out how short it was

2154
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
and then we just gave up.

2155
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Yeah, it's not

2156
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
good, but it's all right.

2157
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
It's not worth the money.

2158
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
That's definitely the

2159
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
something I could say. It's not worth the money it costs.

2160
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
It's not worth $60?

2161
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
No, not at all.

2162
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Oh, plus for $20

2163
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
or $30 DLC to actually have the rest of the game.

2164
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I sort of enjoyed.

2165
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Oh, yeah, and you go

2166
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
DLC to get the real ending.

2167
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
That guy said, like the only part

2168
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
of the game that guy said was good, was the DLC.

2169
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
He really liked the DLC

2170
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
and like nothing else.

2171
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Like the Tangled is world is like

2172
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
nothing interesting

2173
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
and the Big Hero 6

2174
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
world is really boring.

2175
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Toy Story World is kind of cool

2176
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
and parts of the Caribbean

2177
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
world is like, ah, finally a pirate ship

2178
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
game that I like.

2179
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
And I forget

2180
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
if there was even

2181
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
anything else.

2182
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It was frozen.

2183
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Frozen. That was a

2184
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
boring level. I heard it was bad.

2185
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
It was just sort of like

2186
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
really, really

2187
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
uninteresting.

2188
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
And then the story doesn't really even exist

2189
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
until you get to the end.

2190
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
It's just sort of like

2191
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
meandering around

2192
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
and then, oh yeah,

2193
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
the organization.

2194
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Now we can play the game.

2195
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
But I didn't fight the final boss

2196
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
because I was like, I don't care.

2197
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I don't care about that stuff.

2198
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I was surprised to find out

2199
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
that Kingdom Hearts 3 is not really the end.

2200
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
It's sort of

2201
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
it's still setting up for more games.

2202
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I kind of thought 3 was supposed

2203
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
to be the end, but it's not.

2204
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
So, okay.

2205
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Yeah, I think something

2206
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
something, the end

2207
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
of the Xehanort trilogy

2208
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
or whatever.

2209
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Some sort of villain

2210
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
is no longer the main villain

2211
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
and now it's going to be a different arc

2212
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
of Kingdom Hearts, I guess,

2213
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
is the idea.

2214
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Yeah, which

2215
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
it's just weird.

2216
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Xehanort is

2217
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
like, I mean in my

2218
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
mind, he's the bad guy

2219
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
and like

2220
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I don't know, Kingdom Hearts does not feel

2221
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
to me like a robust

2222
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
enough intellectual property to be like,

2223
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
okay, that was just the first arc of Kingdom Hearts.

2224
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Now we're moving on to a whole new

2225
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
fucking plot.

2226
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Well, as you can see in this tweet

2227
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
the second image, that's Alleyoop.

2228
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
So this is actually my game

2229
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
is Pumpkin Alley.

2230
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
They approached me

2231
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
after playing the demo and they said

2232
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
can we make

2233
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
your game into Kingdom Hearts 4?

2234
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And I said, sure, here's all the rights

2235
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
to my intellectual property

2236
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
and I didn't want to get paid for it

2237
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
and they just took it. So if you see a Pumpkin girl

2238
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
they

2239
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
it's all theirs. Got it.

2240
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Damn. Got it.

2241
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Noted.

2242
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2243
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I guess I'll

2244
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
eagerly await

2245
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
when this game comes out and then I'll watch

2246
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
YouTube videos about how bad it is

2247
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
and I'll get a lot of enjoyment out of that.

2248
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I was kind of like

2249
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I played the second game

2250
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
and I enjoyed it. It was a really, really good fun game.

2251
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Yeah.

2252
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And then I didn't want to play

2253
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
like the 70 different things

2254
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
that were

2255
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
on PSP

2256
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
and mobile, whatever they were

2257
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
all over the place.

2258
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And so I was like, okay, I'll just buy the third one.

2259
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And unfortunately

2260
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
it was like 12 years.

2261
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Yeah, unfortunately they did not design it

2262
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
to be

2263
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
playable after you just beat the second game.

2264
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
You have to be a super fan

2265
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
to even comprehend anything.

2266
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
You have to have played all of the secret

2267
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
like the side things.

2268
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
The PSP and like the weird like

2269
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
online the mobile game and all that.

2270
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
You have to be

2271
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
at least knowledgeable

2272
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
about some of the bigger ones

2273
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
like Chain of Memories or

2274
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
whatever the fuck that one was.

2275
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I did play Chain of Memories

2276
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
and it was awesome. Not that one.

2277
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
It was like those other ones. I forget what they're called.

2278
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
You mean like 368 over two days

2279
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
and Birth by Sleep.

2280
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Birth by Sleep, that's the one.

2281
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
They probably expect you to have played that

2282
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
and I didn't. So

2283
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
it's not much for me in that game.

2284
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Is Birth by Sleep the one about

2285
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Terra and Aqua and

2286
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Ventus?

2287
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I think so.

2288
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
They've fallen asleep and you gotta wake up

2289
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
and get born.

2290
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
They've fallen asleep.

2291
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Okay, I will.

2292
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Thanks.

2293
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
That's exactly what is

2294
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
in that game.

2295
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Whatever, Kingdom Hearts is

2296
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
fucking silly.

2297
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
The trailer's out so maybe

2298
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
five years from now, Kingdom Hearts 4 will come out.

2299
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Ten years, twelve.

2300
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
That'll be exciting.

2301
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Alright, let's do voicemails.

2302
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
First voicemail

2303
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
is called

2304
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Nate Besman 2022.

2305
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Alright.

2306
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Three, two, one, go.

2307
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I did see that comment

2308
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
about my usage of the word retarded.

2309
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I will never give up

2310
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
the word retarded. Never.

2311
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I won't do it.

2312
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
The euphemism treadmill has been spinning

2313
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
along so fast lately.

2314
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I will never give up that word.

2315
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
It is a rude word.

2316
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
I totally agree. I'm a rude guy.

2317
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I'm a rude dude. What can I say?

2318
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Okay.

2319
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
You know what?

2320
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I know people

2321
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
that use the R word.

2322
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I personally

2323
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
have ceased

2324
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
to use it, but I would be

2325
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
a hypocrite to get upset

2326
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
at Nate using it

2327
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
because there are other people

2328
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
that use it and I don't

2329
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
bishot them.

2330
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I let it go without comment.

2331
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I mean, it is his word.

2332
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
It is his word.

2333
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
True.

2334
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I didn't get to pass.

2335
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Lucky.

2336
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Damn.

2337
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
It's just a hard one.

2338
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Of all the words to call someone dumb,

2339
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
that's just a hard one.

2340
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I guess so.

2341
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Sometimes I just want to

2342
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
say it hard.

2343
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I don't know.

2344
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
It's got the R right there.

2345
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
It's just stupid with a hard R.

2346
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Patard.

2347
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Patard.

2348
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Star Trek Picard.

2349
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I don't know.

2350
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
I've been very

2351
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
resistant to stop saying it,

2352
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
but ultimately when it comes to me,

2353
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
it's dropping words from my vocabulary.

2354
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
It's just about

2355
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
the fact that I just don't want to upset people

2356
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
in my day-to-day conversation and I've just met more

2357
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
and more people who are upset by it.

2358
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I feel like

2359
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
they've been told to be upset by it

2360
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
and not because

2361
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
the word actually gets used in an ableist way

2362
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
that much compared to

2363
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
the millions of uses where it's just

2364
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I'm like, ah, I'm fucking retarded.

2365
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Oh, I dropped something.

2366
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
That's how I hear the word use my whole life

2367
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
and I've only ever heard it used in an ableist sense.

2368
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
A handful of times

2369
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
really ever.

2370
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
To me, it doesn't come across that way.

2371
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
I feel like that's probably

2372
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
it doesn't offend me.

2373
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I was bullied for being neurodivergent

2374
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
and I had that word thrown at me a bunch

2375
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
but I didn't care about the word.

2376
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I cared that people thought that I was stupid

2377
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
because I think I'm smart. How dare you say I'm dumb.

2378
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I never cared about the word.

2379
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I only ever cared about

2380
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
if I was being bullied for my weird behavior

2381
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
in high school, I don't know.

2382
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
The word was the least

2383
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
of my worries compared to

2384
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
the knowledge that they've hated me.

2385
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
That's what I've heard.

2386
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
That's all language

2387
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
is that it's not literal

2388
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
the word, it's the way

2389
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
it's used

2390
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
that can rub someone the wrong way

2391
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
when it's saying I don't like you

2392
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
can be more damaging than

2393
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
a swear word hurled at a person.

2394
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I agree, but I also feel like

2395
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I can

2396
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I can swap it out for something else

2397
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
it's not too difficult.

2398
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Whatever I think of like

2399
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
times when I would say

2400
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
fucking our word

2401
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I would just replace it with stupid

2402
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
because that's basically the same thing

2403
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
that's what I mean.

2404
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I've been working towards that

2405
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I have fucking stupid

2406
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
I've been saying that more

2407
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I haven't completely dropped it

2408
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
but I'm working my way

2409
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
out.

2410
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Every time someone told me

2411
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
that it bothered them

2412
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
that I would use it

2413
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
I was like okay noted

2414
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
and I guess

2415
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
there were enough of those times

2416
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I guess it really comes down to the fact

2417
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
that a word used

2418
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
can have unintended

2419
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
effects

2420
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
even if you don't use it in a disparaging way

2421
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
some people just feel bad when they hear it

2422
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
so that has to be

2423
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
accounted for in deciding

2424
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
what words to use not just

2425
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
when you decide to say something to someone

2426
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
in a certain way to make them feel bad

2427
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
if you want to do that

2428
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
but

2429
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
knowing that there could be collateral damage

2430
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
and maybe you could shrug

2431
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
and be like oh people are so sensitive these days

2432
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
but like I don't know

2433
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I guess they are what are you going to do

2434
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
are you going to be annoying to everyone

2435
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I don't know how true this is

2436
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I would just hate the idea but like

2437
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
because I feel like the word

2438
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
in the mid-2000s was on its way

2439
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
to just becoming a colloquial word like stupid

2440
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
where it would have no more offense than that

2441
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
because

2442
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
it was becoming casual but then

2443
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
there was like pushback to keep

2444
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
the word offensive I feel like

2445
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
almost

2446
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
and I feel like

2447
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
back then no one was really hurt

2448
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
by the word that I was aware of

2449
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
but now people seem to be very hurt by it

2450
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
when I'm like

2451
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I have to wonder like is it because of like personal experiences

2452
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
you've dealt with ableism that have like made you

2453
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
that sensitive to the word

2454
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
or is it because you've just been told

2455
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
over and over that it's bad and you can't say it

2456
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
if it's the latter

2457
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
then you're just kind of

2458
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
making the word hurt people more than it would have

2459
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
if you just let it go

2460
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
I feel like it's

2461
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
more complicated than just a single person's decision

2462
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I feel like

2463
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
in a society where

2464
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
the R slur is an R slur

2465
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
and you can't say it

2466
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
somebody deciding to say it

2467
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
says something about a person

2468
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
that like

2469
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
it maybe makes people feel

2470
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
like if they're willing to break

2471
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
social norms

2472
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
what else are they willing to break

2473
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
socially?

2474
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Bones, skulls, ligaments

2475
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
I think

2476
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
it's a gender

2477
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
gender

2478
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I think it's not something you should

2479
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
like

2480
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
if somebody says the R slur they're there for

2481
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
it's not like a deductive thing

2482
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
but it's like it's understandable

2483
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
that breaking a social

2484
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
rule

2485
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
that is not like written down it's just sort of everybody

2486
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
decides yes we're not going to do this

2487
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
it says something

2488
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
about you as a person that you decide to break it

2489
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
knowing that it's a rule

2490
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
that people follow

2491
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
and that it's you know the consequences of that

2492
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
might be overblown sometimes

2493
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
but it's

2494
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
it's too nuanced to have like

2495
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
one like either or

2496
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I think

2497
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
language is crazy

2498
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
and the way we use it and interact with each other

2499
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
has changed so much over the past few decades

2500
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
so I don't know

2501
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
I don't know I just know

2502
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
people told me that hey the word

2503
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
is hurtful and I was like

2504
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
oh okay sorry

2505
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
but I also

2506
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I just worry

2507
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
the best you can do is just

2508
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
work on your

2509
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
and I don't really have an opinion

2510
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
because it doesn't offend me but

2511
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I don't know

2512
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I just took people out their word when they said

2513
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
they didn't like it

2514
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I don't know

2515
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
it's a bad habit for me to be like

2516
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
why do you really not like it

2517
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I shouldn't be saying that

2518
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
that's not fair

2519
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
I know what you mean

2520
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I just don't know

2521
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I'm happy to drop it

2522
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
it's again it's just gonna take me a while

2523
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
because I've said it my whole fucking life

2524
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
I said it back when I was being bullied and stuff

2525
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I also said it my whole life

2526
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
and I never

2527
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
it's like it's weird that like

2528
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
weirdly the proportion

2529
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
of the words usage that's ableist

2530
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
I feel like is increasing by having people

2531
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
stop using it in the innocuous way

2532
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
but whatever

2533
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I just worry that

2534
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
because I know there are some people who don't think

2535
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
you can say anything at all

2536
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
like you can't say stupid even

2537
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
you can't say dumb

2538
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I remember Faust Slime had to make a huge apology

2539
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
apology video because he said naners

2540
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
which is slang for

2541
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
bananas

2542
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
apparently that was too far

2543
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
and that's fucking

2544
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
wild to me

2545
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
that's a little funny

2546
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
it is a little funny

2547
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
but like

2548
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
they call someone stupid

2549
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
they're not like making a comment

2550
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
about like their brain function

2551
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
that they can't control or some shit

2552
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
they're just calling you foolish

2553
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
they're just saying that you're acting dumb

2554
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
not that you're

2555
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
oh you have a disability

2556
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
that you can't help haha

2557
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
like that's not what people are fucking

2558
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
saying when they use those words

2559
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
yeah but like it

2560
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
it's uh

2561
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
it's complicated

2562
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
to know how to

2563
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
like

2564
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
a single person can't decide

2565
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
like

2566
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
the way society should be

2567
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
and expect people to capitulate

2568
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
just because

2569
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
it's like

2570
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
there's so many moving parts

2571
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
if the wind tells me

2572
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
that I shouldn't say a certain word

2573
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
and it's something I said my whole life

2574
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
obviously I'm going to be like

2575
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
ah but I want to say it

2576
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
and maybe I'll slip up sometimes

2577
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
but like

2578
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
if it's consistent and it stays

2579
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
then I guess I'll just have to stop

2580
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
saying it

2581
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
because I live in a society

2582
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
and the society is a certain way

2583
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
and it's

2584
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
sometimes sucks but what am I going to do

2585
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
okay I don't know

2586
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I mean people

2587
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I just uh I didn't like it

2588
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
when people were mad at me

2589
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
yeah

2590
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
and I was like well

2591
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I know how to avoid this outcome

2592
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
yeah

2593
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I'm offended by people

2594
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
putting words in my mouth

2595
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
or putting meaning in my words I guess

2596
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
but I clearly didn't intend

2597
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
why can't I be mad at people

2598
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
for doing that

2599
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
am I doing that

2600
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
is that what you're saying

2601
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
no I'm talking to these hypothetical people

2602
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
who want to remove all

2603
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
insults to intelligence in the world

2604
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
get rid of all of them completely

2605
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
those are the people I don't like

2606
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I hope it's not a slippery slope

2607
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
I hope that doesn't catch on

2608
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
I mean

2609
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I feel like

2610
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I've seen pushback

2611
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
you can't even insult people

2612
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
for any amount of

2613
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
like

2614
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
it would become so cumbersome

2615
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
that society would be like

2616
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
nah we gotta have at least one

2617
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
we gotta have at least one

2618
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
so we can actually describe a thing

2619
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I've seen pushback against

2620
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
stupid but I've seen

2621
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
more

2622
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I've seen more

2623
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
pushback against the pushback

2624
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
where it's like okay

2625
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
you could interpret stupid to mean

2626
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
neurologically

2627
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
disadvantaged or whatever

2628
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
but you could also

2629
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
just be bad decision making

2630
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
someone could be

2631
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
poor reasoning

2632
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
yeah

2633
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
or dishonest reasoning even

2634
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
like if you wanted to be

2635
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
super slippery slope about it

2636
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
you could worry that the word no

2637
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
and the concept of

2638
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
disagreeing would become

2639
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
like

2640
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
you would be killed in the street

2641
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
for disagreeing

2642
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
and that's where

2643
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
that's where the logic

2644
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
would go if you were like super

2645
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
neurotic about it

2646
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I just don't see it

2647
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
being like an issue in the real world

2648
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
maybe on Twitter

2649
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
maybe Twitter and social media will get to a point

2650
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
where it's just unbearably like

2651
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
wokescoldy and they will

2652
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
tear you to limb from limb for doing anything

2653
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
in particular it's kind of sometimes

2654
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I mean it's sometimes like that sometimes like that

2655
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I mean I feel like wokescoldy

2656
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
like

2657
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
the aftermath

2658
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
like it's a big hype thing that happens

2659
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
once because it's the hot

2660
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
new thing to hate on a person

2661
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
or whatever because they did something

2662
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
a social faux pas but then it sort of gets

2663
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
forgotten and if the person doesn't

2664
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
run away then they can just continue

2665
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
to exist and nothing really

2666
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
happens

2667
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
well I feel like

2668
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
we have learned nothing

2669
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
but maybe that's okay

2670
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
yes

2671
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
no I have the F slur pass

2672
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
because I'm in a gay relationship

2673
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
but I don't like saying that word anymore

2674
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
yeah

2675
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I said that before a lot

2676
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
at some point I just sort of

2677
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
felt weird to say it

2678
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I dropped it before

2679
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Kai started transitioning

2680
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
and so

2681
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
it became

2682
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
retroactively a gay relationship later

2683
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
but I'm like I don't feel like saying it

2684
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
you're trans

2685
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
I'm not

2686
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Kai is trans

2687
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Kai is my husband

2688
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I thought you said I

2689
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
no Kai I'm not trans

2690
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
there's no magic button

2691
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
that'll make me an 8 foot tall

2692
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
woman with giant titties

2693
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
that button doesn't exist and that's the only

2694
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
trans I'll accept for myself

2695
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
so

2696
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
goals

2697
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
goals yes

2698
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
who wouldn't want to be

2699
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
8 foot tall mummy milker

2700
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
there are two buttons one turns me

2701
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
into that one turns everyone else

2702
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
on earth into that I'm pressing

2703
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
that button

2704
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
true

2705
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
that's the button

2706
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
that's the test

2707
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
that's the litmus test

2708
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I'm also pushing the everyone else button

2709
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I

2710
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
have to think about it for a little while

2711
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
do you get the F Slayer pass

2712
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
if you're gay

2713
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
if you press the button

2714
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
if you do any gay shit

2715
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
do you get the R word pass

2716
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
if you are neurodivergent

2717
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I guess so

2718
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I guess it would make sense

2719
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I was bullied

2720
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
for me being on

2721
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
the autism spectrum

2722
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
but according to people

2723
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
you can barely tell

2724
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
you're one of the good ones

2725
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I'm one of the good ones

2726
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I want to

2727
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
test it on the outside but I'm neurotypical

2728
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I could barely

2729
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
I could barely even tell

2730
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
that you're

2731
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
special

2732
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
that's a thing

2733
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
special feels like way more

2734
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
of a slur to me than the R

2735
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
word at this point

2736
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
context of the sort of person who would use

2737
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
that word so condescending

2738
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
imagination

2739
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
that sounds way slimy to me but

2740
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
oh well

2741
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
slimy

2742
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
but like could in

2743
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
20 years

2744
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
oh I work in special effects

2745
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
you can't say that word

2746
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
could it end up that way if enough people start

2747
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
using that word

2748
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
why is it called special effects

2749
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
it is a bit

2750
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
not the same but it is a bit weird

2751
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
to me

2752
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
you can't say

2753
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
colored people anymore

2754
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
but we circled back around

2755
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
and now people of color is

2756
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
sort of like the more polite way

2757
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
it's just the same words

2758
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I know it's one of those things where it's like

2759
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
the people who

2760
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
the kind of person who says colored people

2761
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
is typically a pretty sus person

2762
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
but at the same time it's like

2763
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
why is the acceptable word

2764
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
just the same thing but re-arranged

2765
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
yeah

2766
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I didn't get it

2767
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I believe it's because the colored

2768
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
people

2769
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
term

2770
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
came from

2771
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
that community and they said we would like

2772
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
to be referred to as this we find this acceptable

2773
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
and everyone was like okay

2774
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
yeah

2775
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
just how it was

2776
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I don't know why I think they just wanted to reclaim

2777
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
it maybe

2778
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
remember when there were takes

2779
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
about black bodies

2780
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
remember black bodies

2781
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
the black body spectrum

2782
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
no different thing

2783
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I don't know

2784
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
they're in the most pitched

2785
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
part of

2786
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
the BLM thing

2787
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
in like 2020 or whatever

2788
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
sometimes

2789
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
some white person with like

2790
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
some academic background would

2791
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
say some shit about how

2792
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
the police are committing violence against

2793
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
black bodies and they would say it like that

2794
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
it's like

2795
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
why are you saying it like that

2796
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
that is kind of

2797
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
weird

2798
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I guess it was like an academic thing

2799
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I don't know it just sounded really bizarre

2800
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
to hear it in the wild

2801
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
in my head

2802
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
that means they killed them and they're dead

2803
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
that's when you call someone a buddy

2804
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I think it was quickly decided

2805
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
that you know that's a weird way to talk about people

2806
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
let's not do it anymore

2807
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
yeah

2808
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I'm inclined to agree

2809
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I guess they did kill a few people

2810
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
they did kill a few people

2811
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
black body radiation is

2812
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
when something's hot and it

2813
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
emits

2814
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
energy

2815
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
in a spectrum

2816
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
black body spectrum is useful

2817
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
for art

2818
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
for trying things that emit heat

2819
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
what do you mean

2820
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
next voicemail

2821
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
just color it red

2822
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
just make it red that's my spectrum

2823
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
black body spectrum

2824
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
wait a minute

2825
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
black bodies, black body spectrum

2826
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
autism spectrum

2827
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
what

2828
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I'm just saying

2829
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
I don't know if I can post this image

2830
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
useful tip for artists who want to draw

2831
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
things glowing hot

2832
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
if you want to be specific about what temperature

2833
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
the thing is you can refer to this chart

2834
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
and grab your hues accordingly

2835
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
this is interesting

2836
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
if you want to be scientifically accurate

2837
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
that's stupid

2838
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
who wants to be scientifically accurate

2839
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
exactly

2840
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I mean the colors are nice

2841
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I guess

2842
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
but my manga is black and white

2843
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
oh yeah

2844
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
because we know

2845
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
the fruit powers

2846
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
that magma is hotter

2847
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
than fire

2848
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
and that's why akainu was able to kill

2849
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
ace

2850
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
we want to make akainu's magma that yellow color

2851
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
and we don't want to go any

2852
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
further than the 2100

2853
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
degree orange

2854
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
for ace's fire and then you'll know

2855
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
they did it the other way around

2856
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
do you remember

2857
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
akainu was red

2858
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
yeah he was they fucked it up

2859
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
they fucked it up

2860
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
they fucked it up they loved it

2861
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
sorry

2862
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
the search for

2863
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
well this wasn't when I typed black body spectrum

2864
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
but this popped up

2865
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
and I have to

2866
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I'm just like

2867
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
to me I have difficulty

2868
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
picturing the bodies attached to the ends

2869
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
of the arms so it just looks like a pile

2870
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
of severed arms

2871
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
duh

2872
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
how are they lying there

2873
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
I feel like they must have taken the pictures

2874
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
individually

2875
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
like two at a time

2876
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I think they would have had to be arranged in a very uncomfortable way

2877
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
yeah like the ambient occlusion seems

2878
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
accurate though where the skin's like touching

2879
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
unless there was very cleverly

2880
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
like photoshopped

2881
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I feel like maybe one or two of them

2882
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
for a second I thought these were all the same

2883
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
hand because they all

2884
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
kind of have the same sort of nails

2885
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
but no I don't like everything so

2886
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
yeah

2887
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
they do all have the same

2888
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
and they have the exact same

2889
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
arm length

2890
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
yeah they do

2891
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
these are all the people of the same size

2892
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
and build

2893
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
good for them

2894
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
damn

2895
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
good for them

2896
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
alright so that was the first voicemail

2897
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
yeah that was one voicemail

2898
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
alright

2899
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
it's called

2900
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Tommy J

2901
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
three two one go

2902
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
hey what's up it's me Tommy J

2903
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
back again with another stellar voicemail

2904
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
finally

2905
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
imagine if you will procrastinators

2906
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
that you are walking along

2907
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
in a dark and enchanted forest

2908
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
emphasis on forest

2909
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
and suddenly

2910
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
you're all of six and there is a fork in the road

2911
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
among these paths

2912
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
are the left path

2913
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
and the right path

2914
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
on the left path

2915
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
is basically you guys

2916
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
star a new podcast based on

2917
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
video game development

2918
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
and you have a variety of guests

2919
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
not including oblivion fall

2920
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
for obvious reasons

2921
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
obvious reasons

2922
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
of course you have to star a new patreon

2923
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
which you don't get the residual

2924
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
people that are already

2925
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
subscribed and you gotta

2926
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
change youtube channels

2927
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
and just change the name

2928
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
and that'd be okay

2929
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
what the fuck

2930
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
that seemed complicated

2931
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
on the right path

2932
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
which is the wrong path

2933
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
but is also the right path

2934
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
basically you guys

2935
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
continue business as usual

2936
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
and slowly but surely been

2937
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
threatened suicide until

2938
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Nate and Tom both come back on the podcast

2939
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I guilt them into it

2940
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I feel like Nate should probably heed that call

2941
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
being brothers and all

2942
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
but we never had concrete proof

2943
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
that you guys are actually related

2944
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
so who knows

2945
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
this was a completely unhinged

2946
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
voicemail

2947
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
stupid

2948
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
the proof is that I've seen both of your surnames independently

2949
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
through

2950
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
paypal transactions

2951
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
oh yeah

2952
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
at various points that's how I know

2953
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
how the mystery is gone

2954
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
if we

2955
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
if we could use this

2956
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
if we

2957
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
rebranded to be a video game

2958
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
development podcast

2959
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
we could just use the same

2960
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
the same patreon

2961
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
oh yeah we could rebrand the channel

2962
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
but we couldn't just rebrand the patreon

2963
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
we would have to make a whole new patreon

2964
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
it's not like you can change the url

2965
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
you can change the url

2966
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
they let you do that

2967
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
you can change everything and you keep the patrons

2968
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
they don't go away

2969
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I mean we could rebrand

2970
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I wouldn't want to rebrand to specifically a game developer thing

2971
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
because we don't talk about

2972
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
game development every week

2973
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
so we would

2974
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
we would literally just have

2975
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
less conversations

2976
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
less podcasts

2977
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
yeah I would not

2978
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
two best game developers

2979
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
bitch about things that aren't

2980
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
necessarily games

2981
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
it's like

2982
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
at that point why do anything

2983
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I'm already

2984
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
at that point

2985
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I don't know

2986
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
the podcast is just

2987
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
about us talking about whatever

2988
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
that's all it can ever be

2989
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
alright next voicemail

2990
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
is called

2991
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Tommy J

2992
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Agaj M

2993
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
3 2 1 go

2994
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
hey what's up

2995
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
procrastinators podcast it's me Tommy J again

2996
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
back at it again with another

2997
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
stellar voicemail

2998
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
in this voicemail I'd like to tell you

2999
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
that the next five voicemails

3000
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
are all me putting on

3001
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
different voices so

3002
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
enjoy so let's skip to six

3003
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
ahead

3004
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
I'll give him a chance

3005
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I would love for Tommy J to just be lying right now

3006
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
so that we

3007
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
it's just actually different people

3008
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I suspect this might not actually be

3009
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Tommy J

3010
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
we'll see

3011
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
we'll upload them at the same time

3012
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
without his knowledge

3013
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I mean I don't actually

3014
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
remember what Tommy J

3015
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
sounds like

3016
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
wait you just heard him

3017
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I think this might be an imposter

3018
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
can you see the time stamps

3019
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
were these voicemails all uploaded

3020
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
within a few minutes of each other

3021
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
no actually

3022
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
the last two were

3023
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
uploaded five days ago

3024
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
and then the next one was five days

3025
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
and then the one after that

3026
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
was four days

3027
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
and then after that three days

3028
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
three days three days

3029
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
so no some of these were posted days apart

3030
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
yeah that makes me think it was a bit because

3031
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I think they have to be

3032
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
because they would know that surely other people

3033
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
would post voicemails if you spread them out

3034
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
if you're going to do that you have to post them back to back

3035
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
if you want to be sure

3036
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I think so

3037
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I think that clinches it

3038
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
we didn't even listen to it yet and we know

3039
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
we've cracked the code

3040
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
alright the next one

3041
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
is called

3042
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
this meme needs to die

3043
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
three two one go

3044
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
oh my god

3045
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Ben no one cares

3046
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
no one cares about Trixie

3047
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
shut the fuck up

3048
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
ah

3049
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
okay you're right

3050
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
and yet we get voicemails about it

3051
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
I don't think Trixie's been brought up that much recently

3052
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
there was this one

3053
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
in a couple of the last

3054
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
episodes there were some voicemails

3055
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
about her

3056
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
yeah voicemails

3057
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
yeah yeah yeah yeah

3058
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
well that's what I mean like somebody cares

3059
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
this person

3060
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
just brought up Trixie

3061
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
on the PCP

3062
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
technically true I understand

3063
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I understand the perspective

3064
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I understand the perspective

3065
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
that like I care

3066
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
more

3067
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
about hating her than like

3068
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
regular humans do

3069
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
that like her

3070
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
and I can understand why you would think that

3071
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
but I assure you

3072
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
every time I say something mean about Trixie

3073
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
a bunch of absolute

3074
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
psychopaths

3075
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
like swarm out of the woodwork

3076
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
and get like very offended

3077
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
at me and say mean things to me

3078
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
and they can't tolerate it

3079
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
so I promise you there are people

3080
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
there

3081
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
there are people

3082
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
that

3083
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
do not share

3084
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
your opinion voicemailer

3085
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
but your point is

3086
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
understood

3087
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
okay

3088
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
next one is called

3089
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
I think there's no actual voicemail

3090
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
I think it's just cyber shell

3091
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
your videos suck and you just got lucky

3092
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
you got fame

3093
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
okay there's no voicemail

3094
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
damn I can't believe they said that

3095
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
about me the guest

3096
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
agree

3097
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
cyber shell complete hat

3098
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
complete fraud

3099
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
most people get lucky

3100
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
cyber shell is definitely lucky that

3101
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
some of their videos got big views

3102
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
but they're good videos

3103
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
so it was probably gonna happen at some point anyway

3104
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I like cyber shell videos

3105
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
at least the recent ones

3106
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I like you know all the things about the sonic

3107
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
oddities like

3108
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
the sonic fandom is huge

3109
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
and they're well made videos that are interesting

3110
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
and funny like across

3111
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
he was gonna get some amount of fame

3112
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I think he deserves it

3113
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
I mean he was posting

3114
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
his old sonic stuff was at a time

3115
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
when like

3116
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
I would say maybe if he had posted that same stuff

3117
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
like years later

3118
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
maybe it wouldn't have been

3119
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
as big a hit because it was like

3120
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
earlier youtube days

3121
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
but like that's just

3122
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
what posting be like

3123
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
I liked the

3124
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
the exploring chow

3125
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
video I forget what it was called

3126
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
I think it was something I bet

3127
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
yeah that's the one of the new I really like that one

3128
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
that was a really good video

3129
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
yeah that one ruled

3130
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
so there you go that's what I think

3131
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
next one is called

3132
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I have an annoying voice

3133
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
3 2 1

3134
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
go

3135
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
yes I use it

3136
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
for the strength

3137
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
of an unicorn

3138
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
he shall eat up

3139
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
some nations

3140
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
his enemies

3141
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
and shall break their bones

3142
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
and pierce them

3143
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
through with his

3144
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
arrows

3145
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
was that void gazer

3146
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I mean doid gazer

3147
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
maybe

3148
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
that's one of the quotes from

3149
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
phantom's revenge

3150
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
my favorite

3151
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
work on your voice

3152
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
it could be way more annoying

3153
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
you could do some run for the cube type shit

3154
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
if you wanted

3155
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
run for the cube

3156
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
it's the guy with the gummy rat who goes

3157
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
run away from the cube boy

3158
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
he talks like that

3159
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
that does not ring a bell at all

3160
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
oh god

3161
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
well now I sound like a fucking freak

3162
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
you know

3163
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
the rat when the cube boy

3164
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
sure

3165
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
of libyan fall

3166
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I'll just fucking link it

3167
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
sure

3168
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
run for the cube

3169
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
oh wow it's real

3170
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
5 seconds of that will make you scream probably

3171
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
hello

3172
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
oh god

3173
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
yeah okay I hear it

3174
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I hear it

3175
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
that's unfortunate

3176
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
alright I posted the next one

3177
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
the next one is called

3178
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
go

3179
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
hey

3180
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
do you think that christine

3181
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
would have been able to finish this game

3182
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
because I'm fucking gay

3183
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
no

3184
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
no I don't think she could be that

3185
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
who christine

3186
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
no I think probably

3187
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I heard black christine

3188
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
I guess I meant to say that

3189
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
do you think that christine

3190
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
yeah yeah

3191
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
we don't talk about

3192
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
we don't talk about black christine

3193
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
no

3194
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I think to beat phantom's revenge

3195
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
you need

3196
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
grit

3197
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
gumption

3198
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
fortitude

3199
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
strength of character

3200
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
moral fiber

3201
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
backbone

3202
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
you need a brain a heart

3203
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
and a dick

3204
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
and christine has none of those things

3205
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
so

3206
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
she can't do it

3207
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
you fool

3208
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
but I guess we'll never know

3209
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
brain a heart a dick and no sex

3210
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
in vet order

3211
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
those are

3212
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
that's the full package

3213
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000

I thought it was bet but I don't know what that would mean

3259
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I don't really know what the bit would refer to either

3260
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
just cause he said that

3261
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000

02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000

3269
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000

3270
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000

3272
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I think yeah

02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Cassie showed me what she was drawing for you

3274
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
yeah

3275
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
what do you think of that

3276
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
I loved it

3277
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
so much

3278
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
they said I was gonna hate it

3279
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
but I didn't

3280
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
I'll

3281
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
they're gonna post it

3282
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
well I don't know

3283
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
they said they weren't sure what account

3284
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
to post it on

3285
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
so I'll

3286
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
hopefully show it somewhere oh I made it my phone background

3287
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
they wanted me to make it my phone but I was like yeah okay

3288
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
that's fair

3289
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
cause I hate the default background that my phone came with

3290
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
uh

3291
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
so it's that's gone

3292
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
got the new one

3293
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
it's based

3294
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
anyway it was great wow I'm here

3295
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
you know uh sad news

3296
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
this week I just remembered

3297
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
uh actually I don't know

3298
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
sure it happened this week but it happened sometime

3299
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
fairly recently

3300
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I got the unfollow from deadly comics

3301
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
and that made me really sad

3302
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
oh what I love deadly comics

3303
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I love deadly comics too

3304
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
but you know what I deserve it

3305
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
I am useless

3306
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
I am nothing

3307
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
what is the point of following me there is none

3308
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
so you know what he was right

3309
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
you know what he was right to do it

3310
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
you know when you follow

3311
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Ben Steyn your twitter timeline

3312
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
is wailing and gnashing of teeth

3313
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
from one man

3314
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
he stuck it out for years

3315
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
uh but uh I don't know

3316
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
sometime in the last

3317
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
couple weeks I guess

3318
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
either something

3319
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
bugs him or maybe he was just like

3320
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I don't even know who this guy is

3321
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
why do I follow this guy

3322
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
is chris raygun still following me

3323
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I'm curious

3324
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Chris raygun comics follows me still

3325
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
oh well

3326
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
so I think it's I think you must have

3327
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
you must have struck something

3328
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
you must have done a Ben Steyn

3329
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
man like it well that's stupid

3330
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I maybe uh yeah I mean

3331
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
it's possible

3332
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
that my uh Trixie negativity

3333
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
might have been the thing

3334
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
probably

3335
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
it seems possible

3336
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
I would say

3337
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
I mean

3338
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
I would hope

3339
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I mean why would they even care

3340
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
but maybe they just don't like seeing posts about

3341
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
like that

3342
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
posts about like hey just fuck somebody maybe they just

3343
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
maybe they see it and they're like well this is just frivolous

3344
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
this is just a waste of my time and you know what it is

3345
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
so he was right

3346
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
with his decision

3347
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
uh

3348
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
and I support it

3349
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
don't do that on my timeline

3350
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
to follow his example you know what

3351
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
it's fair enough

3352
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I simply have nothing of value

3353
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
to contribute

3354
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
so all I can do is spew bile

3355
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
that's right

3356
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
but I mean if spewing bile is what I

3357
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
can do then

3358
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
I'll spew till the cows come

3359
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
spew away

3360
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
basically

3361
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
um

3362
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
next one is called

3363
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000

3364
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Killer Prince 930

3365
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
uh

3366
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
yeah here we go

3367
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000

3368
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000

at the rate I watch the videos

3371
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
or take to watch the videos

3372
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I really get

3373
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
late on the conversations

3374
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
anyway have you guys ever heard of

3375
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000

wasn't that the exact the very first one

3381
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I believe I believe it was the first episode

3382
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
yeah

3383
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
you must have been listening to the the horse cast

3384
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
so behind

3385
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
he's got a bit of a backlog yeah

3386
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
next one is called

3387
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
uh

3388
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
not a voicemail it's an image

3389
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
uh here let me post it

3390
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I love visual media

3391
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
oh

3392
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
then Trixie said to me Ben you're just mad

3393
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
that you don't get to fuck me like I do share

3394
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
grandma let's get you to bed it happened it really

3395
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
happened I have the

3396
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
I have receipts

3397
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
yeah I know that happened because I've seen

3398
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
that this

3399
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I I I mean

3400
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
whatever this is funny

3401
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
this is funny

3402
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I like the implication that being mad

3403
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
at someone implies that you're old

3404
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
I

3405
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
I

3406
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
I tell that I tell that story

3407
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
when someone asks me

3408
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Ben why are you so mad what did Trixie

3409
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
people just legitimately still ask me like

3410
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
what did she do like what has she ever done

3411
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
to you like they ask me because they

3412
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
don't know and then I have to be like

3413
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
well and then I trot out this old

3414
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
fucking story because

3415
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
they fucking ask

3416
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
I don't I don't bring it up

3417
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
apropos of nothing

3418
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
but it's true and it still

3419
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
makes me mad

3420
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
anyway next one is called

3421
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000

okay

3424
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
next one is called Ben what did you think

3425
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
of the Odin flashback with Roger

3426
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
there's no there's

3427
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
no voicemail it's just a question I

3428
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
liked it

3429
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
it was cool I I really

3430
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
liked the Odin flashback the whole thing

3431
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
learning about Odin and then meeting

3432
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
seeing all

3433
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
seeing young Roger was really

3434
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
really cool it was

3435
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
I did like it Odin

3436
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
was I don't know

3437
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
cool it's cool that he like

3438
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
became a dad

3439
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
while on board the

3440
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I mean he was an

3441
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
totally insane character

3442
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
like when he's introduced

3443
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
he's so fun he was fun

3444
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
um

3445
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
he's just like

3446
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
just a fucking like

3447
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
wild dude

3448
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I guess it was a wild stallion

3449
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
yeah pretty much

3450
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
like a Japanese stallion I don't know

3451
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
if they have horses in Japan

3452
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
he he taught

3453
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
right he taught all the other

3454
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
crew members to read the pona

3455
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
glyphs right that's what happened

3456
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
or did it only

3457
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
or did only he know how

3458
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
I

3459
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
yes he knew how to read them

3460
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
because he was from one oh and that's where

3461
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
they know how to do that

3462
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
hmm

3463
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I'm trying to think that was

3464
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
that was it I'm trying to think what else can I say

3465
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
about other than Odin

3466
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
was cool and I liked his backstory and I liked

3467
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
seeing

3468
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
you know him his like

3469
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
travels with white beard and Roger

3470
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
and stuff I don't know

3471
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
uh those those guys are

3472
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
those guys are sick

3473
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
yeah I

3474
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
loved it okay that's my answer

3475
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
uh next one is

3476
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
son of Marowak

3477
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
did the okay here we go

3478
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
okay three two one go

3479
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
hey

3480
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Ben saying give a take

3481
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I'm a huge prover of going to the movies

3482
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
if you two

3483
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
are willing to go to see

3484
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Sonic 2 in theaters

3485
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I will pay for your tickets and snacks

3486
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
God

3487
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
huge promise let me know if you were

3488
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
absolutely serious and I will

3489
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
legit pay for your tickets

3490
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
preferably in an AMC theater

3491
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
give and take I don't know if you have AMCs

3492
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
in your country

3493
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
but

3494
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
if I can pay for your ticket I will pay for yours

3495
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
no problem

3496
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
it's just a movie you don't need to

3497
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
I don't want to go and see it

3498
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I don't I also don't want to go and see it

3499
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
I you'd be paying

3500
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
for me to waste my time

3501
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
and I don't even want that

3502
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
I want to go and see it

3503
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
I want to

3504
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
here's my reasoning

3505
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
here's my reasoning alright

3506
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Sonic 1 just has Sonic

3507
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
and Eggman is an even really Eggman

3508
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Sonic 2 we got

3509
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Knuckles we got Tails

3510
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
and Eggman is very egg

3511
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
like

3512
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
if this movie does well

3513
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I'm just saying

3514
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
if there was a Sonic free maybe Shadow

3515
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
and I think the internet needs that

3516
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I'd like to see Shadow

3517
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
I'd like to see if they use guns with Shadow

3518
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
if Shadow has a gun

3519
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
then I'll watch anything

3520
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
that has that in it

3521
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
they won't put a gun

3522
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
they won't put a gun in the hands of a hedgehog

3523
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
on the big screen

3524
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
but I still wouldn't go and watch the movie

3525
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
it would be really fucking funny

3526
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
if Shadow of a Hedgehog

3527
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
was in a real movie

3528
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
and I think the best way to

3529
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
make that happen is to pay for this one

3530
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
buy a ticket and don't see it

3531
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
you know first voice mail it

3532
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
you should just buy their tickets and then they can just sit at home

3533
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
and not leave the house

3534

train my body

3551
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
to defeat you

3552
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
for stealing

3553
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
school

3554
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
your defeat

3555
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
will be delicious

3556
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
as my

3557
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
baby formula is

3558
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
until next time

3559
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
men go

3560
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
kitten

3561
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
are you trying to say

3562
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
men go go take

3563
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
yeah they're doing the kendo thing

3564
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
the phantom horn does

3565
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
is that an impression

3566
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
the voice sounded different

3567
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
I think it's

3568
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
I think it's some

3569
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
different person who has adopted

3570
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
it's a new generation

3571
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
he was reincarnated

3572
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
as

3573
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Ethan Ralph and

3574
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Amanda Lynn Morris

3575
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
child

3576
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
was that a thing

3577
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
I must have missed that

3578
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
was what a thing

3579
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
reincarnation of Samurai

3580
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Samurai

3581
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
maybe that was last week

3582
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Ethan Ralph and Mae's baby

3583
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
is

3584
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Samurai Samurai reincarnated his soul

3585
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
into that

3586
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
child

3587
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
so that's why they sound different

3588
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
yeah that's why he sounds different

3589
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
not because like some guy decided to

3590
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
just like steal the character

3591
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
it's

3592
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
cause he's a baby now

3593
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000

would you kill a baby hmm

3595
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I'm thinking about it

3596
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
if he gave me

3597
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
enough lip about stealing scrolls

3598
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
I might think about it

3599
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Anna Maury would kill that baby

3600
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
oh yeah for sure

3601
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000

3603
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000

wondering

3637
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
would get recast after shooting

3638
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
that guy it's possible

3639
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
now we know

3640
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
he has

3641
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
only expanded his range

3642
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
proud of him

3643
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
next one is called

3644
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Shrek's taint

3645
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
ed

3646
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
okay

3647
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
3 2 1 go

3648
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
so I'm watching

3649
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
shark retold with some friends

3650
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
and it was pretty good times all around

3651
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
there were the bits where

3652
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
the animators were clearly

3653
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
being weird for the sake of

3654
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
being weird and those parts

3655
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
were kind of shit

3656
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
otherwise you know pretty fun

3657
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
time all around

3658
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
except there was one part where

3659
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Shrek has now become irreparably

3660
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
damaged

3661
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
and now it's a little bit where there's

3662
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Christine Chandler

3663
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
doing her thing

3664
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
I was like oh no

3665
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
for all this you know

3666
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
considering everything that's happened

3667
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
but

3668
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
I can't watch Shrek anymore

3669
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
it's just ruined

3670
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
sounds like a you problem

3671
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
can't enjoy Shrek anymore

3672
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
damn

3673
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
that's so tragic

3674
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
animators

3675
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
experimenting with weird styles is good

3676
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
actually

3677
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
controversial opinion

3678
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
I thought they were going to say that stuff was good

3679
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
they said it was bad that shocked me

3680
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I mean

3681
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
for fuck's sake I'm just trying to watch

3682
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Shrek you know

3683
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
I didn't boot up this

3684
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
version of Shrek that was drawn by

3685
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
a bunch of different anim-

3686
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
I didn't do this to see any weird animation

3687
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
I just want to enjoy the story

3688
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
of an ogre getting his swamp back

3689
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
I just want

3690
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
the straightforward take

3691
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I don't know why I didn't just watch

3692
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
the original Dreamworks production

3693
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
but I don't want to be distracted

3694
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
I saw the part by Ratboy Genius

3695
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
and didn't even realize

3696
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
how avant-garde

3697
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
it truly is

3698
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
I didn't know he was in that

3699
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
I don't think

3700
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Ratboy Genius did a scene for Shrek Retold

3701
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
yeah I remember that

3702
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
it was in 3D

3703
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
and they were weird fucking animation style

3704
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
was it the dooluck

3705
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
going into the castle a bit

3706
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
I remembered Donkey

3707
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
I thought it was in the forest

3708
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
oh wait no

3709
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
oh maybe they did a few scenes

3710
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
oh god

3711
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
yeah you might be right

3712
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
it's been a while since I've seen this

3713
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
but I just found someone to upload the clip by himself

3714
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
what kind of a mind makes this

3715
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Ratboy Genius is

3716
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
a

3717
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Hollywood composer

3718
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
who worked on actual movies

3719
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
and was a pianist

3720
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
I think in Gattaca

3721
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
he physically played a pianist

3722
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
and he writes music professionally

3723
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
and is very good at writing music

3724
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
he has a

3725
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
storied career and at some point

3726
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
he just decided

3727
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
I'm gonna make really just fucking

3728
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
weird as fuck 3D animations

3729
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
as a vehicle

3730
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
for the music and the music is well written

3731
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
it's just that the animations

3732
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
accompanying them are fucking

3733
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
strange as hell

3734
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
my old roommates

3735
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
were big Ratboy Genius fans

3736
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
or some of them were

3737
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
so I've seen some of it

3738
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
and I've heard a lot of the

3739
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
songs which are

3740
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
I wouldn't call them

3741
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
catchy but they're

3742
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
memorable

3743
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
the voices are the

3744
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
weirdest part about them

3745
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
but instrumentally there's some interesting things

3746
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
going on than a few of what I've heard

3747
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
even just like the background music

3748
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
during dialogue scenes

3749
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
sometimes I'm like oh damn this is interesting

3750
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I didn't know

3751
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
that he was a

3752
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
movie composer that's really funny

3753
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
yeah I think

3754
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
I found it out from

3755
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
the interviews he did

3756
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
in his channel

3757
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I think it was like there was free of him

3758
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
this was one of them

3759
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
I think yeah Ryan Doran is the guy

3760
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
who

3761
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
he's got a PhD

3762
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
forgot about that

3763
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
well good for him

3764
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
and like music stuff yeah

3765
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
how do you get a PhD in music

3766
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
you do a very good job

3767
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
I'm assuming you write your thesis on

3768
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
duh I made

3769
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
a song that sounds really good this time

3770
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
dude my name

3771
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
I am doctor music

3772
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
these two notes

3773
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
sound nice together

3774
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
dude

3775
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
I read a paper about it

3776
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
is your PhD thesis

3777
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
just like a symphony you just write a symphony

3778
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
how does it work

3779
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
no it can't be it's gotta be

3780
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
some theory shit but how much more

3781
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
how much more music theory is there

3782
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
even to do

3783
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
we know all the notes there's eight of them

3784
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
that's it

3785
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
we figured it out

3786
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
there's dope

3787
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
music or art

3788
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
never heard of them

3789
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
I don't believe

3790
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
all these damn

3791
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
progressive

3792
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
freaks in congress

3793
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
all these damn groomers

3794
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
trying to complicate things

3795
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
they don't even know what a note is

3796
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
notes are a spectrum

3797
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
sounds is a spectrum actually

3798
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
I'm not part of the note binary

3799
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
basic

3800
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
basic music theory

3801
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
it's either a doe, a ray, a me, a fa, a so, a la

3802
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
or to your ado nothing in between

3803
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
how many notes are there

3804
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
liberals can't even answer

3805
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
you get it

3806
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
do you get my joke

3807
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
yes I get your joke

3808
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
yes

3809
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
sacred music

3810
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
apparently this is a strange article

3811
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
a related doctor

3812
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
sacred music

3813
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
what's sacred about it

3814
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
it's got to be like church music

3815
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
hymns and stuff

3816
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
I don't know what's there to study

3817
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
oh my god

3818
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
okay it's a doctor of sacred music

3819
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000

3820
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
sacred music doctor

3821
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
I say in fake latin

3822
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
how sacred blues

3823
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
sacred music doctor

3824
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
wait is this

3825
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
is Ryan Doran

3826
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
the rat boy

3827
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
man?

3828
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Ryan Doran is the creator of rat boy genius

3829
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
hmm

3830
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
okay well you know what

3831
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
I'm proud of him

3832
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
I mean I found his IMDb

3833
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
oh yeah

3834
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
what's he in

3835
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
he was in Gattaca

3836
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Trekry told us on IMDb

3837
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
that's interesting

3838
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
he's been doing stuff since the 80s

3839
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
yeah he's been around a while

3840
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
wait but he's

3841
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
he was born in

3842
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
79

3843
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
so

3844
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
doing stuff in movies when he was 11

3845
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
oh the thing let's see kid songs

3846
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
what I want to be

3847
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
1987 so if he was born in 79

3848
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
he would have been like 8 years old

3849
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
maybe he was just like a child actor in that

3850
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
yeah kid songs he played himself

3851
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
that's funny

3852
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
kid songs

3853
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
yeah the bottom

3854
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
yeah okay

3855
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
he was uncredited

3856
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
he played english kid

3857
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
uncredited

3858
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
and meanwhile

3859
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
the star Ryan

3860
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
bullman

3861
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
how dare he have the same first name

3862
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
bullman is not a real star

3863
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
doran is a star

3864
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
yeah he was just in a bunch of

3865
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
like little kid

3866
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
we can't credit two ryan's

3867
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
that would be like that would confuse

3868
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
him

3869
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
looks like his

3870
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
his real stuff was started

3871
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
in like 2007

3872
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
rap boys kingdom

3873
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
when was gattica

3874
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
oh gattica was 1997

3875
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
yeah he would have been

3876
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
20

3877
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
yeah okay sure

3878
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
hmm

3879
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
fast I should get rap boy genius

3880
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
on the draw cast

3881
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
yeah you should

3882
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
uh when we do the free

3883
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
episode

3884
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
uh

3885
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
that would rule

3886
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
uh

3887
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
I kind of thought he was

3888
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
just some weirdo

3889
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
I mean I guess he

3890
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
already could also still be

3891
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
some weirdo yeah that's true

3892
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
yeah true

3893
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
he can't get me being weird

3894
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000

02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
that's what they want it would be so embarrassing

3916
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
if I didn't pop on this episode you just have to

3917
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
talk to a ghost right now but uh I would

3918
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
when I first started listening to the podcast

3919
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
I got Ben and Nate confused

3920
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
um that's really funny

3921
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I thought I thought they were

3922
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
it's funny I thought they were the same person

3923
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
much like I thought uh mumpkey jones and

3924
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
munchie were the same person for a couple

3925
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
weeks at one point hilarious um

3926
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
I thought that Ben

3927
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
did the kingdom hearts lecture

3928
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
and was not due lecture they were done by the same

3929
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
person that's what I fought in 2017

3930
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
for like a little while and then I

3931
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
learned I was mistaken

3932
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
some people have said we sound kind of

3933
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
similar I don't hear it at all

3934
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
but I mean I mean I don't I don't hear it

3935
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
at all now but at the time

3936
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
when I was first getting into it because not all the

3937
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
episodes your icons weren't really

3938
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
lighting up yeah

3939
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
so there's a lot

3940
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
is like like people

3941
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
say their names at the beginning or whatever but

3942
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
like you know if I'm just looking over

3943
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
at my second monitor I don't necessarily see who

3944
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
was talking so I'd get them confused

3945
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
um

3946
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
I don't know that's that's what I think of Ben

3947
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
saint um I hope that's informative

3948
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
similar to Nate saint similar to

3949
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Nate yeah

3950
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
it's my it's my most

3951
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
distinctive feature

3952
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
uh next one is called

3953
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
is Davoo's channel dead

3954
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
and there's no voicemail it's just a

3955
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
question

3956
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Davoo posted like two videos

3957
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
in like this year I think

3958
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
yeah it's more active than it's

3959
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
been in a long time she's posting

3960
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
I don't actually know what she's doing

3961
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
she she um I need to watch her new videos

3962
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
she made a discord

3963
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
channel or she made a discord

3964
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
server

3965
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
moderated it with like weirdly

3966
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
draconian rules where like

3967
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
you were only allowed to post like once per

3968
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
hour

3969
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
and then left it kept it for like

3970
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
two months and then decided like hey

3971
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
I changed my mind I don't want a discord server

3972
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
I'm deleting it so that's

3973
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
gone but the channel

3974
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
is I mean it

3975
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
you know

3976
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
I think your last video was like a month ago or something

3977
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
so it's not dead

3978
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
yeah it's more active I don't know

3979
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
maybe maybe it's dead again

3980
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
who knows

3981
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
uh next one

3982
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000

02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
this youtube channel which

3993
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000

02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000

02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
voicemail

4014
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
I don't remember why

02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000

02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
what condition clearly

4021
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000

4022
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
well good

4023
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
what condition makes your hair half white

4024
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
it's kinda

4025
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000

4026
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000

already didn't play all your voicemails

4034
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
so if you're wondering why you didn't hear them

4035
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
because you will never hear them again

4036
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
fuck you

4037
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000

4042
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
prince isolation at cause ben said

4043
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Trixie should pack it in

4044
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
.com

4045
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
okay

4046
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
fine

4047
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
these are like zero second

4048
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
this one is not but all the other ones were

4049
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
yeah alright

4050
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
3 2 1 go

4051
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
hey ben

4052
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
and hopefully gib and any possible

4053
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
guest I was just watching

4054
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
the newest episode of the pcp

4055
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
and first of all the moment

4056
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
where Ben just starts saying

4057
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
about Trixie

4058
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
he just stops talking about Trixie

4059
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
and starts saying she's so stupid

4060
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
she's so stupid

4061
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
is probably the hardest

4062
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
that I've laughed at

4063
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
a podcast or a podcast

4064
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
why are you laughing it's true

4065
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
that was hilarious

4066
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
but it also brought me to a little bit of a question

4067
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
that just popped into my head

4068
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Ben do you genuinely

4069
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
think that

4070
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
for Trixie to like quit youtube

4071
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
and whatever she's doing

4072
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
and like get a retail job

4073
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
do you think that that's genuinely

4074
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
smarter for her to do right now

4075
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
than to just milk whatever she has left

4076
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
as long as she can

4077
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
or do you mean that more in the sense of

4078
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
if she has any more aspirations

4079
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
of growing she's just wrong

4080
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
yeah that's all

4081
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
bye bye

4082
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
in terms of dollars and cents

4083
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
yes I think that at this point

4084
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
her audience is never coming back

4085
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
and it would be more

4086
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
the time spent making

4087
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
videos now

4088
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
which get like 4000 views

4089
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
a piece

4090
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
more profitably spent

4091
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
bagging groceries

4092
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
I think that's just true

4093
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
that's what I think

4094
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
okay

4095
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
thanks for your question

4096
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
next one is called

4097
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
it's an image

4098
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
from Gibb you'll witness Ben's

4099
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
demise at my baby hands

4100
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000

with paused videos

4135
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
of various characters doing things

4136
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
and then he plays them one after the other

4137
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
switches to the next tab so it's like Homer Simpson

4138
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000

4139
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
reacts to Homer Simpson falling over

4140
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000

he moves to the next tab clicks

4151
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
on it and then play clicks play on the

03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000

4223
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
female character in the simpsons

4224
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000

03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000

03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000

03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000

4262
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000

and their friend Eeyore

4267
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
remembered Uncle Ben's word

4268
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000

4269
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
with great power

4270
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
comes great responsibility

4271
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
I feel

4272
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
they look so troubled

4273
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
wait wait the arms

4274
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000

03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
together oh yeah they are

4276
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
they have two right hands

4277
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
I feel

4278
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
I want to believe

4279
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
I feel like this is

4280
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
too so comical

4281
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
it has to be fake

4282
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
but who has this much time

4283
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
he's devoted

4284
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
a lot of time

4285
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
to whatever this is

4286
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
it's the same sort of feeling

4287
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
you would get looking at some other

4288
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
like profoundly

4289
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
autistic person

4290
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
what was the guy who dressed up as Gumby

4291
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
and did Thomas the Tank Engine

4292
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
are we talking about the new storyteller

4293
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
like yeah

4294
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
I never watched his stuff but

4295
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
that's the impression

4296
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
it's just hyper fixated on this

4297
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
hyper fixated thing

4298
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
I think it's cool

4299
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
I think it's like genuinely cool

4300
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
I think it's pretty funny

4301
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
like the

4302
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
you know what you like

4303
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
and you just do it

4304
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
yeah

4305
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
it's funny

4306
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
it's really funny that

4307
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
he gets genuine satisfaction

4308
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
from like

4309
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
he'll just film

4310
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Nelson going ha ha

4311
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
at Scar from the Lion King

4312
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
and he'll just be like

4313
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
yeah

4314
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
this is great

4315
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
wait wait

4316
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
oh my god that image yeah

4317
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
it's just Lisa playing every video game

4318
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
I found one of the videos he mentioned

4319
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
I didn't realize they were recording their screen of a camera

4320
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
so they're basically

4321
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
a primitive form of video editing

4322
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
where if I have videos open

4323
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
in multiple tabs they'll play a section

4324
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
then quickly switch tab play another section

4325
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
and it says if the two videos are interacting

4326
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
or talking to each other

4327
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
it reminds me of when I used to like

4328
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
edit Let's Plays by putting

4329
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
a video tape into my

4330
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
VHS player and hitting record

4331
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
during different parts

4332
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
of a video game

4333
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
to record like my PlayStation 1 footage

4334
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
and like edit like scenes together

4335
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
for like a YouTube poop slash Let's Play thing

4336
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
back in like 2005

4337
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
this is just the advanced version

4338
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
I'm watching the Spongebob one

4339
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
yeah

4340
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
yeah he's just

4341
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
yeah he's recording

4342
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
his screen

4343
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
are you switching back and forth

4344
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
just getting Sony Vegas

4345
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
just put the clips together in Sony Vegas

4346
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
movie maker even

4347
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
I mean this just makes more sense

4348
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
your likes the Simpsons

4349
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
your likes the Simpsons

4350
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
he does look at that smile

4351
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
smile

4352
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
this is

4353
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
I love this one

4354
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
the Simpsons females react to Will Smith

4355
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
the voice of Oscar from Sharktail

4356
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
his greatest role

4357
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
slaps at Chris Rock the voice of Marty

4358
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
from Madagascar at the Oscars

4359
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,000
dude

4360
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
the DreamWorks canon

4361
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
it's real

4362
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
is this the same

4363
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
women

4364
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
image compilation I think it is

4365
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
it's the same like stock

4366
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
every female background character

4367
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
they spent the time

4368
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
to get all of the images together

4369
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
and they made their image and then they can be like

4370
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
ah perfect now

4371
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
whenever I need to use the image I have it already

4372
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
now whenever I want to see every female

4373
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
character in the Simpsons react

4374
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
to something in a sort of

4375
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
dismayed manner

4376
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
well I've done

4377
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
most of the work already

4378
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
it's so efficient

4379
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
yeah he's a well oiled machine

4380
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
anyway I just

4381
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
why did I bring this guy up

4382
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
was Ninjas oh it's cause that samurai

4383
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
baby looks like one of these ninjas

4384
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
oh the samurai baby

4385
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
yeah

4386
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
that's all I had to say about that

4387
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
he's Ben Hughes

4388
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,000
would be a big fan

4389
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
maybe I should

4390
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
tweet it at him and see what he thinks

4391
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
well it's not from the Simpsons so I don't know

4392
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
no but he's a blue ninja

4393
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
surely that must

4394
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,000
surely that must count for something

4395
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000
maybe it's the Simpsons thing

4396
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,000
I haven't seen them

4397
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,000
put any different like non Simpsons

4398
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
females into a blue

4399
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
ninja costume

4400
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
so maybe it's just Simpsons females

4401
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
yeah

4402
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
possibly it's sure he only seems to

4403
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
he only seems interested

4404
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
if it's the Simpsons

4405
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
alright

4406
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
well that's

4407
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,000
huh

4408
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
just one more

4409
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
okay

4410
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
Ben

4411
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
they asked you to draw it

4412
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,000
right

4413
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:26,000
he asked me if I draw the Simpsons

4414
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
you could have just drawn it like that

4415
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,000
but they'd be happy

4416
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
yeah

4417
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:36,000
I guess that

4418
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,000
that's enough to do it for him

4419
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:40,000
that's enough

4420
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,000
you know what

4421
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
I think I could do this

4422
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:46,000
no I think I could

4423
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
I can't I have to

4424
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
I can't let it tear me away from my

4425
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,000
holy duty of finishing the Tales Get Strolled

4426
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
page

4427
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
is there like an episode that has

4428
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:58,000
like I don't know

4429
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
Lisa and Marge like sneaking around

4430
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:02,000
doing something

4431
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,000
in ninja outfits

4432
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,000
hmm

4433
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,000
is there a scene that has like

4434
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:10,000
sparked this in this game

4435
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
like was there a scene where

4436
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
someone wore this outfit

4437
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,000
possibly

4438
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,000
I feel like definitely

4439
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:20,000
Barth has worn like

4440
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:22,000
a ninja costume

4441
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,000
to sneak around

4442
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
I think in the episode where he like

4443
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:28,000
soars the head off of Jebediah Springfield

4444
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:30,000
statue

4445
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
yeah

4446
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
although that was a black ninja costume

4447
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
yeah it was different

4448
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:38,000
I just googled it

4449
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,000
yeah he wore a black

4450
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:42,000
wait a minute

4451
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:44,000
Simpsons

4452
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:46,000
okay wait I found something

4453
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,000

4454
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,000
okay no this is him

4455
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
it was under an official the Simpsons

4456
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,000
twitter account tweet

4457
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,000
with some Simpsons characters

4458
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:58,000
in blue ninja outfits

4459
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:00,000
by the way

4460
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,000
the Simpsons I have these images

4461
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,000
and I hope in season 32

4462
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,000
or season 33

4463
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,000
uh

4464
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,000
some episode where Marge, Lisa, Maggie

4465
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
and other female Springfielders

4466
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
characters become ninjas

4467
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:16,000
and then oh my god

4468
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
someone replies to him

4469
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,000
shut up

4470
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
and he says to that person

4471
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,000
watch your language

4472
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
oh wait okay we've got a whole thread here

4473
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:28,000
oh my god

4474
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,000

4475
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:32,000
I gotta

4476
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:34,000
this actually just keeps going

4477
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:36,000
someone asks him like what's with the ninjas

4478
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,000
and he says

4479
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
for someone to do

4480
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
honestly though what is with the fucking ninjas

4481
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
and he says for someone to do drawing

4482
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,000
request of the Simpsons female characters

4483
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:48,000
in ninja outfits

4484
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:50,000
dress in blue their face covered by mask

4485
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
belt swords bow staffs

4486
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
nunchucks and their ninja skills for me

4487
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,000
for what reason

4488
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,000
because Bart Simpson is the only character

4489
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
who wear a ninja suit so let these female

4490
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
characters wear a ninja suit

4491
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:04,000
based

4492
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
equality but what if they don't need

4493
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,000
to then Hughes replies

4494
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:10,000
very well I don't have

4495
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,000
to argue he then replies to himself

4496
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
alright

4497
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,000
uh what the

4498
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:18,000
someone else replied

4499
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:20,000
to

4500
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:22,000
he doesn't reply to himself the guy says

4501
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:24,000
it's just mad and then he says alright

4502
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,000
oh yeah I didn't see that one but you're

4503
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:28,000

4507
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:36,000

4508
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:38,000

4509
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:40,000

03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:42,000

03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,000
I wanted to send this to them and really

4545
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:52,000
I mean I'm sure they would get

4546
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:54,000
a lot of hate

4547
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:56,000
6000 followers dude they got some fans

4548
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,000
hey

4549
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:02,000
have you seen something on Twitter

4550
03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:04,000
called

4551
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:06,000
Tinder Skitty

4552
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,000
I've

4553
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:10,000
I've seen glimpses

4554
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:12,000
and glances I haven't actually read

4555
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:14,000
any of the comics because it's like

4556
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:16,000
yeah it's nice I'm sure it's

4557
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:18,000
like a lovey-dovey couple

4558
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,000
and one of them is a fucking whale lord

4559
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,000
and the other one is a skitty

4560
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:24,000
and everybody knows that

4561
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:26,000
his dick is so big that

4562
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,000
she would be fucking destroyed

4563
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:30,000
but it's a wholesome comic so

4564
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:32,000
there's no sex haha

4565
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:34,000
and I'm not

4566
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,000
it's not too interesting

4567
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,000
I get annoyed every time I see one

4568
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:40,000
oh god he did another one

4569
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:42,000
really he's got so many fans

4570
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
really he's keeping up this facade

4571
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:46,000
this charade even

4572
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:48,000
yeah it's I think it's

4573
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:50,000
people like the

4574
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:52,000
the idea of

4575
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:54,000
thinking about how big his dick is

4576
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:56,000
compared to her

4577
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:58,000
but they don't go there

4578
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,000
and so it's like fine to

4579
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,000
repost to retweet

4580
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:04,000
I don't know if it's

4581
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:06,000
do you think that's it

4582
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,000
I think there's an element of that

4583
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
is it about his dick

4584
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:12,000
he's so big

4585
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
and she's so small

4586
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:16,000
his whole body is big

4587
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:18,000
it's not just his giant dick

4588
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:20,000
it's not literally all that

4589
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:22,000
because the art's nice

4590
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:24,000
and I'm sure it's cute and wholesome

4591
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:26,000
or whatever

4592
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:28,000
I'm sure there's a few people who are like oh my god

4593
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:30,000
well sure

4594
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:32,000
if there was porn of this

4595
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,000
I mean size difference is probably

4596
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:36,000
what some people are into I guess

4597
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,000
but like that's not this guy's

4598
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,000
that's not this guy's fault

4599
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:42,000
it's fine it's fine and whatever

4600
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
it's not a fault I just see it

4601
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,000
and I just think it's cynical

4602
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:48,000
I've grown my eyes and I think

4603
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:50,000
yeah I think the whole

4604
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,000
I don't know

4605
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:54,000
what if I made a pokemon

4606
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
but I made one a sexy girl

4607
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:58,000
and I made a cute little

4608
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:00,000
cute little romance

4609
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:02,000
I just like

4610
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
the beginning

4611
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,000
there should be a scene where one of them

4612
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
just gets caught with a master ball

4613
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:10,000
and there's just a human walks off with them

4614
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:12,000
forever

4615
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:14,000
some human

4616
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
no a human caught my boyfriend

4617
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
no he's teaching him how to use

4618
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
self destruct

4619
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
no

4620
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,000
oh no he made

4621
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:26,000
my waylord boyfriend his h.m. slave

4622
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:28,000
no

4623
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:30,000
oh it's kinda hot though

4624
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
yeah

4625
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:34,000
yes that's definitely should be where it goes

4626
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:36,000
that's you know what at least that'd be

4627
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,000
something at least that'd be something

4628
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:40,000
uh yeah I don't know

4629
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:42,000
it annoys me

4630
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:44,000
and I hate it

4631
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:46,000
but not for any reason that I can

4632
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:48,000
articulate

4633
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:50,000
I feel indifferent to it

4634
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:52,000
generally it's just like

4635
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
I can see why it's big and popular

4636
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:56,000
people like pokemon people like

4637
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:58,000
cute girls

4638
03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:00,000
like there's nothing

4639
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,000
of value here for me I don't

4640
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:04,000
see why

4641
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:06,000
I have to keep seeing it

4642
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:08,000
I'm gonna kill him

4643
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:10,000
I'm gonna kill him

4644
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
I'm gonna find him in real life

4645
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:14,000
and destroy his body and mind

4646
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:16,000
you're gonna bring your pokemon

4647
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,000
and you're gonna challenge him

4648
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:20,000
to a pokemon battle and he's gonna have

4649
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,000
they're gonna be sent out and you're gonna kill them

4650
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:24,000
like in a nuzlocke

4651
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:26,000
you're gonna send out russell

4652
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,000
back from the dead it's now a ghost pokemon

4653
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:30,000
you call him again

4654
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:32,000
he actually always was a ghost pokemon

4655
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:34,000
actually

4656
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:36,000

4657
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,000
wait was he

4658
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
I thought he was like a different pokemon

4659
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:42,000
no he was a ghastly

4660
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:44,000
and in one of the nuzlocke's and then

4661
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:46,000
okay

4662
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:48,000

4663
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:50,000

4664
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:52,000

he looks more normal

4683
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:30,000
than I expected honestly

4684
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:32,000
yeah that's what I was

4685
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:34,000
found strange to

4686
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:36,000
hmm

4687
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:38,000
we've been conditioned to think that strange people

4688
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:40,000
have to look strange

4689
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:42,000
no

4690
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:44,000
how wrong of us

4691
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,000
absolutely we've all learned a valuable lesson

4692
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,000
here today

4693
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,000
don't you know the lesson is

4694
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:52,000
don't judge a person's cover

4695
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:54,000
by

4696
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,000
what their personality is like

4697
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:00,000

welcome back to the slime times

4704
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:14,000
weekend update

4705
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:16,000
this time I'm pleased to recount some festive activities

4706
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:18,000
most of the rowdies

4707
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:20,000
love themselves to live in the sewers

4708
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,000
and take a break from gameplay

4709
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:24,000
have revived

4710
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:26,000
and resumed their gang violence

4711
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:28,000
in some capacity

4712
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:30,000
rowdy mischief in particular has been

4713
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:32,000
on an outstanding grind set

4714
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:34,000
furthermore as I record this

4715
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:36,000
last night was the anniversary of the

4716
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:38,000
famed rowdy brick night

4717
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:40,000
where rowdies collected thousands of bricks

4718
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:42,000
and used them to assault killer apartments

4719
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:44,000
a special extra art contest

4720
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:46,000
has been started in celebration of our

4721
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:48,000
100 obelisk's fourth birthday

4722
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:50,000
rowdy old hat matt is leading the charge

4723
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:52,000
will apparently be bone hurt

4724
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:54,000
beamed if endless war does not

4725
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:56,000
appreciate the offerings

4726
03:19:56,000 --> 03:19:58,000
finally it seems stay that

4727
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:00,000
ghosts have finally gotten their hands on the

4728
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:02,000
technology or the grim magics

4729
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:04,000
to have their own pets accompanying them

4730
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:06,000
mega slime oids

4731
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:08,000
the dark reflections

4732
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:10,000
of the green slime oids of the living

4733
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:12,000
in celebration of this

4734
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:14,000
stay that warbredon invited

4735
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:16,000
all flesh bags to the arena

4736
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:18,000
to fight his new 12 foot

4737
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:20,000
mega slime oid named warforge

4738
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:22,000
both wins and losses

4739
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:24,000
were had for the living

4740
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:26,000
but the real loss was for that guy

4741
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:28,000
you know

4742
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:30,000
that guy who told us not to send in pcp

4743
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:32,000
voicemails and then embarrassed his way into jail

4744
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:34,000
by sending too many

4745
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:36,000
how embarrassing

4746
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:38,000
thank you somebody

4747
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:40,000
uh

4748
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,000
i didn't realize mega slime

4749
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,000
i kind of thought mega slime oids were already a

4750
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:48,000
ffff

4751
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:50,000
and you could fight them in the wild

4752
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:52,000
maybe that's what i was thinking of

4753
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:54,000
i didn't realize you could not have them

4754
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:56,000
before but uh it's good

4755
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:58,000
that's a good inclusion that makes me happy

4756
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:00,000
best game

4757
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:02,000
ever made

4758
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:04,000

4765
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:18,000
based by joining endless war today

4766
03:21:18,000 --> 03:21:20,000

4774
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:36,000

slime

4798
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:24,000
multi-user dungeons and played

4799
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:26,000
endless war of the game in a very

4800
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:28,000
long time

4801
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:30,000
same i i guess i never

4802
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:32,000
only like once or twice did i actually

4803
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:34,000
like

4804
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:36,000
get on the grind on an alt and try to

4805
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:38,000
actually like play the game

4806
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:40,000
it was when yeah i was um

4807
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:42,000
i was uh

4808
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:44,000
i was the humble juve

4809
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:46,000
and i tried i joined the

4810
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:48,000
killers and i tried to

4811
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:50,000
uh take out terse worthy

4812
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:52,000
but terse worthy got his

4813
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:54,000
ass and uh it was

4814
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:56,000
tragic

4815
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:58,000
i remember when uh the

4816
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:00,000
gankers and shamblers were coming around

4817
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:02,000
and there was a new thing

4818
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:04,000
you could do as a shambler

4819
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:06,000
where you're not like dead you're a

4820
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:08,000
zombie and you can shamble

4821
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:10,000
and destroy like the

4822
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:12,000
functionality of certain districts and

4823
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:14,000
buildings so that people couldn't play

4824
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:16,000
the game anymore and that was funny

4825
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:18,000
so i was i was part i was

4826
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:20,000
i was a big shambler i was shambling

4827
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,000
everywhere trying to ruin endless war

4828
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:24,000
so nobody could have fun

4829
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:26,000
yeah that uh

4830
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:28,000
was like a problem that like

4831
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:30,000
continued for a long time i would go to

4832
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:32,000
um i would go to the cafes

4833
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:34,000
to try and i wasn't

4834
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:36,000
really playing the game but i was going to the

4835
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:38,000
cafes to uh create uh

4836
03:23:38,000 --> 03:23:40,000
zines like in the in-game zines

4837
03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:42,000
of uh slime and punishment

4838
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:44,000
and i would always go to the cafe and like

4839
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:46,000
the cafe would be shambled and so like i

4840
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:48,000
couldn't do it it's like some fuck some

4841
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:50,000
idiot like shambled

4842
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:52,000
the cafe and now it's in ruins and i

4843
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:54,000
yeah and i don't know how to fix it

4844
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:56,000
but uh

4845
03:23:56,000 --> 03:23:58,000
i think there was a whole

4846
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:00,000
thing with that it was sort of tied into the

4847
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:02,000
bicarbonate reign like dr downpour

4848
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:04,000
was responsible for the shambling

4849
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:06,000
and that was kind of a i think we were talking

4850
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:08,000
about it in the last contest

4851
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:10,000
i think we i think we were doing a

4852
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:12,000
villains contest was the next yeah

4853
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:14,000
we're gonna judge it in like a week or two

4854
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:16,000
and we did the we're gonna do the villains

4855
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:18,000
contest and dr downpour was one it's like everyone

4856
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:20,000
was like whatever happened to dr downpour

4857
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:22,000
he never got like a resolution

4858
03:24:22,000 --> 03:24:24,000
story uh but he was a

4859
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:26,000
minor character for a while

4860
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:28,000
uh i guess i guess

4861
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:30,000
that like uh

4862
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:32,000
now that phantom's revenge

4863
03:24:32,000 --> 03:24:34,000
has shown the end of of the

4864
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:36,000
reign and everything

4865
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:38,000
the dr downpour i guess that is that

4866
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:40,000
it's probably in some sort of

4867
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:42,000
different dimension what dimension

4868
03:24:42,000 --> 03:24:44,000
is the

4869
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,000
endless war in that we could play right now

4870
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:48,000
in our discord browser yeah yeah it's in c197

4871
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:50,000
and that's

4872
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:52,000
where phantom's revenge takes

4873
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:54,000
place yeah yeah

4874
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:56,000
so phantom horn comes from a different

4875
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:58,000
dimension into this one yes

4876
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:00,000
yeah phantom horn came from

4877
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:02,000
a beta timeline and moved

4878
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:04,000
in the alpha timeline

4879
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:06,000
the uh nlaka calm

4880
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:08,000
was deslimed and basically destroyed

4881
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:10,000
and so they brought the beta

4882
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:12,000
nlaka calm

4883
03:25:12,000 --> 03:25:14,000
which was not deslimed

4884
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:16,000
to the alpha timeline

4885
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:18,000
and just like landed it on

4886
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:20,000
top of the deslime version

4887
03:25:20,000 --> 03:25:22,000
and just were like okay

4888
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:24,000
we're good now

4889
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:26,000
uh yeah but it's

4890
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:28,000
it's from a different timeline but it's in

4891
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:30,000
c197 alpha

4892
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:32,000
so like everyone got genocided

4893
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:34,000
and then replaced with a different timeline

4894
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:36,000
yeah all timeline versions just came

4895
03:25:36,000 --> 03:25:38,000
and replaced all the all the fucked up ones

4896
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:40,000
which is

4897
03:25:40,000 --> 03:25:42,000
just uh i think in my

4898
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:44,000
in my mind there there

4899
03:25:44,000 --> 03:25:46,000
was an opportunity and i don't know if

4900
03:25:46,000 --> 03:25:48,000
anything will ever be done with it but i feel like there is

4901
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:50,000
an opportunity there for like

4902
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:52,000
the ruins of a deslimed

4903
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:54,000
nlaka calm are like

4904
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:56,000
crushed underneath the city

4905
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:58,000
now that's that's canon

4906
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:00,000
so i mean you

4907
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:02,000
could maybe venture down there and find

4908
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:04,000
some shit

4909
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:06,000

an anti

4943
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:20,000

4945
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:24,000
not that i can remember

4946
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:26,000
a twilight sparkle

4947
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:28,000
transitioned into an alicorn

4948
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:30,000
that's true

4949
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:32,000
that's true

4950
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:34,000
twilight sparkle yeah she is

4951
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:36,000
i think she kind of is like one of those

4952
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:38,000
you know one of those white ladies that make

4953
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:40,000

4955
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:46,000
i yes

4956
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:48,000
engaging in generational

4957
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:50,000
smack talking like a fucking

4958
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:52,000
weirdo and yet there's a whole genre

4959
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:54,000
of person that thinks it's

4960
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:56,000
cool

4961
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:58,000
why would you shit on the youth

4962
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:00,000
weren't you

4963
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:02,000
once a youth the youth

4964
03:28:02,000 --> 03:28:04,000
the youth sometimes shit on us

4965
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:06,000
but i mean that doesn't mean that it's a good look

4966
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:08,000
yeah but that's because they haven't done it yet

4967
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:10,000
right it doesn't mean it's it looks

4968
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:12,000
cool to be like no the children

4969
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:14,000

4970
03:28:14,000 --> 03:28:16,000
we grownups are smarter

4971
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:18,000

4974
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:24,000
comes for me when rosanne

4975
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:26,000
ralph shows up at my door

4976
03:28:26,000 --> 03:28:28,000
step in his blue ninja costume

4977
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:32,000
okay i think

4978
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:34,000
last voicemail

4979
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:36,000

4980
03:28:36,000 --> 03:28:38,000
twilight sparkle

4981
03:28:38,000 --> 03:28:40,000
is depressed

4982
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:42,000
three two one go

4983
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:44,000
previously on the twilight sparkle

4984
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:46,000
show

4985
03:28:46,000 --> 03:28:48,000
maybe this is just a hippie bleeding heart artist in me

4986
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:50,000
from here on out call me liquid

4987
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:52,000

4988
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:54,000
and now

4989
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:56,000
for today's episode

4990
03:28:56,000 --> 03:28:58,000
it's been hard

4991
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:00,000
they don't like empty voicemails

4992
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:02,000
so i started adding them to art

4993
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:04,000
it was too weak

4994
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:06,000
so i became a ninja cyborg pony

4995
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:08,000
but even then so many high concepts

4996
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:10,000
so many funny characters wasted completely

4997
03:29:10,000 --> 03:29:12,000
on deaf ears

4998
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:14,000
i don't know if i can make it to the voice grail

4999
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:16,000
your ways you have lost

5000
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:18,000
better when young don't be too smart

5001
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:20,000
or better understand your medium properly

5002
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:22,000
it's yatsu

5003
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:24,000
not like an audio drama do what appeals to you

5004
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:26,000
and don't chase the success

5005
03:29:26,000 --> 03:29:28,000
chase your own satisfaction cat being shot

5006
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:30,000
by a minigun was pretty fun

5007
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:32,000

5008
03:29:32,000 --> 03:29:34,000

03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:40,000
no big deal so what will you do now

5012
03:29:40,000 --> 03:29:42,000
oh big deal

5013
03:29:44,000 --> 03:29:46,000
i think i have an idea

5014
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:48,000
oh shit

5015
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:54,000
pig sounds to be continued

5016
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:56,000
oh no pig sounds

5017
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:58,000
well that's not the ending

5018
03:29:58,000 --> 03:30:00,000
i was hoping for

5019
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:02,000
that's bad ending

5020
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:04,000
they'll never recruit me

5021
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:06,000
i'll never reprise my role

5022
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:08,000
oblivion falls in a backslide

5023
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:10,000
in a backslide into his old ways

5024
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:12,000
i'm clean

5025
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:16,000
you better be

5026
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:18,000
you have to avoid images of pigs

5027
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:22,000
i'm in rehab

5028
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:24,000
i think it was major of light

5029
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:26,000
in my discord

5030
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:28,000
he thought that i'd like hated pigs

5031
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:30,000
he thought that it was

5032
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:32,000
like i specifically disliked pigs

5033
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:34,000
i was like no i

5034
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:36,000
didn't like being jump scared by the scary

5035
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:38,000
squealing sounds of an angry

5036
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:40,000
sow

this episode of the pcp areas

5065
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:38,000
that's where i'm gonna aim to do it

5066
03:31:38,000 --> 03:31:40,000
and then i'll play

5067
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:42,000
pump and i'll play slime and punishment

5068
03:31:42,000 --> 03:31:44,000
i'll do both

5069
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:46,000
fandoms revenge

5070
03:31:46,000 --> 03:31:48,000
i'll do both

5071
03:31:48,000 --> 03:31:50,000
back to back one stream

5072
03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:52,000
you made your choice

5073
03:31:52,000 --> 03:31:54,000
you can only play one

5074
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:56,000
i don't know how long

5075
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:58,000
pumpkin alley is

5076
03:31:58,000 --> 03:32:00,000
it took me about two hours

5077
03:32:00,000 --> 03:32:02,000
but i got really stuck trying to find

5078
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:04,000
the last couple of

5079
03:32:04,000 --> 03:32:06,000
you might beat it in an hour

5080
03:32:06,000 --> 03:32:08,000
if you're like lucky

5081
03:32:08,000 --> 03:32:10,000
i'm gonna look for the lizards

5082
03:32:10,000 --> 03:32:12,000
i've heard talk of lizards

5083
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:14,000
but i've seen nothing

5084
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:16,000
it'll take a while to find those

5085
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:18,000
playing the game

5086
03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:20,000
literally doesn't take very long

5087
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:22,000
but finding everything

5088
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:24,000
takes maybe an hour

5089
03:32:24,000 --> 03:32:26,000
an hour and a bit

5090
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:28,000
you could get stuck looking for those lizards

5091
03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:30,000
you could get stuck

5092
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:32,000
i still haven't found four

5093
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:36,000
i've seen those spoilers

5094
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:38,000
so i'm excited

5095
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:40,000
i wanna see your stream

5096
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:42,000
and maybe will you be doing that

5097
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:44,000
now when this episode is going live

5098
03:32:44,000 --> 03:32:46,000
is that the plan

5099
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:48,000
it's currently the plan

5100
03:32:48,000 --> 03:32:50,000
i'll have to make sure this comes out

5101
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:52,000
i'll probably wait an hour or two

5102
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:54,000
after the episode

5103
03:32:54,000 --> 03:32:56,000
so that way people have time to get to the part of the episode

5104
03:32:56,000 --> 03:32:58,000
where i announce that

5105
03:32:58,000 --> 03:33:00,000
make sense

5106
03:33:00,000 --> 03:33:02,000
i'll have to make sure this episode comes out

5107
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:04,000
2pm on the dot on friday

5108
03:33:04,000 --> 03:33:06,000

and upload those podcasts

5112
03:33:12,000 --> 03:33:14,000
on those podcast apps

5113
03:33:14,000 --> 03:33:16,000
i still haven't put the time in

5114
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:18,000
to figure out how they work

5115
03:33:18,000 --> 03:33:20,000
even though tom explained it to me

5116
03:33:20,000 --> 03:33:22,000
but i just haven't gone through it

5117
03:33:22,000 --> 03:33:24,000
and figured it out

5118
03:33:24,000 --> 03:33:26,000

5119
03:33:26,000 --> 03:33:28,000

5124
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:42,000

5125
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:46,000

5127
03:33:50,000 --> 03:33:52,000

5128
03:33:52,000 --> 03:33:54,000

5129
03:33:54,000 --> 03:33:56,000

i made her give an orange skin

5171
03:35:26,000 --> 03:35:28,000
and then i got a tattoo

5172
03:35:28,000 --> 03:35:30,000
i wanted to have the eye

5173
03:35:30,000 --> 03:35:32,000
like the indents

5174
03:35:32,000 --> 03:35:34,000

03:35:38,000 --> 03:35:40,000
side of her face so she's got

5178
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:42,000
kind of a scar

5179
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:44,000

5180
03:35:44,000 --> 03:35:46,000

5181
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:48,000
and the pupil color of her eyes

5182
03:35:48,000 --> 03:35:50,000
her eyes are completely yellow

5183
03:35:50,000 --> 03:35:52,000
i'd like to customize

5184
03:35:52,000 --> 03:35:54,000
the whites out of this damn country

5185
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:58,000
back where they came from

5186
03:35:58,000 --> 03:36:00,000
back to hell where you belong

5187
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:02,000
blaggards

5188
03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:04,000

5191
03:36:08,000 --> 03:36:10,000
whatever

5192
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:12,000
that's okay

5193
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:14,000
as long as it's

5194
03:36:14,000 --> 03:36:16,000
orange skin like pumpkin

5195
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:18,000
as long as she's killing people

5196
03:36:18,000 --> 03:36:20,000
black

5197
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:22,000
blaggards

5198
03:36:22,000 --> 03:36:24,000
yeah blaggards it's spelled

5199
03:36:24,000 --> 03:36:26,000
black guard but it's pronounced

5200
03:36:26,000 --> 03:36:28,000
is it the word that this woman said

5201
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:30,000
in this short video

5202
03:36:30,000 --> 03:36:32,000
but let's see

5203
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:58,000
i thought you said that for a second

5204
03:36:58,000 --> 03:37:00,000
and you fight

5205
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:02,000
he says

5206
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:04,000
return to the depths

5207
03:37:04,000 --> 03:37:06,000
from once you came blaggard

5208
03:37:06,000 --> 03:37:08,000
he calls you a blaggard

5209
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:10,000
it hurts my feelings

5210
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:12,000
it's racist

5211
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:14,000
no

5212
03:37:14,000 --> 03:37:16,000
he's referring the black in black guard

5213
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:18,000
refers to your soul

5214
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:20,000
not your skin

5215
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:22,000
anyone

5216
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:24,000
any race can be a blaggard

5217
03:37:24,000 --> 03:37:26,000
if they're really bad

5218
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:28,000

5219
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:30,000

5220
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:34,000

5221
03:37:34,000 --> 03:37:36,000
