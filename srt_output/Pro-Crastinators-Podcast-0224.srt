1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's the podcast. It started. The PCP. It's a duo again. It's me. It's Gibbontake, right? I don't like that. I get lost. I get lost in that one. Gibbonsake? Sake?

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, for Gibbonsake. For Gibbonsake. Speaking of sake, I'm hungover. My head hurts. Yay!

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, Ben, do you have a story or did you forget all of it again?

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No, there's not much of a story this time. By the way, it was really funny when I wasn't on to hear you and Tom be like, oh, I think he's hungover. Oh, I think he's drunk. Or I think he's dead. I was like, to hear that later and be like, yep, they're correct.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, I was hanging out with Munchy and Kazzy and on our way out, we went to get food and on the way back, I decided to buy some hard seltzers for myself and then, you know, just going to have one, just going to have two. Drank the whole case. Don't worry about it.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,000
When I hear seltzer, all I can think of is the crusty the clown, seltzer water, flour, like, smooth my flour gets here.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You know, because I have the ingredients, because I've been doing my gummy worm experiments, I have all these like, flavoring ingredients. I've been, sometimes I'll just buy a case of like, what's the word, sparkling water and just mix up like, malic acid and like, fruit flavorings and like, colors and stuff and stevia and just mix up like, some like, soda for myself.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But it's never as much, it's too much work. It's too much work to mix like, one glass and it goes flat really fast. So I can't like, make a whole bunch early on and like, keep it for later. It's a little disappointing, honestly.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I wonder how they do it.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They do it, I don't know. They can do it on, they do it on a mass scale and an industrial scale. So it's easy for them. They have the infrastructure. They own the means of production. Not like, not like me, Prol that I am.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have a couple things to talk about today.

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Cool.

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The Tezuka comic that I've been going on with is, it's like, it's well into the inking stage. And I'm still streaming weekdays over on twitch.tv slash give and take. So drop in.

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We reached a goal where I had enough subscribers, I think I just needed 15 to get an extra emote slot for the subscriber like tier one.

15
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm hoping we can get to the next one by the end of the month, which is like nine away at this point. It's not that far.

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean, aside from the comic, have you been, is twitch being good to you? Is it like, worth your time? I don't know if that's what I mean to say. Do you feel like streaming is going well as an endeavor, apart from the drawing?

17
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I mean, I never get enough viewer base in order to like get up my way to partner. You need to be getting an average of 70 something.

18
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But you've got 15 subscribers.

19
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

20
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Which is kind of a lot to get in like one month because you started with zero, right?

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think I had one or two already.

22
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But yeah, mostly, mostly zero.

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So yeah, it was like, it was a big hype thing. And then a lot of people were invested in what was going on already. And they were like, yeah, sure, Amazon Prime, ding, you know, free. It's easy.

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Excellent, excellent.

25
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if I'm going to like use this as a stream like springboard. I think streaming is just sort of thing, a thing like a tool in my tool belt that I go to sometimes that I'm not really ever thinking of making it into anything bigger.

26
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So sometimes nice to have an audience while you do something, be it video gaming or drawing.

27
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Makes sense.

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But yeah, I'm 20 pages into the 50 page line art thing.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You've lined 50 pages.

30
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've lined 20 pages.

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've lined 20 pages, yes.

32
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What's the deadline?

33
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The deadline is 1st of September. So I've got,

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You got time.

35
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've got time.

36
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm trying, I'm going to go for like getting to page 40 by the end of next week if I can do like four pages a day.

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And that'll be, that'll be great.

38
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sorry, my voice is cracking a little better than I know why.

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You are really fucking going for it. You are really making some some headway on this and I'm very impressed and intimidated and infuriated.

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you.

41
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Good job.

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I mean, at the beginning of last Monday and Tuesday, I was like, oh shit, my line art's not good.

43
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh no, like I was starting the line art and it was like, oh no, I'm not like a God.

44
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can't do it yet. I thought I would be a God by this point by the amount of drawing I've been doing.

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But no, it's like, it's good, you know, it's on the level of Lord of Ghosts, maybe a little bit more.

46
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But the time it takes to get a page done is, you know, you can't rush through something like that.

47
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have to do all of the steps and it does involve a lot of control.

48
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Control Z.

49
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, but you know, overall, I'm pleased with the way it's looking.

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I've accepted that it's not going to be like a fucking super masterpiece, but it is going to be pretty good.

51
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And like on the level of stuff I've done before, if not a little better.

52
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Everything, anything finished is better than anything unfinished. You know what I'm saying?

53
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I do.

54
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You understand the words that are coming out of my mouth.

55
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I, you know, you know, I didn't think you could do it.

56
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I thought you were a stupid dumb bitch, but it looks like I was wrong. Good job.

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Holy fuck.

58
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What?

59
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You probably can't pick that up on the mic, but like there's a massive thunder booming.

60
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So if you hear that in the background, that's probably a storm.

61
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Awesome. I'm jealous.

62
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's, um, it got, it got cold here all of a sudden.

63
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Like it's been like, it's been like terribly uncomfortably hot.

64
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's been like 90 degrees around here.

65
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then like yesterday it was like sub 70 and I couldn't believe it.

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's exactly the same thing over here.

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So much for global warming. Am I right?

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, I'm right. Yeah, you know, I'm right.

69
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Man, oh man.

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Uh, hey, do I have time to gripe about my personal finances?

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Uh, sure. I don't know what I could say.

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Do I have permission? Well, I just got to say last week I was so excited about my,

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
about my credit card, about my city double cash card, 2% cashback, but I fucked up.

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I fucked it up, Gib.

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What'd you fuck up?

76
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If, if I had gotten, um, okay, I won't, I won't.

77
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There's, there's no need for me to explain all the intricacies of why this is the case.

78
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But, uh, if, if I had gotten the discover it cashback card, I could have gotten,

79
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I could have gotten like $200 plus back on, um, on like the, the, the buying the,

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
the RFCK pins and the, um, and the vapors to book printing.

81
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I could have gotten like more than $200 back.

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Uh, if I had gotten that card instead with the double cash, I'm getting like $60 back.

83
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So better than nothing, but, uh, I beefed it.

84
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's, that's free money down the drain and I'm bummed about it.

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But I guess what are you going to do?

86
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So you're still getting some free money.

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's just you found a better deal.

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I could have gotten, I could have gotten significantly more, but it's pretty cringe.

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's pretty cringe and they won't approve me for that one.

90
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
For some reason, too many inquiries, I guess, I guess because I applied for this one before,

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
but like I'm definitely under 524.

92
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I don't know.

93
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I feel like I should be good.

94
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They're watching you Ben.

95
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
They, they heard the podcast.

96
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They know what you're going to do.

97
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They heard the podcast.

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They hacked my computer.

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They saw that I was going on R churning and reading this, the flow charts.

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And they're like, this guy's no good.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This guy's trouble.

102
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Black, black bag him.

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh well.

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Live and learn.

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's my, that's my, that's my personal tragedy this week.

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, I'm out of things to say.

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, well, I got a thing to say.

108
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is my second.

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm floundering.

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Um, I guess this wasn't the case last week, but I started doing, I guess,

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
some sort of public gender confusion tweets.

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

114
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Where I started, uh, I posted like, like a thing like, Hey guys,

115
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm just going to try using female pronouns.

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hmm.

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay.

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's all law.

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't think anything of it.

120
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Just do, do that.

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know, um, and that was a nice, people were very nice about it.

122
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Um, and it, it really was an experiment because I just wanted to know.

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If the, the, the feeling of being, uh, uh, spoken to with the, the female pronouns would

125
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
change my views on the whole trans thing because I had been thinking a lot of trans

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
thoughts, um, ever said a lot of, a lot of dangerous trans thoughts ever since, uh,

127
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
revolutionary.

128
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes.

129
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Ever since recon four, when I cosplayed as punk and I was like, Oh no,

130
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I like wearing tights.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Am I gay?

132
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This, this is bad news for me.

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's fucking gay.

134
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's fucking gay.

135
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah.

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Can't believe this.

137
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay.

138
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
All right.

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sure.

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So I was like, hmm, I don't know.

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I was thought like the, the pronoun thing would be a way to like solidify in one direction

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
or another, whether or not I'm fully trans or some other thing.

143
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think after this, I am not fully trans.

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,760
If I'm going to make a public statement about it, I think I am some sort of weird thing

145
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,000
in the middle, a non binary that can, you fucking centrist pig.

146
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I know.

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm always me, always the centralist.

148
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh yeah.

149
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah.

150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
From that bad guy.

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Uh, so.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay.

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If you have any questions, I will answer.

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have my, my, my, I mean, my only question, I guess, is how, how did you feel about it?

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You did, you went on Twitter, you said, Hey, try, try the female pronouns.

156
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And then when I assume people mostly did so, uh, uh, how did that feel?

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What did you think about that?

158
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Very initially, um, it felt, it felt great.

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You know, it was like, ah, it was so nice of them to immediately accept the thing I was

160
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
doing.

161
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Right.

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
After a day or two, it just sort of was like, I was seeing more of them and I was like,

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
yeah, you know, fits, you know, it doesn't feel incorrect.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Um, but I'm also not like going crazy about it.

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's just sort of like, yeah, it's like those pronouns fit just as well as the male ones.

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Um, hmm.

167
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Okay.

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So she felt correct, but, but, uh, he did not feel incorrect.

169
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah.

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Like it, it was.

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's why it's been so like confusing for me because it's, I really wish it was more clear

172
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
cut that I was like, Oh, I hate being a man and everything to do with masculinity on that

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
gender, like no thanks, but all of the female stuff, I'm all for it.

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Then I would be like, easy, just transition, do the other gender.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Um, but it's, it's, it's not as simple as that.

176
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I feel like there's no, cause you know, I personally believe that if gender is like mostly

177
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
societally built and it's, and it's, you know, the things that about the gen, the language

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
of gender can change over time.

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There's no like permanent anything.

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You can, you can cherry pick what things you like and just do that.

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And so when it comes to like deciding on a pronoun or a gender, it doesn't really make

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
any sense to be so, be so final about any, like be so.

183
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sounds.

184
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know.

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't, I don't want to jump into a label, I guess is the thing.

186
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Sounds like, well, not, not to label you against your will or anything, but it sounds like you're

187
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
a little bit envy.

188
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Uh, non bar.

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah.

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's okay.

192
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I forgive you.

193
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Cool.

194
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I understand.

195
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Cause like I was having hangups about it specifically because I was thinking, ah, non binary.

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's lame.

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's not interesting.

198
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's just, you didn't make, you didn't do completely the opposite of what you were

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
before.

200
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's not crazy.

201
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's not wacky.

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's, that's not a, that's not a scoop.

203
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I say a throwing down my, my notes and my, my quill for as I, as I, as a throwing down

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
my reporters hat, my journalist badge.

205
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah.

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Like the headline is a man decides that maybe some female things are good.

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm not going to be, this isn't going to make the front page.

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So like,

209
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This isn't going to be trend on Twitter.

210
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So when it comes to like pronouns, I guess either, I like, I like she and if people are

211
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
okay with doing that, that's fine.

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Um, if people, I think that the weird thing about it is that there's definitely a contingent

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
of people who would spitefully call me he knowing that I was a man.

214
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes.

215
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And so it would be, it would be hard to, to parse whether or not somebody calling me a

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
he was calling me a he just because, or calling me a he because they hate trans people.

217
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And so it's, I don't know exactly how to, to approach that.

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Um, boy.

219
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Gee, I don't know.

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay.

221
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, everyone needs to put in their bio, whether they're saying he because they don't

222
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
know anything or because they are a mean, a mean jerk.

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We need that in bio, please.

224
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
In my bio, transphobe or not.

225
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Stop, stop, stop shoving it down our throat.

226
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Stop forcing us to put pronouns in bio.

227
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You just put your opinions in bio.

228
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And so we don't have to do it.

229
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay.

230
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's, it's better this way.

231
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes.

232
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's on, it's on you friends.

233
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Cool.

234
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So when it comes to other things like changing voice or dressing differently, I'll probably

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
dress differently.

237
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Occasionally, you won't see that because that's me.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's my personal life.

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Correct.

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But I don't think I'm going to try changing my voice too much.

241
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't know.

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It feels pretty, I don't know.

243
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What do you think?

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I only know my voice from inside my head.

245
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And what do I think about your voice?

246
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
About like whether it has like an androgynous quality because it's not very deep.

247
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's probably more masculine than it is feminine, I'm sure, but like.

248
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's hard.

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's hard.

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I mean, it's a, it's not a particularly deep voice.

251
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I wouldn't say it's particularly Andrew.

252
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't know.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I mean, I think of it as a male voice because I've thought of you as a male for this whole

254
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
time.

255
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So maybe I'm a little biased when I say that it sounds like a.

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah, it's fairly masculine voice to me.

257
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I would imagine most people, even if it's not super deep or anything, I would imagine

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
most people would assume it, but there has been like one time I think that somebody

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
thought I was a girl from like a give and take video, a pony give and take video that

260
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I made.

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Just one of those reviews.

262
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They thought I was a girl from that.

263
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I remember that.

264
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Epic.

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do they think your pony was a girl pony?

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
They may have been talking about that instead.

267
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not sure.

268
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Didn't you give give and take like the girl pony face?

269
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Wasn't that like part of his design?

270
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes.

271
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That was explicitly like, I don't like the way the male pony snouts look.

272
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah.

273
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No, nobody does.

274
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Nobody does.

275
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So yeah, that's, that's.

276
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's my gender confusion.

277
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's still not like finalized.

278
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hilarious.

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's, it's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

281
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Speaking of the funniest thing you've ever seen, did you see, did you re, did you rewatch

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
the French history lecture?

283
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Did you see that that came out yesterday?

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I did not rewatch it because I was, I was rewatching it in a call with Munchie to go

285
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
over it to see if there's any problems.

286
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I saw some, I saw some screenshots being posted in the, the Golden Child Foundry.

287
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is that, was that like, he was like editing it or whatever?

288
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah.

289
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He was, he was thinking, all right.

290
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No, it was just the raw footage.

291
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We were going through like both cameras on screen at once.

292
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And, and he was just wondering if there was anything people pointed out like, oh, you

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
should do this is a suggestion.

294
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So I watched most of it through that.

295
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, not most of it.

296
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It was four hours long.

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But yeah, it was just great.

298
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Just re-living the Munchie time.

299
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I feel, you know, there's not, I was re rewatching it, not the whole thing, but just like bits

300
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and pieces.

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And I was like, there's not a lot of like audience.

302
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Like we don't say very much.

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Like Munchie mostly just talks the whole time.

304
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Only occasionally does the audience speak up.

305
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Like I was editing, I was going back the other day and editing the Sonichu lecture, Sonichu

306
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
102.

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And it's like, it's constant.

308
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Like, like you guys speak up like all the time, which is fine.

309
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Like that's good.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I was thinking like, should we have said more during the French Revolution?

311
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Like I didn't know what to say, but that is not because like I was like bored or anything.

312
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like I was interested.

313
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No, it was, it was, I didn't have any like comments to make during it or anything.

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It was because Munchie explained it in such a way that it seemed like he was always getting

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
to an explanation and exploring a new thing.

316
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And you weren't left being like, wait a minute, what was that about that?

317
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Like he was talking like a thousand miles an hour for four hours.

318
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It was, it was like so much information.

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And you know, I don't think any of us were like big history buffs.

320
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So we were just like, yes, nodding our heads.

321
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like, of course we trust you.

322
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The thing that every man wants unwashed pussy and unrelenting cuckold drink.

323
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The UP you see.

324
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I saw that part just a minute ago before we started recording and I laughed.

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's good.

326
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's good.

327
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's good.

328
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So what do we got?

329
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We got two.

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We got my lecture, which is going to be coming out soon because Sixten has a, I think I haven't

331
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
heard his latest take on the music for the slime and punishment finale, but I think we

332
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
are almost done.

333
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And I'm going to be releasing that soon.

334
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh yeah.

335
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's all linked in.

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It is all linked in.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And then the Sonichu one of two lectures to come out after that.

338
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Very exciting.

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then Digi's lecture, whenever that's ready.

340
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
She said September, but I don't know if I believe her anymore, but I guess we'll see.

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I really want to see that because it was really funny and cool and good.

342
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I want it out.

343
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Hmm.

344
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes.

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hey, you there?

346
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Hey, you there?

347
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm just like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

348
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Okay.

349
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, and then we got, and then we got the, we got the.

351
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Girl.

352
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Should I, should I say the other things there are the radcon four things?

353
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Are they secret?

354
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't even remember what's supposed to be secret anymore.

355
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Don't talk about the Brad stuff.

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Okay.

357
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We know the knowledge that there is a lecture is out.

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Obviously, because we said we would do that.

359
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But don't slip any secret deeds about it.

360
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay.

361
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think I was just about to slip some secret deeds.

362
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So thank you for catching me.

363
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Thanks for catching me.

364
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Anyway, I was reflecting on this yesterday.

365
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You know, I was downing, I was downing hard seltzer after hard seltzer.

366
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Talking a munchie about this yesterday and I was reflecting on, you know, I feel like

367
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
once everything that we have in the works, once every radcon four related thing that

368
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
is in the works is done and out, I think people will be, I think people will be hard

369
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
pressed say that we did not deliver on, on, on the, the, the whole, the whole promise.

370
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I think people will be, I think people will be easily satisfied with the amount of content

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
that was delivered for, you know, the meme $34,000 because there's a lot.

372
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yeah.

373
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
A lot, a lot, a lot.

374
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We worked hard.

375
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It was.

376
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And we played hard.

377
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It has been like a bit of a, like a downer period.

378
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It like, not just for us, but in the world.

379
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And it's, it's kind of because of the downer period in the world that, I don't know, like

380
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
all of this stuff got delayed for a bunch of months, but like things are getting into

381
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
place.

382
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We got, we got lectures coming out munchies done with his fucking, well, the channel's

383
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
back.

384
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's definitely a good thing.

385
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Losing the channel, losing all that red content.

386
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah.

387
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It was just so disheartening.

388
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And we got more things.

389
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You are nearly done with slime and punishment, which is like a big thing that's been building

390
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
up.

391
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I, you know, I feel bad.

392
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I, I like, I'm, I'm very happy with how the finale looks.

393
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm, I'm excited to release it.

394
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's not, I feel like it's not enough for the amount of time that I've been talking about

395
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
finishing it.

396
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Uh, but like, I don't know what would be.

397
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You know what I mean?

398
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Does that make sense?

399
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Uh, it's been like, I was talking about the finale at Radcon 4.

400
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,500
Even at Radcon 4, I was, I was like, about to make it.

401
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,440
And here we are five months later and I'm like ready to release it.

402
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,840
And I'll be perfectly frank.

403
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,120
It's not, it's not five months worth of work.

404
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,560
It just took me that long to like focus myself and actually get around to doing it, uh, instead

405
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,000
of all the other things that I was doing.

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,320
And I feel a little bummed about that.

407
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,000
Does that make, make a sense here?

408
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
I feel that as well.

410
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,880
Like sometimes the amount of time it takes to make something is not literally the amount

411
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,880
of time it takes for it to come out and it feels like you're, you're, you're being a

412
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,160
shithead like, oh, all of those hours I could have been working.

413
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
I didn't.

414
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,040
But like, I don't know.

415
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:39,400
Sometimes life gives you, um, ruined lemons and you can't make lemonade.

416
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,480
It was, it was a combination of having other things that I was working on that distracted

417
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:53,160
me and just being sad and like depressed and upset and like not being able to focus is,

418
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,760
is both of those things together.

419
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,760
And that's why, and that's why it took me five months to get the finale done.

420
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,960
Uh, and I don't know.

421
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Do I feel good about it?

422
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,160
No, but it is what it is.

423
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,160
Yeah.

424
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,280
But that being said, it, I was showing, I was showing Munchie and Kazzy yesterday and

425
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,440
I think they thought it looked cool and I also think it looks cool and I can't, it might

426
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,440
even be out by the, it might even be out by the time this podcast that you, the viewer

427
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
are listening to this.

428
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Yeah.

429
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
I know, I know.

430
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Very exciting.

431
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Very exciting.

432
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

433
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Yeah.

434
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,200
So, you know, we've got all that stuff.

435
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,720
We've got rad content coming.

436
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,720
We also have, uh, the podcast is back after a hiatus.

437
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Is it?

438
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Yes.

439
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,200
We made an episode catching up four chapters.

440
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,560
There's a lot of cool shit happening in these chapters.

441
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,720
Are you, are you caught up with One Piece, Ben?

442
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,600
No, I never did get caught up.

443
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,960
I think I'm like 70 or 60 chapters behind.

444
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Wow.

445
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Yeah.

446
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,920
Um, um, I, I, I'm so stupid.

447
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
I'm so stupid.

448
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:06,160
I, at Radcon, I was, I was like, I'm definitely going to catch up so I can be on the podcast

449
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,280
at Radcon and I, I read it on the plane, I read it on the trip and then I would like

450
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,560
stay up at night in bed, like reading the chapters, like trying to get caught up and

451
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,640
I didn't get caught up.

452
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,440
The only thing that happened was that I was just tired every day because I like stayed

453
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,720
up in bed reading One Piece trying to get caught up.

454
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,520
Is that, is that why you were in bed so much?

455
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,560
I didn't realize that you were like staying up late into the night reading One Piece.

456
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,600
To a, to a large extent, yeah, that is why like, my sleep schedule was all fucked up

457
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,360
and I like slept through a lot of stuff because I was like trying to get, I was trying to

458
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,040
catch up on One Piece at night.

459
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,400
There was so much very, very stupid.

460
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
You left.

461
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,320
I mean, not to like shit on you, but you left a lot of things right to the last minute.

462
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,080
The poster, you drew in like one hour, like extremely fast before you got on the flight.

463
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,280
No, I didn't, you are a fucking fool.

464
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
That's not accurate.

465
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,240
I was drawing that poster for like a week.

466
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,080
I did finish it very close to the deadline, but I was working on it for like a whole

467
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
week beforehand.

468
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,960
Well, yeah, but like, it's, it was like, we needed the file so that Munchie can print

469
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,360
it so that Munchie could bring it.

470
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,640
And we had a very clear deadline for that.

471
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
And it was like, oh shit.

472
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,840
Oh, shit.

473
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,680
And then like all of it, I mean, you're right, you're right.

474
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
I did.

475
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,800
And it was like, I did leave it.

476
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,240
And then also like basically all of us did not study for our lectures and we had to study

477
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,240
at Radcon, including you and me.

478
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Yes.

479
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:46,200
It was like, Radcon was kind of a shit show, but you know, sure, I, I enjoy that it happened.

480
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
It's the same way.

481
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,320
I mean, it's the same way I did my first lecture.

482
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Well, when you, when you say that I didn't study, I mean, I, I read through, you had

483
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
the material in your head.

484
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
You was just like, I did.

485
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Yeah.

486
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Yeah.

487
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Yeah.

488
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,960
I did read through a unicorn jelly.

489
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,800
I did read through the JDR comics and I did read through Sonichir before.

490
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,720
I didn't make any notes though, which is like the hard part.

491
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,320
Mostly what I'm thinking of.

492
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
Yeah.

493
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
True.

494
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,200
I really, I mean, I didn't do fucking any research.

495
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,240
I, I thought, I thought I could rem, remember Homestuck and I kind of did, but I couldn't

496
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,080
kind of remember Homestuck.

497
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,760
I remembered so much, but like it wasn't enough to make it like well formed.

498
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:38,840
Oh, I suck and they gave it a, a, a cruel name that means half formed quasi-modo.

499
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Amazing.

500
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Amazing.

501
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:48,360
Anyway, that's, that's the past, but the future is now, um, canton is a thing.

502
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Yeah.

503
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
Yeah.

504
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Whatever.

505
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
They're, they're doing that.

506
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
No, I like it.

507
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,160
I like the fact that, you know, this idea of doing a show weekly is like actually finally

508
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,320
a real possible thing now that they're living near each other.

509
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Hmm.

510
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Hmm.

511
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,560
Imagine, imagine some friends getting together to release a recording of themselves talking

512
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
once a week.

513
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,280
Where, where could I, where could, where could I find a content of that, of that nature?

514
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Hmm.

515
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Gee, I don't know.

516
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,080
Where could such a thing be?

517
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,280
Gee, I don't know.

518
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,680
Nobody, nobody knows.

519
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
It's a mystery.

520
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,240
Good thing canton exists to fill this, this dis unfilled niche.

521
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,120
I mean, I don't know.

522
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,840
The mark, the mark, the gap in the market needed filling and now it's here, praise be.

523
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,240
People were going insane last episode wanting Nate.

524
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,720
They were thirsty for him.

525
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,520
They really want him back.

526
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
No.

527
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,200
There was, Tom mentioned this two episodes ago, ever when it was, when it was just you

528
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
and Tom, right?

529
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Everyone, like nobody, everyone was like, I like the, like the low energy, like the low

530
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
key nature.

531
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,200
This podcast is relaxing.

532
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,040
I don't miss Nate.

533
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,200
Last one ever, there was, well, there was a split.

534
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,320
There were people saying like, God, where is Nate?

535
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,640
Why isn't Nate on this podcast?

536
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,720
And there was another group being like, fuck all these Nate heads, Nate heads molding,

537
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,720
get wrecked.

538
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,640
So, so we have an ideological divide.

539
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,920
And Digi said that it was probably because of the name, responsible fiscal planning,

540
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,080
which does seem, you know, if you're,

541
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,440
It does seem like a Nate head, not a Nate head, a Nate himself, a topic.

542
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Sure.

543
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
Sure.

544
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Possibly.

545
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,040
However, you know, that's, that's the twist.

546
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,120
You think it's Nate, but it's not.

547
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,000
It was me all along.

548
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's the trick.

549
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,200
And you fell for it, viewer, you Rube, you fell, you, I lay the trap and you walk right

550
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
into it.

551
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,120
I mean, all of this stuff, I, I do want more people to appear on the podcast.

552
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,080
It's fun having the little shows, you know, just chatting about stuff, but it's, it's

553
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,560
very clear that like, unless there's a lot we can talk about, we only have what we've

554
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,440
been doing that week to, to really focus on.

555
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:13,760
I mean, more people means more material, more, more things, more items of interest.

556
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
I'm like, I don't know.

557
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,520
The gender, could I talk more about it?

558
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
I don't know.

559
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
It's.

560
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
You could.

561
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
If you wanted to.

562
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,680
I mean, I don't know what really to say exactly.

563
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
No, sure.

564
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Sure.

565
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,440
Um, this is, this is a, you know, yeah, I don't know.

566
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,320
It's like I'm saying, like, where could I find a weekly recording of some people talking

567
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,160
with where, where could such a thing be?

568
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Hmm.

569
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
I don't know.

570
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:46,360
Uh, I feel, I feel like, uh, should I even talk about this on the podcast that I feel

571
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,640
like it's weird that like, that like attendance is down and I don't know why is this, is this

572
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
too real?

573
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,840
I mean, if it's, if it's true to life, then you may as well say it.

574
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,400
If you, if you think that I have, I think I have said this.

575
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,920
I don't know if I've said this on the podcast, but I've said this to you guys.

576
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:12,360
Is that I genuinely don't understand why someone wouldn't show up to be on the podcast.

577
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,160
It is a, it is objectively a good use of one's time.

578
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,560
I never feel bad about it.

579
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,880
I always feel good about it.

580
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,280
I always make a point to show up because it's worth it because it's not a mistake.

581
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,240
But everyone else, everyone else, I guess I, I'm like one of the few people that feel

582
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,440
this way because people voluntarily like, nah, I'm not going to be on the podcast.

583
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Why?

584
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
Why?

585
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,400
I, I do not understand why anyone makes that decision.

586
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,840
I don't know.

587
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
That's all I can say about it.

588
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,040
It doesn't make any sense to me.

589
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Yeah.

590
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:54,440
I, I, I, it's hard to, to like, I'm, I'm sure on a, on some level it's just, I don't want

591
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,640
to be on the internet today.

592
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,240
Like if, if they, if they perform badly, I'm going to get bad comments.

593
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,120
People are going to say, fuck you.

594
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
Like I'm not sure.

595
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,680
I'm sure people aren't like running away from that specifically, but like if you don't

596
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:15,840
need to embarrass yourself by making, making, making a podcast and being like, then I don't

597
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
know.

598
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,600
Do you feel, do you feel like you embarrass yourself on the podcast?

599
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,560
I feel like by the nature of being an internet man, it is embarrassing inherently.

600
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,760
I kind of, I kind of know what you mean, but I feel like that ship has sailed and there's

601
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,440
no like unembarrassing myself at this point.

602
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,720
There's nothing I can really do.

603
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Like the people like hearing me talk.

604
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,280
So yeah, I'll talk, whatever.

605
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,920
Some people fucking hate my guts apparently and it's like, well, you know what, I'll keep

606
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
talking.

607
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,640
I'll keep talking every day, every week.

608
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
You got to, you got to show the haters.

609
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,480
You got to show them that they're not going to get you down.

610
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Yeah.

611
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Fuckers.

612
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Um, I, I, I don't know.

613
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,200
I just, I just don't, I just don't know what went wrong.

614
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,600
Um, remember my little pony?

615
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,360
Dude, I fucking do.

616
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,920
I do remember my little pony.

617
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,120
I was, that was like a pretty good show.

618
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,360
I had like jokes for adults too.

619
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,680
You know what I'm saying?

620
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Yeah.

621
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,720
It had like, it had like adult humor, like sex on screen as my favorite parts.

622
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,080
It had like, it had like, remember the episode where it was just, you just went on Derpy

623
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Buru and we're just, just jacking off, just jacking it to porn, to porn on the pornography.

624
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,800
I liked that one a lot.

625
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,440
I did watch that Jenny Nicholson, uh, Brony Khan, death of a fandom video.

626
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,800
Oh, had you not, had you, had you not seen it before?

627
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,360
No, I hadn't had a chance, but I love it.

628
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
I love that video.

629
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
It's great.

630
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,280
It's like reminiscing with an old friend about the good old days.

631
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
It is.

632
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,640
It's like, I, I like all of the, all of the, I mean, I feel like we probably made a PCP

633
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,920
about Brony Khan, but.

634
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
We did.

635
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,180
I, I love the atmosphere and the, and the, the, like the unabashed, like cringy embracing

636
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,120
sincerity of everyone there.

637
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,640
It's like, wow, I don't ever think I could ever be in a place like that again with people

638
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,120
who are like not cynical at all.

639
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Yeah, right.

640
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,640
It was, it was cool.

641
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,640
It was, it was cool.

642
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
I liked that too.

643
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,000
Uh, and it's gone forever.

644
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's gone forever.

645
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,080
Nothing gold can stay.

646
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,640
We just have to, we just have to make my little pony too.

647
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,240
We just have to create the next, we have to be the Lawn Foust.

648
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
You don't, I mean, nobody owns it anymore, right?

649
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,000
Like if the show ended and now the name is just like free and anyone can use it, right?

650
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's how that works.

651
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,160
We could, we could be the change we want to see in the world.

652
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,040
We could just make it again.

653
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,640
We could just remake it again in HD.

654
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Yeah.

655
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
We don't even have to do any work.

656
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,080
We could just find the files and upload them and we made it again.

657
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,960
We could be like, we could go on 4chan and be like, Hey guys, I hear they're releasing

658
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,880
this show about ponies.

659
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,960
Uh, uh, wouldn't it be ironic if we went and watched it?

660
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,800
Uh, and everyone will fall for it.

661
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,920
They'll climb and sink it.

662
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Yeah, yeah.

663
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
We just do it again.

664
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Here we go again.

665
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,680
We could, we could literally just do it again.

666
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,880
Like we wait a few like generations until like the 4chan user base is a different bunch

667
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
of people.

668
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,400
We just, we just wait, we just wait until like everyone who's currently alive dies.

669
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,480
And then when there's a new crop of people, we just do it again.

670
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
We're like 98.

671
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,080
Hey guys, Hasbro, Hasbro made this new show, what do you think?

672
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
We can look this up.

673
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,280
We know what this was.

674
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,000
It was like, Oh no, we failed.

675
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,680
We waited for 19 years and it didn't work.

676
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
We fucked up.

677
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
We fucked up.

678
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,080
It was a foolproof plan up until we did it.

679
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:02,160
Uh, but we can't know it won't work.

680
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
You can never go back.

681
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
You can't.

682
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
You can't reclaim the past.

683
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
It's gone.

684
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,840
Uh, only the future remains only the, only the nightmare, only the nightmare that is

685
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,960
the rest of our lives awaits.

686
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Cool.

687
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Yes.

688
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
2021.

689
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:28,000
Only the horrifying reality of the economic recession that we are facing on top of the

690
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,760
last one that didn't even end before.

691
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:40,680
I can't wait for COVID adult UK with their own recession to be hit with Brexit in October

692
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:47,560
and get double recession and be completely destroyed overnight because nobody was paying

693
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
attention to it.

694
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
And they forgot.

695
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,040
Are they, are they still going to do Brexit?

696
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,760
I mean, they're still doing it.

697
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,240
The last thing I remember was we have written it in law that this will happen and it is

698
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,240
final and it will happen on October the 30th.

699
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,240
That is it.

700
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Okay.

701
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,080
And then the point of that was to pressure the rest of the nations into just getting

702
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,320
their shit together and saying, fine, let's have a deal.

703
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:23,720
And it was a gamble because the, they may not decide on a deal by that time.

704
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,920
When you say deal, what are the, what a kind of deal?

705
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
What do they want?

706
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,640
A trade deal and various other things related to like make a trade deal in order for them

707
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
not to Brexit.

708
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,080
No, a trade deal as in like, this is how we're going to organize trade from now on.

709
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,440
This is our new relationship between the UK and the EU.

710
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:49,640
This is how we're going to sort out, you know, the different allowed materials and how the

711
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,800
tariffs are going to work is all this paper work stuff.

712
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,800
And obviously the EU hates the UK for even doing Brexit.

713
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Why are you doing this?

714
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:06,520
Or they say, fuck you, you fucking racists, you stupid idiots.

715
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,040
And we're like, wow, give us a good deal.

716
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Yeah.

717
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,520
And, and I don't think this is going to happen.

718
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,280
So we're going to get, we're going to fall out of the EU with no deal as, as was, as

719
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,680
was, you know, thought about a many, many of a time.

720
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,480
If it's, I mean, if it's about like, if it's about like not looking weak or whatever, I

721
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,160
feel like UK, if they don't want to do Brexit now under these terms, I feel like no one

722
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,480
is going to blame them if they're like, listen, I know we said that.

723
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,880
But like, shit got really fucked up since then and we're going to rethink it a little

724
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
bit.

725
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,240
I definitely think that, that is like an excuse people will generally be like, yeah, okay.

726
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
I mean, COVID.

727
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,000
I mean, I would be like, yeah, of course, of course you changed your fucking plans after

728
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
COVID hit.

729
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I mean, I hope so.

730
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah.

731
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,240
No, nothing, nothing will ever be the same.

732
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,680
There was a contingent of people, myself included for a little bit that was just like, I'm tired

733
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,800
of hearing about Brexit.

734
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,280
This has been going on for three years, going on for, just decide, like make it final.

735
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Don't have it be hanging over the heads, over our heads anymore, because the, the uncertainty

736
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,920
of it was already affecting business.

737
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,960
It was already making the pound devalued.

738
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,720
It was fucking us up before anything had happened, just the idea of it.

739
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,920
And it has been like that the whole time is like, we have to make a decision and every

740
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,720
decision is bad.

741
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,280
And it's just, it's a nightmare that will continue to be relevant for years to come

742
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,000
whenever it does like, quote unquote, happen finally.

743
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,680
So it's like, it's just like, it's, we've already been fucked over here.

744
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,760
And then the whole world is also fucked.

745
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,160
It's like a double fuck.

746
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
We're getting fucked involved.

747
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,840
We're getting fucked at the same time.

748
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Yeah.

749
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Yeah.

750
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:06,760
Well, I mean, um, you, it'll always like, until you break, until Brexit happens, it'll

751
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,480
always be like on the table, like, unless you do it, like the option to do it will always

752
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
remain.

753
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Right?

754
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Yes.

755
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,320
So, I don't know.

756
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,320
If you don't want it, if it's bad, then you probably shouldn't do it.

757
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,320
Well, yeah, it probably doesn't, it probably doesn't, yeah, it doesn't make, it doesn't

758
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
make any sense to me.

759
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:30,880
But I'll definitely be voting for whoever's trying to not have it happen because I, right.

760
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,960
I don't want this anymore.

761
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,960
I did.

762
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
Yeah.

763
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
Yeah.

764
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Uh, oof.

765
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Ah, cringe.

766
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,640
It's just a thing, it's just, it's just, it's just something that popped into my head.

767
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,840
It was like, oh wait, yes.

768
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,440
Even before all this, there was a terrible thing going to happen this year.

769
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
Yeah.

770
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,280
Uh, uh, and then, yeah, and a fucking Super Tuesday happens.

771
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,800
I feel, I feel a little bit the same about Bernie losing the primary.

772
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,720
That was, that was a nightmare.

773
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,200
I guess you guys had the same kind of thing with Corbin.

774
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Yeah.

775
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,680
Uh, she was, she was already pretty bleak.

776
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,400
She was already pretty bad, in my opinion.

777
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,040
When are we going to die?

778
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,960
When are we going to die?

779
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,520
I'm tired of all this shit.

780
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,480
At least, at least we can, uh, make content and distract ourselves.

781
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,360
At least we can make, put funny videos and podcasts out on the interwebs and pretend

782
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,080
that we're going to have a future.

783
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:44,000
I, I think that I consume too, I consume too much content.

784
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I watch too many like fucking like people telling me about a thing on YouTube videos.

785
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
Yeah.

786
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
I do.

787
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
It's, it's bad.

788
00:42:53,160 --> 00:43:03,160
I, uh, I, uh, I, I listen, I listen to people repeat my opinions back at me too much and

789
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,080
I don't really get anything out of it except annoyed, except annoyed that they're like

790
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,160
famous for thinking the same thing that I do and I'm not even though they told you about

791
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
it.

792
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Yes.

793
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Yeah.

794
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
And it doesn't make any sense because like, yeah, I learned these things from you.

795
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,880
So like, of course you get the credit for saying it, like what, I didn't do anything,

796
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,400
but I'm still like, I agree with this.

797
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,240
Why don't people, why don't people know me as the guy who thinks this thing?

798
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:37,240
Uh, I'm a very, I'm a very, uh, very spiteful, uh, uh, uh, jealous person, a grasping, uh,

799
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,240
covetous goblin, uh, of a man, uh, and it's very sad.

800
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
Hmm.

801
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Yeah.

802
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Yeah.

803
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,520
I've been, I've been listening to a lot of just videos.

804
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,800
I recently, that H-bomber guy guy, I'd never really gotten into him cause he's a bit too

805
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,640
much of a wacky YouTuber on top of the, the stuff he talks about, but I, I got into a

806
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,720
few of his videos and I was like, you know what, yeah, yeah, he's, he's pretty good.

807
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,160
A lot of H-bomber guys videos are not like, yeah, a lot of them are just kind of too weird

808
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,520
and wacky and like lean too hard in the comedy bits and ways that don't really do it for

809
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,520
me.

810
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,560
Um, have you seen the one about control, all delete?

811
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
That one's really good.

812
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,480
Uh, I have not seen that one.

813
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,720
That's, that's probably my favorite H-bomb, uh, the one about pathologic, pathologic

814
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
is pretty good.

815
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,400
Uh, that one's not particularly wacky, uh, yeah.

816
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,200
The one's about like Sherlock, I don't like cause I don't know anything about Sherlock

817
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,400
and I don't want to.

818
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,800
I, I enjoyed that one mostly because of his, um, his Doctor Who analysis, which I am very

819
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,780
much interested in and I'm like, yes, of course, all of these things he's saying about the

820
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:54,080
showrunner makes sense when I think about those episodes that I watched and how I don't

821
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,160
give a shit about those particular series.

822
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,160
Yeah.

823
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Yeah.

824
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,640
I don't know anything about Doctor Who, so it's not for me.

825
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
It's not for me, man.

826
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:09,960
My dude, my dog, my brooch, bleh, H-bomb, I don't know, I have mixed feelings about H-bomb.

827
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,960
I guess he's okay.

828
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
He's fine.

829
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Yeah.

830
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,960
He's not my favorite.

831
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,960
He's okay.

832
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,960
He's, he's great.

833
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,960
He's my best friend.

834
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,960
I love him.

835
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Mwah.

836
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,960
And kiss him.

837
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Yeah.

838
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,240
Like, I, I, I've, I only watch YouTube videos at the weekends now because of Cold Turkey.

839
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,680
I blocked it completely.

840
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
Um.

841
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,440
You're so, you're so, you're so like, um, I can't believe you stick with the Cold Turkey

842
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,440
thing.

843
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,960
If I would cheat, I would cheat with Cold Turkey all the time.

844
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,480
The only reason Cold Turkey is so effective is because it's very difficult to cheat.

845
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,960
You cannot, you cannot change a setting during a block period.

846
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Um.

847
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
Yeah.

848
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,480
You cannot change the block while it's, it's running.

849
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,680
And I have it running 24 hours a day, five days a week.

850
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,960
So if, if I want to, on the weekend, I can decide to let myself, you know, change it

851
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
up.

852
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,960
I can change it up during the weekend.

853
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
Yeah.

854
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,920
But I just forget and I don't really give a shit because I can get through basically

855
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,400
all of the YouTube videos of the week during the weekend.

856
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
Just binge it.

857
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Like, ah, yeah.

858
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
TV time.

859
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Relax.

860
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Yeah.

861
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,520
Just do nothing in particular and, and watch this garbage and I'm like, hmm, that was

862
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,520
tasty.

863
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Well, it's all gone.

864
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,680
I don't really need YouTube anymore.

865
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,960
So I'm okay with it being gone for the next week.

866
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:36,840
I have just been, I have just been having fucking red letter media videos just on in

867
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,840
the background.

868
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
Just constantly.

869
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,840
We've all been there.

870
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
Just constantly.

871
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,840
Yeah.

872
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,120
Uh, there, there's never not one going, there's never not a best of the worst on and I don't

873
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
know.

874
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,160
It's, it's like, uh, it's, I don't even, I don't even see it or hear it anymore.

875
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,680
It's just, it's just the soundtrack of my life.

876
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,480
It's not even diegetic.

877
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,280
What you should do to like make it so absurd that you realize what is happening to your

878
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:11,360
life is open like five to six of those types of videos at once and just bask in the cacophony,

879
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,000
the noise that is generated from all these people talking about movies or whatever.

880
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,480
And then you'll be like, oh my God, this is what I've been doing all day, but like all

881
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
at once.

882
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
Yeah.

883
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
I see.

884
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,320
I don't even, I don't even like movies.

885
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
It's weird.

886
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,600
But I don't, I don't think I like movies very much.

887
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,560
Like I'm not interested in them.

888
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,880
I haven't even seen Avengers Endgame or the first one.

889
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,640
The Avengers Thanos attacks.

890
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,840
Munchy and Kazi were trying to get me, they were trying to convince me or they were talking

891
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,840
about watching, um, hereditary.

892
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,520
And I was like, uh, I don't want to watch hereditary.

893
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,720
And they were like, no, you should.

894
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,720
It's good.

895
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:56,920
And I was like, no, I don't think it is because like I watched, um, they got me to watch Midsommar

896
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,520
and like Midsommar is a good movie.

897
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,240
It's a well-made movie, but I didn't like it.

898
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,320
I didn't enjoy it.

899
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:06,360
And I feel like my life is worse since having watched it because sometimes I will think about

900
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,800
the things that happen in that movie and they'll make me sad and upset.

901
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Yes.

902
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,480
I've heard that it's very gory and scary and will make you upset and poop your pants.

903
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
It's yeah.

904
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,000
It's, uh, it's just upsetting and, and, uh, I don't like thinking about it.

905
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,520
And my life is worse that I, that I have the memories of its events.

906
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,960
And so I'm like, I don't want any more of that.

907
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,960
I feel like this is like pussy shit.

908
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:36,720
I'm describing like pussy shit opinion that probably like, I don't know, I mean horror

909
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,600
movies are, you don't need to enjoy them.

910
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,080
I get scared.

911
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,040
I get scared by like fucking jump scares in Resident Evil one.

912
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,520
I still do, even though I know they're happening.

913
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,960
When the dogs jump through the window, I like clench the controller so hard I snap it in

914
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,520
two and I can't play the game anymore.

915
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,960
Every time I'm, I'm extremely easily scared and I just like a little moth flies in front

916
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,960
of me and I'm like, I spazz them out and I need, I need to kill it.

917
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,960
I go into a, you know, you go into a beast mode.

918
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,440
So it's like, I'm not good with scary things.

919
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,720
So I don't watch horror movies and that's perfectly epic from my perspective.

920
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,440
I'm not, I'm not good with scary things and I'm prone and I'm prone to dwelling on unpleasant

921
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,200
thoughts and it hurts my mood.

922
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,960
It makes me unhappy and I'm like, I should probably, why not, why not limit the amount

923
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,440
of those things that I can dwell on?

924
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,920
It's just, it's just not for me.

925
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,760
The, the, the horror movie experience is not for me.

926
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,160
I don't get anything out of it.

927
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,240
I think I've decided.

928
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:51,600
It's funny when you are the scary person and you are scaring other people, but when you

929
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,800
are the one who is being scared, it is not good.

930
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:01,760
Um, yes, I like to cause harm rather than receive it.

931
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,880
I like to be the goblin in the dark to just, to jump out.

932
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,440
Here's, here's a fun give and take lore fact.

933
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,720
One time, um, we're, uh, me and my brothers were on holiday and the, there was this big

934
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,720
old field and it was dark.

935
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,240
It was pitch black around the country.

936
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:27,320
Um, and I ran away from this like garden lamp, this, uh, out by the patio, there was

937
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,200
a garden lamp and it was illuminating like a circle and it felt like a video game is

938
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,120
like, oh, the light only goes this far beyond that is completely dark.

939
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,120
So if I run into that darkness, I'm invincible.

940
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,160
I mean invisible and, and so I ran into the dark.

941
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,520
My brother, little, little baby at the time, you know, I was like 12 or something.

942
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,840
He was like, oh no, he's gone and he didn't want to call me like he didn't, doesn't have

943
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,840
an object permanence.

944
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,840
It's like a complete idiot.

945
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,840
12 years old.

946
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,280
He hadn't figured it out yet.

947
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,280
Okay.

948
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,240
So I was like, okay, strategy time.

949
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,040
He thinks that I left.

950
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,320
How am I going to defeat my baby brother?

951
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
Yes.

952
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,280
How am I going to best scare him and kill him?

953
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,280
Yes.

954
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,640
He saw me run out of the, the circle of light, uh, in this direction.

955
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,240
He thinks I'm still in that direction.

956
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,480
I will circle around hoping that the light can't reach me.

957
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,480
And I was right.

958
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,680
He, he didn't know where I was.

959
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:30,080
He was completely blind and I got to the side of him and I jumped at him like a werewolf

960
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,080
in Bloodborne.

961
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,280
Um, and he screamed and it was the funniest thing I'd ever done.

962
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,360
In my life.

963
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,560
And that's, that's my story.

964
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,120
That's my gibblor.

965
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,840
I scared my real brother by jumping out of the darkness.

966
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Did he ever forgive you?

967
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,480
I don't think he was terribly scared or traumatized by it, but if he was, he has never told me.

968
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,280
He's never told me if that was the case.

969
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,080
I mean, we're definitely, we're definitely cool, but like it would be funny if like in

970
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,040
the back of his mind, every, you know, every so often he wakes up in a cold sweat, thinking

971
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,040
of, of me, beast man.

972
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,040
Yes.

973
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,040
Excellent.

974
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
Excellent.

975
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:17,680
Uh, uh, I mean, I used to, I used to torment my little sister.

976
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,200
I would put her on a swing.

977
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,040
We had a, we had a swing, like a, like a disc on a rope.

978
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
You know what I'm talking about?

979
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,080
Like a disc that you would sit on.

980
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,080
Yeah.

981
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,080
Yeah.

982
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,080
I know.

983
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
Yeah.

984
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,080
One of those kinds of swings.

985
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,880
And I would like, she would get on it and I would grab the rope and I would like,

986
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,640
plant my heel in the ground and just like spin around as fast as I could, uh, uh,

987
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,640
terrorizing her and traumatizing her.

988
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Uh, uh, and it was cruel and unusual.

989
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,440
Uh, but what are you going to do?

990
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,440
Not do it.

991
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,440
No.

992
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,440
Shut up.

993
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
Wrong.

994
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,440
Did you traumatize Nate?

995
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,280
Um, uh, I mean, we were close, we were closer in age.

996
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,680
So he was not as easy to tear, you know, it's, it's only, it's only cool if you're

997
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,840
terrorizing like a literal baby who is totally defenseless and can't fight back.

998
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,240
That's the only way I get off on it.

999
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,240
You know what I mean?

1000
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,240
Based.

1001
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,240
Yeah.

1002
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,240
Hell yeah.

1003
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:28,240
Um, so, you know, being mean is pretty good and I hope people, people do it more.

1004
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,240
Yeah.

1005
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,560
In the comments, be as mean as possible.

1006
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:37,480
If go, go find someone who's defenseless and can't fight back, do something cruel to them

1007
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,560
and then tell us about it in the comments and tell us about how good and how much of

1008
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,720
a big man it made you feel like.

1009
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
Yeah.

1010
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,560
I went into the store and I coughed on everyone and I gave them all COVID they'll show them.

1011
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,560
Yeah.

1012
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,560
Yeah.

1013
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,560
Free speech, baby.

1014
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,360
Uh, fuck yeah.

1015
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,480
Did you watch, um, you watch the, the brownie video, did you watch the, do you watch other

1016
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Jenny Nicholson?

1017
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,480
Have you seen her other stuff?

1018
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,680
I, I just, I, uh, very occasionally it's, it's not usually subject matter I'm interested

1019
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,680
in.

1020
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,160
I watched that one about like the worst reality show ever, which was interesting.

1021
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,000
I like, I really like all of her videos or all the ones where she like talks about a thing.

1022
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Um, she has a new one out about like her trip to go and get a giant spider plush.

1023
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,320
That video is great.

1024
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,320
I love that shit.

1025
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,440
I love, I really like, I like the idea of a giant spider plush.

1026
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,160
It's a lot.

1027
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:37,560
It's, um, it's the one from, um, it's a big giant, like limited edition plush.

1028
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,600
It's the one from Lord of the Rings, I think, or is it a Harry Potter, whatever it's.

1029
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Aragog or Shilob.

1030
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
Yeah.

1031
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,600
It's one of them.

1032
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,600
They're, they're interchangeable.

1033
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,440
They're just big brown spiders.

1034
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,440
Wait, Aragog.

1035
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,440
Aragog is Harry Potter.

1036
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,440
Oh, that's the one in the woods, right?

1037
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,440
Yeah.

1038
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,440
Yeah.

1039
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,440
Yeah.

1040
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,440
Yeah.

1041
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,440
Follow the spiders.

1042
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
I'll, I'll eat you Hagrid raised me that guy.

1043
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
Yes.

1044
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,440
Great.

1045
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,440
Spectacular.

1046
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,440
Uh, that's right.

1047
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,440
That's right.

1048
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
I'm a Harry Potter whiz kid.

1049
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,440
Not a wizard.

1050
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,440
Um, fucking millennial.

1051
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:13,120
I've probably listened to Harry Potter so many times because my mom had the audio books

1052
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,880
or she would, she would borrow the audio books from the library and she would just play them

1053
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,440
in the car like all the time.

1054
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,440
So I've heard every Harry Potter book like multiple times.

1055
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,440
Uh.

1056
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,440
Oh, Harry.

1057
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,440
Oh, cool.

1058
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,440
Uh, Jim Dale had a very weird way of speaking.

1059
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,440
And I remember his like weird inflections and the way he would say, cool.

1060
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,440
I do not know that one.

1061
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,440
I had the Stephen Fry version.

1062
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:48,440
It's so weird that they, they got Jim Dale to do the voice in America and not Stephen

1063
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
Fry.

1064
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,440
Cause like they're both English.

1065
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,440
Why did they get just get another English guy to do it for the American release?

1066
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,440
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

1067
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,440
Maybe they, maybe the producer was like, I want to give two of my friends a paycheck

1068
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,440
or something.

1069
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,440
Maybe.

1070
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,440
Maybe.

1071
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,440
I don't know.

1072
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,440
They're like, oh, Stephen Fry is a homosexual.

1073
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,440
That won't play in America.

1074
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,440
That might actually be it.

1075
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,440
It might actually.

1076
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,440
I don't know.

1077
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,440
Possibly.

1078
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,440
I don't know.

1079
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,440
I think people like Stephen Fry over here.

1080
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,440
Do people know about him from anything?

1081
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,440
I do.

1082
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,440
He might not be as famous over here.

1083
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,440
No, Stephen Fry is a household name.

1084
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,440
Everyone knows that fucking guy.

1085
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,440
That's my opinion.

1086
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,440
Ow.

1087
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,440
Uh, you know what?

1088
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,440
Hey, let me tell you something I'm worried about.

1089
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,440
I'm worried about copyright, not copyright.

1090
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:48,440
I'm worried about a demonetization because in, because, you know, my, my, the biggest

1091
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,440
video I've ever made in terms of reach was Sonichu.

1092
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,440
You know, it's a million views.

1093
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,440
It's incredible.

1094
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,440
Yep.

1095
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,440
It's incredible.

1096
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,440
So I'm, I'm, you know, I'm hoping that a Sonichu 102 gets a lot of views, gets a lot

1097
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,440
of play, you know, makes me some AdSense revenue.

1098
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:09,440
But there are Nazi Sonichus and I do talk about the Nazi Sonichus and I'm worried that

1099
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,440
just saying the word Nazi in the video will get it demonetized.

1100
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,440
Could you not like just look up what words like surely people have figured out by now?

1101
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:27,440
Um, I did, I did Google it and I found on a thing about like which words in the title

1102
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
will get it demonetized.

1103
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,440
But that's not the same.

1104
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,440
Like nobody really knows for sure.

1105
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,440
And like I've heard people, yeah, I've heard people bleep out words like Nazi and stuff

1106
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,440
and in, in, like in the video because they're worried that just saying it in the video will

1107
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
get demonetized.

1108
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,440
So I think it is a thing that happens, but I don't think anyone really understands

1109
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,440
like, well, I think it's kind of random and it would be, it would, it would be very sad.

1110
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,440
I'd be very upset if like I, I, I upload it unlisted.

1111
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,440
It says good for monetization.

1112
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,440
It goes, I put it out, it's out there for a while and then at some point in the future

1113
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,440
it's like no demonetized because you say the word Nazi.

1114
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,440
And I'm like, how could imagine like knowing YouTube that would happen.

1115
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,440
Yeah.

1116
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,440
I think it's better, better to be safe than sorry.

1117
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:23,440
Just get some, some way to explain what word you're saying without saying it.

1118
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,440
Maybe an image on screen, just flash up.

1119
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,440
So that it gets past the sound barrier or whatever they, they call it.

1120
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,440
I would hate to, I would hate to like censor that word for no reason.

1121
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,440
You know, it would be very embarrassing to be like overly cautious about it.

1122
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,440
I just, I just don't want YouTube to fucking not pay me.

1123
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,440
I, I just don't want them to steal my fucking money.

1124
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,440
I don't think it would be too embarrassing.

1125
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,440
I mean, you're taught, you're doing a school lecture about Sonichu.

1126
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,440
Oh, it's already, it's already very funny.

1127
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,440
Like people aren't going to be like, oh my God, this guy has no integrity.

1128
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,440
He censored the word Nazi.

1129
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,440
What a pussy.

1130
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,440
I mean, yeah, but I'm not, I mean, yeah.

1131
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,440
I mean, it's strictly, I'm motivated strictly by money.

1132
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
I'm motivated strictly by self-interest here.

1133
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,440
Yeah, do it.

1134
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,440
I'm not doing, I might, yeah, I might do that.

1135
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Be the, be the based coward that has hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1136
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,440
Be the worthless baby that you want to see in the world.

1137
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,440
Maybe I will be the money baby.

1138
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,440
It would be, it would be incredible.

1139
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,440
It would be incredible if Sonichu wanted to did numbers like the first,

1140
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,440
I'm sure it won't do as, as many numbers as the first one.

1141
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,440
I mean, it took the first one like three years to hit a million.

1142
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,440
Man, if I had two million view videos, I would be set for life.

1143
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,440
I would never have to, I would, I would quit the podcast because I'd be like,

1144
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,440
ah, fuck that.

1145
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,440
No, it's not even worth my time.

1146
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,440
I'm too fancy.

1147
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,440
Oh, then it would just be the give talks about absolutely nothing in particular for an hour.

1148
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,440
What a, what a fucking sucker.

1149
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,440
What a fucking sucker still on the podcast, still doing this shit.

1150
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,440
Still doing the podcast, getting all of the money from the Patreon.

1151
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,440
Give me a, give me a break.

1152
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,440
You got to, you got to fucking, you got to get on my level.

1153
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,440
You got to make a fucking son, just make another son, just,

1154
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,440
just re-upload the Sonichu lecture and get the million views.

1155
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,440
Yeah, just mirror it.

1156
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,440
That's how it works.

1157
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,440
Mirror it.

1158
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,440
Just mirror it.

1159
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,440
Like zoom in on me, the, the, like, like, whenever I'm seen,

1160
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,440
that's like a point to the red arrow point to myself.

1161
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,440
I wrote everything you're saying.

1162
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:44,440
Just, just a download or like screen record the, the, the, the 3D camera version,

1163
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,440
the 360 degree camera version.

1164
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:52,440
But just all the footage is just, just the cameras focused on you.

1165
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,440
But it's the same.

1166
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,440
Yeah.

1167
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,440
Okay.

1168
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,440
So that's the plan.

1169
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,440
That's how I'm going to get the, that's how I'm going to get demonetized on YouTube.

1170
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
It's, it's, it's bullshit.

1171
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,440
It's bullshit that I even have to worry about it.

1172
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:15,440
It's bullshit, yes, but YouTube is no longer like any kind of like prestige platform.

1173
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,440
It's, it's like a, it's like a sludge hut.

1174
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:24,440
It doesn't matter that it's like not like super crisp and clean and perfect in every way.

1175
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,440
It's, it's content.

1176
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,440
People eat it by the bucket load.

1177
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,440
They're not going to worry about it.

1178
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,440
Yeah.

1179
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,440
Yeah.

1180
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,440
Yeah.

1181
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,440
True.

1182
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,440
Man.

1183
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,440
Shit.

1184
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,440
I feel like I had another thing I wanted to bring up, but it's gone.

1185
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,440
La-Mow.

1186
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,440
La-Mow.

1187
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,440
Um, we can go to voicemails.

1188
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,440
We've been going for an hour.

1189
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,440
Uh, yeah.

1190
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,440
Okay.

1191
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,440
Did you, did you said she was going to jump in?

1192
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,440
Yeah.

1193
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,440
Did you was in the chat.

1194
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,440
I was kind of, but that was like 45 minutes ago.

1195
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,440
I was kind of hoping she would jump in and then I would talk to her about gender stuff.

1196
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,440
And that would be like some sort of a dialogue, a conversation, but she, she was eating something.

1197
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,440
And how long does it take to fucking eat brunch?

1198
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
Also, who eats brunch?

1199
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,440
And also it's 3pm.

1200
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,440
It's too late for brunch.

1201
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,440
Everything's wrong.

1202
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,440
Yeah.

1203
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,440
You get linear with what I'm seeing here this time.

1204
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,440
Yeah.

1205
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,440
It's fucked up.

1206
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,440
It's fucked up.

1207
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,440
Second brunch fist.

1208
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,440
Uh, yeah.

1209
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,440
Let's, let's, oh, I need to open up the, let's fucking do it.

1210
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:32,440
Speak pipe.com slash, uh, the procrastinators.

1211
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,440
Is it that simple?

1212
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,440
Um, I mean, I just, I'm logged in.

1213
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,440
No, I mean for the viewers.

1214
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,440
So if you want to post your voicemail, where do they go?

1215
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,440
Oh, PCP voicemail.

1216
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,440
That's what it is.

1217
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,440
Speak pipe.com slash PCP voicemail, send in your voicemails and we'll listen to all of

1218
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,440
them and we'll cringe if it's cringe and we'll base if it's based.

1219
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,440
We'll dab of its base and we'll thrash of its cringe.

1220
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,440
That's my promise to you.

1221
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,440
The viewer.

1222
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,440
Okay.

1223
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,440
You got it.

1224
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,440
You looking at them?

1225
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,440
Yep.

1226
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,440
All right.

1227
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,440
So first one.

1228
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,440
First up.

1229
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,440
David from Ohio.

1230
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,440
Three, two, one, go.

1231
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,440
Hello, procrastinators.

1232
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,440
My name is David.

1233
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,440
I'm six years old and I'm from.

1234
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
Ohio.

1235
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
Ohio.

1236
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:31,440
Now there's, there's only two things I love in life and that's apple juice and Jake Paul.

1237
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:39,440
So the other day I asked my mom to get me some Jake Paul merch, but then my, my, my stupid

1238
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,440
older brother, Timothy told her, no, Jake Paul's bad.

1239
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,440
And so now my mom won't get me any Jake Paul merch.

1240
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:54,440
So my, my question is to the procrastinators is what is their opinion on the aggressive

1241
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:01,440
marketing towards children that most upper echelon YouTube channels have taken in recent

1242
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,440
years like Jake Paul with their marketing tactics towards children.

1243
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,440
Thank you guys.

1244
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,440
Okay.

1245
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,440
Okay.

1246
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,440
Good question actually, but I think stick to the apple juice kid.

1247
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,440
I think the answer is pretty simple.

1248
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,440
YouTube.

1249
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:25,440
I mean, children on YouTube have always been like a massively numerous like viewer base

1250
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,440
and therefore they also, they watch ads because they're stupid.

1251
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:36,440
And so it's also extremely lucrative for, for YouTube is in general to appeal to kids

1252
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,440
in some way.

1253
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,440
Yeah.

1254
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,440
Like like game theory and stuff.

1255
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,440
Kids are, kids are easy, easily impressionable.

1256
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,440
They're easy to convince to do things.

1257
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:52,440
But I think because the YouTube has been like sued or something, I forget exactly what

1258
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:57,440
the terminology was, but they, they're not allowed to advertise to children anymore.

1259
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:03,440
So merchandise is the next best thing to get the children's money is, is my thoughts.

1260
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,440
Are they not allowed to advertise to children?

1261
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,440
That doesn't seem like an enforceable rule.

1262
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,440
Well, do you not remember the whole thing?

1263
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,440
It was like.

1264
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,440
No, I remember the whole thing about like, is this video appropriate for children?

1265
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,440
And you have to, yeah.

1266
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,440
I mean, it's quote unquote, not enforceable.

1267
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,440
YouTube just makes it so that you can't monetize it.

1268
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,440
If it's, you have to say whether it's for kids or not.

1269
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:32,440
And if it's like for kids, you cannot monetize it whatsoever.

1270
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,440
Wait, really?

1271
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,440
That's, that's, that's the point.

1272
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,440
Oh my God.

1273
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,440
Yeah.

1274
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,440
That's the system they came up with.

1275
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:46,440
And the idea is if you lie about that, if you have videos that are marked as not for kids,

1276
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:53,440
if you have them, yeah, marked as not for kids, but you are clearly getting a child audience on those videos.

1277
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:00,440
I guess I don't know how they would like tell whether you are deliberately being child friendly or not.

1278
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:07,440
I think they, they had a weird list of parameters like bright colors, appealing visuals, like stuff like that.

1279
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,440
So stupid.

1280
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,440
So stupid.

1281
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:15,440
But if they decide that you are breaking the rules, they can take your channel down or something.

1282
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,440
And that was a big controversy for a while.

1283
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,440
But I don't think anyone has been affected by it at this point.

1284
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:28,440
I've seen some people have their videos demonetized because they were marked as like child friendly.

1285
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,440
I've seen some people complain about that on Twitter or whatever.

1286
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,440
So it's like you, you can't appeal to children anymore.

1287
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,440
Even though you might, you may just happen to and, you know, whatever.

1288
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:46,440
But now I think merchandise is like the way to get the children to spend money.

1289
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,440
I mean, I mean, they're still stupid.

1290
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:53,440
Jake Paul was aggressively marketing his merchandise before that happened.

1291
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,440
I think it was just like a natural progression of like, well, if kids are my audience,

1292
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:03,440
because it's the most lucrative thing to be kids also want things.

1293
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,440
And they say, mommy, daddy, can I have this please?

1294
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,440
And parents are like, fine, I don't care.

1295
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,440
I don't like you.

1296
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,440
I don't know.

1297
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,440
I mean, I think it's bad.

1298
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:23,440
Like, I think it's bad that like kids are being aggressively marketed to, but like, that's nothing new.

1299
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,440
Like that's just, that's just capitalism.

1300
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,440
That's just like in a world where you want to make as much money as possible.

1301
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:39,440
Children are like a vulnerable market that is like easily swayed and easily convinced to do the things that you want them to do.

1302
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,440
So like, I don't know, it's bad, but like, what are you going to do about it?

1303
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:59,440
It really is funny to think that like the natural reflex of a child to cry when they are upset is a lot of the reason that merchandise even exists.

1304
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,440
What do you mean?

1305
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:07,440
Because parents don't like to have to listen to their child whining so they will cave in.

1306
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,440
That's the whole reason selling things to children works because they don't have money, but they can cry.

1307
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,440
And their parents are like, I don't want to listen to that shit.

1308
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,440
I'll buy you the fucking thing.

1309
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:21,440
And that like that desperation from all the parents is the thing that is is feeding the economy.

1310
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,440
It's like parents being tired.

1311
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,440
That's the that's the that's the money maker.

1312
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,440
I guess that's probably part of it.

1313
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,440
Yeah, true, true.

1314
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,440
Uh, uh, fucking.

1315
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,440
I don't know.

1316
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,440
Merchandising is bad.

1317
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,440
Jake Paul is bad.

1318
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,440
The kids are stupid.

1319
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,440
Apple juice is good.

1320
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,440
Stick to the apple juice.

1321
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,440
That's my opinion on on that.

1322
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,440
Next one.

1323
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,440
Yep.

1324
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,440
Okay.

1325
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,440
Aged eggnog.

1326
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,440
Three, two, one, go.

1327
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,440
Yo, what's up?

1328
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,440
It's me.

1329
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,440
Aged eggnog.

1330
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,440
So like y'all, I've got a shitty podcast with a weird community around it.

1331
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,440
And I recently made some aged eggnog for Christmas.

1332
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,440
Put it in a bunch of Mason jars.

1333
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:16,440
And the first thing I did, what happened when I posted is one guy in my discord saying, Hey, yo, dude, that's like, come, I drink nine jars of your comb.

1334
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:21,440
So yeah, what do you do when you're confronted with something like this?

1335
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,440
Like, should I ignore it?

1336
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,440
Is it good to embrace it?

1337
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,440
It's pretty fucking weird.

1338
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,440
I kind of hate it.

1339
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,440
Thanks.

1340
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,440
What the fuck?

1341
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:35,440
I mean, if it's pretty fucking weird and you kind of hate it, tell him, well, actually, I guess the answer is a little nuanced.

1342
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,440
Try to ignore it.

1343
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,440
Don't encourage it for sure.

1344
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,440
I'm confused.

1345
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:51,440
Is the problem that this guy is like, is he like continually harassing you with like that aged eggnog looks like, come, I want to drink the come.

1346
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,440
Is that it?

1347
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,440
Because like, this seems like something someone would say one time and like that would be it.

1348
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:04,440
If they keep bringing it up, if they keep bringing it up, I don't know why that's weird and they should be banned.

1349
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:11,440
Yeah, if it's just one off comment and you don't want to encourage more of them, just don't respond, I guess.

1350
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:17,440
Yeah, which you've already failed at because you made this voicemail.

1351
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:23,440
But aged eggnog, that's not real, right?

1352
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,440
Like, that's a joke, right?

1353
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,440
Like, you don't age eggnog.

1354
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,440
I don't even know what eggnog is.

1355
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,440
Is it like an alcoholic drink?

1356
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,440
You fuck.

1357
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,440
You don't know eggnog?

1358
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,440
No, it's not a thing over here really.

1359
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,440
You stupid motherfucker.

1360
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:46,440
The first time I heard about it was reading a Simpsons comic and I was like, why would you drink eggs that doesn't make, that's disgusting.

1361
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,440
That's fucked up. This is fucked up.

1362
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,440
What are you drinking eggs for?

1363
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,440
Eggnog, you monster, you're a criminal.

1364
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,440
Eggnog is, it's a holiday drink.

1365
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:07,440
It has like egg yolks and cream and I don't know, it's like some spices like nutmeg, I think, is the thing that gives it its flavor.

1366
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,440
I love eggnog.

1367
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,440
Eggnog is great.

1368
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,440
You can put rum in it.

1369
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,440
Sometimes you put rum in it and it's hard eggnog, but you don't have to.

1370
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:19,440
And I don't think you age it because I think it would just turn into nutmeg flavored cheese.

1371
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,440
So this has to be a meme.

1372
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,440
Stop making aged eggnog.

1373
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,440
It's fucked up.

1374
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,440
It's unacceptable.

1375
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,440
That's what I have to say about it.

1376
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,440
Maybe you should try eggnog.

1377
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,440
It's really good.

1378
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,440
I love it.

1379
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,440
My favorite part of the holidays.

1380
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,440
Maybe I should come over to Boston for Christmas.

1381
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,440
Fuck.

1382
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,440
Yes.

1383
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,440
The flu season and I'll catch COVID for sure.

1384
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,440
It's like absolute guarantee.

1385
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:54,440
Yeah, unironically do it based.

1386
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,440
Yeah, come do American Christmas.

1387
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,440
Yeah, fuck my own family.

1388
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,440
You'll never go back to England.

1389
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,440
You'll see the air of your ways.

1390
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,440
Don't have eggnog, do in Brexit.

1391
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,440
Nothing's good.

1392
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,440
Yeah, I'll get out while I can.

1393
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,440
Yeah.

1394
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,440
Next one.

1395
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,440
Rumpelpack 64.

1396
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,440
Three, two, one, go.

1397
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,440
Hey, Ben.

1398
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,440
Yeah.

1399
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,440
Well.

1400
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,440
Okay.

1401
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,440
I think he got us.

1402
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,440
Is there is there going to be more?

1403
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,440
Wait, there's 10 more.

1404
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,440
There's six more seconds.

1405
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,440
I can't believe it.

1406
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,440
I can't believe I've been had.

1407
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,440
He got us.

1408
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,440
I can't believe he would waste 23 seconds of his life

1409
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,440
just to just to get us.

1410
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,440
I can't believe I fell for it.

1411
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,440
I feel owned right now.

1412
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,440
I should have seen it coming.

1413
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,440
I want to know what Rumpelpack 64 meant.

1414
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,440
What is Rumpelpack 64?

1415
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,440
We'll never know.

1416
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,440
God damn.

1417
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,440
Jesus Christ.

1418
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,440
Um.

1419
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,440
Hey.

1420
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,440
Hey.

1421
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,440
Before we before we do the next one.

1422
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,440
Uh.

1423
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,440
Yeah.

1424
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,440
Did you happen to see.

1425
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,440
Did you happen to see somebody posted a.

1426
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,440
Somebody like, like composed.

1427
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,440
A song.

1428
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,440
I did.

1429
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,440
I saw.

1430
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,440
I saw the thing that didn't work in the voicemail.

1431
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,440
And he posted it on another thing.

1432
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,440
It was the dream thing.

1433
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,440
Yes.

1434
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,440
I will post.

1435
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,440
I'll link in the description.

1436
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,440
Link in the description.

1437
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,440
Andrew Oaks.

1438
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,440
Composed.

1439
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,440
A.

1440
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,440
My version of my dream song.

1441
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,440
It's pretty cool.

1442
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,440
It's, it's, it's nice.

1443
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,440
It's got bells and whistles.

1444
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,440
I think he did the.

1445
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,440
Some of the melody to the way you sang.

1446
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,440
That thing you sang.

1447
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,440
I think.

1448
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,440
Yeah.

1449
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,440
Yeah.

1450
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,440
That's cool.

1451
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,440
I.

1452
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,440
Okay.

1453
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,440
Link in the description.

1454
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,440
Check it out.

1455
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,440
It's good.

1456
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
It's funny.

1457
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,440
Next one.

1458
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,440
What's.

1459
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Soup.

1460
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,440
But like the.

1461
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,440
The SO is in parentheses.

1462
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,440
So it's like what's so up.

1463
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,440
It's two seconds long.

1464
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,440
Okay.

1465
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,440
Two seconds long.

1466
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,440
Three, two, one.

1467
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,440
Go.

1468
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,440
What's soup.

1469
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,440
Nice.

1470
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,440
Next one.

1471
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,440
You want to answer the question.

1472
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,440
Do you have a response?

1473
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,440
It's wet vegetables.

1474
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,440
I guess.

1475
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,440
Yeah.

1476
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,440
True.

1477
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,440
True that.

1478
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,440
Next up.

1479
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,440
Fuck voicemail.

1480
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,440
God.

1481
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,440
In quotation marks.

1482
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,440
Three, two, one.

1483
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,440
Go.

1484
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,440
Hey voicemail.

1485
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,440
Faggot.

1486
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,440
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1487
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,440
Call up to you.

1488
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:41,440
You submit a bunch of shitty goddamn voicemails about fucking persona and other shit.

1489
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,440
Fucking die.

1490
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,440
I don't want to hear your fucking voice on the goddamn voicemails ever again.

1491
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,440
You son of a bitch.

1492
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,440
You know.

1493
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,440
He makes the good point.

1494
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,440
He makes a compelling argument.

1495
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,440
I wasn't quite with him until he screeched at the end there.

1496
01:14:58,440 --> 01:14:59,440
Yeah.

1497
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,440
I was like, I'm not entirely convinced.

1498
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:05,440
But then, but then I was convinced.

1499
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:13,440
Never, never, ever send us a voicemail about persona five ever again.

1500
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,440
None of us have ever even seen persona five.

1501
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,440
That will get you fucking banned.

1502
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,440
My friends.

1503
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,440
I promise.

1504
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,440
Voicemail God.

1505
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,440
I don't know.

1506
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,440
Fuck you.

1507
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,440
I guess.

1508
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,440
Next.

1509
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,440
Next one is a bullshit, but not really.

1510
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,440
Wink.

1511
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,440
Three, two, one.

1512
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,440
Go.

1513
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,440
Howdy.

1514
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,440
What do y'all think about the ration?

1515
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,440
Do you know what the rational male is?

1516
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,440
I don't.

1517
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:49,440
But I can assume if he's talking about pickup artists stuff, then it is a mode of thinking

1518
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,440
that is like, I am a man.

1519
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,440
And this is my how I conduct myself in order to be a good man.

1520
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,440
I don't really know anything about it.

1521
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,440
So I can't really call it.

1522
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,440
Oh, it's a, it's a book.

1523
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,440
The rational male is a book.

1524
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,440
Let's see if I can find a synopsis.

1525
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:11,440
The rational male is about being as most based as possible and least cringe as possible.

1526
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:17,440
In this 10 step guide, you will learn how to punch down.

1527

You will learn how to.

1528
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:26,440
The rational male is a, is a rational and pragmatic approach to intergender dynamics and the social

1529
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,440
and psychological underpinnings of intergender relations.

1563
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,600
I can't make a judgment call yet.

1564
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:20,160
I used to read stuff like this and I and like I'm all for I'm all for like

1565
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:27,840
people like writing honestly about like what they think is up with like men and women and stuff

1566
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:33,680
like like I'm all for like you know go discuss that discuss like how they interact with each other

1567
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:39,360
discuss like you know what is successful and what is not successful that's that's all fine but like

1568
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:47,520
in hindsight a lot of this stuff is very is very like um uh uh uh evolutionary biology in

1569
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:54,960
like a pseudo scientific way a lot of this is very like presumes it presumes a lot about like

1570
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:00,480
what is natural that is like not really based on it there's a lot of like there's a lot of um

1571
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:07,120
ideology do you think it's like mostly anecdotal sort of stuff like from what a person can see

1572
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,480
this is the the information they've gleaned as to how generally things work there's I think there's

1573
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:19,440
a lot of like hidden ideology under the surface of a lot of this kind of writing that is that I

1574
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:25,440
don't necessarily agree with there's a lot of presumptions about yeah like what it is to be male

1575
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:37,200
or female or whatever um I'm you know uh I guess I I don't like fully hate this kind of stuff I

1576
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:43,040
don't think this stuff should be banned or anything but I would like read it with skepticism read it

1577
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:49,200
with a healthy grain of salt question question what is the thinking behind a lot of it is how I feel

1578
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:58,800
about it now yeah yeah so that's how I feel it's like it's stupid bad voicemail no not really

1579
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:04,880
no not really it's good thank you thank you for your call uh uh wink next one is uh ranting raw

1580
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:15,040
wool three two one go do you like croutons on your salad no stop it croutons don't belong in salad

1581
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:21,520
right that shit is designed to be eaten you spear all your shit with a fork and you just like

1582
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:27,120
skewer everything you can't skewer a crouton because that shit is hard it's like yeah the

1583
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:32,640
opposite texture of everything you want on the salad and it's like the only way you can eat it

1584
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,680
is either you just like scoop that shit into your mouth like a barbarian or you scoop it up with your

1585
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:42,400
fork but you don't scoop shit with your fork the fork is there to spear shit you're not eating

1586
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:48,960
your salad with a spoon so croutons are just they don't belong in fucking salad Jesus fucking

1587
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:55,520
if you spear if you spear some lettuce with a fork then you have a big leaf on your fork

1588
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:01,840
and the crouton can just kind of be like held on the leaf you don't need to individually spear

1589
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:09,040
the the crouton the crouton can just kind of be like caught up in the fork load of stuff

1590
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,400
it's fine i like croutons they're good i've never had a crouton on a salad i think i've seen them

1591
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,400
but like i think of croutons as a soup thing oh weird i think of them as a salad thing

1592
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:28,000
do people put croutons in soup yeah like a soup or like a stew or something

1593
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:34,160
actually maybe not a stew i guess i could see it they sort of soak up the the moisture and they

1594
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:37,680
they lose their crunch but not too much of the crouton you gotta eat it at a certain time it's

1595
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:46,240
like cereal you can't let it get too soggy did you did you listen to the ben cast voicemail

1596
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:52,960
anarchy oh i didn't i heard about the things that that happened in it with there was a lot of salad

1597
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:58,080
a lot of salad questions a lot of salad questions hopefully we've um i had thought that we had

1598
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:03,840
solved all our salad problems but i guess there are some dissenters out there uh still got a bone

1599
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:13,600
to pick an axe to grind a fork to skewer uh next one do wane sua three two one go

1600
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:24,640
hey pcp just wanted to say i appreciate everything you do i think it's great yeah especially uh

1601
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:30,880
recently thank you i've been helping me through these tough times um and so one thing that resonated

1602
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:38,480
with me a lot was i guess gib's idea about having to engage with the cringe to uh you know understand

1603
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:45,440
the the based reality beneath it um so i just i guess i had a question like how important do

1604
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:51,920
you think it is to recognize the cringe within yourself you know either in the past or in certain

1605
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:57,680
aspects of yourself that that you know might be cringe in some ways but they are like they make

1606
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:03,200
up what you are so you just got to roll with it i don't know just a thought but keep up the good

1607
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:13,200
word guys anyway um i i would say that it's it's really just like a terminology is like funny

1608
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:21,200
right but the the the point of that is is sort of to not take yourself too seriously if you find

1609
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:26,800
the cringe things about yourself and it's just learning to laugh and learning to like

1610
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:33,280
self-deprecate and it being okay like nobody's perfect i don't think you can be based unless

1611
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:40,240
you understand your own yeah like like there's nothing more like and i like super cringe than

1612
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:48,480
someone who is terrified of like a really innocuous fact getting out into the public and they're

1613
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:54,000
trying to like cover it up it's like it doesn't really you don't have to like spill the beans on

1614
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,920
everything you've ever done that is stupid but if you have like things that are like pretty obvious

1615
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,000
and you accept them and laugh about them then you're laughing with everyone else and it's not

1616
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:12,800
cringe it's based absolutely 100 agree uh so yeah that's it how important is it to recognize your

1617
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:21,680
own cringe very it's true it's critical uh it's it's gender critical it's it's it's jk rallying

1618
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:31,280

for you to fuck each other instead of me um makes me feel bad uh sexually that's cuckledry which i

1647
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:09,040
think is illegal um okay so that's fine that's my opinion about uh this so that's so in short

1648
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:17,440
that's why i joined antifa um po next up po po dead cast question mark uh three two one go is the

1649
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:27,280
body cast dead i think you already answered this one yes it's not dead um due to like nate moving

1650
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:32,800
and just various things it was just gone for a while uh basically an entire month i think

1651
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:41,520
almost an entire month but now we're we're back we're gonna do this base uh next one property

1652
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:49,040
taxes are immoral three two one go property taxes are the most immoral form of taxation that exists

1653
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:54,480
as they reduce the population to nothing more than serfs who can never truly own land and instead

1654
01:27:54,480 --> 01:28:04,160
are forced to simply rent it from the government discuss i agree do you agree do you think it's

1655
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:12,880
the most immoral form of taxation uh i mean i was that what he said did you say the most um i think

1656
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:20,720
he said the most well i don't know whether but you agree that they're bad yeah um i don't know

1657
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:26,320
i feel like well i guess it depends on the property but you know what you know what i think i feel

1658
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:33,120
like people should be able to to own land that they pay for part of me is thinking like okay

1659
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:41,440
but owning land like the like land is a means of production in a way right like if you own land

1660
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:48,640
you should theoretically be doing something with it should be using it for something um and they're

1661
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:53,680
talking about land or just a building like i'm thinking of houses as land i'm making maybe that

1662
01:28:53,680 --> 01:29:00,960
doesn't count well i think i think the property tax is specifically on the land i think that's the

1663
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:07,200
property and like a house is just something that may or may not exist on the property it might raise

1664
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:12,800
the value of the property and if i'm not exactly sure how it works i guess you know if you're like

1665
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,760
a fucking industrial producer or whatever and you own like a lot of land and you have like you own

1666
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,320
like a factory or you're like you're like a farmer you own like tons of land you have like a big old

1667
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:26,880
fucking fields and stuff and you're producing and you it's your livelihood it's your it's the means

1668
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:32,160
of production i feel like you should be taxed on that i guess i would agree there's like cars

1669
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:38,320
going crazy and honking out my window i don't know if you can hear it i can lol uh what is what is

1670
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:46,480
what is going on oh it's just somebody's alarm okay whatever um i would agree that i think it's

1671
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:52,720
kind of bullshit that you're taxed on land that is you just live on i guess i would say that there

1672
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:58,160
should probably be like a threshold and it's like you can own up to this much land you know like

1673
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:03,600
enough land for a person to live on and like beyond that you should be taxed on it i guess i

1674
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:10,880
guess i would say that it would be better like that i'm so sorry for this fucking horn um what do

1675
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:18,560
you think about that yeah i mean i haven't really i'm not like um well versed on on taxes and and

1676
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:24,080
you know like i just hear that the the idea of money being taken from the by the government i'm

1677
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:30,960
like no that's why i just generally dislike that but i understand that they need taxes in like a

1678
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:36,960
hypothetical situation where like i don't know a bunch of guys own like an unbelievably a large

1679
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:42,560
amount of land of a country and they just decide to not do anything with it and they could be farming

1680
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:48,240
they could be creating resources for the people to to live off of but they just decide to just

1681
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:55,360
not do that and then the the country just has no space left to make farms then it's like that's

1682
01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:02,480
unfair they clearly need to to get some use out of that land i like um i like the government

1683
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:10,160
taking money from oh my god it just keeps going what is what is wrong with you what is fucking

1684
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:17,280
wrong with you just throw rocks at it they're they're driving away they're driving away with

1685
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:22,160
their alarms still going it sounds like they're it's not the owner of the car is driving away if

1686
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:30,400
that's the case oh my god did i just witness a jacking i mean i don't know i don't know

1687
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,040
dude what's the number plate say it out loud i don't know it's gone i can't see it anymore

1688
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:43,520
it went behind a tree very strange um okay all right um i like the government taking money

1689
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:49,600
from people who are making a ton of money off of stuff i don't like the government taking money

1690
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:55,040
from people who are just trying who are just trying to live and so i agree i do think it's

1691
01:31:55,040 --> 01:32:00,400
kind of bullshit that like if you don't own a property you know you you rent you rent a property

1692
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:05,440
you're paying your landlord whatever but even if you buy the property you still have to pay

1693
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,920
what is effectively a kind of rent yeah to the government just to like live in a house that you

1694
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:16,480
own i do think that's bullshit um you should you should you should you should be like especially

1695
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:21,520
if you fucking pay the money i mean i think that housing is a human right and should be free uh

1696
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:27,120
but if we're not gonna do that i think if you fucking buy it you shouldn't have to pay if it's

1697
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:31,520
just for you to live on if you're just trying to do your thing and you're not like you're not using

1698
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,680
it to like you're not use it's not the means of production that you're running a business or whatever

1699
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:41,840
you're not using it for like industrial purposes you only own as much as you need to to live yeah

1700
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:47,280
no i don't think you should be taxed on that that's bullshit it is bullshit i agree 100 uh unless

1701
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:52,320
if you're a landlord you should be taxed on it uh but maybe you should just be taxed maybe it makes

1702
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:57,600
more sense to just be taxed on your fucking rent revenue that you're making from the people that are

1703
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:03,360
you're renting it to i don't know uh or wait or is that bad because then that would incentivize you

1704
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:09,680
to raise your rent so maybe that would be a bad tax maybe you should just be uh oh whatever the

1705
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:16,240
landlords not pay tax already they must i mean they must pay tax i mean they must pay the property

1706
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:23,760
tax and they must pay the tax on their income which they get from renting so yes i'm i should

1707
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:31,120
they be taxed more i don't know taxing the more we just raise rent uh oh fuck man what a sticky

1708
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,760
what a sticky wicked part i don't know what to do i don't know i don't know how to solve this

1709
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:42,880
problem short of just abolishing landlords which is what we should do lament yeah um but i guess

1710
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,480
okay i think i've come down on the side of yes property tax is bad

1711
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:52,480
unless you have a lot lament okay whatever i've talked enough about this uh next one

1743
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:46,080
getting tons of them we would probably have to stop playing yeah but whatever as a rule they're okay

1744
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:53,200
an occasional like incomprehensible wild drunk something or other would be like fun just because

1745
01:37:53,200 --> 01:38:02,080
we don't know what's happening but not all the time mm-hmm agree hard agree uh next one

1746
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:07,840
poochie is hungry for beef oh wait wait what do you you said what do you think about being drunk

1747
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,720
oh um when i do it i like it and then other times i'm like that was a mistake

1748
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,560
and i don't like it like i'm hung over now and i wish that i wasn't so it was a bad idea

1749
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:28,400
very very bad idea don't don't do it kids it's wrong and it's a sin god is watching

1750
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:37,040
uh anyway what do you think about being drunk um i think that i can avoid it pretty easily and

1751
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:46,320
i enjoy one beer occasionally i just be just a little bit going when when i drink i usually i'm

1752
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:53,120
just like i mean i'm doing it i might as well go for it and then i fucking go for it bro if you if

1753
01:38:53,120 --> 01:39:00,880
you go for it every time then you'll run out of alcohol it's true i drank the whole i drank the

1754
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:07,600
whole case i had drank the whole case of hard seltzer so you're you're not wrong um uh i don't

1755
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:14,320

1758
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:33,200
i wouldn't do it regularly no it seems like a really stupid idea that idiots would do yes

1759
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:42,080
that's why i do it ooh a man um uh yeah you know i feel like i feel like um i didn't use to be

1761
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:55,520

1762
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,960
become more nihilistic and just like ah fuck it you know nothing matters uh uh just just

1763
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:09,040
fucking down it just fucking lose yourself in the moment uh and uh and that's and that's why

1764

1772
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:06,960
the people are starting to revolt against the voicemail hierarchy they're going crazy down there

1773
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,280
this is what happens when i when i declare anarchy it becomes it becomes open it's it's open

1774
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:21,360
warfare it's it's house to house warfare um and i'm i'm i'm okay with it i'm here for it uh next

1775
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:31,440
one the real reason piracy is bad apab three two one go it's like i was listening to this

1776
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:37,200
latest episode of the pcp and this guy calls in with a voicemail about how piracy is bad because

1777
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:44,720
it's illegal but but but but but see here's the thing right he has a point but it's not because

1778
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:54,880
it's illegal well it's like like pick any piece of media right uh like just on my shelf we're on

1779
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:02,800
my bookshelf right here that i'm looking at right now uh uh mostly harmless by douglas adams that's

1780
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:12,320
the pirates are the bad guys in that like in in all media that where pirates exist uh like pirates

1781
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:22,000
of the caribbean and uh like jack sparrow is the good guy assassins creed for one piece pirates

1782
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:31,040
bad guys all of them what is this guys it's bad i don't know if this is a parody it's it's a joke

1783
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:38,000
it's just like very badly delivered i don't under yeah okay well that was a waste of a minute in a

1784
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:47,120
second all pirates are bad i think is the acronym he's going for definitely um that sucks die voice

1785
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:53,840
jail i think i'm i'm thinking i'm thinking apab do we want to put apab and voice jail yeah it was

1786
01:42:53,840 --> 01:43:01,040
terrible apab we gotta we gotta show like like make an example of someone occasionally yeah we

1787
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:06,800
gotta make an example of someone speaking out against crime by putting him in jail that's what's

1788
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:12,960
gets you fucking locked you're locked up apab you're done you're out of here the pirates have the

1789
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:21,680
access to the the penal institutions everything flips the pirates pirates have skeleton keys

1790
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:26,400
that could unlock your jail your cell door but because you spoke out against them they won't

1791
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:33,200
use it to get you out so you know i hope you've learned a valuable lesson here today uh uh

1792

1804
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:11,200
all right three two one go hi pancakes here listen before we start ben we worry about you yeah we

1805
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:19,440
worry about your safety that's right all right this whole drinking thing you know it hurts uh the

1806
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:25,280
children think about the children ben do you ever think about them i don't think so i don't i'm sorry

1807
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:31,360
made threats to you to people even me i mean look at this evidence

1808
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:41,600
however scared you are you should be more scared because pancakes the thing about drunk ben is that

1809
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:55,040
i promise that i will come to your house no and uh eliminate you was that me i rest my

1810
01:45:55,040 --> 01:46:00,960
sounded like it it sounded like munchie i thought it sounded like munchie too but i think it was me

1811
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:08,320
and i don't know why i said that i think it must have been another time that i got drunk and munchie

1812
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:14,160
asked me about pancakes and i don't know why he would do such a thing but it's the only thing that

1813
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:21,760
makes sense but i don't know i kind of think that was a little based of me honestly making threats

1814
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:28,720
i kind of think making threats is cool now death threats included especially i mean if you're

1815
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:34,400
you're gonna if you're gonna be threatening you might as well go all the way with it why why half

1816
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:40,240
acid i'm gonna break your leg say we'll half the way no it's just it's just like drinking if you're

1817
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:44,080
gonna drink your elbow if you're gonna drink anything you should drink it all and if you're

1818
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:51,680
gonna injure someone you should completely you should injure them 100% onto death why why do any

1819
01:46:51,680 --> 01:47:00,400
less uh is drunk ben based give drunk but come on he's pretty big he's pretty big i mean i have

1820
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:06,320
not seen drunk ben in person enough i want to see drunk ben in person i think i've seen you

1821
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:13,600
tipsy but not like fucking like dead like i was pretty drunk i was pretty drunk at radcon the

1822
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:20,400
first time that first night i was pretty you were pretty drunk that was pretty but but i feel like

1823
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:27,040
nate was doing worse than you at the end during that first stream uh yeah i think that's true i

1824
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:31,680
think that's true i did have to throw up though i mean there's that that famous gift of you

1825
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:37,760
like okay explaining something explaining something to to nate who is sitting there like

1826
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:46,320
no energy and like completely dead eyes like uh and i'm like spazzing out and like yeah that was

1827
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:53,200
late into the night i think nate was done he didn't he seemed like he didn't he doesn't seem drunk

1828
01:47:53,200 --> 01:48:00,080
in that gift he's just kind of sitting there just like it was the aftermath of all that right um

1829
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:07,120
okay well it's an open question as to whether drunk ben is based lamal uh next up next up give it to

1830
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:14,240
me gay three two one go hi it is my goal to deal better with interrupting and getting interrupted

1831
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:18,320
so suppose we're in a social or political conversation do you have a morality on talking

1832
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,920
over someone in one of these situations which would be satisfied about your ability to get

1833
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:25,920
your words across and do you ever seize back the topic after someone interrupted you how do

1834
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:29,760
you do that respectfully i've learned to never interrupt i always let others finish also when

1835
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,600
they're interrupting me now i never tell stories and also confuse people who thought i was finished

1836
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:44,800
talking uh i i know this feel um sometimes i mean historically on the pcp i have started a story

1837
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:51,680
and been interrupted by somebody thinking that my my point was uh over and that i didn't have

1838
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:57,120
anything more to say and i couldn't wrestle wrestle back the conversation to to finish my point

1839
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:01,440
occasionally when i got the chance i just forgot what i was gonna say and it sucks

1840
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:10,240
unacceptable unacceptable someone should be punished for that yeah so uh i think in in a real

1841
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:18,720
person real life conversation um you could use body language uh a little easier to like make it

1842
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:25,040
clear that you you're not done or like i don't i don't think saying excuse me i wasn't finished

1843
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:32,160
that's that's like sort of brings the room down yeah i think what you should try to do is if people

1844
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:39,360
are trying to interrupt you you you like jump into the headline of your next point like if you're

1845
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,760
trying to set something up if and they're not letting you set it up just go straight into the

1846
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:49,760
weird thing that is the main point and and and then they'll be like wait what and then you can explain

1847
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:56,960
afterwards if somebody explain the setup after the the punch if somebody interrupts you then like

1848
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:05,200
it's automatically okay for you to interrupt them back um i i if if they sort of like psych you out

1849
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:10,080
like you're talking they start talking and you continue talking and you both are talking at

1850
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:14,240
the same time and you're sort of playing chicken like who's gonna stop and let the other person

1851
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:19,120
speak first i think if you were the one talking already you're allowed to to snap and say shut

1852
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:27,360
the fuck up i'm speaking yeah yeah uh i'm okay i'm not i'm not a opposed to interrupting all the

1853
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:34,400
time i think if you like if you need okay if you're saying something and then someone else changes

1854
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:38,560
the topic and you weren't done then i think it's okay to interrupt them to bring it back to what

1855
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:44,960
you were gonna say i think that if someone is talking about something and you feel like you

1856
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:52,320
have a really important point to me i think you know it's it's uh it's like it's bad form to interrupt

1857
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:56,880
but i think if your point is actually good and relevant and like you need to say it right then

1858
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:02,480
i think it can be okay to interrupt them and just like say what you want to say and and if it if it

1859
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:07,600
is a good point then it justifies itself so it's kind of gamble it's a gamble if you make a bad point

1860
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:16,080
that way then you look like an asshole i've noticed ben your way of doing that um uh is is to to repeat

1861
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:22,640
the thing you had just been interrupted with louder really and just repeat it until you're

1862
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:26,640
sure that you have the room again and then you continue the sentence because it's sort of like

1863
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:32,080
annoying to hear but but just but just but just but just but just but just but just and and then

1864
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:36,640
like you're all right fine i'll let you finish your thing you're clearly trying to say a thing

1865
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:41,920
wait that's that's me i'm saying but just but just but just um i mean everybody does that to some

1866
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:48,320
extent but like it is yeah i've noticed that you do it as well uh that's probably true that's probably

1867
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:55,200
true uh when it when it comes to like a nate versus you thing you know you need to finish your point

1868
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:02,720
you haven't finished it yet you you you do that i feel like nate interrupts me and i and i interrupt

1869
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:09,040
him back and because of that people say that like we both are interrupted i don't think i'm that

1870
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:13,200
interrupted i think i'm pretty good about letting people talk it's only when i get interrupted

1871
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,840
or i i think i think that it's only when i get interrupted that i become interrupted back but i

1872
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:24,080
don't know i i i don't think it's necessarily always that i think it's just when you haven't

1873
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:29,920
quite got to the point and you're here is the the money shot here is the thing that i was building

1874
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:36,080
to i gotta say it um i won't shut up even though you're trying to tell me to shut up by speaking

1875
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:43,200
over me right well yeah and it's like yeah that makes sense it's it's a good tactic it works you

1876
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:48,480
can't if you're if you're if you're on a roll if you're on a roll you can't let some idiot come in

1877
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:54,400
and knock you off it you can't let some idiot redirect your momentum like that fuck you up ruin

1878
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:01,120
ruin the climax you gotta you gotta go for it you gotta just barrel on to into the horizon do you

1879
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:08,640
hear the horn again this fucking idea this fucking idiot is back is he just like is it his

1880
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:13,920
current he's like why is the alarm going i i oh gosh oh gosh how embarrassing and he doesn't

1881
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:18,320
know what he's doing i don't know but it stopped it stopped why is this a problem why does this

1882
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:25,920
keep happening what a fucking more what a maroon anyway um anything else to say about interrupting

1883
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:33,840
um don't be a honking car don't that guy is the worst about it that guy is cutting me off i was

1884
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:42,640
building to something and he ruined it um okay next one she pollution about animorphs three two one

1885
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:48,400
go hey tom just wanted to thank you for letting me know that animorphs is actually good only watch

1886
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:53,840
the first bit of your lecture before deciding i'm gonna read it myself or listen to it actually

1887
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:59,600
some company i've got a name is making audiobooks for all the books and the quality is really good

1888
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:04,720
too bad it's gonna take ages before the audiobooks are made right now they only have the first 10

1889
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:10,400
and i think the coronavirus delay the production i'm at book four now i do have some pet beefs like

1890
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:15,840
why aren't they collecting tons of animal morphs right away but i can forgive those book three with

1891
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:22,560
tobias was really really sad such a unique and interesting character study so yeah thanks a lot

1892
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:28,320
too bad i can't read discussions and forums since i don't want to be spoiled but i'll get there cheers

1893
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:39,840
uh man imagine reading animorphs i can't i've never seen it i mean i read i read animorphs when i was

1894
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:47,200
in like second grade third grade or fourth grade or whatever like that that's that's the mark i don't

1895
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:54,640
know an audio they're really short like an audit like 10 animorphs books like each one's gotta take like

1896
01:54:56,080 --> 01:55:03,920
fucking like two hours tops like they're only like 100 or 200 pages if that they're very small

1897
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:12,560
um but that that sort of length makes me feel like i could just easily read it uh yeah they're

1898
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:20,480
they're basically light novels i think that got said in the lecture um but uh the i don't remember

1899
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:25,360
okay you say they don't you say why i don't i don't know if i should talk about it if i'm

1900
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:29,760
going to spoil but i kind of thought that they do like one of the first things they do maybe not

1901
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:35,200
immediately but there is sort of like an early arc where they go this is like right at the beginning

1902
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:40,320
they go to the zoo and they get like they get some really good like like morphs right like they get

1903
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:46,320
there they're iconic like rachel gets the bear and jake gets the tiger and marco gets the gorilla

1904
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:54,240
and so on and so forth um do they have a finite a number of no no they can have as many as they

1905
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:58,880
as they want i think so yeah i guess there really is no reason why they're not just getting like

1906
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:04,640
getting as many as they can all the time they are a little bit i guess they're a little conservative

1907
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:08,720
with it they're a little bit like they only get a new one if they're like hmm i need to

1908
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:14,880
accomplish a specific task perhaps this animal would help me do so i must go find it out and

1909
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:20,160
touch it and now i can do it yes yes i did narratively that would be the easiest way to

1910
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:27,120
keep things fresh yeah instead of just like have like the first couple books is just like oh an ant

1911
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:30,480
oh there's an ant in my room i gotta get the ant okay got it oh a spider oh i gotta get the

1912
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:34,000
spider okay i got the spider oh oh there's a there's a bird i gotta shoot the bird in the

1913
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,680
wing so it falls to the ground and they go and get it while it's not before it dies okay i got the

1914
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:42,880
bird uh now another bird oh uh we could go we could go to a bird sanctuary or petting zoo we

1915
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:47,120
could pet all the animals and get all things um you could swing with dolphins oh we gotta go do that

1916
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:52,880
yeah yeah and then that's just the whole series it's like there like there is there is an alien

1917
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:57,040
invasion happening but like they're not engaging with it at all they're just like going to like

1918
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:02,720
meet animals like like no no i'm not ready i'm not ready to to fight them yet i'm not ready i need a

1919
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:07,440
i need a silverback i need a i need a giraffe i gotta go to the aquarium i gotta go to the zoo uh

1920
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:17,520
yes i'm gonna go find a killer whale brb yeah exactly uh boy oh boy so um good good job good

1921
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:25,520
job reading the animals i guess uh the the i really liked the like side books like the side

1922
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:30,000
story is like the andalite chronicles and the horkbezier chronicles and stuff they're like much

1923
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,920
bigger and i thought those were fucking cool as hell uh but i don't know if i'm remembering the

1924
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:43,520
lecture now it's so it's such a great little story it is all of that lore all that stuff is so

1925
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:49,360
inventive strange it's just it's like a strange thing that these books exist and are the way they are

1926
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:58,160
they're like fucking scary i don't know uh but it's cool it's cool shit uh uh all right next one

1927
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:07,200
i think this is the last one is fuck three two one go fuck man she leaving the pcp just hit me

1928
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:14,880
hard man um mage leaving was sad like mage just was already out when i started listening to you guys

1929
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:23,440
but um man he's like three days um younger than me so now i feel that since he has left i will have

1930
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:30,240
to fucking start doing something with my life too and it's too much pressure and i want to kill myself

1931
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:35,920
and if you guys could also try to hold him back in life so he doesn't

1932
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:44,720
spread his wings too much it would be appreciated spread his wings too much yeah we'll hold him back

1933
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:52,320
just so that he you can be on a similar level to him i hate i i hate this attitude so much this

1934
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:58,560
this really maybe i'm maybe i'm crazy maybe i'm like taking it too seriously but this this attitude

1935
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:05,120
of like oh so and so left the podcast to go and like do because because they had something better

1936
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:09,440
to do like because they had to spread their wings and move on to greener past like what greener

1937
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:15,280
pastures like what are they doing instead what is anyone doing with their like two hours on a sunday

1938
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:20,400
afternoon that is like so important that like being on the fucking podcast would have prevented

1939
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:24,960
that from doing i know the answer it's nothing this is like a complete like this is like a total

1940
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:31,760
like false perception but don't you realize ben that um we only exist on the podcast and we don't

1941
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:39,200
do anything else besides this yes of course here i am on the podcast that is drawing rapidly to a

1942
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:45,520
close at which point i will wink out of existence and cease to be until next friday at 2 p.m eastern

1943
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:51,600
standard time at which point i will resume my existence in your ear and then and the cycle

1944
01:59:51,600 --> 02:00:00,800
will begin anew uh so i don't know the way the way that people talk about the way that people talk

1945
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:08,720
about like people being on the podcast leaving the podcast it's see if it's very weird it's

1946
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:15,920
saying they're leaving the fandom yeah it means so little yeah i agree to be on the

1947
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:21,600
podcast is just to be present when the podcast is being recorded it doesn't mean necessarily

1948
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:28,640
anything i mean i don't know munchy maybe his greener pastures in his mind but they're like

1949
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:33,360
like then they have nothing to do with him leaving the podcast there's just

1950
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:38,800
there's like he has things he wants to do with life and like two hours out of his week is not

1951
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:44,320
going to be enough to stop him from doing that if he decided to stay on the podcast he just

1952
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:52,880
prefers not to be on i'm gonna say it i'm gonna say it um being on the pcp is like such a like low

1953
02:00:53,600 --> 02:01:00,240
commitment thing it is like such an easy thing to do i actually kind of feel like not doing it

1954
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:05,520
is like irresponsible and i'm kind of like every every week i'm kind of like shaking my head and

1955
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:10,640
all these people that are not on i'm like what are you doing like what are you thinking why

1956
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:16,320
you're fucking up that's that's how i feel um it doesn't make it does not make any sense to me

1957
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:23,280
uh hmm i hope i'm not coming off like whiny or anything i hope i'm not coming off like a

1958
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:28,800
little bitch this episode but i guess if i am i don't know maybe i just am a little bitch

1959
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:35,680
maybe i'll just maybe let's just up to the viewer to decide i mean it's it's fair to be like

1960
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:44,960
where's everybody where's everybody it's it's been you me and tom for a while yeah and before

1961
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:51,360
that was you me terminate for a while i just i just want i just want it to be known that like

1962
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:58,720
it doesn't that i do i don't understand it i do not understand the thinking that that that leads to

1963
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:06,240
people not being on the podcast people leaving the podcast or whatever it's it's bizarre i don't

1964
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:11,200
know that's and that's and that's how i feel about it and you know and this this uh the greener

1965
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:15,680
pastures thing no it doesn't hold new water doesn't make any sense uh doesn't stand up to

1966
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:21,120
scrutiny if you think about it for even like a second and this and i'm saying and i say this

1967
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:26,640
as someone who directly benefits from other people not being on the podcast because i make

1968
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:32,720
more money the fewer people are on the podcast the more i get so it's like it's good it's actually

1969
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:38,880
good for me for people not to be on but i'm still just like but why aren't people on it's it's what

1970
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:44,320
they think yeah kind of a little bit yeah i'm having a miserable time talking to you

1971
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:54,720
um oh no shucks uh oh see oh no i guess i'll never come back another friendship ruined gibbs

1972
02:02:54,720 --> 02:03:01,920
leaving the podcast um ben ben doesn't like me ben's too mean he broke up the podcast because

1973
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:09,360
he's too political he was so political of him to say i'm a bitch uh okay i've i've

1974
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:16,000
spealed about that for long enough i think i don't know what do you what do you think um i mean

1975
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:23,120
people coming on the podcast i i would like them to come back that's all i really have to say about

1976
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:30,160
it yeah i i like speaking to him the money is like whatever it's fun doing the show it's fun

1977
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:40,000
speaking to people weekly it's good yeah it's it's uh i mean i don't know not every not every time

1978
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:49,120
is it like sunshine and rainbows but like i don't feel like we've been arguing that much in like

1979
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:56,560
recent months or years even it hasn't been that bad no so i don't know why people are like so

1980
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:02,640
apprehensive maybe they assume that things will get bad if they mix with with uh with i don't know

1981
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:09,040
ben if you if you have if nate comes back and then oh suddenly it will become political we haven't

1982
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:13,920
talked about politics really that much i don't and it hasn't been like very contentious stuff

1983
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:19,600
if it hasn't but like if nate comes back does he think that there will be like a bunch of politics

1984
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:23,920
i mean the times when i the times when i get mad about politics are generally the times

1985
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:30,560
that's nate or someone else says something political that i disagree with and then i

1986
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:36,640
have to talk about it i feel like that's when i get that and it's not fair it's not me it's

1987
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:41,360
it's not just a me problem but everyone says oh ben's political oh ben gets mad about stuff

1988
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:48,480
ben's mean ben yells at people and is cruel uh it's very stupid it's very small brain smooth

1989
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:57,680
brain opinion to have um i don't know is this is this like um this is like a is it a is it a

1990
02:04:57,680 --> 02:05:03,440
bad look to be here on the podcast discussing like why isn't anyone on the podcast anymore

1991
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:13,200
is that is that cringe i mean maybe people have reasons and that we're not like uh thinking about

1992
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:18,000
and they'll be like ah come on guys it's this reason that i'm not here so it's like uh whatever

1993
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:23,920
like i don't think it's too much of a bad look because it's like the the viewers feel the same

1994
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:31,840
i think a lot of people are just sort of like where is everyone it's a it's a very like visceral

1995
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:41,120
feeling that is happening yeah i i guess i'm just as confused about it as you are dear viewer

1996
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:50,400
dear listener uh hey we got another one we got another one do we have it wait from our boy margar

2001
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:30,240
and no one is being paid it is slave labor to be frank it's legal it's legal in the united

2002
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:38,560
states people in here are innocent as i am i am convinced that we were not sent here because

2003
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:46,320
of the crimes we committed we were convicted because they wanted our labor and they made up crimes

2004
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:55,360
so that we could get in here we need reform we need abolition fully of the pc police state
