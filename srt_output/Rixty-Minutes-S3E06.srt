1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Fuck me and my fucking asshole, it's, we're back with Rick Stieman. It's everybody season 3 episode 6. Rest in Rick

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,600
Laxation. I am the best guy ever and here's Digibro.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:24,240
We're back. You sound, you sound like you're toxic Digi. You're, I am quite toxic. Toxic animal. Yeah, I'm the toxic Avenger.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,800
This is good episode, man. Yeah, real good episode, real good. I really liked it. This took me back in a way to

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,040
what I think is a

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,880
lot of the best Rick and Morty episodes, which is take a just really interesting fucking sci-fi

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,880
concept and see what you can do with it. Yep. Yep. Which I don't feel like we've had as much of this season.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Maybe the first episode with the whole

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,920
Yeah, yeah. Going into like his memories and shit, but the start of season 2 was a lot of this.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,720
Like the, this reminded me of like the planet that was a live episode kind of with the

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,640
The usage of the concept and seeing where they could go with it. Planet that was alive as in the

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,720
What was her name? Fuck. His girlfriend, that lady? Yeah, the girlfriend. Yeah, okay. I'm with you. I'm with you.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,280
Yeah, this was uh, this is really great shit. Uh, there's no like, there's no like evil foe

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,280
to conquer in this episode. So there's no need to like worry or there's none of this shit. We're like, we're, we're second

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,000
Guess like, why doesn't Rick just do this? Why doesn't Rick just fucking do it?

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,600
No, it doesn't fucking matter because the conflict is internal this episode exactly where it should be for this shit

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
It felt tight and it's

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,160
I kind of love when they

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,280
I can call it an excuse, but I think it's clever writing when they put the characters in a situation where they can't

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,440
solve it because of just like personal like mental limitations like in this case the

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,400
You know, this could be resolved easily if they were whole but the fact is that they're not and that's the whole problem, you know

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Yeah, um pussy rick

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,160
You know won't go through with what uh other rick would right of course toxic rick

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
and I mean what makes it interesting is like these are

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,000
Like they're approaching it on a level that makes sense to all of us like we can all imagine what our

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
Toxic sides are and it's really interesting when when you get to the end of the episode where it turns out the toxic parts

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,240
Everyone it defines for themselves what their toxic parts are that may or may not be what the rest of us think they are

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,000
And that was a fucking great twist. Yeah, it was awesome. It was fantastic

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
It because it made me realize, you know, like this whole episode

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,240
These are the obviously toxic parts of rick and morty that we're seeing the idea ricks a violent

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,400
Maniac who thinks he's a god and just you know, it's completely full of himself

32
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,320
But when we find out that this is what rick thinks are the toxic parts of himself

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,240
It really recontextualizes it quite a bit that like even he wishes he wasn't like that

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,320
But he also wishes he wasn't uh, he didn't have like love and feelings like that, you know

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,840
Like he'd like to be a nice polite regular dude, but he still wants to be a cold

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
asocial, uh, you know

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,320
Psycho and it's great and it's great that since like morty kind of like those are the other

38
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,120
The traits that he would consider positive about himself

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,760
Like he wants to be that american psycho like a a moral, you know, unfeeling

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,280
Cutthroat businessman kind of guy that that rick identifies as like that's what he wants to get rid of

41
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,200
But morty wants to keep those things because of his deep deeper insecurities and it just makes it it's making it so that

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,320
None of this is like an objective stance as to like what is actually good and bad about a person by couching it in this

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
This is how the individual identifies as their bad points

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,800
It gives it this great air of subjectivity where it's just

45
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,960
We just get to more understand the characters themselves and how they perceive these things as opposed to like, you know

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,840
Dan Harmon making a stance about like, oh if you have feelings if you love your week, you know any of that that bullshit

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,280
It's not making that point at all. It's just talking about the characters. It's uh, it's great. It's much more interesting

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,360
Smart shit. I will say one thing if I have one complaint or doubt about this episode. It's

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,120
Would morty really be this good just by losing his toxic side that did occur to me as well

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, like just by not being such a huge

51
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
coward

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,640
You know, I mean one of my favorite moments in the entire show

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,760
Is in the entire episode is when morty just like confronts rick

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He like tells him like you are not fucking getting in the back

55
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,600
It'd be real dangerous for you if you fucking went back and got like our shitty sides

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
And then as he's walking away fucking football just arrives in his hands

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
And he fucking tosses his back and keeps going like

58
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,160
Yeah, like the levels of absurdity as to how perfect morty's life has become because he's lost his like are comedically

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,080
Just just fucking perfect like they're way over the top and they're great. I love how obnoxious he is

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,640
Yeah, and that the episode's willing to just dwell on it like just really like go

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
They go so hard on like the cornball

62
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,200
element of it like he's just telling stupid jokes that aren't funny and like

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,440
For a second I'm like groaning and then I'm like, oh, that's the point, you know, like you got me you mother fucker

64
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,440
I constantly felt that way throughout his scenes and I sort of felt like um

65
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,800
uh

66
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,760
the the elements that propel him to such levels of success are just his absolute confidence and

67
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,760
You know, really that's that that can that can make a huge difference in somebody's life

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,960
And you can see like toxic morty, which is his complete like

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,480
Disgust with himself on every possible level

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,600
Uh, yeah, leaving leaving, you know, healthy morty quote-unquote healthy morty to be just this fucking

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,520
Powerhouse of confidence. Yeah, like I can see why he'd do well, you know, when he goes it becomes like a broker or whatever

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,640
Uh, yeah, yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,720
How my favorite character in this episode is um, what's a random random slut

74
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,240
Big tits make what's a bar. Yeah, I fucking love her. I felt it. I felt a certain

75
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
Tingling in my loins when I gazed upon this character

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,040
The line where he's uh, when she's like, should I leave and he's like

77
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,960
You're free person do what you want. She's like, I choose to stay

78
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
That got me

79
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Yeah, she was a bit of a delight. I liked her a lot

80
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,080
I knew I I was really happy because like I knew that they were gonna end up trapping her in the machine

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,440
But what I was really hoping was that either she'd escape or just be like like a badass down

82
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
Like I knew she was going to be in the end after credits

83
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
Yeah, yeah, like no question after she got trapped in there

84
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,000
And didn't like like I would have been really bummed out if they'd like killed her

85
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,400
You know, and this is I've I've been saying all season that the show has been

86
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,840
writing right on the line between being like overly gross and like and

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,480
Inacceptable and like there's still an insane violent scene in this where all these little kids chop off a clown's head

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
And it's fucking

89
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,240
Horrible, but it was great because it's a character. Nobody cares about it's just a one-off gag

90
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
And it's it works really well

91
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,800
Like if this girl had gotten killed that would have been like this is like why why she was likable

92
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
I liked her don't kill her

93
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm glad this show still has that sense of knowing like when to push the violent button and when not to

94
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
And um, you know, it's continued

95
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,080
There's only been like a couple places where I thought like the aforementioned one of the avengers episode

96
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
I was like, uh

97
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,480
We have to kill that guy so gruesomely, but it wasn't a big deal and I didn't like that episode anyways, so yep

98
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,640
Yep, you know, but here I felt it was done. Just right, you know

99
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,640
Okay, can I just bring up so people have been making a there's been a contention this whole season that we haven't addressed on this show yet

100
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,720
The issue of the quote-unquote female writers. Are you aware of this? You aware of this meme that's going around

101
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
Yeah, I don't like I mean didn't the show always have female writers

102
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,120
I honestly don't know. I thought that I should prepare, but then I also didn't uh, so I have not looked into this at all

103
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,280
I don't know comment people give me give me like reasons to take this seriously

104
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,920
I don't know what this means every time it gets brought up. It's like it's completely inconsequential because

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,840
Everyone agrees pickle rick was an amazing episode. It was written by a woman

106
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,000
and then like

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,960
So, you know, where do we go from like what what is the side you're trying to take here?

108
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,520
You're trying to say the female writers are good or bad because

109
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,120
We've already proved they've done like the both the best and worst episodes of the season were written by a woman. So

110
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,960
Where you know, I mean all I can tell people make of this is just show me an itemized list

111
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,640
Show me the correlations here because uh pickle rick was perfect

112
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
This episode was fantastic

113
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,520
And then the the avengers one and the the mad max one like those are pretty lame overall

114
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320
So like I don't know if these were like diversity hires that made the show worse

115
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,160
I don't know prove that to me in some way. I don't know do do the work for me people

116
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,520
That's what I'm asking of you. It's I think they're just trying to make it a meme

117
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,720
But like the meme can't stick if the if some of the best episodes are written by women

118
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
Like you can't meme it if it's just not even true

119
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,880
I think so people disliked pickle rick just for like they didn't pay attention to how good the episode was

120
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,040
And instead focused on like the memory of it like oh pickle rick

121
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,840
So funny except that episode was fucking great. So, you know, I don't I don't know what there is a complaint about

122
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
Um, well, anyway, I don't know

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,400
I just thought I'd bring that up like people have been saying that for a while

124
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,680
And I didn't really know if you had any insight to to bring to the no

125
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,040
Like I said, the first thing I heard about it was well pickle registered by woman and I was like, well, okay

126
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,680
Well, there's no problem. I guess women are the best writers then as it turns out

127
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,720
I don't know. I feel like yeah, maybe people are just out to

128
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
which hunt on the show for

129
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,360
Seemingly having more women than it had before I don't fucking know

130
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,440
I know everyone who works on rick and morty gets fucking poached. So like

131
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,360
If they hired more women, it's probably because they ran out of whoever was writing the show before, you know

132
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,520
And the new hires are just as good as the old ones. Who the fuck all the goddamn men are ascending too high in the patriarchy

133
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,440
We have to fill these slots with the the lowly women. Hey, what can we do? Uh, so, hey, can we talk about how?

134
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,320
fucking uh, I don't know spine

135
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,960
Shatteringly intense the opening scene of this episode was because I I fucking loved it. It was the coolest thing ever

136
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,280
I was not in control that situation at any point morty that that really fucking got me that uh, that's

137
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Oh, that's another thing

138
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,080
I've I mean we've this has happened many times throughout this show

139
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
But the way that this show will have like full blown

140
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,760
Lovecraft shit happened to the minds of these characters and then find a reason to just wipe it under the rug

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
You know like we had the roy game in season two

142
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,400
Where morty experiences an entire lifetime as another person

143
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,320
We just had in the last episode the whole mind meld for an epoch thing right and now we've got this like

144
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,160
Deep trauma to the point of we're never going on another adventure for both of them for even rick

145
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,400
But then they go to a spa. They're like, you know, well, you're just gonna work through that stress

146
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
It'll be fine

147
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,760
That was great. That was great. And I yeah, I just love seeing like the alien spa and all the stuff they were doing there

148
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,800
And I don't know. It's not a major point, but seeing like

149
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,440
Once we saw like toxic rick and toxic morty trapped in the tank and just realizing that they're like in this world

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Uh, I don't I don't know something about that was just really cool being in this

151
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,040
like seeing sort of like the uh, sort of the anthropomorphization of like the inside of like this toxic tank

152
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,240
Or or something like that. I don't know something about that was really dope. I really like I really I love this

153
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
idea just because of the fact that they they go to a spa

154
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,440
And detox which is like in in reality a load of horse shit

155
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, like detoxing is not like a

156
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,280
Thing that works as far as I'm aware. I'm pretty sure it's like bro science, you know, it's like a meme to me

157
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,720
Yeah, so like especially the like, oh, I'm going on like a three-day detox right to like swallow a fucking rope and

158
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,560
Then shit it out over the course of three days, you know about those ones like

159
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,320
You know, that's what they're making fun of here, but it's a sci-fi version where not only does it work

160
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:25,840
But it's like literally everything toxic about you psychologically removed like just such a good idea

161
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,520
And then to make a whole story out of that idea is

162
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,480
It's genius. Yeah, it was great. It's just really smart and uh, you know seeing, you know, uh, uh clean rick

163
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,080
Or a healthy rick, you know being guilted into into bringing back him and and even being guilted like oh morty

164
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:50,240
We got to reabsorb our darkpots. They're they're part of us morty. We can't we can't live without them. That's uh, I really loved

165
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
That rick. I loved fixed rick because they didn't make it

166
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,080
Oh, they didn't overdo it. It didn't make him like a like an actual total pussy. He's just like a reasonable guy

167
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,920
Who's very interested in science, you know, like he just wants to be a scientist man

168
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,200
Like that's that's the rick's perfect vision of himself is just a man who wants to do science

169
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
Just a reasonable guy who who wants to do that, you know

170
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,720
And like that's what he would consider an idealized version of himself

171
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,280
But but that that idealized version is such a moralist that he can't stand to leave behind

172
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,440
You know a part of himself that he feels he wronged by you know doing this too. So

173
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
By the way, a detriment to himself. He's so self-sacrificing. Yeah. Yeah that he would help this other person

174
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
Whereas morty sees himself a perfect version of him would not sacrifice anything for anyone

175
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
Yeah, yeah, it's true. It's true. It kind of just shows that uh

176
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,040
Deep down morty is kind of a worse person than rick, you know

177
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,520
At least in the way that like he wishes that he could be you know, he wishes to be this kind of a moral guy

178
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,440
Which I totally relate to I I'm totally in agreement with morty. I would I wish I was that

179
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
American psycho morty

180
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,560
I've said many times that my favorite thing about rick is that underneath all the psychopathy

181
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,960
He is a moralist and now we've been made fun of on the previous episode for suggesting that rick was a better person than

182
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,960
Jerry we have because ricks ricks killed so many fucking people and all that shit, but rick also

183
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
has

184
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,040
Created entire worlds that run perfectly fine. He's you know create his amount of things

185
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,520
He's brought to the world is possibly

186
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,520
Greater than the amount of destruction he's caused and I mean I would say it probably more likely evens out

187
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,840
Considering that on the council of ricks. They said he was like right in between being a full evil and a full good

188
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
He's like the perfect middle ground

189
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,880
Um, but you know a middle ground as a rick is not oh, I don't kill anybody

190
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,440
But I also don't really contribute to society. It's I kill swaths of people

191
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
But I also like create entire

192
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,320
Utopias and shit and you know occasionally help people so

193
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,040
Like I do think there's a moral center to rick that's always been there

194
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:11,040
And whereas morty has you know, he's just an idiot who's been strung into this world where he's developed this nihilistic

195
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,440
Personality and doesn't care about anything for real. So like you know

196
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,280
It's a bit of a bit of a give and take there. It's it's interesting to and I really don't think

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,520
Toxic ricks point should be discounted like you you've got to imagine yourself in ricks perspective here

198
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,920
Everyone around him is a fucking like worthless piece of protoplasm

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,240
Like he is a literal god compared to these people with with his abilities

200
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,680
Like to even give one ounce of an iota of a shit about any of these creatures that you know

201
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,200
You have access to infinite alternate versions of like

202
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,360
Frank like the the moral labor enacted to do that is frankly more than any of us could possibly imagine

203
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,320
In any of our lives because we're like a lot of us only act kind because we have to act kind or society will destroy us

204
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
rick is above society in every possible way

205
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,000
He chooses to act morally none of us ever have to like with how about the great with great power comes great responsibility

206
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,960
Considering the incredible power rick has he is goddamn saintly because he could just evaporate our universe if he felt

207
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,440
And granted he will do that sometimes if he flies off the handle like

208
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,240
We're not saying that he always makes the right choice

209
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,920
But the fact that he ever makes the right choice is almost shocking exactly

210
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,280
You know like like again back in episode two with the the road warrior world

211
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,800
Like if he wanted to he could have just killed everyone and left

212
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,440
But he just didn't I don't know didn't feel up to just murdering everybody that episode

213
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,920
The people the people making those kinds of points

214
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,720
I think should listen to bill burr's comments on tiger woods like all these all these fat middle-aged pieces of shit

215
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,840
Like waddling out when they hear that tiger woods cheated on his wife

216
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,840
They waddle out to their fucking sedans, you know, they're fucking honda civics, and they're like, oh, absolutely

217
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
Reprehensible behavior from tiger. Oh, it's absolutely disgusting

218
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,000
Meanwhile, they have never once ever had to face the kind of challenge that tiger woods did at his peak when he would walk

219
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,400
Off the club and there'd be a fucking busload of of fucking uh,

220
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,080
Swedish cheerleaders wanting to fuck him all at the same time

221
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,600
When have you people ever faced the kind of challenge the tiger or rick has never once in your fucking life?

222
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,200
So I don't want to hear you commenting on this shit like oh, why doesn't he just be perfect all the time get fucked

223
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,560
I don't have any sympathy for these people rick is uh rick's uh

224
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
He's a he's a complicated man

225
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,920
I like how many times have you crushed an ant in your life at least once probably that's what human beings are like to rick

226
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There's a context people it's a context

227
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, there you go. Here you go beautiful beautiful rant there. Uh, what the fuck was this episode about again?

228
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,040
I don't know toxic. Uh, hey, uh, how about I was pretty cool when they made the whole world toxic

229
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Uh, that was that was kind of cool

230
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,960
Uh, what did they I all I can remember is them the the children murdering the clown

231
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,120
Oh, the priest the priest being like, uh, got we steal money from you. God's not real

232
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,760
Ha ha tip. Yeah, and then everybody starts fucking and then the people from like

233
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,920
Subarrows and some salad place like switch places for some reason. I was trying to interpret with that joke man

234
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,280
I didn't really understand that one

235
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,240
I think like the fat people went into like the mexican restaurant and then after it went back

236
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,920
They went back to like the salad place. I I don't know. I I lost track

237
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,840
Yeah, I wasn't paying it. It wasn't mexican. It was a subarro. Oh, oh, yes. It's subar right right

238
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,880
Oh, hey, one other cool thing about this, uh, the fight scene between ricks was pretty fucking dope

239
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
Especially when they like murdered each other and they had to like

240
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,280
Regrow fucking body. Yeah, that was fucking awesome

241
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,160
Uh, the coolest thing ever

242
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Which is another one that has

243
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,920
Like that's a thing a lot of the coolest tricks in this episode are things that have been done before

244
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,360
Like that is something we've seen we've had a

245
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,800
In episode one when morty knocks over the like the tank with an alien baby and it like grows all the way into old age

246
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,080
In a second. Yeah, we've had rick. Don't think about it morty. Yeah

247
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah, we've had him kill other versions of himself and take their bodies at the start of the season like

248
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,680
We've seen a lot of rick using weird

249
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,440
Regrowth and rebirth techniques, but it's still cool

250
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
But I do think this is one of those things where it's like

251
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,160
This show has a limited number of seasons that it can still be impressive like this, you know

252
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,440
Like if we see this another time, it's gonna start to be like, okay, I get it rick can science himself back to life

253
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,480
You know, uh, how many times are we going down that road because I thought it was cool as shit

254
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,320
But I didn't have that shocking like hanging in my psyche like that scene from episode one did with the alien

255
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,360
Don't think about it because I couldn't help but think about yeah

256
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,440
Yeah

257
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,760
You know, this fight kind of reminded me, uh, you know for obvious reasons of uh, you know that fight

258
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,280
I once I first saw it on youtube as the most cartoony anime fight ever between uh, araragi and uh,

259
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,920
Vampire girl where they just pop each other's heads off repeatedly and uh, you know what i'm talking about

260
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,360
If you've seen this I don't think so is it recent it might be from the third keys in monogatari film

261
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,120
It was basically the coolest thing i've ever seen in my entire fucking life and uh, makes me understand why people watch that show

262
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
So I gotta fucking do that sometimes

263
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,440
Yeah, yeah

264
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,320
A lot of people would say you should watch the films first because they are technically a prequel to everything else in the series

265
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,160
But aren't prequels supposed to be watched after you know, uh, whatever

266
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,800
I mean, I mean they the book was like the second book, but it's taken them the longest to adapt so yeah, right

267
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,320
Well enough about bullshit anime, uh

268
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,400
This I mean and nothing else. I mean we pretty much covered everything that was great

269
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,200
Oh, hey, how about the uh, the additional little extra layer of character that was added to jessica?

270
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,360
And she like actually seems to have some feelings. Yeah, what's up with that? I don't know man. It seems like it's going somewhere

271
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,320
I mean I can't I can't really remember how she's been treated because she wasn't around much in season two

272
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,360
And hasn't been much for this season so far like she was mostly a plot device in the first season and

273
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,720
It kind of felt like the way they were treating her was she has no personality whatsoever

274
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,240
She's just a prop in whatever the scene is. Yeah, like so

275
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
I can't remember if there's ever been a hint of this before the idea that she might have cared about

276
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,880
but

277
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,920
Yeah, other than when she got like love potioned in the uh

278
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,320
Other universe, right? I honestly feel like it's a little bit out of nowhere

279
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,400
Like I she did go on a date with him and I'm sure she was impressed like she said like I think I'd be too boring for you

280
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,920
So that that's an admission that this guy seems to have a lot going on

281
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,480
So she's kind of into him in that way. I think she was

282
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
You know, that might have been an excuse or something. Yeah

283
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,840
I think that was a nice way of putting it that she's probably true. I don't know. I feel like they're going somewhere with her

284
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,680
I expect to see more of her at some point

285
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,600
But like Morty wants her bad and she is at least a little bit into him. Just just fucking do it guys just

286
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,360
I wonder if they're trying to set up like because there's a lot of stuff this season that feels like it could be continued on

287
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,080
I wonder if they're trying to set up for like the long haul

288
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,800
Like this isn't going to be stuff that's resolved this season

289
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,080
But it'll be like new overarching stuff for the rest of the show that'll like slowly develop

290
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,000
I almost feel like every episode that we've seen so far has introduced a character that like could come back for like the season

291
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,560
Finality of this like in in this episode. There was uh, you know, the the big tits McGee

292
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,360
Uh in pickle rick. There was like the the that machete guy, whatever his name was l t gray that guy

293
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,640
In episode one there was bird person and what's the face of those guys were obviously kind of like more important characters

294
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,160
I don't know. Oh and uh like bucket head uh x husband of summer

295
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,040
I guess or whatever just seems like there's a bunch of that

296
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
I'm wondering if we're gonna

297
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,400
I don't I almost feel like they're setting up for like some big event where they all get together and for like revenge or something

298
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,800
I don't know that that's my prediction

299
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,160
We'll see we'll see I don't think anybody who shows up in an ending gag is going to show up again

300
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,480
I feel like they do that to resolve a character so that we know they won't be back

301
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,920
I know what you're saying that that would make a lot of sense. Then again l t gray

302
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,320
seems

303
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,360
I don't know the fact that he's still out there, you know makes it like I can't see big tits McGee coming back

304
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,600
Because what would she do? Yeah, but but l t gray if that's his name. I I don't know if that's his name

305
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,840
I can't remember

306
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,080
We all know who you're talking about though. Yeah, we'll uh

307
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,760
We'll see man. We'll see as it goes great episode

308
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,760
Really good. Last episode was really good. Pickle rick was really good

309
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,280
Well, let's let's keep this episode one was really good. There's only really been two episodes that we thought were weaker. So that's not bad

310
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
That's not terrible. Yeah

311
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,800
It's going it's going okay. I mean

312
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,520
And not even that we thought were terrible just that we're not amazing like below average rick and morty episodes

313
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,520
Which is a dissapointment, but more or less. Okay. Yeah, I was a force on when I was like

314
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
but yeah, I mean I

315
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,080
There's episodes of seasons one and two that I think are worse than the others. So this is not new

316
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:09,520
I don't expect to show to bat a hundred at all times, but it is definitely fucking still solid. Absolutely as long as they keep

317
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,200
Bringing in new ideas. I just I hope they stay away from like if there was like another mr

318
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,800
Meeseeks episode or just anything like reusing old ideas

319
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,600
Even in small ways would be that would be an indication that things are starting to dry up

320
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,680
But as long as they keep doing stuff like this

321
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,920
Yeah, this is good. Like this is just a new idea. That's like that's the kind of stuff that we I promise we will see that if

322
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Dan or

323
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,160
or

324
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,200
Justin ever left the show. Oh, yeah, for sure. You know for sure

325
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,920
They'll laugh on those tangible details as hard as they fucking can if those guys leave

326
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,640
Which I mean Justin voices half the characters and Dan voices the other half

327
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,000
So like they can't it would be real hard to do the show without the moment

328
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,280
Yeah, that's true. Well, we're here's hoping good so far. Keep it up guys

329
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
All right. Yeah, peace

330
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Kill me
