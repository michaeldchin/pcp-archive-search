1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,680
Oh my god, I actually did it.

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,000
I actually finished all of the projects that I was working on in the last couple of weeks,

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,800
the last month probably.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,760
Man, I gotta tell ya, first of all I have to apologize, cause I feel partially responsible

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,200
for the fact that there hasn't been any new PCP this week, and how they've been kind

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,880
of irregular lately, that there's been more of all the side projects than the main ones.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,200
No fault of Nate who's been trying to organize PCPs all the time, the rest of us are always

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:04,480
busy, and Ben's been doing his Pokemon Sun playthrough, and he's been busy working on

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,280
his comic, so that's been keeping him occupied a lot.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,520
Davoo has been working really hard on my videos, I gave him a lot of assignments, it took him

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,960
a straight week to finish the video on the one we just did, the subverting Shonen Trove's

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,600
video, and I don't know, Jesse's been, I guess, just moping around somewhere, I haven't

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:38,040
seen a lot of him in the last month and a half or so, but as for me, I usually see Nate's

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,640
calls to action, and I'm just like, I am busy working on all this other shit.

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,800
I gave myself too much work, I gave myself too many projects, too many ongoing projects,

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,080
where I keep having, like, I'll be thinking, alright, today I'm gonna edit this video,

17
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,920
but then I'll remember, oh yeah, today's PCP day, or today is Pub Crawl Day, or today

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,640
is Day I Get Called Into Random Other Podcast, I did a podcast with Mumki, just like over

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,840
a week ago, I did the Wave Motion Cannon Podcast that still isn't out, I think it's gonna come

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,080
out soon, I hope it comes out soon, because I'm giving it a shout out in my next video.

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,120
So yeah, there's just a lot of stuff that keeps pulling my attention aside, and then

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
I keep giving myself these really big projects, and then having them stacked on top of all

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,320
this other shit, and I was also saving a lot of stuff up, so like, the Let's Plays, you

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,000
know, I stocked up the entire Bomberman and the entire Wario Land 4 Let's Play, like,

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,720
I didn't release any of it until both of them were pretty much completed, so that was like

26
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,560
16 videos that were just sitting on my computer until I had time to edit all of them, upload

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,280
them all, you know, schedule them all, give them all the information, which is a process

28
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:04,520
in itself, I had these fucking, god, I, so the two big ones that were really holding

29
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,520
me, that were like weighing down on me, is the co-heating Cambria video and my audio

30
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,680
book of my novel that I wrote six years ago, both of these are pretty big projects that

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,080
I kinda jumped on while the inspiration was there, and then quickly realized they were

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
much too big.

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
Now, I'm gonna tell you about the best feeling in the world, and the worst feeling in the

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,520
world, the best feeling in the world is being way ahead of yourself, the best feeling in

35
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:37,160
the world is when I have six completed videos waiting to be uploaded, that feels great.

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,440
When there's six videos that are already uploaded to which, like, okay, let's say the Let's

37
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,640
Place, right, it feels great to know that in December, there will be a Let's Play video

38
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,520
every month, I already scheduled a whole month worth of Let's Plays, you know, all of December,

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,920
the exact length of December, because both Bomberman and Wario were 16 episodes apiece,

40
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,560
both their final episode will come out on the 31st, so every day of December has a Let's

41
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,760
Play coming out, all of those videos are fully uploaded, fully scheduled, they have all their

42
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,160
information in place and the files have been moved to my external hard drive, they're not

43
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,760
even on my computer anymore, those videos are fucking done, that feels great, that's

44
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,120
being ahead of yourself.

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:32,820
The worst feeling in the world is having unfinished videos sitting around on the desktop and knowing

46
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,600
that I haven't done them yet, and I have this, I like to have only one column of things on

47
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,600
my desktop, I have four folders that are below my wrist, you know, there's the computer,

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,040
the computer icon, the main user folder, the DigiBro folder, the recycling bin, and

49
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,000
there's four folders under that, the first one is a music folder for all the music projects

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,540
that I'm working on, the second one is just a general video, it's called NNB which stood

51
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,200
for Non Non Biori, because I made the folder when I started up the sitting around watching

52
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,280
series with Non Non Biori, so whenever I take files off of my camera, I throw them into

53
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,760
that folder, and then you know, the files stay in there until those videos are done

54
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,920
being edited, then I remove the files from the folder, then there is the podcasts folder

55
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,400
where I hold anything for this channel pretty much, stays in that folder, and then finally

56
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,000
there is the let's play folder which is new, I didn't have one in the old days, but I created

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,600
one because of the let's plays I was doing with both DeVue and Victor, these four folders,

58
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,240
the best state for them to be in is empty, now a couple of them have materials, like

59
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,240
for instance the NNB folder has all of the comments that I use for the board of second

60
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,720
chances videos, or the podcasts one has the thumbnail and the background photoshop documents

61
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:09,840
for the procrastinators videos, and the music one just has a shit ton of errant music files

62
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,720
in there because I have a bunch of outstanding music projects, which is itself a problem

63
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,440
but I don't pay as much attention to that as I do the other stuff, but aside from those

64
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,320
folders, I have had this technique that I've been using the whole time I've been making

65
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,480
videos, this is a very integral to my workflow, which is that because I'm so obsessed with

66
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:36,600
my desktop being clean, any video I'm currently working on that's not finished, if it doesn't

67
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,840
go in one of those four folders, it goes right on the desktop, all the project files

68
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,400
go straight on the desktop, and what that means is I can't get rid of them until I finish

69
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,720
the project, so the Coheed and Cambria video had an audio, all the videos of me talking

70
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,160
into the camera were all in the NNB folder because I just ripped stuff from the camera

71
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,480
straight to that folder, but all the project files for the Coheed music videos and their

72
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,880
songs and stuff and all that shit was sitting in a folder on the desktop called Coheed and

73
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,040
I couldn't get rid of it until I finished editing the video, which took weeks, because

74
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,520
I'll get into why in a second, then I did my audio book and that had to sit on the

75
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,800
desktop until I was done editing it, and this like, this worms its way into my mind, like

76
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,200
I need these things to be gone, and eventually if something sits on the desktop for long enough

77
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,160
and doesn't get finished, it will get thrown away, but I'm sure I've said this many times

78
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:44,920
before that for me, there's a very steep, harsh curve of my interest level in completing

79
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:51,200
a video, so there's the moment I get the idea for the video, which is a fairly high level

80
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,920
of excitement, depending on how quickly I think I'm going to do the idea, if it's something

81
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,440
that's like a vague idea that maybe I'm going to do in the future, but I'm not entirely

82
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,600
sure, it's a low level of excitement, I get a lot of those, almost every day, there's

83
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,600
some kind of idea that I'm like, maybe I can do a video about that, but I don't know exactly

84
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,240
how it would be, so we'll hold off on that for now, then there's the ones that I immediately

85
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,600
know what it's going to be, and I'm like, oh, I'm ready to do that, I can do that right

86
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,280
now, some of them are like, that would be a little bit too complicated, I'm not going

87
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,800
to do that today, that requires me to watch 10 shows, that one can get put off for a while,

88
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,280
but if there's an idea that's like, oh, I can do that right now, then it gets pretty

89
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,520
excited, now, whether it's a vlog and I'm getting in front of the camera, or if it's

90
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,640
a written post, the act of creating it is the highest level of excitement, if I'm writing

91
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,400
a post, I am super into it, particularly as I get close to the end, that's the highest

92
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,480
level of interest I have in this project getting made, is when I'm towards the back end of

93
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:04,080
finishing writing it, or when I'm recording the vlog, but after that, it goes straight

94
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,560
downhill, because if I have to start editing the video, I'm already past the part I was

95
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,920
excited about, which was getting the idea out there, manifesting this idea into writing,

96
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,080
making it concrete by putting it to paper, that's the exciting part, now I just have

97
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,160
to go through the process of making it presentable for an audience, which I'm not interested

98
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,520
in, and the more I listen back to this audio, the more I hear myself talking about this

99
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,200
thing, the less I care about the point I'm making, the stupider it sounds to me, the

100
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,320
more I feel like, was this even really worth it, why did I even make this, that's how

101
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I start to feel as I edit, that's why DeVue edits my videos for me, because as that interest

102
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,640
curve goes down, the likelihood of it getting done, or it getting done well, also goes down,

103
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,560
and this is why a lot of my older videos reach that point where it might just be set to a

104
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,320
video game, like Sword Art Online and Analytical Diatribe, it's like I made this, it's an hour

105
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,760
long thing, you know, my interest curve peaked when I wrote that thing, it was starting to

106
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,320
go downhill after I had to record and edit the audio for that thing, you know, it was

107
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,960
still a pretty high level of excitement, but then the prospect of editing an hour of video

108
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,920
with relevant footage, and then knowing that it probably wouldn't get onto YouTube, because

109
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,120
at the time I didn't know how to get around YouTube systems, total decimation of interest

110
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,620
curve, let's set it to video game footage, you know, so I pay DeVue because when he gets

111
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:44,060
my videos, then he all at once hears the audio and immediately hits the top of that interest

112
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,220
curve, and then he edits it, you know, he edits it while he's in that state, and he's

113
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,220
like he stays there through the editing, and I do think it's, I think there's times where

114
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,980
even he, if he has to edit something for too long, it even for him it becomes like a, okay

115
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,540
I don't care anymore, you know, by the time he's finished, there's some videos I feel

116
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,780
like he, this shonen one, I felt like fairly early into editing because it was so complicated

117
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,660
because he had to gather so many fucking clips, I think he was starting to be like, I don't

118
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,580
know why I'm editing this fucking video other than that I'm getting money, you know, like,

119
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,020
he can correct me if I'm wrong about that, but like, it was an arduous edit, you know,

120
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:31,180
I could tell he was not as stoked about doing it because of how arduous the process was,

121
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,940
because Davoo's least favorite part of editing is having to just gather shit, like he's pretty

122
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,260
good at the plug and play of actually editing it, but the gathering part seems to stress

123
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:48,820
him out and he had to do a lot of it for this, so anyways, yeah, like, if I have to edit

124
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:55,420
for too long, the likelihood of it being finished goes down, and this is especially true for

125
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,780
anything that I don't see how this, like, what the impact of this is going to be, like

126
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,060
if it's something I don't really care about, then it goes down further and further, so

127
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,260
like, for instance, I got inspired when I was watching Shallow Rewards to make some

128
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,460
music content, like, to make a video explaining my history with a band, because like, a lot

129
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,580
of his videos will talk about a band's entire history, and I don't really have the kind

130
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,220
of knowledge that he does of like, what goes on in the industry or like, what was going

131
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,900
on in the minds of the bands and their personalities, but you know, with a band like Coheed and

132
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,820
Cambry, I've heard all their albums a thousand million times, I felt like I could talk with

133
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,980
some confidence about how I feel their music has changed, and maybe some of the reasons

134
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:46,540
that it's changed, but it's all very speculative and very gonzo, and I just kind of did it

135
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,940
unscripted and ranted, and I ranted for like an hour, and my idea with this video was I

136
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,100
was going to edit in music clips to try and help prove my point, that ended up being a

137
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,820
lot more effort than I thought it would be, and so this video that, as I'm listening to

138
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,620
it back, all I can find, like, all I hear is all the things, places where I use the

139
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,180
same word a thousand fucking times, I, everything is just sweeping and epic and huge, those

140
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,940
are the three words, and pathos, I say all those words a million times, and, and I just

141
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:25,180
hear myself getting facts kind of wrong, or just like, not really explaining something

142
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,620
and it does much depth, or like, certain places where I'm like, oh, why didn't I point this

143
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,340
out, that would have helped, or like, just all, because it's an unscripted mess, you

144
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:40,460
know, and I'm not really good at talking about music, and, and I was drunk and tired probably,

145
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,140
so like, this is, this is something that should not have had to be edited for the amount of

146
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:51,580
time that it did, you know, but it took a lot to edit it, and as I'm going, like, because

147
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,340
I don't really have that much enthusiasm for it, it makes it harder and harder to keep

148
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,420
working on it, so it sat on my desktop for like, two and a half, three weeks, you know,

149
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,180
like, I was just slowly plugging away at it with little energy, and then I keep taking

150
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,820
on all these other projects at the same time, so like, this one is just sitting around while

151
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,500
new shit keeps piling up, oh, we did another Let's Play with me and DeVue, oh, we did another

152
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,500
PCP, now I gotta, and make sure that gets out, and if that doesn't get out within a

153
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,900
couple of days, and the schedule's gonna get really fucking weird, you know, and like,

154
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:32,340
uh, it just becomes like a stack, a fuck shit stack, all on my desktop, and uh, so, god,

155
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,220
let me take a breath for a second, and these, the decompression chambers don't help either,

156
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,500
because I've been trying to keep these to a week, like a relatively weekly thing, and

157
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,100
I think I said on the last one that it, that it might be longer or whatever, uh, before

158
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,340
this one came out, but like, you know, when that week, when it starts getting towards

159
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,580
the end of the week, and it's like, oh, well, now I'm gonna do a decompression chamber,

160
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,220
well, that pushes, like, if I have to edit this, then I'm not editing the coheed video,

161
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,540
you know, and then I stacked on top of the coheed video, an even worse edit project,

162
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,260
which was the audio book, and I'm glad I did it, I'm actually very glad that I made this

163
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,740
audio book, I'm really happy with how it's come out, and the fact that it's out there,

164
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,780
by the way, um, I'm not making a video about it, but it's on my Reddit, on the our Digi

165
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,860
Bro subreddit, um, I might put a link to it in the description, if not, go find it, um,

166
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,060
it's called Tales from the End of the World Book 1, Scarlet City, it's a four hour audio

167
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:33,940
book, uh, and there's also like an hour and a half worth of podcasts I did about it, afterwards.

168
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,220
Check that out if you're interested, um, I don't really want it to be widely released,

169
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,260
but I do want to, like, sort of word of mouth spread it to make sure at least some of my

170
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,900
fans get to read it, uh, a few people have checked it out and their reactions were fairly

171
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,140
positive, so, uh, so far it seems to be a good time, and it's not that much of a time investment,

172
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:59,020
it's only four hours, even for the audio book, um, so, so yeah, I'm happy with how it came

173
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,500
out, but the editing process was such a fucking nightmare, because it was like, I got inspired

174
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,140
to do this all at once, and I just recorded, I just like sat down and in one sitting recorded

175
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,740
the entire thing, I just sat there for four hours and recorded an audio book, and then

176
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,500
I had four hours worth of audio that I now had to edit, which meant removing every stutter

177
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:28,260
and fuck up, and every, like, uh, tightening up spacing, that was the worst part, is that

178
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,500
like, you know, I wanted to make sure it flows well, because if it flows like garbage, then

179
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,700
it's just gonna be even worse of an experience, but it's not a good book, it's not work I'm

180
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:44,700
proud of, it's, I mean, I'm proud of it, but like, it's a six year old novel that, that

181
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,700
I never edited or revised at all, and like, it has tons and tons of glaring problems that

182
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,860
I'm well aware of, and so as I'm editing it, I just keep hearing lines that I'm like, oh

183
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,260
god, am I really editing this, am I really trying to make presentable, what is by all

184
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,820
accounts a not very good book that I know is not very good, uh, I just want it to exist,

185
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,380
and I'm not even releasing it widely, I'm just releasing it to like, an audience of

186
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:17,940
probably 15 people on Reddit, you know, like, why am I putting so much effort into this,

187
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,420
and because it's such a huge project, then even when I did like, pluck away at it a little

188
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,780
bit, you know, over the course of a couple days, it's just, it's so long that like, I'm

189
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:33,380
gonna have to put it on hold to go do the pub crawl or to go do something else, so yeah,

190
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,780
it was a nightmare to have this fucking four hour long burden over my head, and I finally

191
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:45,780
defeated it with the, the, the masterful technique that Dick Masterson came up with of the three

192
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,500
beers, I gotta tell you about the magic of the three beers, you see, I've always known

193
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,340
and I've, I've preached that editing is easier if you're a little drunk, like a little, at

194
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,180
least a little tipsy, you know, have a beer or two while you edit, because it, it helps

195
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,940
to numb the part of you that doesn't want to do it, like you, you still have enough

196
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,420
cognitive ability to do the job, because it's not hard, editing is not like, I don't think

197
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,300
editing takes a ton of thought, like you, you can pretty easily figure out what you want,

198
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,340
and it's rare that you come across something that's like, hard to do, that's like something

199
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,260
new that you haven't done before, usually you know what you're doing, and so it's just

200
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,860
a matter of plugging and playing, like hitting, you know, okay, this is the, I need to find

201
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,940
this clip for this line, I need to find this moment, I need to time it right, you know,

202
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,700
and all that can be pretty easily done without needing like a, like, you know, your full

203
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,940
brain, which your full brain is just desperately trying to rip itself away from this and do

204
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,020
anything else, it just wants something to stimulate it, and to not pay attention to

205
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,300
this editing, it wants to go to Twitter, it wants to go anywhere else, but when you numb

206
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:01,860
that part, when you numb your brain just a little bit, so that it can deal with doing

207
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:08,380
something boring and menial for hours on end, editing is way easier, and I've always known

208
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:14,700
this, but Dick Masterson came up with a formula for it, like a revelation, I mean, this man's

209
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,380
been a lifelong alcoholic, so he's in his late 30s, he truly has had time to perfect

210
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,620
this technique, but he said, three beers, he said, you know how I got through all my

211
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:32,100
emails finally, three beers, you know how I deal, like any situation that you need to,

212
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,100
you're like, I don't really want to do this, but I need it to get done, three beers, two

213
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,140
beers, not quite enough, you know, he said, you know, drink three beers, I think you can

214
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,900
drink three in the process, like for me, I usually start after like half of one beer,

215
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,700
that's enough to get my mind sort of in the game, to prep myself that like, all right,

216
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,860
just numb it a little bit and get it in there, you know, but the third, you can't go above

217
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,300
three, that's the important part, if you break over three, you're gonna get drunk and you're

218
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,580
gonna get, that's when you get dumb, that's when you get too dumb to actually do the thing

219
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,340
you're trying to do, but three beers, it has to be light beers or like relatively, you

220
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,660
know, not, you can't drink a strong ass beer and think that three is gonna keep you under,

221
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:27,180
you know, but you drink three relatively normal beers and you'll be good, and it's worked

222
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:34,180
wonders for me to the point that I'm now becoming an alcoholic, but I drank three beers and

223
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,620
made it through the entire rest of the editing and finally put that fucking chapter behind

224
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:48,140
me, all the let's plays are up, all that four hour fucking Q&A thing I did out of nowhere,

225
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,260
thank God I was able to edit that quickly, you know, like, because that's the thing,

226
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,820
I've got, oh, I'm working on this audiobook, maybe I'll do a 50k subspecial, oops, it's

227
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:07,620
four hours long, you know, what am I gonna do about this, you know, so yeah, I knocked

228
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:14,660
it all out, I got all of it done, and now I can start fresh, this isn't to say that

229
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,260
every single project that I have is, that I have open is complete, you know, and I closed

230
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:29,100
off a couple, I closed the finisher fail, not finisher fail, I closed off what's it called,

231
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,820
the board of second chances, and I closed off random ass recommendations, which I don't

232
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,300
know that anybody was like holding me to that anyways, because it had been like two months

233
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:47,500
since I did the first one, but I closed those off because they were kind of overkill, and

234
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,220
I can open them up later, but I was like, I need, there's certain series that I want

235
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,140
to start on that need to get started, and those ones are getting in the way, so what's

236
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,420
great about having like a clean slate of finishing all the old work is that I can like really

237
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,980
focus on, okay, now these projects that I want to get started, I can start on those,

238
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:15,180
you know, so there's a few, there's some, I have a few musical projects, I have a bunch

239
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:20,020
of musical projects that are unfinished, those ones though can kind of wait, I'm not in any

240
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:26,740
huge rush to finish my musical projects, because they're always kind of in a, there's kind

241
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,860
of a different mindset I approach those with, we're like when I make music, it's like getting

242
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,260
inspired specifically in the moment to work on it, it's not something I view as like a

243
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,900
project I'm continually working on, my music, you know, it's completely non-monetary and

244
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,060
has nothing to do with the rest of my career, it's really just something I do for fun when

245
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:51,100
I feel like it, so my musical project's not withstanding, there's only one, no, two videos

246
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,700
that I have footage for that are incomplete, one of them is the start of the new version

247
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:04,820
of Finish or Fail, and the other one is just this clip I took of a magazine thing that

248
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,060
I haven't quite decided what I'm gonna do with or if I'm gonna do it, I just have the

249
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:13,020
clip around, but all the podcasts are clear until now, now we've got this one, but that's

250
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,660
okay because, you know, there's nothing else there, keeping me from it, these are easy

251
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,140
to edit, they're not a big deal, and all the Let's Plays are done, so I can start up a

252
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,660
new Let's Play show, I've got an idea for a new show I want to do that I'm like, this

253
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:34,540
is one of those things where I got an inspiration the other night, like I had an idea for a

254
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:41,540
show that I suddenly was like, oh man, that's a really cool idea, I'm not gonna record anything

255
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,420
for it, because if I do it, it's just this audiobook's never gonna get done, this co-heat

256
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,620
video's never gonna get done, I just have to muscle through these fucking videos, these

257
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,940
shitty idiotic videos that I should never have taken on, I just have to muscle through

258
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:02,940
them, I want to become someone who finishes what I start, I never have been that guy,

259
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:11,380
it's always been a huge problem for me, it's always been so hard, and I really felt like

260
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:18,420
I got started on that road with the asterisk where it sucks, and it was very important

261
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:25,460
to me that most of it was written before any of it came out, like I wrote, I think there

262
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,460
were seven parts, no, there must have been at least four or five parts written before

263
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,140
I sent any to DeVoo, and I know there were eight parts written when the first part came

264
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:43,140
out, and then from there I continued writing it until the end of the year, and yeah, it

265
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:50,860
had to be so far along that there was no way I'd stop, that's the only way I could feel

266
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,260
comfortable letting it start to come out, because I'm always so worried that anything

267
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,540
I launch is not gonna finish, because that's how it's been in the past, if you were a follower

268
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:06,820
of my anime blog, which I don't know if anyone who listens to this was, I launched so many

269
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,860
projects, and they were always big, it would always be some huge thing, like, oh I'm gonna

270
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,420
review every single one of my favorite anime, I'm gonna review everything on my on hold

271
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,220
list, all 100 shows, I'm gonna randomize them out of a hat, though I built a randomizer

272
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,900
of show, there was one randomizer I had was I wrote the different years down on scraps

273
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,460
of paper, put them all in a hat, shuffled it, picked out a year, and then I had to watch

274
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,340
whatever show was on my on hold list from that year, now that I'm thinking about it,

275
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,580
this is actually a great idea, and I should do it again, because I only ever did one video

276
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,380
of it before, and it would be better than randomize recommendations, not one video, one text post

277
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,380
I mean, you know, I had this awards show, like, oh anime awards, I'll give an award

278
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:01,620
for each thing, the best show in that category, I think I wrote three of those and then gave

279
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,900
up on it, like, out of the 20 rewards I was supposed to give, it's just a, lots of episodes,

280
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,660
I'm gonna blog every episode of Utana, I got through three, you know, I'm gonna blog

281
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:19,660
every episode of Lane, I got through six, and you know, when I started doing anime videos,

282
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,220
that was one of my first goals was let's be someone who finishes projects, and that's

283
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,140
why I did Lane first, it was like, out of all the projects I had left unfinished on

284
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,660
my blog, that was the one I most wanted to finish, and so I did it, I mean, I completely

285
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:39,020
redid it from the ground up, but it was the same concept, and I fucking, and it almost

286
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,900
didn't happen, like, after the first four, I started doing like other videos, and like

287
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,380
they got slotted in, there was like these little vlogs that came out, I started concentrating

288
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,780
on other stuff, and I started to feel like, eh, the Lane videos aren't as, like, they're

289
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,380
not coming out as great as I wanted them to, but whatever, it got done, that was what

290
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:02,420
mattered, you know, and, and, you know, I've completed a bunch of projects since then,

291
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:07,740
I don't, I don't know that I've had any projects that had like a definitive amount that was

292
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,180
supposed to happen that have stopped, like, people keep asking me like, when are you gonna

293
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,580
do episode two of Interesting Anime Protagonists, and like, the thing is, I never had much

294
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,060
of a plan for that, like, I really had exactly two ideas, one of which I wasn't even that

295
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,260
excited about, I mostly just wanted to make that one video, and I thought that no one

296
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:34,260
would click on it if it was called like, you know, like, stoic anime characters or whatever,

297
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,340
like, or, or like, if I tried to give a name to that phenomena, then nobody would click

298
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,420
on it, but if it was just called Interesting Anime Protagonists, and then it was suggested

299
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,020
that this was just one type of Interesting Anime Protagonist, then people would click

300
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,420
on it, but I've never actually had a plan for how to continue that series, really, um,

301
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:58,700
and I still only have one other episode idea, but, um, but stuff like cool character designs

302
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:04,620
have kept coming out now, you know, um, there's a few that I need to do more of, but none

303
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,860
of them were that like, rigidly defined, whereas there's stuff like, there have been video

304
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,780
projects that have just died because I didn't get it edited in time, you know, where like,

305
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,700
I eventually lost interest in the concept or just thought, uh, this project's too big,

306
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,460
I can't actually finish it, you know, I want to become a guy who finishes things, and I've

307
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:31,220
got one really massive project that I'm kind of at the advent of, like, I'm a bit into,

308
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,260
you already know what I'm talking about, like, I guess I should also become someone who can

309
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,940
finish videos I've spoken about, because this has been a huge fear of mine, because it used

310
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,020
to be that any time I talked about a project, it wouldn't get done, um, this is especially

311
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,140
true in the pony days, every time I had a big video I would talk about, it would never

312
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:56,380
get made, um, and so I've been like terrified of that ever since, but like, right now, the

313
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,180
big project that I have is the shaft one, you know, and I wrote Akuki Shinro in the

314
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,380
early 2000s, which is like the lead-in to Dissecting Shaft, which is supposed to be like a 16-part

315
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,740
series about all the shaft shows, and you know, I'm gonna have to start on that at some

316
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,500
point, but like, I want to become the guy who can finish that, even though I've talked

317
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:23,700
about it, even though it's a huge daunting task, I want it to exist, and I need to do

318
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:31,340
it, I need to become the person who can do that, and um, I feel like I'm, I feel like

319
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,420
I'm getting there, you know, I've got another cool little idea, the one I talked about earlier,

320
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,740
which now I get to do it, like I had this great idea for a video, and I said I'm not

321
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:47,580
gonna do this until I edit the rest of the audio book, and until I finish the Kohiid

322
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,060
video, and I did, and it also was like a test of, you know, because another fear I have,

323
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,340
the reason I launch into projects on top of each other so quickly is because I'm always

324
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,100
scared that if I put it off, I'll lose interest, you know, I want to get these things out there

325
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,700
while they're fresh, but like, now I've had a couple days and it's like, yeah, this is

326
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,820
still a good idea for a video, I should still do it, you know, fuck it, let's fucking launch

327
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,220
this video idea, it'll be cool, we'll see what happens, we'll see where it goes, it

328
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:20,420
may or may not become a series, we'll find out, um, but yeah, so that's, that's where

329
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:27,900
I'm at today, I finally finished all my outstanding projects, uh, I could probably, by the time

330
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:34,260
this podcast comes out, because I think I've been recording for about 30 minutes, so this

331
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,300
will probably be a couple days late, because I'll have to have more things to talk about

332
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:45,180
before this gets published, but um, by the time this is out, maybe I'll have those last

333
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,020
videos I mentioned that are, that are like, you know, that I, that just kind of have the

334
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,620
early workings, maybe those will be out too, maybe even the cool idea I'm hinting at, maybe

335
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:03,060
you'll already know about it, um, so yeah, I'll see you then, and, and also in the next

336
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,340
part, I don't know, I'm very tired and kind of delirious, uh, from editing this fucking

337
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,980
co-heat video all night, um, so, yeah, whatever.

338
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,580
Uggghhh.

339
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:24,220
So here's a first for this, uh, podcast, I actually just listened back to the previous

340
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,380
part, before recording this part, just to make sure I wasn't gonna repeat myself too

341
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,340
much, or to remind myself exactly how I presented these concepts that I was talking about, not,

342
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,580
not usually something I do, I usually listen to these, um, after I've uploaded them, not

343
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:46,900
even really during the editing process, but, um, I wanted to expand on some of those things

344
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:54,180
I said, and, uh, readdress some of it, because now that I've, you know, now I've done more

345
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:00,660
projects, I, with that liberation I felt from having all my projects finished, I then immediately

346
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:06,460
launched into more projects, and it was interesting, I kept them, because of that pileup I just

347
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:12,940
experienced, I put a lot of, um, I really wanted these to each be done before the next

348
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,180
one started, like I kind of slotted them one after another, so, after the co-heat video

349
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:25,540
I did that Hamtaro one, the Handfuls of Zen, which may be a series, I don't know how long

350
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:31,940
of a series it'll be, or how frequent it'll be, but, um, I'm excited at the idea of it,

351
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,340
it's, basically the idea is that it's a Game Boy Advance show, and, um, because Game Boy

352
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:43,660
Advance is kind of, I see it as a console I'm the most connected to, it's, it's like

353
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,580
games that are, I don't want to say it's like my favorite console or anything, or even that

354
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,020
it has a lot of my favorite games, it's just that the games are very well suited to my

355
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:57,260
interests, in terms of I really love the graphical style, um, there tend to be simplistic and

356
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:02,660
short, which is helpful for me, and I've played a lot of them, like the era that I played

357
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,060
the most video games was probably the Game Boy Advance era in my childhood, so like I'm,

358
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,860
I'm very familiar with the console, and with like all the classics, you know, a lot of

359
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,700
consoles I had, but I didn't have the classics that everyone remembers, and I, I did for

360
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,100
the GBA, as well as some more obscure games, and I have an interest in obscure ones, so,

361
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:25,700
um, so I thought it'd be neat to do a Game Boy Advance show, but I don't want it to be like,

362
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:33,060
I just wanted it to be as not obvious, or, or something that, that I'm like beholden to as

363
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:39,300
possible, I wanted it to have a title that doesn't really say, this is about the Game Boy Advance,

364
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,220
you know, like, Handfuls of Zen, once you get it, you're like, oh, okay, because it's a handheld

365
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:49,780
console, um, and also the episode numbers, I didn't want there to be numbered episodes, because

366
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,940
there's something that holds you, when you have like episode one, and then episode two,

367
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,060
then you suddenly feel like this has to reach a certain number, like there has to be a certain

368
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,220
number of these, and they have to come out at a certain rate, like, because when you think episode,

369
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,020
you think weekly, you know, you think, oh, well, yeah, episode one, so episode two comes out next

370
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,900
week, or even monthly, um, as a lot of uploaders are, you know, more infrequent, at least this is

371
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,180
how I think, I don't know if anyone else thinks this way, but like, I, I go, I usually go way

372
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:23,460
out of my way to avoid episode numbers, unless it's a series that I really don't care about that

373
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,260
much, like most of my, uh, my finish or fail style things, the ones where it's like me just sitting

374
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,340
around watching something, and I'll give it like, you know, spin the crunchy roulette number five,

375
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,220
because why, there's nothing else to distinguish it, like, I'm not gonna list every show that we

376
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:42,340
watch in the title, so it's just a way to distinguish that it's not the same one you already watched,

377
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:47,380
sort of, um, but I don't really care about if those series, you know, reach a certain number of

378
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,500
episodes, because they're kind of like a, like a joke anyways, in the first place, um, or just

379
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,740
for fun anyways, so with, with handfuls of zen, rather than giving it an episode title, the number

380
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,260
is just the number of the game, because every Game Boy Advance game has a number, for some reason,

381
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:12,020
they all have a number between zero, zero, zero, one, and two, eight, one, zero, I believe, in, in

382
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,900
order, so yeah, they're all numbered, not sure why, but I've just posted the number as the episode

383
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,740
number, and I thought that was a really fun and cryptic way to do it, um, I've been pretty inspired,

384
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:29,460
there's one video by Shallow Rewards that was, that really wormed its way into my mind, and, and

385
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,860
really interested me on a deep level, because it's something I'd never completely thought about,

386
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:42,020
which was about people hiding their work, about deliberately making things that aren't meant

387
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,220
for mass consumption, that are meant for just the people who would care about it to see it,

388
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:54,660
and I feel like it's something I've always been interested in, and I've, I've made lots of like

389
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:00,420
alternate blogs and alternate sites that I don't connect to myself in the past, not so much anymore,

390
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,780
these days I really want my core fans to be able to find a lot of my stuff, but I don't, I don't

391
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,420
necessarily want all of it to be like widely distributed, you know, I really do want it to

392
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:17,700
just be those core fans, um, you know, back in the anime blogging days, I had my main blog, which,

393
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,060
when it was first made, was called Digital Boy's Anime Blogging, then its name got changed to euphoric

394
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:29,140
field after I watched F A Tale of Memories, then it got changed to Fuzakenna, once I bought a domain,

395
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:35,300
and then it got changed to my sword as unbelievably dull, once I got rid of the domain and went back

396
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:42,580
to just being a wordpress blogger, yeah, quite a trajectory, but in the meantime I also had side

397
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,820
blogs, some of which I was like posting just completely other alternative stuff that just

398
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,900
wasn't in the same style as the main blog, not that the main blog had a very defined style,

399
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,860
but for instance, at one point my blog was on hiatus and I deliberately decided to put it on a

400
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,860
three month hiatus, like I even said at the beginning, like this is how long I'm going on hiatus 4,

401
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:08,820
and I took a break from anime pretty much entirely, but I got really into manga, and so I just kind

402
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:16,340
of created this entire other persona who was a manga guy, and his blog was called Is That You

403
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:24,420
Motiliata, which is a line from a Mars Volta song called This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed,

404
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,900
and the tagline of the blog was this manga must be unearthed, you can still find the site,

405
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,100
isthatumotiliata.wordpress.com, good luck spelling that, unless you look up the Mars Volta lyric,

406
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,500
but the the the writer was named Se Di Se Bisante, which means is this a bison,

407
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,860
which is from, or this is a bison rather, yeah, this is a bison, not a buffalo is the name of the

408
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:54,420
album by Omar Rodriguez Lopez, who's the guitarist of the Mars Volta, so everything's kind of themed

409
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,100
around the Mars Volta and Omar in the in the titling of this of this character and site,

410
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:06,580
but on this website I was just writing about manga in, but in like a character that wasn't

411
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:12,340
like me, it was a much more like polite and upstanding figure, because my blog was always

412
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:18,420
extremely crass and in your face, and there was swearing constantly and perverted humor and stuff,

413
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:24,740
and like I just, I always had this very in your face personality, and I thought that if I tried

414
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:31,300
to write in another style, if I tried to like bring in a series that wasn't quite the same, then

415
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,780
people would just, I mean everyone knows it's me, so they wouldn't really see it as like another

416
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,820
person, they just see it as me doing a weird affectation that is clearly not how I normally write,

417
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,580
and that was what I was concerned about, so I made an entirely new site,

418
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,980
new blogger, you know I got it, there's this, I don't know that it had like any readers,

419
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,020
I had a few comments here and there, because there's this anime blog aggregator that people

420
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,420
used to use back in the day called Anime Nano, and you would try to get your, if you had like a

421
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,660
decent number of posts, you could get onto Anime Nano and it would just post your stuff up there,

422
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,300
and you could get some clicks that way, it was a decent way to get a little head start,

423
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,500
so I had gotten onto Anime Nano and I think I had a couple readers,

424
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,580
but I really was just doing it for myself, like I was just blogging manga in this very

425
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:30,660
in-depth and interesting way, the posts were all like medium length, it was always like

426
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:37,140
probably between 500 and a thousand words, not very long, but they would break down the artwork

427
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:43,620
in manga, and it was written in this very polite normal tone that was nothing like me at all,

428
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:50,740
and yeah it was just a matter of like I didn't want this to be the same crowd as my main blog,

429
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,900
I just wanted it to stand on its own, and if you know whoever took an interest in it would take

430
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,340
an interest in it, regardless of it being something I made, now eventually I gave up on the blog,

431
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,740
it only lasted probably like mostly it was only active during the time I was on hiatus on the

432
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,740
main blog, and then I posted like a couple more times there, and then eventually I imported all

433
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,060
those posts back onto the main blog, so they are still, they're all on my blog and on the original,

434
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,740
and I've had other times where I kind of compartmentalize things differently and

435
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:25,300
split things into different places, and I still do it obviously with DigiBro versus

436
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:31,940
DigiBro After Dark versus this channel versus my Reddit board, you know everything has its own

437
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:40,500
place, and this idea of deliberately, like I guess it never occurred to me, like with that

438
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,380
manga site, it wasn't like I was trying to not let it get popular, I still would have liked it to

439
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:51,060
be popular, I just didn't want it to be associated with the same writing style as my main blog,

440
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,500
and I'm sure eventually I would have revealed that it was the same guy or something, or if the

441
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,300
other blog got more popular I would have probably jumped ship and just become that guy, but

442
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:10,580
but like making something and then hiding it, like not wanting it to get popular, like

443
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,060
putting it somewhere where I don't want, I'm putting it somewhere that only people I want

444
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:23,460
to see it will see it, that was something I hadn't given too much thought to, but it makes perfect

445
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:31,060
sense to me, because so much, there's so much stuff that, that like, you know I don't want everyone

446
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:37,060
seeing certain things, like and this is the case for my audiobook, which you know this podcast

447
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:41,940
right here only has 5,000 listeners, which to some people would seem like a lot, and to me

448
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,620
seems like not very much, because it's you know, politically compared to my other channels,

449
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,180
but those 5,000 listeners, the kind of things they're listening to on this show,

450
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,740
they're the kind of people who can appreciate this book, who I'm okay with hearing it, you know,

451
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,420
or the people who are on my Reddit board, that's where I released it, is on Reddit, you know,

452
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,980
I'll probably link it to my patrons at the end of the month post I'm gonna do,

453
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:10,900
those are people I can let the story be heard by, because again, this is a very odd story that

454
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:17,460
was a portrait of who I was when I was 19, it's not me currently, you know, and yet it is, like

455
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:24,820
there's a lot of me in it, and you can still tell I wrote it, but, but you know, it's not polished,

456
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,260
it's not something that was made consumer-ready, I recorded the audio book just so that it would

457
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,020
get out there, even though the book itself was never finished, you know, it's got missing

458
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,220
chapters, it's got plot holes, it's got just stuff I would completely change,

459
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:46,500
as you can hear detailed in my podcasts, so yeah, I decided to hide it, I decided not to put it on

460
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,260
Digibro After Dark, because I don't want to read comments about what's wrong with this book,

461
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,980
because I know what's wrong with this book, it was written nine years ago and never edited,

462
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,180
I know exactly what's wrong with it, you know, I have no desire for it to get out there and try

463
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:10,340
to have a life of its own, and increasingly, I don't know how much, I want a lot of things to do

464
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:16,180
that, you know, for me like a post on Digibro is one that I'm trying to, like there's a reason

465
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,180
that so many of the videos that go up on Digibro are about like trying to change the public

466
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:28,180
conversation, like Digibro is almost like a like a rallying cry channel, like every video I post

467
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:33,540
is like me trying to affect the way that the masses talk about anime to some extent, you know,

468
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:40,900
it's it's maybe a little pretentious even, but like there's always that tone of hey I wish you

469
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:47,060
all would would talk about it this way, you know, hey why don't we stop talking about subversions

470
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,860
because it doesn't fucking mean what you think it means and it's obnoxious and it just shows that

471
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,380
you haven't read enough shonen manga, you know, like that's the tone of that video, so those things

472
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,460
should be out there, those things are meant for the masses, they're meant for me to they're me

473
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:08,980
trying to change the cultural tide, but not every not every little thought I have, not every little

474
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:15,380
like this podcast is not meant for the masses, this podcast is meant for whoever it would interest

475
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,300
and I've always had this mindset that you have to cast a wide net in order to catch

476
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:29,300
you know the fish you want, right, like let's say that there are 5000 people out there who would

477
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:38,740
enjoy my audiobook and if I only cast a net around 5000 people and 50% of those turn out to not be

478
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,500
people who would like my audiobook then you know I'm only getting half of what I could be getting,

479
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,660
so if I cast a net that's 10 times wider maybe I'll catch all 5000 of those people but I'm also

480
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,260
gonna catch a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't that doesn't care, you know a whole bunch of people

481
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:01,460
who don't care or who actively dislike it and like because I've always had that mindset of like I

482
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,460
want everyone who could possibly be interested in this thing to see it then I've never taken a step

483
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:13,300
back and gone like well I mean in the end people are gonna miss out on stuff they would enjoy,

484
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:18,020
that's just a fact of life there's too much shit out there that you would enjoy and for me as someone

485
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:24,420
who collects recommendation charts like as a fucking hobby I know this all too well I have like

486
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:32,340
hundreds of books and movies and video games and comics that I'm never gonna get to even though I'm

487
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:38,660
sure I'd like them but like you know unless unless the fucking singularity happens and I get my life

488
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:44,020
extended by a hundred years I'm not catching up on all this stuff and I shouldn't be necessarily

489
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:51,220
trying to catch every single person because I don't really need them like I'm I would like it if

490
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,980
everyone who would like my stuff would see it but I don't need everybody who does so to do so like I

491
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:02,420
can be satisfied with a couple thousand views and like a hundred comments on a video that's like a

492
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,940
great amount you know if I can make a video like uh like this mindless self-indulgence one I just put

493
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,780
out you know and it's a concept I've had for years I mean I even thought I did this whole spiel

494
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,820
in a in a halo let's play once but no one watches the halo let's plays you know no one watches the

495
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:27,380
the digi and friends let's plays um so like that whole spiel even though I'd done it before

496
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,260
a lot of people hadn't heard it and I wanted to make it its own like nice glossied up video

497
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:38,900
and I will say I'm glad I did the coheed one just for the experience of figuring out how it would

498
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,540
look like how a me talking about music would come out if I tried to throw in clips and stuff

499
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:50,020
because the MSI video was a breeze to edit I legit recorded it and then edited it all in one sitting

500
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:57,140
it was like maybe three hours four hours from concept to completion and uh that's rare you know

501
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,380
for for something that that's that's that heavy on editing for me to just like immediately grind

502
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,140
it all out but it was because I was excited about it because I thought I made my point well

503
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:10,740
there wasn't a whole fuckload of factual inaccuracies or weird shit it wasn't an hour and a half long

504
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:16,340
you know it was exactly what I wanted it to be concise and and well made and I did it and I was

505
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,900
like yeah that coheed video gave me the experience to figure out how this would work and it worked

506
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:28,180
really well um and just seeing you know a handful of comments that are like either wow I've liked

507
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,660
this band forever and I didn't know this stuff that's cool or man you really got me interested

508
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:37,460
in this band that I had never heard of before or like uh that's an interesting take on the

509
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:42,340
kind like just a few comments like that is enough I don't need it to be like seen by everybody I

510
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:47,300
don't need it to have a hundred thousand views that would be nice for making money but I have a

511
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,980
channel for making money you know the digi bro channel is for making money the patreon my you

512
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,900
know a lot of the people on patreon are people who watch like all my stuff and they're paying for

513
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,420
just me existing essentially you know I only really need the core audience the ones who are the

514
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:07,060
the patreon the patreon people are the people I really need you know I still make by far most

515
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:12,740
of my money on patreon not so much through ad revenue because I don't go out of my way to make

516
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:18,900
all my videos super monetizable and it's funny because I could do it I'm like I feel like I was

517
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:25,460
born and bred as the perfect youtuber in a way because uh there's this recent game theory video

518
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,860
about youtube's changes that they've been implementing that like everyone's been freaking out

519
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,460
because youtube's been changing their algorithms and stuff and game theory did a video that like

520
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:40,020
explained it in concrete terms and kind of put a lot of the rumors to rest well at least you know

521
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:45,060
attempts to but basically the way that youtube is working right now is that they're not only

522
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,900
rewarding retention time which is something we've known about for a couple years that youtube

523
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,180
rewards you for the length of time that people watch your videos but now they're also

524
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:59,140
rewarding you for coming back every day now I'm somebody who puts out hours of content

525
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:06,500
every single day I'm perfectly primed for this you know but the funny thing is that I almost

526
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:12,020
released them in a way I wouldn't say deliberately but the way I release videos does not optimize on

527
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:18,340
this ability if I had everything on one channel like just said fuck it to all these weird divisions

528
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,660
and all this like all this like concept of how I want these things to be released and I just put

529
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:28,100
it all on one channel and released it all at the rate I do I think it would actually like balloon

530
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:34,340
in success I think that like if all of this was just on digi bro everything I do is just on digi

531
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,820
bro I think it would actually maybe not everything you know keep out the rap videos and all that

532
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,900
weird shit that can stay on after dark but if a lot of these vlogs I've been doing we're up there

533
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:49,940
a lot of these podcasts I think it would become more successful and uh and make me more money

534
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:56,900
through ad revenue but there's also sacrifices in doing that because all those big youtubers who

535
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,580
are concerned about this they're the people who make their money mostly through ad revenue

536
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,860
like the only reason to be worried about youtube changing its ad revenue rules is if you make money

537
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:10,660
through it I don't really worry about ad revenue I don't even check it like I get the money in the

538
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:16,340
mail once a month and then I'm just like oh oh I guess I made money through ads this month you

539
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,340
know like I don't even think about it at all because I really just worry about the patreon

540
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,500
I really just worry about the the fan payments because that's not only is it the biggest

541
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,420
source of income those are the people I care about you know I care about the idea that I'm

542
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:33,860
making something people want to pay for more so than that I'm making something that will make money

543
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:41,140
and what those people lose out on all those big youtubers is their comment sections are garbage

544
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,860
you can't get any real feedback you know you've got way too many people vying for your attention

545
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:51,620
the whole internet becomes hard to deal with I've I've been there I've been in that position like

546
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:56,020
even though I was not as famous like when I was big in the brony clique it was really like

547
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,660
like I couldn't talk to any any bronies unless they were other video creators because they they

548
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,540
see you as like this celebrity guy it's a little bit this way in anime too like if I head out

549
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:13,060
if I were to head to some forum somewhere or like just talk to people casually on the internet they

550
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:18,020
come in with a huge amount of presupposition about me because they see the funny thing is that the

551
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:23,060
people who are really into my work I don't think see me as much of a celebrity like you guys anyone

552
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:28,660
listening to this podcast you probably see me less as a celebrity than people who barely know me

553
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,540
people who only know me as like a guy with 250 000 subscribers and they've seen like maybe one or

554
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:40,260
two of my videos they see me as like this whoa it's digi bro that famous anime youtuber you know

555
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,780
when I did the wave motion cannon podcast like the guy who was like uh josh he was like shocked

556
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,740
he was like wow I'm actually talking to you and I'm like uh yeah I'm a guy who reads anime blogs

557
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:56,100
I'm an anime blogger of course you're talking to me why like I read your fucking website read

558
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:01,620
everyone's website you know um that's the kind that's how I feel about it and I feel like the

559
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:07,460
people who engage with my content who know that you can find me in the comments you can find me on

560
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:13,540
my reddit you can find me on my patreon you know I don't respond to everything but you know I'm there

561
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:19,060
you know I'm not some like untouchable celebrity off somewhere who doesn't you know even like have

562
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:23,140
the time to engage with fans even though I don't read the comments on the main channel anymore

563
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,860
but that's exactly the issue that channel's too big I can't read the comments on it anymore

564
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:32,980
when a video gets over a hundred thousand views you can pretty much say goodbye to nuanced discussion

565
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,860
in the comments and don't get me wrong I still get lots of great comments on there in fact I'd say

566
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:43,940
more so than bad ones it's just that people have less context the more the more a video gets big

567
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:49,140
the more people are watching it who don't know me and the people listening to this show or listening

568
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:54,980
to the the the after dark show they know a lot about me they have a lot more context they know

569
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:58,660
kind of what I'm about what kind of comments I'll respond to you know like what kind of discussions

570
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:04,340
I want to have on the internet a lot more so than people who come in for just one video and and are

571
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:11,860
lacking in that context and um and that's something I value I like having a dialogue with my audience

572
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:17,140
I to me it's always been about the depth at which someone appreciates something not so much how

573
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:23,780
many people appreciate it you know I don't that's why I'm not a like a pop guy I'm always I'm boogie

574
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,580
pop I've said this a thousand times that like pop is all about appealing to a lot of people a little

575
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:35,620
bit whereas boogie pop is about appealing to a smaller number of people a lot and uh and that's

576
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:42,900
what I hope that I do and you know I know from my fans that I do in it so it's it's really great for

577
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:50,260
me that I was able to put out this novel that I wrote six years ago and um and a few people listen

578
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:57,380
to it I didn't even I didn't expect like the most I expected to listen to this is like at the absolute

579
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:01,140
most even after this podcast even after all the any time I mentioned this book because I'm going to

580
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,980
mention it probably a few times you know I'm going to mention it here maybe I'll mention it here or

581
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,300
there on after dark and I'll definitely mention on Patreon the absolute most people I expect to

582
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,780
ever listen to this book is like maybe 30 and that's including my offline friends you know Victor

583
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:23,940
has already listened to it um Ben and DeVu probably will at some point so so yeah like I I don't

584
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:29,140
expect a lot of people to listen to it but the second I had like two opinions about it I was

585
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:34,020
satisfied like it was all worth it as soon as like I was able to have a conversation with Victor

586
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,340
about my book that I wrote all these years ago that I've never stopped thinking about you know I got

587
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:43,540
to have a conversation about it I get to see I get to read people's reactions to this book I don't

588
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:49,860
care you know how many people see it I don't care how many like how deep these reactions are just

589
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:54,580
wanted there to be some reaction just wanted to know does anyone like this does anyone care about

590
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:59,460
this is this interesting at least you know and the responses have pretty much been yeah it was

591
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,700
pretty interesting all right yeah I kind of liked it you know like that's basically what all the

592
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:08,180
responses been there's been like five or six people who've commented on it on reddit and uh and

593
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:14,100
that's enough then that's enough to make it completely worthwhile and maybe there's going to be more

594
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:19,300
stuff that I kind of hide a little bit and handfuls of zen to bring this back because I'm sure you

595
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:27,060
forgot that this is what I brought this up for is like a pseudo hidden video because it's not

596
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:36,100
the Game Boy Advance show it's not a review of ham ham heartbreak you know it is handfuls of zen

597
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,900
it's on the digi brother dart channel the people who are going to watch that video

598
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:47,300
are mostly going to be my fans I don't want it to be I don't want it to escape into the hands of

599
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:53,460
video game fans and I mean if I have one let's say I cover like the most popular gba game you know

600
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:58,580
and I have nice things to say about it and and some some new people come in and most of them

601
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:02,420
will probably just react to that video but maybe a few of them will become fans of the show and

602
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:07,140
watch the other stuff and find it interesting that's great you know I love getting new people on board

603
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:14,180
but what I don't want is that I put out a video called Castlevania aria of sorrow review and I

604
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,340
make some negative comments about it and then I get a bunch of people showing up to complain

605
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:24,900
funnily enough the coheeding cambria video it has some of that like not so much in the comments

606
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:31,220
but I it some coheeding cambria fan twitter like it was like hashtag all things coheed I think was

607
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:36,580
the name of it something like that they posted it up and they were like uh see how far you can make

608
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,700
it into this video before closing and they tagged me in this post and then of course all these

609
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:47,220
responses come in I didn't even make it 30 seconds well this guy seems like a total asshole like

610
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,340
people who literally know nothing about me who know nothing about what the video is supposed to be

611
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,700
or the context surrounding it they just clicked on a coheed video they interpreted it as negative

612
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:04,260
and they freaked out that's why I have to hide some things you know and that video is not even

613
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:10,180
like made to be super public I mean I did give it a relevant thumbnail and title so but I even

614
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:14,900
called it a fans retrospective specifically so it wouldn't be taken that way like I originally

615
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:20,020
was gonna call it coheeding cambria what happened but then I was like that makes it sound too like

616
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,980
like like I'm trying to write an article or something like something more objective if you

617
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:30,260
will whereas if I put a fans retrospective it makes it more clear this is a personal story you

618
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,660
know and I and I try to like really in the early part try to be really fair about the idea that

619
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,500
like this maybe the band's not even gone to shit maybe it's just me you know I go I go on a lot

620
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:43,700
about that but you know on some level the video has to stay hidden because the video is not for

621
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:50,020
coheeding cambria fans that's not who the audience was intended to be it's just me telling a story

622
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:56,020
about a band that I that I like you know it's more about my narrative it's more for my fans to just

623
00:57:56,020 --> 00:58:01,620
see something kind of fun and cool about some band they maybe have heard of or maybe not um

624
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:10,820
so yeah that's why like with this hand with the samples of zen thing it's it's it's really about

625
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:17,700
it I wanted it to be its own thing it's not the gameboy advanced show it's that video is not a

626
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:24,820
ham tarot video it's my video that uses those elements and I think that that that is kind of

627
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,860
what I get out of something like shallow rewards where that show has a title shallow rewards you

628
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:35,540
know it's it's not just the name of the guy making it like it is a show unto itself it has its own

629
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:40,420
style and none of the videos are just about the thing he's talking about it's about his presentation

630
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,300
of the thing he's talking about and the cult of personality that is his you know his writing

631
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:54,100
so that's kind of where I find the value in hiding things and um and it's really a privilege I have

632
00:58:54,100 --> 00:59:01,140
because I have a main revenue stream and I think there's a I mean don't get me wrong I think there

633
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:06,740
is somewhat right now a fetish is a fetish is fetishization is that the word yeah okay it seems

634
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:14,340
like it needs more syllables there's currently a fetishization of working uh like making money off

635
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:20,260
of art like I think because there's more people who are able to do it online now than like everyone's

636
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:25,060
chasing that and I don't think that used to be like as common of a thing I think it used to be

637
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:30,100
that there were a lot more people who worked normal jobs and did art just because they enjoy it and

638
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,260
that it was never meant to get big and you still see this like there's lots and lots of let's say

639
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:41,300
like cover bands for instance if you ever go see like um a few of my god probably close to a year

640
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:47,780
ago me and a couple of friends went with my mom to some bar where some 80s hair band cover band

641
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:52,980
was playing and it was just like like a bunch of 40 year old guys who get together every probably

642
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:58,900
month or so and do a bunch of covers of hair metal songs because they want to and it's fun and they

643
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,220
get to hang out with a bunch of people at a bar and get drunk and it's a good time and I think that

644
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:11,700
maybe everyone is trying to be like their own celebrity and to make like a whole career out

645
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:16,660
of art now and they think that that's the only way to do art as opposed to just doing it on the side

646
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:22,180
because you want to which is a great way to get started and I mean if you think of my career in

647
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:27,540
terms in like a full scale that's what it was for the longest time you know my anime blog was never

648
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:33,780
intended to take off I wrote it for seven years before it got before it took off and um and now

649
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:38,820
I've been writing for over nine years close to 10 if you you know count my my anime blog as part

650
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:47,540
of it or my channel rather so yeah like I feel like people need that kind of build up time and

651
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:51,780
everyone's just trying to like launch a career out of art immediately out the gate and some people

652
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:57,940
are lucky some people can do it some people manage to get that either through having good

653
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:03,220
connections or just being incredibly talented right when they start but I think everyone

654
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:09,940
else is looking at those people and trying to be them and I think that because I've been lucky enough

655
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:14,500
that I had such a long time of build up and then I did launch a career through art and because it

656
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:20,820
manages to make enough money that I don't have to work at it constantly I actually have time to do

657
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:25,540
other projects that are just out of passion that have nothing to do with making money you know

658
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:32,180
nothing on digibro after dark is ever made to make money with the like one exception of the ghost in

659
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:36,260
the shell video because I thought it would be really funny to see if it can make 100,000 views

660
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:43,540
and it did so like nothing else on the channel is oriented around making money the procrastinators

661
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:49,140
channel is not making me any money you know this these videos these decompression chambers I can't

662
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:54,500
like I monetize them but they're they're not even on my channel you know it's connected to Nate's

663
01:01:54,500 --> 01:02:01,300
account um Nate has said that he eventually wants to like split up all the pcp money amongst all of

664
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:06,100
us once it's like actually made some money and he's collected it but like you know I'm basically

665
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:09,940
just doing this for free I mean the most it would make us would be five dollars an episode for for

666
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:16,020
these decompression chambers but like you know I'm not making any money off of this I'm just doing

667
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:20,500
it because I feel like it I'm just doing it because it's something I want to do um and I wrote the

668
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:26,100
I did the audiobook you know for an audience of spend a week editing it for an audience of what

669
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:33,620
will probably at most be 30 you know 30 people I'm doing all these things that are just they're just

670
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:40,020
for me and uh and that really is a privilege because a lot of my friends are trying to become

671
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,820
successful you know they're trying to make a job out of it um even though some of them are just I

672
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:51,620
mean because it's not a job yet they're just doing it on the side for now but like it's because I make

673
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:55,940
enough off of those videos that it doesn't have to be a full-time career I don't have to be I don't

674
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:02,740
have to make it so I am getting out a 20 minute video every single day on a main channel just to

675
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:08,420
make a buck you know which is what like all those big youtubers who are complaining now that like

676
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:13,060
that youtube's algorithm is not working out for them you know they only have to complain about

677
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:19,460
that because of the fact that they have to make ad revenue dollars you know and I don't I I'm privileged

678
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:26,020
to not have to do that I get to have um you know my own system that works for me because my fans are

679
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:31,780
willing to pay for it so yeah I'm lucky enough that I get to do whatever the hell I want um which

680
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:36,820
is exactly what I always wanted my career to be so it's really beautiful for me

681
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:52,100
so the other benefit of having released that audio book is that I got to spend a lot of time

682
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:58,260
thinking about it and thinking about my writing uh my fiction writing that I used to do because for

683
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:05,940
a very long time that was my goal was to be a fiction writer and um sort of what incited me to go

684
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:12,020
and do that book and let me know if you find this an interesting concept which I know a bunch of

685
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:19,380
people are gonna say yes regardless because it's a video I suggested and I've never been like hey

686
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:24,020
does anyone find this interesting and had nobody say yes because someone's always gonna find everything

687
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:31,700
interesting but I had this idea that I would record a podcast just explaining all my old stories

688
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:37,140
like I was just gonna go through one by one and find every old story I'd written like every concept

689
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:43,300
I had uh and like half written first chapters and stuff and just uh explain all of them and I

690
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:49,460
thought this would be a fairly simple thing but then I started going through all my notebooks

691
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:56,180
and I realized I have a shitload of stories that I was coming up with back then like I mostly

692
01:04:56,180 --> 01:05:01,460
remember a handful of like the most uh you know the ones I got the farthest with and because it's

693
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:06,900
been such a long time since I quit it never occurred to me like just how many fucking ones I had

694
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:12,660
I found like one page that's called like ongoing projects and there's 30 stories on that page

695
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,660
and then I like found all these other ones you know I'm just like going through these notebooks

696
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,980
that have all these fucking character bios all these little short synopses and stuff some of them

697
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:26,340
are like the title of a story on a page and like one line of description of what it would be

698
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,420
but other ones are like these whole fleshed out universes and shit and I was like holy

699
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:37,380
fuck I had so many fucking ideas um I spent so long trying to do this and um you know even

700
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,860
after my novel I wrote a few more things before I finally gave up on the whole novelist thing

701
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:48,820
but rereading the book really reminded me of like where my actually I won't even say reminded it

702
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:54,580
taught me where my strengths lie as a writer because back then I you know I wasn't a professional

703
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:59,380
I wasn't as good as I am now I wasn't as good of an analyst as I am now you know I can analyze

704
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:05,220
my own work just as well as I can analyze anybody else's uh but you know back then I was much younger

705
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:10,340
uh wasn't as critical didn't know as much about like what makes good storytelling or good writing

706
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:15,460
and now I can look back at that book and be like huh you know I I I have kind of a knack for

707
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:22,580
character writing and construction and like giving characters distinctive voices um and I have some

708
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:28,180
pretty pretty good dialogue some of it's corny as shit but there's moments where the dialogue is

709
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,540
really interesting and I of course could do it a lot better now because I have much better taste

710
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:37,300
um you know there's a lot of potential there like when you read through it you really feel like man

711
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:42,500
if this guy had kept writing he'd be great and that's my brother explicitly said that Victor

712
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,340
listened to it and he was like you know it's not really bad at all and he was like if you had been

713
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:52,100
writing fiction the way that you've been writing blog posts like if you had kept doing it all this

714
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:59,140
time you would be as good at fiction as you are now at analysis and I was like yeah that's true

715
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:04,180
like I would be I would actually be great at fiction if I kept doing it this whole time um I just

716
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:10,980
didn't and then but it's it's weird because it's not like I haven't been writing you know like even

717
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:15,940
though I'm writing in a different field I feel like a lot of the skills I have from this can easily

718
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:21,460
be reapplied to fiction and like now that I've kind of analyzed my story and thought about like

719
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:28,180
huh well if I just did this like if I cut out this element like you know uh I was never good

720
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:33,780
at constructing like um strong narratives I was always good at like character interactions and

721
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:38,180
more slice of lifey kind of stuff because that's more of what I was interested in at the time anyways

722
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:44,660
um I'm better at like constructing a scene that means something about a character like the the

723
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:51,140
development kind of aspect and not so good at creating a plot and uh for some reason I was always

724
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,980
stuck on the idea that I really needed a plot back then even though so much of what I liked

725
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:01,300
didn't really have a plot at all but now I know how to write like much smaller stories not everything

726
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:09,860
has to be like some big deep sci-fi concept like it was in that book and so uh I think I could do

727
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:13,540
it a lot better like I think I could take all the elements I was great at and construct something

728
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:17,380
new and so I'm just kind of looking at this book and looking at the reception it's getting which has

729
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:23,140
been all positive I mean it's only a handful of my closest fans who have read it so it's not like

730
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:27,060
I'm gonna get these huge negative comments but I was really shocked by how much like my brother Victor

731
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,900
liked it you know um who like there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff about this book that it

732
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:38,100
would be easy to hate and people didn't hate it as much as even I did like I was really harsh on it

733
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,500
when I first read it and I recorded a podcast about it and then I did a follow-up podcast where

734
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,460
it kind of softened up because I'd had more time to think about it and been like yeah I guess it

735
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:50,740
is kind of interesting now I think about it um and so all of that's kind of inspired me that I

736
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:57,300
might get back into fiction I'm I've been coming up with more like I was I came up with a story

737
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:03,300
concept I like I'm gonna maybe try to run with it and see where that takes me and see if I can get

738
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:11,460
back into fiction because I guess I was shocked by how not shit I was I expected to be more shit

739
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:16,660
and I wasn't that shit and I feel like I could improve improve quickly and I have plenty of time

740
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:24,820
like all it would take away from is probably time spent doing I don't know decompression chambers

741
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:30,900
or something or or all these fucking podcasts I mean I've even with the crazy amount of output

742
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:36,180
I have I still spend hours out of every day just kind of like laying around fucking staring at the

743
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:43,300
ceiling you know um so it's not like I am completely maximizing on my time although I will say I've

744
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:50,420
been working a fucking lot lately definitely a lot more than I ever have before these days I've been

745
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:55,620
much more of a workaholic but there's something I guess this is how I'll end this is by explaining

746
01:09:55,620 --> 01:10:03,300
this last thing that like back in April um we had me and Davoo we had finished the asterisk

747
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:10,580
suck series in like January February that area um and the patreon got high enough that I could

748
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:16,820
start paying him full time where like it became his job he left his job and became just my editor

749
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:23,780
because I was able to pay him enough to make it worth it you know and so when he first joined me

750
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:28,420
as a full-time editor I wrote out a schedule for the month of April I believe it was April

751
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:35,540
and it was five videos I think there was one and a half I think that I'd written before the

752
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:39,140
month had started two of them are videos I'd conceptualized a long time before and then the

753
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:44,740
other ones were like new it was interesting anime protagonists uh the how hayami isaki

754
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:51,380
maps the setting the the one about stray little devil what else was there I think there were two

755
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:58,980
more um I think maybe what is the appeal of anime was that month and I think there was one more

756
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:03,700
but I had these five ideas oh cool character designs shimanetta I think that's the last one

757
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:10,580
and um I I not all of them were fully written I had a couple written I sent those to him and

758
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:14,500
then I was writing the rest over the course of the month but it felt so good to have a plan

759
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,340
because I'd never gone ahead with a plan like that I've never had a full month planned ahead

760
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:23,700
until that point um I usually was like you know coming up with a concept writing it immediately

761
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:29,380
making it and then having to come up with another concept I was very rarely working ahead of myself

762
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:34,580
so April was the first time ever that it was like here's a whole schedule and we'll make each video

763
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:39,700
has a deadline for when it's going to come out I have to have it written by a certain date and

764
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,900
then you have to have it published by a certain date you know and we did it we kept to the schedule

765
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,060
the whole month perfectly the next month we did something similar it was a more simplistic

766
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:55,220
schedule because there's only four videos which is one a week we got it done and um we didn't

767
01:11:55,220 --> 01:12:01,220
keep doing that every month because eventually uh there was like a month where I only had one video

768
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:05,940
I just didn't want to do any of these concepts I had and then we did rad con and then divu moved in

769
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:10,500
and then it became like this frantic hectic schedule but then for the month of november

770
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:19,860
I won up to myself because I wrote all of the november videos in october all five of them

771
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:25,300
were written before the month even began and that was a whole new level this wasn't just

772
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,700
scheduling it was a whole new level of this I talked about this in a previous decompression chamber

773
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:34,020
and as a result the vu had his work cut out for him all the way up until just recently and like

774
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:38,580
I wrote the the like because we pushed back the shonen video that was supposed to come out in

775
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:43,940
october we pushed it back to december so that one um yeah we got all the november videos we

776
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:48,020
have the first december video done I really only need three this month I'm gonna do like a month

777
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:53,700
ending post on patreon so I already had the next one written back in october and now I just need

778
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:59,220
a third one for december basically what I'm saying is that I got so far ahead of myself in november

779
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:06,900
that I'm like that I'm so that like now I have there was no rush there was no rush to finish the

780
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:11,620
december work in in november and there's still no rush to finish the december work even halfway

781
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:16,100
through december because I was just that far ahead of myself and that's given me time to do

782
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:20,580
all these other projects all these other weird little things like this audiobook like handfuls

783
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:28,260
of zen and it's kind of like man I'm I'm fast enough and good enough at coming up with concepts

784
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:33,860
and I have such a wealth of ideas that I could do this forever like I can always be this far ahead

785
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:38,100
of myself and I can always keep coming up with new things and why that's so valuable why I'm

786
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:45,140
explaining that is that that is the environment in which I can write a book or write fiction or

787
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:50,980
write or make more music or learn to draw finally like those are all things that the

788
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:55,860
reason I haven't done them is because I'm scared of them taking away from my career I'm scared

789
01:13:55,860 --> 01:14:02,660
that if I can't work on my main series videos then then you know that that will deteriorate

790
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:07,700
while I'm trying to work on this other shit but if I can have and this is what the this is what

791
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:12,020
I've been advertising on patreon from the beginning like it always said like the the highest goals

792
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:17,540
were always if I make this much I can do other things you know I can do bigger crazier things

793
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:25,380
and if I can continue to do something like you know what if I get two months ahead of myself

794
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:30,020
you know if I have two months where the video is written before any of them come out I can do

795
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,620
whatever the fuck I want for two months two months is enough time for me to finish literally

796
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:39,780
anything you know I wrote a novel in in a in a month before I wrote the asterisk war sucks in a

797
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:45,940
in a month and a half you know um I could do I could do a novel in one month and polish it the

798
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:53,300
next month I could design uh you know I could write something and then illustrate it the next month

799
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,620
you know like something like that I could do crazy bigger projects by getting so far ahead of myself

800
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:04,260
and always having that like that knowledge that I'm good enough to make that happen and I don't

801
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:08,340
think I would have been that good at any other time before like this is how I know I'm improving

802
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:15,220
because those five videos were all good like if I tried to write five videos in like six days which

803
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:19,620
is how I did if I tried to do that even at the start of this year they would have all come out

804
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:26,180
shit I mean if you look at the october thing where I did the video a month a day all month in 2014

805
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:30,580
most of the videos are not worth going back to there's like a small handful that are

806
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:34,180
but like most of them were just like little throwaway things that had nothing to do with

807
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:40,420
anything that were just me trying to rush through the month um if I did that today I could I mean

808
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:45,540
this is what I was trying to do at the time that I wrote the the five videos I was gonna write a whole

809
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:53,060
fucking uh 15 of them I think 15 or yeah it was supposed to be 15 but I ended up writing the ones

810
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:58,740
that I was the most interested in and then leaving the rest on hold but like they all came out as

811
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:02,820
fully fledged videos that I was completely proud of not one of them do I think though I have anything

812
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:07,780
negative to say about I loved all five of those videos they came out exactly how I envisioned

813
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:13,620
pretty much so um that's something I can only do now and I really feel like I'm reaching a point

814
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:18,180
where I can do all these things creatively that I've been dreaming of for years now

815
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:25,060
um and so maybe you'll see the fruits of that in the near future um

816
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:34,500
this is a very upbeat podcast probably uh compared to the last two I think the the last one was me

817
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:41,300
complaining about uh not having not getting laid not having a girlfriend um which incidentally

818
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:46,500
I just like after that podcast I just completely forgot about the online dating thing and went

819
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:52,420
back to what I was doing which is making videos and drinking constantly and the week before that

820
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:58,980
was the depression chamber so this is a pick me up this time yeah yeah back in the back in the

821

saddle the good old fun digibro saddle you know we're we're having a good time again I hope you

822
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:14,500
enjoyed this video I hope um I hope you are not one of my friends who is currently creatively

823
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:21,620
unfulfilled and is now stewing in bitter uh anger over my success I hope you're having a good time

824
