00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
Hello everybody, PCP, hi it's me Gibb. This is The Pro Crastinators Podcast, we're here with Ben and no one else.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:28,720
PCP, if indeed such a thing exists, hey, fuck, I just heard a beep in my headphones. I'm gonna fill a buster for like 30 seconds while I plug my headphones in

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:43,440
and try and kill some time where I'm talking before I can hear you again. Okay, I'm back, I'm back, good. Podcast works.

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,480
So yeah, this is the PCP, The Pro Crastinators Podcast, assuming such a thing exists as of right now.

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:04,720
Oh yeah, the channel's been destroyed, it's gone. Yet again, and nobody knows why, no reason given.

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,120
No reason given, I mean that's part of the course, if you're given a reason it's probably like a bad thing.

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:19,440
Yeah. They're actually paying attention like they're trying to kill you for real, but because they're doing their general thing of like, you're just gone.

8
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,720
Yeah. Submit like a thing like fine, I guess we'll be back in some amount of weeks.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,680
Until then I guess this will be on my own, my own Ben's channel I guess.

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,360
Or maybe not. Maybe we won't be back in a matter of weeks. We just don't know.

11
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:45,200
God, I'm like nervous about uploading it. I'm like nervous that if we upload this they'll like take punitive action against wherever it's uploaded.

12
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,360
Why would they do that? I mean, I just don't know.

13
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,360
I mean, that's what they did like when Monkey got deleted, right? They just like deleted all the new channels he started to make.

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:09,360
Right, they also stopped doing that. I think that was because Monkey was being investigated for a specific reason, like oh he's making school shooters real again.

15
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,640
Like oh, he's the cause of it all. It's like that was like a strange thread they were following.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,480
I don't think anything like that has got anything to do with us. I think it's just one of the generic

17
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,680
something or others happened and YouTube did not actually check to see if it was valid or not and they just said oh yeah, go on.

18
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
It's a bit weird though because it's like it wasn't a strike. It was just like termination immediately.

19
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,200
There was no strike. Just the channel is gone at about 4.30 in the morning

20
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,880
and then when you look it says it's the terms of service violation

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,640
and there's a little like form email saying should I read what the form email says?

22
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
Yeah, just if it's got no info that's important.

23
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,680
No, no, no, no. Let's see. It said something about like illegal activity.

24
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Like encouraging illegal activity or

25
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:28,000
where was the other thing? Here, YouTube account notification. We'd like to inform you we've received a complaint regarding your YouTube account to the Procrastinators.

26
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,560
Upon review, we've determined that your activity, the activity in your account violates our terms of service linked to the terms of service.

27
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:43,360
As a result, we've terminated your account. We don't allow content that encourages illegal activities or incites users to violate YouTube's guidelines.

28
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,280
The only depictions of such activities that we may allow need to be educational or documentary in nature and it shouldn't be designed to help or encourage others to imitate them.

29
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

30
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Yeah, so I read that and I was like...

31
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Wait, wait, wait. You are prohibited. You are prohibited from accessing, possessing or creating any other YouTube accounts.

32
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,160
I missed this part before, but it says that at the bottom. What the fuck?

33
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
That's, that's insane.

34
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
Uh, yikes.

35
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
I mean, when they say you, they don't know that this is a shared channel. Like, do they just mean

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Nate or what?

37
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,280
What, what, what, I don't know that action. How could they take action on that?

38
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,960
Like if I posted this into one of my channels, well, but like I'm not the procrastinators. Well, but here's

39
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,880
Okay, I guess what makes me nervous is like they say here you are not allowed to

40
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,840
make new YouTube channels or own other YouTube channels. If we upload

41
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
some content that is clearly meant for this channel,

42
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,600
then that, I don't know. I don't think it's likely that anyone would like notice,

43
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
but I think there's,

44
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,960
I think that would be considered like we're getting around YouTube guidelines and they might take punitive action. I just, it seems plausible.

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,040
That seems plausible to me that they would take, they would punish us for the same no reason that they've given here.

46
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,120
Uh, uh, it encourages illegal, I mean, I'm not sure,

47
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm not sure if this is specific to like our complaint. This encourages illegal activities or uses, incites users to violate YouTube guidelines.

48
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,760
That sounds like it was chosen specifically or auto-generated specifically based on what our, our crime was.

49
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,440
Um, I don't know that, but it seems specific.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
It said, it said we received a report, right?

51
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,440
Uh, oh, well, reports. You're right. It said

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,640
we've received a complaint regarding your YouTube account.

53
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Upon review, we determined

54
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,760
blah blah blah and we don't allow current, yeah.

55
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:51,360
Like had issue with something that was said on one of the many videos on this channel. I'm gonna guess it's more recent.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,440
It could just be like you were puzzling. It could be like a holdover from when Brad had the channel.

57
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,200
But that was like content ID strikes, so that would be something different.

58
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,080
Um, but also there were a few people who were like flagging the videos in an attempt to get Brad off our channel.

59
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,800
Yeah.

60
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,120
So that could also still be it. It's like we don't have any information. We're just gonna

61
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,320
figure it out.

62
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,200
We don't know if like, yeah, we don't know when the complaint was filed. Could have been could have been two months ago, three months ago.

63
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,880
Don't know. We don't know what it was filed, what video was filed in response to

64
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
how many of them there were.

65
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,040
I mean,

66
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,400
apparently

67
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,720
they quote unquote followed up like apparently they quote unquote checked

68
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
and

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,560
agreed with whatever the complaint was, but I don't actually believe that any any human being like looked and checked at all.

70
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
No, absolutely not. No.

71
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,480
Uh, it's fucked. It's very fucked. Um,

72
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,360
I all right if if you're worried about like re-uploading we can just put this out as an mp3

73
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,880
We we have like an iTunes feed. We have we have a procrastinators website if like like

74
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,880
It before until we know exactly what the fuck is going on. We can release this in non-youtube areas

75
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:21,600
Yeah, sure. Yeah, true. Yeah, sure. Yeah, true. Yeah, sure. Yeah, true. Yeah, yeah, I know it's yeah true and sure

76
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Yeah

77
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,720
Shut up. Okay, I'm sorry. Um, but yeah the the channel I mean

78
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,920
My my first thought was it was the um

79
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,880
The stream we did. Yes, where we talked a lot about killing cops in now

80
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,080
Uh, yeah, none of us advocate literal murder obviously

81
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,400
But it could be taken like that if you don't have any understanding of of like context

82
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,400
To be honest, it was my first thought too is is this about the charity BLM support stream? Which

83
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Wouldn't that just be fucking amazing?

84
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,040
If that were if that were what did it? I mean, wouldn't that be

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,960
I mean, it would be a goal. It would be a great

86
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Marketing ploy to get us back is saying. Oh, you think black lives don't matter. Huh, youtube?

87
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah

88
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Huh, is that what you think we don't

89
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
But they won't they're they won't they we don't know we don't know if that's we don't know

90
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,760
I mean, so like if it's not that there's no reason to go down that

91
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,720
Path of like accusing youtube of something. They're not doing that's just gonna make us look stupid

92
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
inciting um

93
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:49,120
What what what was the description inciting something or um encouraging illegal activities or inciting users to violate youtube guidelines?

94
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
I mean, that's

95
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,120
That seems like maybe that would count maybe someone

96
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
thought it was terrorism

97
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,760
Thinks that like it's like an antifa terrorist stream or something

98
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,840
I mean, it wouldn't be that surprising to see antifa and they think oh, it's bad

99
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,960
Yeah, well, I didn't mean the stream didn't say antifa

100
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,720
I mean, I might have like joked about it in the stream or something. It wasn't like tifa blm

101
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
I mean some people think blm is a terrorism. Yeah

102
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
I don't know man. I I guess if I had to bet

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,560
I would say that yeah, it was probably that stream which is fucking amazing. Um

104
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
And like obviously should not have been flagged or such a thing

105
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
But

106
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
We just don't know

107
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,760
Nate has supposedly appealed the suspension, uh, which they gave you the option here to do

108
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,480
Um, he he didn't I kind of wish I could have seen what he submitted

109
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Uh, oh

110
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Well, what are you what are you just the same sort of stuff he posted the last time but the bread thing

111
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
It's like just as much information as you can. Please could you get back to us as soon as possible?

112
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,080
You know email shit. I don't know if they're

113
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,360
You know, I don't trust I don't really trust Nate to like be on top of this

114
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I mean, maybe you don't

115
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Well, I trust him to be on top of like administrative email shit

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
I

117
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,240
Well, I mean this is important for him as well. This channel is obviously it is but like he he was pretty

118
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,000
I guess it worked out in the end last time, but he was pretty like

119
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,360
he was pretty like lackadaisical about like

120
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
how many like

121
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,080
Like he he didn't want to make tweets about like the the the channel getting hacked for like a week

122
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Last time. I don't know. Yeah, I still don't really understand why

123
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,600
Like something about like keeping his like his feed for the audience like clean, but it's like

124
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
I don't know. I mean of what?

125
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,600
Uh, of I don't know. Okay, I don't I don't know either. Um, so that's that's all I mean

126
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
That's all I mean when I say that we should um

127
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,760
I mean, we can do the tweeting ourselves. We can't we can do the tweeting we can do the tweeting ourselves, but like that's

128
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
uh

129
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,680
Lol

130
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,120
Pcp's dead

131
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,000
Nobody even shows up. This is just us. I was I was so hype

132
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,800
Like like not hype as in like a good just sort of like getting like adrenaline

133
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,960
Thinking like oh, it's just gonna be me. It was gonna be me until two minutes before

134
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Like the the cutoff point

135
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,560
I'm I was thinking. Oh, okay. I'm gonna be I'm gonna be doing the thing myself. Okay. I'll

136
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm sorry. I was gonna I was gonna have a whole spiel about like the pcp is just me now

137
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
Yeah, every like everyone like I don't expect

138
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,520
Like you were the only one I would have expected to show up tom isn't on that much munchies never on

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Digi is very rarely on jesse is very rarely on yeah, and that's it

140
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,600
Uh, it's just me. It's it's you

141
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,800
I would say I would say I'm more on more often than you are right. Would you agree with that?

142
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,600
Uh

143
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,000
I guess I don't really pay you too much close attention to that. You're like usually on

144
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,920
um

145
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,280
I'm usually on I'm almost always on at least on the normal episodes

146
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,920
Is it Nate is never not here like that's so that's wild to me. That's wild to me that he's not here

147
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
When's the last time he's missed an episode?

148
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
It was a while ago. What's he fucking doing?

149
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,920
What I think I think it was it was a similar thing to this where I was here and then you were here and then

150
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,200
I think they came in late and so well, maybe jesse came in I can't remember

151
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
I feel like there was one time when I was in your position

152
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
And poised to be the only one

153
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,560
On an episode and I was like, oh, what am I gonna do?

154
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,120
What is this episode gonna be about? Yeah, one of these days it's gonna happen. Yeah, and it's gonna be a historic moment

155
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,640
And it's gonna be really funny. That'll be the straw that broke the camel's back. Um

156
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Nobody. Yeah, nobody shows up

157
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:17,520
If the uh, we've we've been we've been dwindling and I don't know why I genuinely do not understand why why uh, uh

158
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
More people don't feel like

159
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
They ought to be here

160
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,400
regularly, I mean I can I I I can see why they don't it's like digi only comes on when she has something

161
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
she wants to talk about

162
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
and

163
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
You know, she doesn't like just

164
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,800
Casual chat. I mean she did but now she does that with me and that was like that was like when may appeared

165
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Did you just stop talking to us a lot?

166
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,560
Uh, you think so? I don't know. It's been so long. I don't know if I even remember what that was like before

167
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,960
Well, I mean back in the old days when we were all cool

168
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,680
We would talk in the pcp chat so much that every single day would be like a like a fucking wave like a

169
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,560
10 hours of like discussion that I would I would wake up to and I'd scroll through it

170
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah, my thoughts at the bottom now. I do that in other discos the pcp chat is sort of

171
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,280
Completely dead and it's not a bad thing really. It's just that

172
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
um

173
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,400
There's there's not a lot of discussion going on between us. Um, I mean

174
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,560
Yeah, there's there's less. It's not that we like we

175
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
It's not that we never do that

176
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,200
Uh, it's it's it's gotten more rare though. I mean, it's definitely more rare than it used to be

177
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
I don't know if I would call like

178
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,040
May showing up the reason why it went from like more talking to less talking. I don't know if there was like a hard

179
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,600
Not not not like entirely just did you specifically? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I guess so

180
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I guess that's probably true

181
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,960
Man, you know munchie wants to focus on school. Jesse just wants to be away from the internet entirely

182
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
It's like people have reasons

183
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,800
I mean, you don't I don't understand the wanting to be away from the internet thing

184
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,200
You don't have to like look at the comments or anything

185
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,800
You can just show up and record an episode and then leave and like that's fine

186
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,400
That it takes like two hours out of your week. I don't know. I just don't know

187
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,840
What everyone's thinking what went wrong. It makes sense to me to me. It's obvious. I should be here and so I do

188
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,520
I can't empathize with other people's perspectives

189
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,200
That's a symptom of autism they say

190
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Yes, so there you go

191
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,320
So to to save this podcast being about itself. I have a topic. Okay

192
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Um, I am fucking

193
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,200
terribly

194
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,480
Fucking exhausted arguing politics in

195
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,320
The social media areas that I frequent. Yeah

196
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,920
It is it is a dreadful slog

197
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:04,960
And I I see now why people are so angry. It's not because they think other people are the devil

198
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,520
It's just that the small minutiae of like getting someone to

199
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,120
You know getting to the same page like getting to level one with someone

200
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,120
Is so fucking taxing because everybody is distrusting and antagonistic towards everyone else

201
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,720
Yeah, everyone assumes so much of your position based on what the talking points are

202
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,960
They they consolidate your you know, if you're saying a leftist thing and a moderate is like

203
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,120
I don't believe that leftists are good because of these various instances of leftism being bad

204
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,240
Therefore I am going to ascribe all of that bad stuff to you and I'm not going to trust anything you say

205
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,600
And I'm going to assume that you are going to be the worst kind of person

206
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,640
Yes, and they just don't read the thing I'm talking about. They don't read the words that come out of my mouth

207
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,760
And it makes it so fucking difficult to just

208
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,040
Converse people always talk about let's just have a discussion, but they don't want to

209
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,200
Even consider the idea that the person they're talking to is not the worst

210
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,200
type

211
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,880
It could be quite a nuanced person

212
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,840
It could be like a you know one of the good ones you could be talking to right now

213
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,800
But if you just go into it expecting to hate them

214
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,920
Then you will and I will hate you back

215
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,560
And I'm so fucking tired of trying to be the mediator the moderate man that gets people to talk to each other

216
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
I can't do it anymore. I quit

217
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,800
I got really mad at my roommate yesterday and I yelled at him and I was a big jerk

218
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,880
Because I was kind of doing that. I don't know. He said he we were having like a

219
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,640
Discussion about cops and he said one thing that was a little more that was a little like

220
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,920
It wasn't it wasn't even he wasn't even being pro cop that would be wrong to say

221
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,160
He he said like one thing about it that I didn't agree with and I like

222
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
Really lost my cool and made an idiot of myself

223
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,800
Uh lamal very funny very very epic. No, it's not funny or epic ben. You're a bad man. It's true

224
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
You gotta ran it in you gotta be like

225
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,280
Well, that's that's the problem is that if you it's so much less taxing

226
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:18,560
To go crazy and ballistic and just let whatever reaction comes to you immediately be the one that you go with rather than

227
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,360
Holding yourself back thinking about it and then approaching, you know with more neutral terminology

228
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,680
Because it just it just wears down on you if you talk to everyone like that everything becomes a long drawn out fucking

229
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
Everyone says

230
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,480
Ben instead of getting mad and being insulting. Why don't you just why don't you just like

231
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,040
Engage with them. Why don't you just like be nice and like show them they're wrong?

232
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,120
Why don't you show them they're like politely demonstrate how incorrect they are?

233
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,640
Like that's not really hard and and like taxing to do

234
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,960
Like really like annoying and difficult and doesn't work most of the time even no matter how well you do it

235
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,040
Uh

236
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,320
Anytime I don't do that. It's because I'm like, I'm just not willing

237
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm just not willing to do that to put that work in for someone. I don't think deserves it

238
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Uh, yeah

239
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,560
Yeah

240
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,200
It's hard. I just I I don't know really what

241
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,120
Like direction to take either. I just stay silent on issues and just let people do whatever

242
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,720
So that I don't wear myself out or I

243
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Let myself get mad

244
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,400
And respond to people like no, you're so fucking stupid. I'm not even gonna talk to you like I don't want to say that

245
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,880
I don't want to be the guy that does that. No, I sometimes it feels like everyone hates me

246
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Yeah, so it's like

247
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,880
I don't want to know what it wants to be. I've been sane. No, nobody does take my take my

248
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,480
Uh, uh heed my warning ebonyzer

249
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,320
These chains these chains were forged in life

250
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Uh, yeah

251
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Be nice kids

252
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
um

253
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,840
That goes for both sides. I like sure sure

254
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Like a person on the right

255
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,240
Who who assumes that because I'm not on the right or I'm on the left or whatever

256
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,760
I mean such broad terms, but like yeah, generally speaking. They will like assume that I am like

257
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,440
a social justice warrior out to get a gotcha moment

258
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
and but

259
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,640
um

260
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,160
For me to assume that they assume that before they've shown their hand would also be wrong

261
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
I need to like and engage with people

262
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,480
normally

263
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,160
Uh and see if they they do things that are like, okay

264
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
He's not he's bad faith

265
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
argumenting right now

266
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,000
And sometimes I try to push through because a lot of the time you can't tell the difference between

267
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
you know someone who's

268
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:02,960
Legitimately only thought about it a little bit and they're just asking legitimate honest like uh sincere questions

269
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
about stuff

270
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,160
Like they've heard a thing and they're like i'm i'm not quite sure about this thing

271
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
and if you attack them

272
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,800
They're gonna have a bad experience with you and it's like it's just

273
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,000
You gotta you gotta handle everything you gotta walk around so many fucking eggshells

274
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,480
And then some of these eggs, they're not eggshells. They're just rotten eggs

275
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
Sometimes you step on rotten eggs and eggshells

276
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,120
You know and it's like you can't you can't win sometimes it sucks

277
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:39,920
You know it's a little related. Have you followed any of the shit that has gone down around jk rowling this week?

278
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:48,400
Uh, I followed it vaguely. I know that she is uh what you would describe as a turf lamal and um

279
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,560
I

280
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,160
But I can't like off the top of my head. Remember what she'd said about things

281
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,040
I've seen you responding to tweets. I hate that guy that guy that guy. Uh, what a guy

282
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,640
Uh, the the the reminds me

283
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
What what you were just saying reminds me of is that all right, so

284
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,640
I mean, I guess we can go over what happens if you think it's interesting to to mention but like

285
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,880
uh, Rowling

286
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,280
Rowling says like turfy stuff Rowling says like trans people are you know in so many words

287
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,000
Uh trans people trans women are just like perverted men with a vagina fetish who want to jerk off in bathrooms

288
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,000
Like let's cut to the fucking chase. That's what she's saying. Uh, uh, that's that's that's the effect of all her words combined

289
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,040
um, so she says this and then

290
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
everyone in

291
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,960
Oh, did I just do it? I don't I really don't think that's a straw man. I really I understand like maybe it might seem like

292
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,920
I'm complaining about oh people like making assumptions about what I actually mean and strawmenning me

293
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't think that's what I'm doing genuinely. I think that's what she's what she's getting at

294
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,440
um

295
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,600
So she she says all this stuff that amounts to that basically and then

296
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,360
You show up and you you you criticize that or you criticize someone who agrees with it, right? Like this fucking loser

297
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,400
Uh, uh, uh, Graham Linnum Graham Linnum

298
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,920
Uh, uh, Linnum Graham. I I think it's pronounced Linnum, but I don't know. Um

299
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,520
Um

300
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,280
You glinner you show you criticize him or something you ask you innocently ask him

301
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,240
Why did your wife divorce you Graham?

302
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,200
Why tell us why your wife divorced you because in your heart because in your heart, you know that it's because he's like a weird obsessed

303
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,200
Uh twitter turf troll and like is just like a weird

304
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,720
Jerk and like of course you would divorce him if you had like a fucking brain

305
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,080
Yeah, I mean you say innocently us, but you know

306
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,320
That you're you're you're poking a protodam to see how he'll react. It's sort of like a yes a joke stir innocent innocent question

307
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,960
That anyone would want to know the answer to could have happened could come up in any in any casual conversation

308
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,040
totally reasonable

309
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
And everyone

310
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,040
Everyone is just like it's amazing. It's amazing how instantly it's like oh another loser

311
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,760
Oh another loser incel guy who hates women

312
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,840
They like cannot it's these like it's these like

313
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
it's these like

314
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,640
Dweebie guys

315
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,480
And and even more so it's like these like it's these it's these cairns

316
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:38,080
It's these white cairns who will who will descend and will respond like oh this guy. Oh, ha ha look how he hates women

317
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,960
It's like because you're criticizing jk or someone as a point like that's it. That's all it takes

318
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,560
They don't just they don't need to justify it at all. They can't conceive

319
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,680
They can't conceive that anyone would be would be here

320
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,680
Voicing any descending opinion unless you just thought that women were bad

321
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,560
And they and they shouldn't be allowed to talk if you think jk rallying is wrong about anything

322
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,560
The only possible reason would be that you are a misogynist

323
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,000
And I don't know whether it's literally that I think it's more that jk rolling

324
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
is framing whatever she's talking about as

325
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
you know

326
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,480
As like a women saying what I'm saying is a feminist women thing

327
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,120
And if you're against that position, then you're you know, you hate women if you believe

328
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,960
direct quote from jk rallying quote

329
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,320
If you think that trans women are women you are saying that

330
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
that that

331
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,240
quote that

332
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
natal women

333
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
natal women quote unquote

334
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,960
You want them to be molested in bathrooms

335
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,520
Jerked off over in locking rooms by creepy men who are just who are just pretending

336
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Who are just like who just like went through all the trouble of getting like hrt and like an id change and a legal name change

337
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
And all that shit. They're in there

338
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,880
Just jerk to jerk it, right? That's the only reason they would be

339
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,440
Uh

340
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,360
And and and direct quote direct. Yeah, this is what she said. She said I am jk rallying and you

341
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,800
This is how I type are a rapist by proxy

342
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,640
comma

343
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,040
sjw's comma ben saint you that's what she said

344
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,600
um

345
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,240
And that's it and that's it. Um, I hate I hate jk rallying. She is bad. She's always been bad

346
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
Everyone knows that she

347
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,680
fucking

348
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,200
Poops her pants on twitter like every other month by saying some dumb shit that everyone hates

349
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,760
Uh about harry potter or about fucking genders shit

350
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,680
So, you know just another in a long in a long and very epic line

351
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
Of that kind of thing

352
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
Just and then this fucking guy graham linem is just like oh my god

353
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,200
Someone more famous than me is also a fucking piece of shit

354
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,920
Just like me that makes me look better in comparison on on this on this. Oh my god

355
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,400
People disagree with it. Look how many fucking bigots there are the hate women. I'm gonna fucking come

356
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,400
And and he's you know, he's got he's just he's just he has he's hiv positive is what i'm saying

357
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,040
What is that true? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

358
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,200
That's probably why that's probably that's probably why his wife is laughing

359
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,840
That's probably why his wife divorced him honestly is probably because he was hiv positive

360
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,040
um

361
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,200
Because from the brain damage she gave himself from like jerking off

362
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,240
Oh, that's that's kind of mean of her to do from like jerking off and eating and eating poop

363
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,440
He gave himself brain damage and got aids. That's I know it's sad

364
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
It's sad, but true

365
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
And I won't turn away from reality

366
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,880
You'd think uh a writer would be able to write good tweets

367
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
You might

368
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,880
You might think so

369
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,000
Graham is very funny. Graham is very funny and cringe. Yeah, this is like supposedly a comedian

370
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,960
What did he write? I think I recognize one of the things he wrote the one everyone knows was the it crowd, which I've never seen

371
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Oh, yeah, that's funny. Uh

372
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
He didn't he co-wrote it didn't he

373
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
He he co-created it

374
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,840
He didn't co-write it at least that's not what I mean. Maybe he did that too. I don't know

375
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,880
Um wikipedia says he co-created it

376
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,760
Whatever that means

377
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
So he's an ideas guy. I don't know

378
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,400
could be

379
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,160
I guess I

380
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I guess did you did

381
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:47,520
Did you see that um all three of the uh main cast of harry potter rupert grint emma watson daniel redcliffe?

382
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,200
They said trans lives uh trans trans rights

383
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,320
Trans lives matter. Fuck off joe. Fuck off joe. Get fucked

384
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,200
Um, so he said um jk Rowling died. He said the the which is pretty cool the the the

385
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:12,160
Uniformity with which those people step in line and claim to sincerely believe that someone saying jk Rowling can suck my dick

386
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,880
Is a threat of oral rape. They all say it. They all love it

387
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
They think it's totally reasonable

388
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,520
To say something like oh jk Rowling is getting rate oral rape threats

389
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,960
Be just just because she said that sex is real and and women are real

390
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,200
That's why that's why people people threatened her quote unquote threatened her with oral rape by saying jk Rowling can suck my dick

391
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
inexcusable

392
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,680
Unfathomable, I mean it's it's it's it's the reductionist argument. It's like

393
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,760
The the consolidation of everything into one point that you can easily tweet twitters that is hell

394
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,680
It's the thing that is destroying our society destroy twitter. I would invite anyone

395
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,520
I would invite anyone if you're bored and you want to see if i'm right just just respond

396
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,600
With something really mean to gram linen

397
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,680
Just just say like something just say the like the worst thing you can

398
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,440
Like just try and try and make him cry because if you win if you you win an argument if you make somebody cry

399
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,880
Just just say anything to him that you think would hurt his feelings

400
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,200
Right and just like wait how long until someone says that you are a that you hate women

401
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,880
or

402
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,040
Something like that right any of the things i've just described right that you're like an abusive woman hating like toxic

403
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,720
man

404
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
But also an sjw snowflake

405
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
Or something

406
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,320
I mean, it's it's funny in this context and i'm talking about doing this only in minecraft obviously

407
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,200
Yeah, this is true. Obviously, obviously

408
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,720
Guys, ben sain. I think I think I think i'm worried about you ben. Yeah

409
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,800
I'm worried about you. I'm worried about you. Where are you headed? Where are you where your heads?

410
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,480
I'm headed might be a dangerous danger to yourselves and the people around me. I'm headed to the fucking i'm headed to

411
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,880
Fucking the end to fight the ender dragon in minecraft

412
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm i'm where i've got my i got my ender pearls. You don't understand and uh, you haven't been playing minecraft

You've been in a coma. No, I think that's not you're actually nate wake up mate

414
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:30,000
No, they added they added the dragon and the end and the withers and and these are new these are these are all things

415
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,120
They didn't exist before but now they've been here for years

416
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,520
And i'm playing minecraft. Okay. All right

417
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:43,920
Um boy, oh fucking boy. Oh, yeah, anyway, I did see that all the kids all the the kids

418
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
What are they like 40 now? Oh, wow

419
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,360
No, they're like all right. They're like 100 now. God. They're so old. God. They're like 30. They're like 28

420
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,680
Can you believe that like luna lovegood the actress is like a grandma now?

421
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
feel old yet um

422
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
She I saw I saw that um

423
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:10,320
I saw daniel radcliffe's response and I have seen pictures of emma watson saying trans rights stuff before I didn't see um

424
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,840
Um rippet grin. I didn't see rippet grin's response, but that's really funny that all three do dude. Everybody fucking hates her

425
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,360
Everybody fucking hates her except for like weird except for like weirdos like glinner and

426
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,520
and carons

427
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,440
like a couple of like

428
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,640
It's like the same it's like the same like older white women that you might see like on twitter

429
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,840
Like responding to you know blue wave democrats who respond

430
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,880
Who respond to trump tweets tweets by saying like by spelling his name lowercase t uppercase r

431
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
lowercase urmp

432
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Or whatever or urmp

433
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,080
There's just like a there's just like a certain

434
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,720
Subset there's just a certain subset of a human female

435
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,160
It's it's just like the older you get the the the progression points the progressiveness points

436
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,400
The the progressiveness points you they have a half life and the older you get the less powerful and the less of them you have

437
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,800
You can only put them into so many things these people

438
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,040
They've gotten to the point where like feminism is good and like maybe gay marriage is good and things like that

439
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,320
Trans excuse me. That's a little too far. They don't have any more. I don't have any profession points

440
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,640
They don't have any more points to allocate, you know, they're their supply is dwindling as we speak

441
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,240
Pretty soon. They're gonna have to choose between like gay rights and feminism like they're gonna have to lose one or the other

442
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,000
They just don't don't have the stamina juice to sustain both

443
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
You know it's like flexing a muscle

444
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Believing in rights is like flexing a muscle

445
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
You can't do it indefinitely

446
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Yeah, it's like

447
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
To some extent it's understandable

448
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,600
But thank god grandma does not have a twitter account

449
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,400
Well, they do now, you know, that's who these people are

450
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,720
They're going to they're like getting to the age where they will be grandmas like like

451
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,520
You know the the the whole thing with like, oh

452
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,920
Grandparents they occasionally say the n-word and something like a little

453
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,160
A little bit of a oh, that's a that's a little bit of a racism there

454
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,000
Grandma grandma a little bit of a you know of the times remark

455
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,720
Um, but they say it in at like Christmas and Thanksgiving and like family gatherings

456
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,520
They say it in their own home. You never see him

457
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,880
Um, unless you do and even then you only see him a really big only see him at Christmas and Thanksgiving

458
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,560
And everyone agrees we don't talk about it when grandma says the n-word

459
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,040
We're just gonna keep going. We're just gonna keep barreling on through to the other side

460
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,840
And it's just imagine if all the grandmas and grandpas had

461
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,400
Twitter accounts and were engaging in all of these conversations along with everyone else

462
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,960
They do and the grandpas all have pictures of their dogs or themselves wearing sunglasses glasses or the american flag

463
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,040
I guess they do it's just not as many grandmas all have themselves

464
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:14,000
Wearing masks or I think I think the thing to do is to do a facebook and change twitter into like the young version of twitter

465
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,880
Which is better and let the old people take twitter and ruin it like they did with facebook

466
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,800
I mean facebook is fine. I guess it's just sort of we can't just we can't just keep losing ground

467
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,480
We can't just keep surrendering more and more territory. We have to take a stand

468
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,640
Now we got we got to innovate like the the whole idea of innovation is to make sure old people don't know

469
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,760
What the fuck is going on so we can sneakily just like plot their like uh mass genocide

470
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's tossing around the g word are we now that's the kind of thing that gets your channel banned from youtube

471
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,640
Oh, no youtube. I'm so sorry. I won't kill you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

472
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,800
Please let us let us have our channel back. Mr. YouTube man. Mr.

473
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,960
Susan Wojcicki. Mr. Mr. Man. Wojcicki

474
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,120
Oh, sorry. I don't believe that I don't believe that that autogynophilic men

475
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,960
Masculating as women should be invading women natal women spaces

476
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Um lamal

477
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,400
That's what that's what you sound like twitter

478
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Die, it's like it's like I don't want old people to die. I just know that I don't like anything they have to say

479
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,920
That's right. That's right. It's it's just an unfortunate like you're too old to pay attention to what is happening

480
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,800
And even if you did you would have really stupid old-fashioned takes because you're setting your ways because you're old

481
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,080
And that's just how it is. That's what human life is if you didn't want to die

482
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,080
You shouldn't have let yourself get old enough to start being wrong. I'm sorry. That's just the way these things work

483
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,720
It's it's the way of the world the the the master of the universe

484
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,240
Uh laws of the universe. Hey, yeah, if you

485
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,600
Uh, don't if you if you feel like speculating

486
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:05,280
I'm I'm thinking because we don't know if it was the black lives matter charity stream

487
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,000
That got us flag seems plausible, but we we can't we can't know for sure

488
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
Did we say

489
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,160
Did we do you think?

490
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,520
honestly

491
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,800
There was anything we said on there that was like

492
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
a a what what were the

493
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,600
the terms again

494
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,080
Encouraging illegal activities or inciting users to violate youtube's guidelines

495
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,760
I mean encouraging illegal illegal activities as in like encouraging rioting. I guess

496
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,200
We like looting we saying looting is based if it's against war not like things like that

497
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,040
I just feel like that's not that spicy a take and I've and I know that other I've seen other youtubers

498
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,280
put out videos

499
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,120
Who are in support of blm and who think that the rioting is who are who support that?

500
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:03,040
Right because they think it all like it's all you know riot is the voice of the unheard or whatever, right?

501
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:09,200
Like is the is is that it do you have to be just like like no riot is ever legitimate?

502
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,560
Is that the is that the implication here if if that's what it is?

503
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:19,920
I mean, I mean, I guess it would probably either be that we were not 100 critical of the rioting or

504
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Like joking about killing cops

505
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:30,240
Now I now I I looked at the terms of service. Okay. This is this says encouraging illegal activities

506
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,080
or inciting users to violate the youtube's guidelines, so

507
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,960
It doesn't so it doesn't imply I

508
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Mean it's sort of

509
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,280
I mean it does say that we we violated the terms of service

510
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:53,600
But the way that we did that was by encouraging an illegal activity or inciting users to violate guidelines and like

511
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,160
So that's really weird. That's like very weird phrasing and

512
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,600
Uh, uh, I looked at the guidelines and the guidelines do include like you're not allowed

513
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,800
You're like you you're not allowed to like say certain things about groups of people

514
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,320
You're not allowed to like compare a group of people to like animals. You're not allowed to call them subhuman

515
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,480
which

516
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,520
I guess you could maybe argue that we did like if we if we called if we called cops pigs

517
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,120
Or whatever or something or said like cops or bastards

518
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,560
Maybe but like the groups that you are not allowed to say that it it doesn't say a job

519
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:38,240
It does say that like based on a certain cast whatever that means arc is being a cop being a member of the cop cast

520
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Um, I don't know

521
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,640
So if you construed it that way, maybe you could say that but like the wording of those of those words in there are clearly

522
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,360
Designed that it's it's like meant to like what it's meant to prevent is like racist speech

523
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,800
Like you know saying some saying nasty shit about like black people right not about fucking cops, right?

524
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,320
So if that were what did it it would obviously have been like taken out of the spirit of what the rule was meant to do

525
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,480
um

526
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,840
I I

527
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:14,720
I guess I mean, I think the most likely thing if it was a report on that stream is that

528
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,600
somebody said that we said um

529
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,040
Something that there was maybe a joke

530
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,080
Yeah, um, but it you know and then the youtube bought what skimmed through it

531
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,920
Found the words and said oh, they did say that and obviously doesn't realize that jokes exist

532
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,760
and so

533
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
maybe report plus like

534
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,720
Uh, just grabbing the the the transcript led to that

535
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,720
but

536
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,480
I mean

537
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:52,480
I don't know. I don't really want to assume that that's exactly what's happening. I I'm trying not to I'm trying not to jump to any conclusions

538
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,760
Um, I just you know, we both we both

539
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,360
Independently were like is that why is that what did it?

540
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,520
if I

541
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,640
I mean, I've seen people saying what do I see I've seen people saying

542
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,360
Uh, maybe it was a naughty edgy things. We've said that got flagged

543
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,520
Maybe it was you know, because like you're maybe it was like the fact that like mumki is banned and he's on certain

544
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,840
Uh, uh videos on our channel. I don't buy that. I don't I think that's his own channel back up

545
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,840
He's doing things. Yeah, that's that can't be it. I mean, I would say

546
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,760
I wouldn't say can't like obviously that shouldn't happen, but like

547
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,200
It I think it seems like a stretch, but it doesn't seem like 100 impossible that youtube would just be that stupid about it

548
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,560
Um, but it's probably not it. I think that one's a long shot. Um

549
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,720
I mean, we didn't get we didn't get banned

550
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,640
Or it didn't get banned when we up when we did the blm stream the charity stream

551
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,200
By the way, we fucking did a fucking charity fundraiser and we get fucking kicked off youtube

552
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,640
um

553
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,800
It wasn't that or it wasn't right when we uploaded it. It was after um, we the latest episode

554
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,240
Which I guess

555
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,800
Makes me think that it was something on the episode that went up and I don't remember what we talked about in that episode

556
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,440
Yeah, I can't remember exactly either. I mean, we have the mp3. We could go through it

557
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,640
I get a couple hours. Yeah, I mean I guess I don't want to even if we even if we like fight figure out exactly what it was

558
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,120
It doesn't mean the channel is going to come back any quicker

559
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:32,320
Yeah, even even if we even if we thought we could identify like oh that must be what it was. Oh clearly clearly

560
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,920
I don't think there will be a moment where it's like. Oh, I see. I see. This is exactly what we said

561
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,280
That was an unambiguous terms of service violation. There you go. Bam

562
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,160
Problem mystery solved

563
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Uh, I don't yeah. No, it's not

564
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
What do we gain nothing?

565
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Uh, right

566
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,200
so

567
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Boy, I'm frustrated

568
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm fucking frustrated about all

569
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
This all things. Yeah

570
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
Yeah, but you know what's good

571
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,400
Is that it looks like tom has made a lot of progress getting ready to start shipping out backer rewards

572
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,640
That's that is good. I like seeing those piles of merch. That's that's pretty cool. Um

573
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
You know, um

574
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,960
How's your how's things on your end? How's the many list of ben saint things that has to come out?

575
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,360
um

576
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
You know, I was um

577
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Well, I think I mentioned last week that nexus did complete his vaporette and I have it. Oh, and I was gonna like

578
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,000
I was gonna like tweet about him. So I was gonna make a tweet and like hey guys

579
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,520
Here's another like like artist highlight for a guest artist. Yeah, you should do that

580
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,000
I should do that, but now everything's fucking falling apart. Oh, I can't I can't

581
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Possibly now. It's just not the time

582
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:58,960
It's just one tweet. No, no, no, no, I have to keep my eyes on the prize. Um, no, but I will do that at some point

583
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,080
Um, kazzie says hers is almost done

584
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:08,720
Actually, she messaged me just like right before the the stream started or this podcast started to say like it's almost done

585
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
Lamal, which is cool

586
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,840
Um

587
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,520
Jade said she was gonna she was gonna maybe get it done this week

588
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,800
But I think she's like at camp or god she's I forget she told me she was going somewhere for a little while

589
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,520
So I guess she's must be up. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine

590
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,040
And then I'm just curious about like why to go somewhere during the pandemic

591
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
She I I don't remember

592
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,920
Um, I probably shouldn't like I probably shouldn't like read out what she said

593
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
She said she was going somewhere

594
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,760
And was gonna try and have it done before she left which was the end of last week

595
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,160
But the week has ended and it didn't work

596
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,520
But whatever so kazzie said she's almost done

597
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,720
So if she ends finish this soon, that'll be four out of six and then munchie says he is working on it

598
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
He says he's working on it every day

599
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,960
Which okay, uh, I don't know how close he is

600
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,240
Uh, how many pages are all these guys doing how many I don't remember how many yours was like what like six pages five

601
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,040
Something like that. Um, I mean nexus says is longer than that

602
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,600
Um

603
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,280
Munchies is shorter. Well, no, maybe it's similar. I don't know

604
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,120
Uh, I don't I don't I don't actually know how many pages it. Um, I think that

605
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,000
jades was was maybe a little longer than yours and kazzie's was also

606
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,640
longer, they're a little longer than

607
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,960
They're a little longer than like the two page ones from uh last time

608
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,880
So, I mean they're a little more substantial. It's good. The book is gonna be like half vaporette content

609
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,280
I think or pretty close to it

610
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,080
Um, so, you know, I mean they're doing they're doing work

611
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,040
Um, uh, how about the rfck pins? So, oh, oh, oh, you know, I have um

612
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,000
God

613
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,760
Really frustrating

614
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,160
So the pins I have um, I I actually have samples of

615
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,400
Six of them. I think I have the potrin. I have the map. I have

616
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,360
Endless not endless war. I have the slime corp. I have the slime heart. I have the lord of ghosts

617
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:23,120
And I'm missing one. I don't know. Uh, I have samples of those here right now and they are producing

618
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,640
I just told them to produce samples of the last like 18

619
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,080
Uh model so they are making samples of of a bunch more right now. They're gonna send them to me

620
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,360
It's gonna be pretty good. I will make like last minute color adjustments when I see how they look in person

621
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,880
Um, so the pins coming along really good

622
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,040
The patches the the the other company I found that makes patches

623
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,080
The woman I'm talking to is so fucking frustrating. She's so useless. I hate her

624
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,960
Like she made the sample pin the patches and like they looked pretty good

625
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,240
I had a couple of like things and I was like, hey, could you change this could you change this?

626
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
But they look really good. I was really happy with them

627
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,280
And she's so difficult like I make like really simple requests. I'm like, hey

628
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,920
What colors did you use?

629
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,800
And like she will take like two days to get back to me or until answer with like something unrelated and I'll be like

630
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:18,400
I just want to know what color please tell me what colors you use and I'll I'll I'll I'll have to ask multiple times

631
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,680
Or like, okay, can I see a picture of what the threads look like so I can compare colors and like

632
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,280
Again, like it's like a 50 50 chance whether she will actually like answer the question

633
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,240
I'm asking or like do the thing that I want her to do to help me make this fucking order

634
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,400
She's so dumb or like doesn't understand English or

635
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,320
Just like lazy and doesn't want to like it's I don't know what the problem is like I cannot tell

636
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,240
but she's so

637
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,000
awful and yet I have to fucking deal with her because

638
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,840
The pet that I've already paid for the patches to be made. They've already designed them. I like we're doing this

639
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,480
It's just like I literally just have to pick out

640
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,880
The only thing I have to do before they make another round of the of the things is like I just ask show me the colors

641
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,840
Please very I'm very polite. I'm very polite when to deal with her

642
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,160
Just said just please show me what the colors look like so I can pick which ones and she's like, okay

643
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,960
That was like three days ago

644
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,120
I hate her I fucking hate her Jesus christ

645
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,080
um

646
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,280
So that's what's going on with that

647
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
I went on fiverr and I paid somebody

648
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,880
to

649
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,880
Make a vector out of the slime coin

650
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,280
coin design

651
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,080
um

652
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,080
It looks pretty good

653
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,040
I spent a while like fucking around with it after I don't know

654
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,000
It's like

655
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,840
Little parts of it are like a little bit off-center and I feel like it's small enough that it wouldn't matter if I if I had it made

656
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:52,480
Right now. I don't think anyone would notice but I can notice that like the border is like not entirely uniform and thickness

657
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,440
But it's like really it'd be really hard. I'd have to like take move everything around in relation to each other

658
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,160
To get it and it's like, why?

659
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,640
Why couldn't you have just

660
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,640
Why couldn't you have just done it 100 percent?

661
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,080
Why couldn't you have just done it perfectly? Probably because she was some girl from pakistan and I paid her like $20

662
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,600
um

663
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,600
but still

664
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,840
Yeah, I guess you get what you pay for

665
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,800
And now I'm probably gonna have to like if I'm if I'm to be satisfied with the final product

666
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,400
I'm going to have to spend any turn of you fucking around with infinite tiny little

667
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,880
Little little like nodes and points in fucking inkscape get that friggin vector exactly how I want it

668
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,480
Um, what else am I fucking doing? What am I talking about after?

669
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,640
Talking about stuff. Oh the um your other lecture

670
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,320
Oh

671
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Oh, that was right

672
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
the other thing

673
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,760
Actually, god, I really wish the thing with a channel didn't happen

674
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:56,960
Because I had just look it's fine. I'll I'll continue. I'll continue as as I was I had just

675
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,840
Finally kicked myself in the ass enough to get back to like

676
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,200
Doing the slime and punishment finale. I had finished the story. I had finished laying out the story board

677
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,960
All right

678
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,480
Like to to

679
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,360
Which was a necessary step in doing it which I hadn't completed yet. I had just kind of done little bits and pieces here

680
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
I have the story board laid out now

681
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,680
And I and I have started making assets for it again. I haven't started putting shots together again. I need assets. I'm making assets

682
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,680
and

683
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,880
so

684
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,640
I'm doing that partially because I am not going to release the chris chan 102

685
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,800
until

686
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,000
Slime and punishment finale is out. So oh, yeah

687
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,960
So me getting that done is like a prerequisite to me getting the slime and punishment or the the the

688
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:50,160
The the thing out the the lecture itself is like mostly edited. There's some stuff I need to add to it, but it's like

689
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,560
More mostly it's cut together

690
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
Not a hundred percent and like

691
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,200
There were some things I there were some things I wanted to do with it a little bit above and beyond

692
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,120
um just like

693
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,280
You know the pretty the pretty bare bones editing that I did with the um

694
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,960
With the other one, uh, so, you know, it's it's

695
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,880
That's gonna happen after the pen the finale which I was which I would have been working on

696
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,880
A lot more in the past day if I hadn't if this fucking news about the channel had not come to light and and

697
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,240
Divided my attention pretty heavily, but it's okay

698
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,120
It's fine

699
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:36,240
I'll get back to it. Damn. So you go um like a whole bunch of irons in that fire

700
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,520
Dude, I have huge amount. I keep thinking about I keep thinking about how many fucking irons I got and how they all

701
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,680
distract me from one another and I'm

702
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
Just so fucking bad

703
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:57,440
I'm just so fucking it's so fucking dumb. I'm I'm I've I've I've destroyed my my life by by not not having everything

704
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,360
Done the fact that there are things that I haven't finished the

705
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,800
I won't go through the list. I've gone through the list a bunch of times in various places. I just I just

706
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,240
I hate it. I hate that there are things that I started that aren't done

707
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,760
It's so fucking like draining it cause it saps my energy constantly

708
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,280
um

709
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,280
The the the the

710
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,600
I will I will receive a passive buff

711
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,120
I'll receive a passive buff to my life as soon as the slime and punishment finale is done because it'll be one more thing

712
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,080
That I can remove from my thought process that room that drains my mental stamina constantly

713
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,040
Knowing that it's that it's that the the promise was made that it would be done and I haven't delivered yet

714
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,280
Um, I will do my IQ will just raise by 10 points spontaneously

715
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,160
Promise if you think I'm stupid. I'm not that's why I I have

716
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,200
That's the reason don't it's not my fault

717
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,240
It's it definitely sucks to have a bunch of things hanging over your head. I mean

718
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
That's why I've made a

719
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,200
I guess not a habit, but I've like made um

720
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,280
who?

721
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:10,000
I me. Oh, I me. I have made a habit of of like cutting projects off

722
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,880
Like it's difficult to just do one thing like you're always gonna have

723
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:22,400
Other ideas distracting you while you're working on one thing. Yeah, um, which is why for the past well this year is like

724
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,440
uh, just like figuring out how to

725
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,440
Make myself do one thing so that it's done

726
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,720
Lord of ghosts was that um pretty pretty successful. Um, but

727
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,440
uh

728
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,200
it's

729
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:46,000
It's oh, I've just realized I'm about to talk about art problems. Gary hack it. Fuck you. I don't like you

730
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,080
You piece of shit you little choke for anyone wondering Gary hack it commented

731
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,760
You may I

732
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,760
commented on like why

733
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,440
Like can't wait. It was what was it like can't wait till gibb starts talking about he can't focus on his art or whatever

734
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,120
And I was like, why is this about him? Why why is this not about me? This is like describes me

735
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:12,480
This would be more appropriate to be said about me. I don't get it. Um, but it was funny

736
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,600
Yeah

737
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:19,760
Well, so I was thinking oh, I shouldn't talk about that next time but uh, you forced my handband now. I'm talking about that's fine

738
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,200
That's good

739
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,200
That's good

740
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,680
but yeah, I was

741
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,040
I was having because like with a lot of ghosts I had um

742
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,720
Done the sketching and dialogue well before I was drawing it and inking it finishing the pages and releasing them

743
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,720
So what the work was was entirely just sort of like workhorse work. I didn't need to think I just needed to do it

744
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,120
Yeah, so solving solving that problem was quite easy really

745
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:53,280
It's just a matter of focusing your uh, your your arm your your energy

746
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,040
But you don't need to I have something to say about and so you see

747
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,280
Yeah, did you find did you find it easier to work on like after the sketch was done?

748
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,320
And you just had to go in and do the mindless work of like inking it basically shading it. Yes

749
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,840
I

750
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:13,920
Okay, when yeah when I did the when I did the vapors or vapors one and two I sketched

751
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,120
And then I inked right

752
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,840
And and I did it like like I sketched it all out first and then I went back and inked it

753
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,080
and I

754
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,200
hated that

755
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,240
Because the inking was like so mindless. It was really boring

756
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,880
And I got like no satisfaction. I got very little satisfaction from it like every time every time I finished inking a page

757
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,200
It was like I hadn't really made anything. I had just done like some mindless busy work

758
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,800
Just some shit that's like required of me to you know to make this thing technically done

759
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,840
Even though like in my mind it had already been done before

760
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,240
um

761
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:56,160
But I say that I say that but then with like vapors three and champion chapter one

762
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,680
I

763
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,880
I didn't do that. I didn't pre-sketch it. I sketched and then inked each page eventually

764
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:10,800
Which like broke up the like more satisfying creative work of like laying out the page and like sketching the page and like and doing all that

765
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,160
But like it also it also it was harder. It was less

766
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,160
It was more satisfying work to do that, but it's also way harder. So

767
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,680
You know the end result is that both went very slowly and I suck

768
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,320
Lamal

769
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,440
lol

770
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,600
It's it's just sort of lol. I mean for me that the sketches were very basic very bare bones

771
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,480
And to to ink them makes them appear real and I'm like wow. I'm actually good at drawing. I guess, you know

772
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,880
um, so it was like more of

773
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,320
Appealing to look at once it was inked and I was like the after that shading it was just sort of like

774
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,200
I don't know fill tool gray here and here. I don't know if I can

775
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,320
um, you know

776
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,080
Yeah, my my my sketches for like those when I've done sketches like that sketch the page out first

777
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,200
Mine are pretty basic, too

778
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,280
But I I feel I still feel like that's when I try like I've already when I've done the sketch

779
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,920
Unless it's like

780
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,440
Unless I've left a lot of shit out like I've already translated

781
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:18,480
The the idea has already come out of my brain and onto the page like there it is

782
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,120
Like to my eye like it's there already

783
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,080
And I know that like it's not done, but like I feel like

784
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,440
I don't know that's the like yeah, yeah, I get that that feeling when I'm

785
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,400
Uh putting dialogue in like I've already written it in like a in a screenplay way and now I've

786
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,760
Putting deciding where to put the switch bubble in the panel

787
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,800
And I'm like and then you know, I sketch it like

788
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,960
When I'm when I'm sketching I just sort of scribble the words in so that I can see like roughly how much space it would need

789
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:56,000
To write all of those words. I I forget if we've talked about this before do you do you like write out a script before you start sketching?

790
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,400
Um for a lot of ghosts, which is really the only one I've done

791
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,880
Any sort of planning on?

792
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:10,000
Yes, I wrote an entire screenplay of the dialogue when it came down to doing this the page layout

793
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:15,040
I based it off of those like the the things that the conversation requires happen

794
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,640
Yeah, uh, but when it came to actually typing it up

795
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:25,200
I would tweak a few things if I felt like the delivery was sort of weird and not cool enough or just sort of

796
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:31,360
Wording could have been improved, but the the the focus of each speech bubble stayed the same

797
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,960
I

798
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,880
I have I have never done I have never done like a like a script treatment before

799
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,760
I will have like um

800
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,720
Well, I mean, I guess I like I wrote out the scripts for the vaporettes that the guest artists then you and the other guest artists

801
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,080
Then like I guess followed or whatever for the actual

802
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,080
drawing

803
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,840
Mine my comics. I've never done a script treatment before before drawing. I will have like

804
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,720
I might have the most I might have is like

805
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,280
notes

806
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,600
Even then I don't really do notes because like I know what the story is like if it's a if it like

807
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
If it's a short story and I've never really drawn like a

808
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,400
A protracted comic with like a really like long well for champion

809
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,280
I did have notes about like like what like but like whatever

810
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,640
um

811
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,600
For the other things I don't usually have notes or anything about what it is. I'll just know what the story is

812
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,120
I know like what the what the basic beats are and I'll have like scenes in my head

813
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,040
And I'll just and I'll just like I'll just draw it out

814
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,720
And like I'll have an idea like if there's going to be dialogue in a moment

815
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,800
And then like I won't know what it's going to be, but I'll draw it

816
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,000
I'll just think of like, okay

817
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,680
I guess they'll have to do this and I guess he or she will say something

818
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,480
And I'll know like the idea that they want to say but not exactly what they're saying

819
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,760
I'll draw it out

820
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,960
I'll like include their mouth being open leave space for a bubble and then I'll like it'll be done and I'll go back in and be like

821
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,880
Okay, I know the idea. She's expressing. How exactly do I word it? Like how exactly would she say it?

822
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,760
Let me figure out the exact words. Um, I guess it's like that. No, that's stupid. No, that's stupid

823
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,720
That okay done cringe move on don't think about it anymore

824
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,360
I mean the way I was thinking when I did this screenplay it was like

825
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,960
um

826
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:25,360
Screenplay as in like it includes like direction like character moves here grabs thing throws thing

827
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,680
Yeah, um, we see a shot of this we pan over like like as if it was a film

828
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,600
um

829
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,320
So I can like base the panel layout off of that

830
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,480
Like I know what needs to be shown as well as who needs to be saying what

831
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,600
Um, but when I write a dialogue scene

832
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,280
If it like ends in a punchline, I'm thinking in my head

833
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,040
like I have a some sort of a vision of

834
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:55,920
What the panel layout needs to look like in order to deliver this punchline or if it's a really cool thing like it zooms up

835
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,360
Like a close up of their mouth and they say fuck you like

836
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,320
Yeah, some sort of some sort of thing like that like silhouetted against an explosion

837
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,360
Um, and they say a one-liner like I I in like in my head. I imagine

838
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,080
Visually what that speech that that thing they say would be said against but I don't need to sketch it

839
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,200
When it comes to sketching I sometimes find that I'm not good enough at drawing to sketch the cool thing

840
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,400
So I have to like come up with something else

841
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,320
I yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Sure. I've been there

842
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:35,280
Um, do you ever when you're when you're like writing out a script when you're coming up with the story?

843
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,160
Do you like see it?

844
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:46,000
Does it appear how to how does it how does it appear to you in your mind when you're like conceiving it when it's

845
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,000
The form it takes for me is generally a

846
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,600
an image or like a sequence of images

847
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,000
and then

848
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,680
I'll be like, okay

849
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,120
That'll happen that image happens that image happens

850
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,680
that image happens

851
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,360
and then the actual process of making the comic is like

852
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,160
just kind of

853
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,160
Making it up as I go along of like

854
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,680
thinking like

855
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:19,040
All right, so to get so to get to get the characters into the situation where that first image happens

856
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,800
Like what would they have to do? Okay?

857
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,040
I guess they do this and this and this and this and this and this and this and okay there and then then it happens done

858
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,440
Okay, and then to get to the next one. It's like, okay

859
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,680
Well, I guess they got to do this and this and say that and this and do this and this and this and then okay there

860
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,360
There it is there. It happens again, right? Yeah, it's it's like thinking in keyframes or key scenes

861
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,400
Like you know the the big moments that you want to explain and they need to be set up. So

862
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,960
Yeah, or like going from point a to point b

863
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,000
Uh, they need to like if they're in one location

864
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,960
You can just cut to another location

865
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,440
But sometimes you want to have a few panels to buffer it if if it needs like

866
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,480
You know, you'll you'll get a feel for how it needs to to look while you're sketching

867
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,600
Yeah, um, but a lot of the time if I have two cool moments and in between them

868
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,080
I'm not exactly sure how they get to the other cool moment

869
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,240
Um, I just know that they need to expose it something before the next action scene

870
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,680
I sometimes leave the sketch a little too loose and I find that that is sure

871
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,040
That's that's um, that's caught me in a few places, right? I've ended up having to like

872
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,800
um

873
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:30,480
Come up with something while I'm lining it rather than sketching it which is difficult like a background

874
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,120
Not not really just a background

875
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,080
I mean sometimes a background because I'm just like it's buildings. I don't fucking know. Yeah, but um

876
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,120
the

877
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,480
like

878
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,480
A transitional phase from one

879
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,360
Area to another. I'm not sure

880
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,840
exactly some type like

881
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,720
Yeah

882
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:57,760
Like it's just it's difficult. It's difficult trying to like because you don't imagine in your mind

883
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,720
The the mundane panels that don't really

884
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,640
Leave much of an impact. You always think of the coolest moments. Yeah

885
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,520
I I think that sometimes

886
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,400
sometimes

887
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,000
Making a story like that is just a matter of finding any

888
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:20,880
excuse just to move the story to towards where you want to go something like and sometimes

889
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,520
Sometimes it's okay

890
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,520
I know I've done it to just be like

891
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,000
Whatever just have someone say something just justify it in any way. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it's bullshit

892
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
We just got to get we just got to get this

893
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:37,840
Wherever we're going as fast as possible make it as can make it as uh as efficient as possible

894
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,560
Even and just just get it there

895
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,920
Just stop drawing you don't like draw make it so you have to draw as few panels as possible

896
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,080
That is

897
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,080
I mean it didn't it didn't end up being

898
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:56,400
Uh a low amount of panels. No, but like chapter two of lord of ghosts where he's like traveling from

899
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:02,400
You know being in the ocean to getting to the you know endless mud and all that. Yeah, um

900
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:08,240
I knew that cuz rck is like the grand canyon of slime

901
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:16,240
It means he would need to go through that slime sea and then end up somewhere else on the other side of the grand canyon and from there

902
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,160
Uh, he needs to travel across the ocean because in my mind it was just like it's just like the earth

903
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,600
It's just real life. It's just is exactly the same as the earth, but like with weird shit in it

904
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,880
so, um, I knew that he needed to go from

905
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,760
Somewhere in the grand canyon to the

906
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,240
Uh east coast of america and then cross the ocean. Yes

907
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,320
Which is why I had the the the cow town

908
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:48,400
And then the the sea train, but like in those locations. I didn't really have anything for lord of ghosts to do

909
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,640
I just so uh, let's put a cowboy in here. They they say something like we don't like

910
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:58,320
Monsters around here and they the fucking shoot him. It's like, oh my god. I'm betting shut out and he runs like and it's just a

911
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,240
It's an excuse for a little comedy, but I also need to explain

912
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,080
In my head

913
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:08,880
It needs to be explained how he gets from one side of the slime sea to another side of the planet

914
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,080
I I really think that a lot of

915
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,040
I think it's underrated how much of like successful

916
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,080
storytelling or making any kind of narrative

917
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,920
content

918
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,680
is about

919
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:31,760
Like how little can I get away with showing without losing it without losing anything as I like progress the action from a to b

920
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:38,960
Uh, I think that's just good. It's just good storytelling to cut out craft and it makes it easier too

921
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,440
And it makes you able to to like tell more of the story you're trying to tell

922
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,200
The more efficiently you can do you can you can move the action along

923
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,200
The best thing to do is to have like the world

924
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,640
Because people love building worlds you build the world as

925
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:01,840
Completely as you possibly can you think of the absolute history of every location if you really feel like going in that that in depth

926
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:08,080
So such that when you come to deciding what to show from that world

927
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,720
You don't need to think of you don't need to make shit up. Everything's already there. You just need to show it

928
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:18,160
Yeah, you know you've built a world now just film what's happening in it and the the thing you're showing

929
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,240
is like

930
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,920
You know, um

931
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,440
It can be very brief. You don't need to explain what's going on in the world

932
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,960
You can leave it to people's imaginations to fill in but if you know

933
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,800
Then it's easier for you to structure everything. Mm-hmm. Yeah

934
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,960
if um

935
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,960
I'm uh, uh, if you've

936
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,720
Yeah, I get if you've got if you've got a really fleshed out idea of the world then like that can kind of

937
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:49,120
I don't know. I guess that can answer questions like if you're thinking like hmm. What happens between here and there? Well

938
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I know this exists

939
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,160
Maybe that that's what happens. Yeah

940
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
maybe that's it

941
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,600
Because it's you you can tell sometimes where things are just

942
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,800
Made up out of nothing. They come out of the of the author's ass. They're just like, uh, then this happens

943
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,000
Yeah, and the reason the reason you can tell is that because is there was no

944
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,360
There's nothing possible that could have indicated that this was the case

945
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,200
You know, like it's it's a it's a common thing in one piece where like

946
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,480
um, it's it's not so much that odour

947
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,320
Deliberately puts things in one piece knowing that he will use them later

948
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:34,160
But he knows so much about the world he's created that he can pick and choose lots of things that he's already shown

949
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:40,800
Like as mundane objects in the background to become things that are relevant later and then people look back and they're like, oh my god

950
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:46,320
I think it's a rich tapestry. You know, I think that you know, there's like there's the architect and the gardener, right?

951
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,160
You know what I mean?

952
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,160
Oh, yeah, that's the I feel like king georgia or a martin conversation

953
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,240
Uh, yeah, I

954
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:59,040
I guess so there was a that's where I heard it on youtube. I I haven't yeah, maybe

955
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,360
I think I might have heard the two of them compared like that some at some point

956
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:09,120
I feel like odour does the gardener thing where like he will come up with some like weird device

957
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,040
To just like enable whatever he wants to have happen happen

958
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,440
Like the dials or whatever in in in a cloud

959
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,760
zone

960
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,680
My favorite sonic the hedgehog level skypea and and then

961
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,800
Oh, yeah, if he want if he like he'll just come up with that because it enables like, you know

962
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,640
Like usop to do all these weird combat things and like uh, uh, you know

963
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,800
Is it excuse for like long distance communication in a place without

964
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,920
No, no, they have to end in mushy. That's not right. Whatever it enables all these weird things to happen

965
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,800
He'll have to just have this idea for like what if these things did have these weird properties like that would be cool

966
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,440
Um, and then he'll just kind of go with it

967
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,840
Uh, like and that'll be and and if he wants he can he'll bring them back later

968
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:58,400
Like cuz dial cuz dials are like a pretty a pretty like, um

969
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,840
Versatile concept and like I guess because of that he'll just he can just bring them back and like make them

970
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:10,320
Show up later like maybe later usop puts them in his fucking slingshot or whatever they do they do a thing

971
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,560
Uh, I feel I feel like he's doing the gardening thing there where he's just he's just he is just kind of making shit up as he goes along

972
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,320
But then he'll like he's he's he's he's grown

973
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,600
He's grown so many fruits and veggies in his garden

974
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,800
That he can then like has a big stockpile of them too

975
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:34,640
Like he can take any of those seeds you see to continue the metaphor that he's already cultivated and replant them for next year's harvest

976
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,520
I'm getting hungry

977
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:44,080
Yeah, it's it's it's beneficial for him as well because it's like one piece is just

978
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,680
Anything you could think of there's an island about it. Yeah, there's a there's everything can exist

979
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,400
That's kind of what I want to do is just to have like

980
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,120
Everything that I could think of that's really cool is all in the same universe. There's all

981
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,680
They can all interact punk will meet everyone. It's all in c197, dude

982
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,320
It's all it's all in c197 the dimensional marriage is coming. Yeah

983
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,960
Fuck yeah, um

984
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,280
Anyway, what I was yeah, what I was talking about

985
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,600
um with regards to working

986
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,520
uh was

987
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,480
That

988
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,080
With the sketches a lot of ghosts. Uh, it was easy to figure out how to get myself out a little bit

989
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:26,320
And I haven't really heard like half of what you've been saying. Could you start over my robot?

990
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:32,400
For me. Sorry viewers. My I don't know if it was your connection or my headphones, but yeah, I missed a lot of that

991
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,360
sorry

992
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:42,400
The way to solve the problem of working on things without needing to think is just minimize distraction

993
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:50,320
Lower your expected dopamine level so that you're not constantly craving a certain amount of entertainment every day and

994
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,400
And you know, you can what you can barrel through and it's quite easy

995
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:00,960
But when I'm doing this tezuka manga thing. Yeah, um, it is it is a different

996
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,720
Feeling of work. You can't sit down at a nine to five and come up with ideas

997
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,280
It doesn't really exactly work the same way. You can get yourself in a good situation

998
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,720
but coming up with creative ideas like

999
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:21,120
So that it's it's difficult and it's a different process and I need to figure out how to

1000
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,960
best

1001
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,960
Make a situation where I can

1002
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,440
Like thrive creatively

1003
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:33,200
Have you so that I can have that as my creative way to do things and then my other way that I've already figured out as the

1004
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:40,320
The production way you've you've seen you've seen that John Cleese lecture right about creativity. I have yeah, yeah

1005
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,360
I need to rewatch it because I keep forgetting

1006
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,560
I know that there's like the open and closed state the playful mind and the and the analytical mind or whatever he says

1007
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,720
But I forget how to best get into the playful mind

1008
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,520
Thing because I've tried like, uh, maybe if I just drink some alcohol that'll

1009
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,600
No, no

1010
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,000
Loosen my inhibitions just a little bit because and then once once my inhibitions are loosened

1011
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,680
I'm not going to worry so much about the things I do. So I would just create right

1012
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:13,200
Stuff and even if it's shit, I'll do it in any way and then I can look at it later and decide what is good and bad

1013
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,840
Like that's not the stupid idea. Very stupid. It didn't really work very stupid. It doesn't it doesn't work. I think I think not for me

1014
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,600
I think as a as a concept like

1015
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:29,600
Loose lowering your inhibitions is a good way to get into a playful mindset where you just do things

1016
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
It doesn't even matter. Just do them. Yeah

1017
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:38,960
However, you can get to that you talked in the money spenders podcast about how like you you get into that when you're like really tired

1018
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:45,520
And I made it and I commented like hey me too. Yeah when I get really tired my inhibitions are lowered and sometimes I'll just like

1019
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,920
Draw a thing or write a thing because I'm too stupid not to do it lamel

1020
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,640
Yeah, it's like you've got to lobotomize yourself. You've got to become the stupidest motherfucker so that everything you do

1021
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,320
um

1022
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,840
It is well you you do everything rather you just do anything that comes to mind and then

1023
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,600
After that you have a whole list a whole big

1024
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,560
Like spread of things that you've come up with

1025
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,120
90% of them are gonna suck

1026
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:17,680
But at least you will be able to like see okay, that doesn't work. That doesn't work. That doesn't work

1027
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,320
That doesn't work. That's has potential

1028
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:26,160
Keep that and then you just do that over and over again until you have like a like a pile of like

1029
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,800
You know, it's like a panning for gold

1030
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,200
Get a whole lot of dirt and eventually you'll find a tiny little nugget. Yeah

1031
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,120
Yeah, but you got it. You've got to move a whole lot of dirt before you can find those

1032
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,840
That's exactly right. I like that analogy

1033
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,720
So, yo, not sorry sorry not to distract and we don't have to harp on this

1034
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,400
But did you see John Cleese's stupid ass shit on twitter?

1035
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,280
It's speaking of John Cleese

1036
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,240
John Cleese, I mean he did it in that stupid like centrist way

1037
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,720
But he was basically like what he was basically anti tearing down statues

1038
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,320
um

1039
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:07,600
He was he's been saying like uh the romans practice slavery the greeks practice slavery

1040
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,480
Why don't we tear down statues of greeks and romans?

1041
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,400
Like that's not fucking smooth as shit

1042
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,320
um

1043
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,960
Yeah, that's that's uh, that's a take that is

1044
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,320
Uninformed that sucks ass dude very disappointing coming from a cool dude

1045
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,160
A pretty overall I thought I think a pretty cool dude

1046
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,640
Like like johnny boy honestly

1047
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,200
I I yeah, it's I mean it's not a major

1048
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:42,160
Infraction, it's not it's not a major infraction, but it's very cringe and I just I expected better of him, you know

1049
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:50,160
Yeah, he does have old man brain now. He does but you know, he mean he's pretty fucking old in that lecture

1050
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:57,520
Isn't like in that lecture that that that thing he says like I'm very old and I'll soon be dead

1051
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,000
And that's like fucking 15 years old or maybe maybe not that old, but I think it's pretty old

1052
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,720
like yeah, jeez

1053
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,520
Funny funny stuff

1054
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,760
Oh, no mortality help. Oh god, I'm afraid

1055
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:22,320
Um gotta immortalize yourself in your creations real quick. Uh, I guess I guess in the absence of any better options

1056
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,320
I better get on that

1057
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,960
Uh

1058
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:33,440
I have gotten to a point where um the oh am I a robot again for you for like a

1059
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,000
Second you were but you're fine now. Yeah, like I saw the thing go red. Um

1060
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,680
I have gotten to a point where I have a full outline of the comic

1061
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,400
um, and I want to

1062
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,640
to go over it

1063
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,800
And maybe I don't know ask people what they think I might ask you what you think

1064
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,080
um, it's it's fine. It's just sort of like

1065
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:02,960
A lot of the a lot of what's cool about it is coming through my head and I'm aware of the

1066
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,520
An outline doesn't really explain enough for a for a person to really get

1067
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:13,760
What's going on you need to expand on each of the points and explain it in depth and at some point

1068
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
You may you might end up writing a book

1069
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:21,600
So like that's the point where you you don't do that and you instead start sketching because that's not what you're doing

1070
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,400
But yeah, I've gotten to a point where I think I have something that is you know, it's doable

1071
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,400
Oh for for tezuka you're talking about tezuka

1072
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,880
The yeah, the okay, right. Yeah

1073
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,960
Clarissa gunsmoke

1074
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,920
I don't know whether gunsmoke is a good last name, but that's the the first name I came up with and I can't think of anything

1075
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,760
Isn't gunsmoke

1076
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:47,200
And this is not to say that no it's not a good name, but gunsmoke is the name of a show right like an old tv show

1077
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,560
Maybe uh, yeah, I actually think it is. Yeah

1078
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,080
Uh, I'm not familiar, but I've heard the name but like that's fine

1079
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,280
I think clister gunsmoke is perfectly perfectly good name. It's very evocative

1080
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,520
I I didn't uh

1081
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,040
I don't know. I you probably don't want to give any spoilers

1082
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:10,880
Otherwise, I would ask like give us some tidbits. What's the story about does she fuck?

1083
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:20,000
No, no does she fuck though. No, she doesn't fuck just because she's a woman doesn't know she's a sex object

1084
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:28,000
Does just does clarissa would you describe clarissa gunsmoke as having a big old mommy milkers?

1085
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,160
No, no damn. All right. Well, I will be

1086
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:39,920
I mean, she may be a cowgirl, but that's not that's not what it means consider yourself to have lost a fan today

1087
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:46,000
Um, no, don't worry pumps doing that now. Oh, yeah, that's true. That's true

1088
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,400
Oh, here's here's here's like some funny fucking

1089
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:55,280
Uh inside of scoop. Let me find let me go to my only fans page

1090
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,240
Oh, right

1091
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,240
Uh, what was it?

1092
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,800
Oh, yeah, pumps bra size. You want you want to learn pumps bra size cannon? I do I do

1093
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,160
Uh 24 g 24 g

1094
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,920
That sounds it's we that sounds that's a really small number in a really big letter

1095
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,160
Lamal, yeah

1096
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,160
The the the letter is like the

1097
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:29,520
The the uh the amount difference between like around the the torso. Yeah, and then the bust. Yeah

1098
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,560
And it's 24 because she's very small. She's like a tiny I based it basic

1099
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,080
Like a little bit off of the the life size punk plushie that I have

1100
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,880
Like this is almost like a cannon punk

1101
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,680
I sized her up a bit and I figured it out

1102
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,040
I spent a few days because it's really confusing

1103
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:53,040
Looking at bra sizes because that's just what I'd like to do. Okay. There's nothing wrong with that. That's right. That's right

1104
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,440
I'm I googled it. I googled a 24 g

1105
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,280
And I know it does not exist. It does not exist

1106
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,440
Unfortunately, everything starts at 30 or 32

1107
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,360
Hmm

1108
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,680
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see a 32 g

1109
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,640
Um

1110
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
No, that doesn't look right

1111
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,440
Okay, I don't I don't think it exists. I don't think that I'm not sure that exists either lamal disappointing

1112
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:29,600
Um, well, maybe oh boy. Oh boy. All right. Hey viewer. Hey, whoa. Hey shut up. Hey shut up a minute

1113
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,200
Okay, cool

1114
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,360
sick

1115
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,360
Yeah, check out her only fans

1116
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:44,560
Check out punk solo fans. There's uh, there's how much how much does it cost to be a to be an only fan of punk?

1117
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,480
Um, if you go to the only fans it is five bucks a month

1118
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,680
Or you can go to my patreon at patreon.com slash give and take to get it for also five

1119
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,680
Dollars, right? That's why I've seen it five dollars per month. That's why I've

1120
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:02,880
Wait, no, wait. No, that's not why I've seen it because I don't patient you for five patient you for one dollar

1121
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,160
Yeah, you gotta up you gotta up for five

1122
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,440
Five also gets you access to like sketches. I'm thinking of also doing like

1123
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:17,120
The screenplay I have yo I'll patron you for five dollars and you patron me for five dollars

1124
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,040
And then we'll both then we'll have added ten dollars a month the global economy

1125
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,520
True

1126
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,560
That's just true. Yeah, it is it is true. That's how money works

1127
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,880
um

1128
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,880
Facts, what were you saying?

1129
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:40,880
Uh, I forget I think so. Oh, yeah closer. You are asking me about Clarissa. Um, right the gist is

1130
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,080
The she has a gun

1131
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:48,320
And she's a cowgirl and she rides into town

1132
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,960
And something happens with the gun and Clarissa in the town

1133
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,240
That's as much as I'm willing to give at the moment. There's obviously more to it

1134
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,400
But I want to spoil

1135
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,480
Until I feel like it's it's more robust and I can give like a cooler synopsis that is less

1136
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,400
Like it has more to it, but also it doesn't reveal anything

1137
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,040
Dude, that's pretty based

1138
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,000
That's pretty based. All right. I'm excited

1139
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,040
You think you think I'll have it done on time

1140
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,680
Um

1141
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,680
Yeah, I mean I've given myself till the end of june to get sketching done

1142
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:32,800
Uh, which means I got like two weeks and a yeah, uh, and then uh

1143
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,800
Depending on how many pages it's gonna be like pretty

1144
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:44,080
Like the maximum I can do is 55. I probably won't go that far, but I might it depends

1145
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,040
So I really need to to figure out at first

1146
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,160
I need to

1147
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:52,000
Do like extremely rough sketch like panel layout like stick figures

1148
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:59,360
No information at all just so I can see how many pages it's gonna take up if I do it. Um, you know, just ballpark it

1149
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,920
Um, if it's extremely low

1150
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,480
Then I have room to expand things that maybe I rush

1151
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:12,720
Like if I if I'm being conservative when I start sketching and I realize that it's only like 20 pages

1152
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:15,600
I can be I can go over it again be more liberal be

1153
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:21,600
Like have more space. Maybe one of the pages can be like a big one panel person shot

1154
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,240
um

1155
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,600
Something like that or like a double page berserk spread sort of thing

1156
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,760
um

1157
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:35,360
But if it's like like 60 70 80 pages, I need to cut it down and that's that's the the next step for me

1158
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,480
Yeah, to figure out how much uh, I can work with

1159
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:43,440
Yeah, I was I was gonna ask you so you don't know how long it's gonna be you don't have like a

1160
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,760
Do you have like a ballpark?

1161
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,760
Goal I I don't really I mean I don't have enough experience yet

1162
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:57,600
With how this the amount of words or the amount of story translates into screenplay and then sketch will it be in color?

1163
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,520
so

1164
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,520
Be in color. Yeah, will it be in color?

1165
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,160
The the the contest says it has to be in black and white. Oh, but I could easily make a color version later

1166
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,160
Um, I kind of want it to be in color because her hair is is red. Yeah, that's the cool thing

1167
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,840
She's got she has red fiery red hair like like

1168
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,520
Completely red not even a little bit of orange

1169
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,600
uh

1170
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,120
dude

1171
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,160
Let me complain about those pin the pins. Um

1172
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,800
They I gave them the the pixelated uh, uh red man design

1173
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:39,200
And they kept the pixelation, but they smoothed out the outer like corner or the outer edge of it

1174
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,440
So it's like a a like round, you know over at like egg shape

1175
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:50,480
Uh smooth on the outside and crunchy on the inside has the pixelated jagged edges and I was like, no, no

1176
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,560
You must fix this. This is unacceptable

1177
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,080
It needs it needs to be it needs to be painful to the touch

1178
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:00,560
And uh, she said we're on it. We're on it, sir

1179
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:06,080
Um, or at least they said that uh, yeah, I think they'll they'll fuck they'll fucking do it

1180
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,480
They'll fucking do it. I'm paying money. I had to pay I had to pay $900

1181
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:15,280
I had to pay $900 to get them the last like 18. Um, um

1182
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:22,000
Uh, the last 18 pins like the molds created and a sample produced and then them shipped

1183
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:27,360
It was like 950 or 60 bucks to get all that so fuck. Yeah, so that's fine

1184
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,960
That's fine. But then the actual production of the thing will be like as one penny. Uh, it'll be

1185
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,040
The the the place I found that I ended up going with is like, I think it's like five cents per

1186
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,280
One made and we're gonna end up making like several thousand of them. So

1187
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,560
You know, you know, whatever

1188
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,960
Uh, it's not it's not that bad. Well, because we went with the chinese

1189
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:57,360
A producer worse will will will end up turning a profit, which we did not expect to when we were when we originally planned it out and

1190
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,840
Planned to go with the uk-based, uh, manufacturer

1191
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:06,320
Um epic it's it is it's it's pretty epic. Um, fuck. Oh, no, I was gonna say

1192
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,440
What was I gonna say? What was I gonna say? I had I just something popped into my head. Oh

1193
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,320
Oh about the um

1194
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:20,880
So about the the black lives matter charity stream, which may be destroyed our the the procrastinators channel

1195
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:27,360
I don't know. Who knows who knows? Um, I did I guess I'm gonna have to wait until like

1196
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,920
Channel ad revenue pays out for that assuming we even get it at all now

1197
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,600
But like because I didn't want to wait. I already like paid out

1198
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,960
Like people donated including like munchy

1199
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:46,160
I've donated 50 and I said that I would pledge 50 and all and everyone else's pledges combined were like 702 dollars

1200
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:52,000
So I went and just like pledged I went and like donated 752 dollars just out of my own money

1201
01:26:52,720 --> 01:27:00,080
Uh, uh, just like to before like, you know waiting to like hopefully get that paid out from the channel and get Nate to send it to me

1202
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:07,600
I sure hope we're still getting it. Um, I mean I said I think we should I think we should because

1203
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:12,000
We should because the the google account is not destroyed

1204
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:16,160
Like the google account that's linked to the adsense account still exists

1205
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,680
So I don't see why that money would not come through

1206
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,520
Um, if it doesn't I guess I'm just personally out

1207
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:29,200
750 but don't worry everyone your donations went through they might have and they I don't know

1208
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,720
Hopefully they don't just come out of my pocket lemal. That would suck really hard

1209
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,280
Um, but we'll see they've been they've been donated already lemal

1210
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,320
Uh

1211
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,440
That's a that's a nightmare potential. Um

1212
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:49,600
Yeah a little uh, it's fine. Uh, it's okay. It's it's okay. I'm okay with whatever happens

1213
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,640
Um

1214
01:27:54,480 --> 01:28:01,120
Well, well, um, shall we go to voicemail? I guess we could go to voicemails. I I feel was there one last thing

1215
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,920
Is there any last thing that I wanted?

1216
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:10,560
That I wanted to bring up before we go. You know what if I think of anything. I'll just fucking interrupts. Yeah, let's go to voicemails

1217
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,800
Okay

1218
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,200
So I've got one two three four five

1219
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:21,520
There's there's five there's six, but one was for digi and digi's not here. Oh, so bummer, uh

1220
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,160
Let the meat play

1221
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,160
Let the meat cake

1222
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:32,400
Uh, this is I think chad thunder cock. Nice. I remember what he was what he said, but he

1223
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,360
Remakes are based and the original demon souls looked terrible. Um

1224
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,920
That was that it was about the the the the demon souls remake

1225
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,760
I mean, it was mostly directed to nate who apparently didn't like the

1226
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:53,120
The the look of of the demon souls remake. I thought it looked pretty cool

1227
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:57,360
Um, I haven't looked too much. I saw I saw matthew matosis saying

1228
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,000
That he thought that like

1229
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,400
He didn't seem to be a fan of the look of the new one

1230
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,840
I don't know. I haven't seen it. I haven't looked into it. I

1231
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:13,440
Super do not care. I I just think that this voicemail is a little dumb idiot because

1232
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,040
Okay

1233
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,640
For saying that the original demon souls looks like shit or looks bad

1234
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,880
No

1235
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:28,720
No, that's all I gotta say. No. No. No. No, it looks it looks great matthew matosis was saying everything everything old looks not

1236
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,480
You you know matthew matosis was saying something about like

1237
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,520
Okay, I know there's like the jail part

1238
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,960
And there's a part that's a jail with the mind flayers

1239
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,920
And he was saying that like the remake seems to be a lot of like

1240
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,320
Have a lot of like extra detail in it

1241
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:48,480
And he said that like it was like they added all this extra like detail

1242
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,480
But in a way that makes it look sort of like ornamented and like fancy

1243
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,680
But like it's not supposed to be a fancy place. It's supposed to be a very like

1244
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,320
Drab and like utilitarian place

1245
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,200
And uh, he I he didn't like that

1246
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,520
Which sounds like a reasonable complaint to me, but I didn't actually see anything

1247
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:10,480
And I've never played the game. So yeah, I've only I've only seen the trail. I haven't played the game

1248
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,920
It's good. I have not played I've only played dark souls and part of dark souls

1249
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,000
Two and a little bit of blood born and that's all the souls born. I've done

1250
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:23,360
Yeah demon souls the the thing that is weird like about demon souls

1251
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,680
is that

1252
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,680
um, you know graphically whatever

1253
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:33,520
It's an early ps3 game. They didn't have like a massive hit yet. So it's like certain things look a little cheap

1254
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,680
You know, but the atmosphere they created with demon souls is like the best of the entire series

1255
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,280
Yeah

1256
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,840
Like the the feeling of the locations is just so

1257
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:48,400
Perfectly crafted. That's why it's kind of almost my favorite. Yeah

1258
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,280
So this guy's saying it looks like shit. You can go away. That's what people do. Cool

1259
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,800
Uh, all right fair enough. Oh wait

1260
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,360
I should say, um, we

1261
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,920
I mean, who knows if it'll ever exist again

1262
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,520
But uh, because we did we did free three people

1263
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,960
We did pay the voice bail for three people in voice jail

1264
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:18,240
So, uh, three of them are out on on bail right now. This is lore and it was um, it was uh, oops

1265
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,560
Was it was it? Oh god. Oh no, I'm blanking. I'm blanking on who it was

1266
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,760
I know it was the japanese man yuta who I guess was the first person we ever put in voice jail

1267
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,960
It was um, yeah, nobody could remember. It was um

1268
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,400
Oh, no

1269
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:39,120
Who else who else got free? I don't remember. I don't even remember who's in who's in voice

1270
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,320
Yeah, we can't even go and back and check. We can't I can't go back and check

1271
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,880
I'm blanking. Hey reply in the comments if you were there remind us of remind me

1272
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:52,560
Remind me of who got freed from who got their their bail looks like we're just gonna have to lock them back up again

1273
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:59,440
Oh, no, no, we can't now. How how will we get them? How will we make sure they come back for their their court?

1274
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,280
They're they're a trial

1275
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,280
We've lost our records

1276
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:09,920
Hey, help us help us enforce help us enforce our our unjust, uh, racist, uh,

1277
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:16,400
Legal legal codes and penalties in the comments remind me of who got fucking freed

1278
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:19,200
I know it was japanese man yuta and two other people

1279
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,160
And I genuinely forget who the other two were

1280
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:29,120
Wait, didn't didn't you make an image? What what didn't you save an image of like when you say you freed them?

1281
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,840
Like you you had like a scratched off their name. It says free. Do you have that image still?

1282
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,640
Oh, you know what I fucking do I fucking do it it

1283
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,840
I'm so dumb. It was oh, it was mozilla fennekin and a well-researched thesis

1284
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:51,360
Yes, mozilla. There we go. So the those have bail they're out bail has been posted still in there is um

1285
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,720

1289
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:16,880
Uh, uh, just as just as planned. This is why we made voice jail to begin with

1290
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,640
Um

1291
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:22,880

1307
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:49,520
Okay, this this next one is uh called from lecture hacks. Yeah, it's a short one. Okay go

1308
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:56,080
I have a relatively serious inquiry that I want you all to discuss

1309
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:03,200
Uh, I am looking for some lecture tips and tricks. You know what I'm saying

1310
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:09,120
No, one aspect that I want to ask you guys about is

1311
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,240
Titling the lecture. Uh, you all seem to have a different way of doing it

1312
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,680
So I was hoping uh, you guys could maybe discuss your thoughts on that

1313
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,360
Thanks. Um, just title it whatever you think is funny

1314
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,720
But also explains what it is. That's it

1315
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,280
I everyone told me

1316
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:32,320
Everyone told me not to title the jennifer dayan writes lecture. Uh, um

1317
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:39,120
Oh, what did I end up titling it? It's like jennifer dayan writes and the birth of a multiverse or something

1318
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:45,680
Yeah, something something like that. I want I just I just thought it was funny to give it a title that sounds like a like

1319
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:52,800
Like a freshman seminar course at like a liberal arts college like the like the class name is like this long like sentence

1320
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,200
I just thought that was goofy

1321
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,240
um

1322
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,240
And uh, so I did it and that's

1323
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:04,240
That's it. Was that seo optimized? No, not really. Um, but I didn't care

1324
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,920
Yeah, I mean really the the subject matter is the most important thing

1325
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:17,840
If you wanted to if you wanted to like succeed and be found by the most people then give it like a very utilitarian just just like have it

1326
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:24,800
Have just just make sure the title says what it's about says that it's a lecture and if you can fit like a funny

1327
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,120
I don't know

1328
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,600
If put a lot of exclamation points in there, I don't know

1329
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:38,640
Yeah, obviously I was I was hoping there would be at least one other person who's done a lecture in here to answer this question

1330
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,200
my the the risk a lecture I think I called like

1331
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:46,720
Risk a circuit 101 so like a an introductory course to what risk a circuit is

1332
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,200
Which is seems all right

1333
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:53,200
Like like what like the best character in how to appreciate the best character in Homestuck is like

1334
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:59,840
You know that'll that'll get him if somebody doesn't believe that they'll be like what how could they how could they do this?

1335
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:06,240
And then they click I mean, but like I don't know to me a title like that is interesting and like what is this

1336
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,120
Like why would anybody make a video call this?

1337
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,920
Uh, I guess like we got to check it out

1338
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,240
um, so

1339
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,000
Yeah, just like

1340
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Make it clear what it's about

1341
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:24,480
Call it 101. I get I don't I to me just like calling it something 101 is just funny

1342
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,800
It's just funny that there is a thing called like

1343
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,040
Sonichu 101

1344
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:32,000
And it's a lecture. So I don't know I could just lean into that I guess

1345
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,840
um

1346
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,840
Or just come up with something else funny

1347
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:40,000
If you think you have the fucking chops for it you dumb piece of shit

1348
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,720
um

1349
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:45,120
That's it. Yeah, it's about it. That's it. Um

1350
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,480
This next one this is the one I was talking about ben

1351
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,160
Uh, the whereabout it's about Nate. Okay

1352
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,520
I don't know should I play yeah fucking play it. Yeah fucking play it. Whatever

1353
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,400
Okay, now that you said it that I am

1354
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:05,040
Absoluble crimes they can respond they can respond next week if you feel so inclined

1355
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,560
Yeah, so this is from a dramatic tweet reading. Yeah, uh go

1356
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:15,280
In response to one Nate best man

1357
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:23,840
I'm disappointed that I can't find a tweet post anything about blm from you

1358
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,560
You've said the n word in videos

1359
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:34,080
Claiming it's okay because you love boondocks rap music content from black creators, etc

1360
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,320
And you don't get why people say you shouldn't say it

1361
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:41,920
Because if you really loved black culture as much as you say you do

1362
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:47,120
Now in times where black people need public allies you are a ghost

1363
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,400
Being not racist yourself isn't enough you need to be

1364
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,240
actively

1365
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,920
anti-racist

1366
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,600
You can reach so many

1367
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:04,560
I just haven't seen you a creator. I love use their platform to support what he says he loves so much

1368
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:10,160
Which makes me think you're scared to lose subs or you support how things currently are

1369
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:15,840
Because being neutral allows this to continue which is supporting racism

1370
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Hmm

1371
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,240
Yeah, um, so yeah

1372
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,080
thoughts I

1373
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,640
I I generally agree with the assertion

1374
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,920
Yeah, but I think I I I feel like

1375
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:32,480
It's it's definitely more of like I don't don't want to lose subs

1376
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,200
By rocking the boat sort of thing if I don't if I don't say anything political then

1377
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,920
Um, I can't lose anything

1378
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,480
Um, or can you?

1379
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,880
Um, uh, I mean

1380
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,720
Like I I I I understand I mean the the

1381
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:54,400
Approach because lots of people do it, but it's like yeah, I don't know you've got a lot of subscribers

1382
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,880
You've got a lot of twitter followers. It would be nice does just to say a little thing. I mean

1383
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:06,160
Does Nate I don't okay the one the one I agree with basically everything the one thing

1384
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:08,160
I'm not sure I agree with is like

1385
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,160
Is it is it?

1386
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:14,960
I don't remember Nate saying like oh, I love black culture

1387
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,200
He doesn't seem like a

1388
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:19,840
Champion of that or anything. I don't know if that's quite fair

1389
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:26,320
To characterize him as like oh you claim to love black culture so much. I mean, I know he does like the boondocks and maybe those other things

1390
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,480
I don't know

1391
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:34,320
But yeah, I do think it's I think he just likes things that he likes. Yeah, which are good. Yeah, um

1392
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,880
I do think not

1393
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,360
I do think not speaking out in support of blm is super cringe

1394
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,120
uh

1395
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,120
Very dumb and and lame

1396
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,760
uh, and I um, so

1397
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,560
I don't know I

1398
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:57,280
There's not really much to say like I know that well, I don't I would encourage everybody just to say speak out about it

1399
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,280
I think it's good to do that

1400
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,560
I think

1401
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,200
Like fuck anyone who would like unfollow you

1402
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,480
For that like fucking get out of here. I don't know

1403
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,040
Fuck youtube who will delete your fucking youtube channel

1404
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,760
If you do it, I don't know

1405
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,360
I just feel like it's a little hypothetically. It's a little unfortunate that Nate is not here to

1406
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,400
I agree say what he would say so like

1407
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,800
Nate, I'm sorry

1408
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:30,400
Well, you know, I felt like this like I agreed with this enough to post to to play it

1409
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,920
Yeah, I'd like to hear what you have to say. I would like I would I would like to hear

1410
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,800
If Nate would like to respond to this next week. I'm sure that would be fine

1411
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,000
If not, we'll all be judging

1412
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:48,800
Okay, cool. Yeah, how many more we got one more

1435
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,960
So

1436
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:41,040
So for what I understand that is a new episode of Seinfeld

1437
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,160
About the the shower

1438
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:50,400
George the showering thing that happened last week the showering thing. Wait, what the the shower speedrun

1439
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:54,640
I think that's what it was. It's like there's a shower speedrun. There was a baby

1440
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,120
And the baby was pissing and then I don't know I forget who it was

1441
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:03,360
But he he did the shower speedrun so that he could get laid so that people would think he was cool

1442
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,080
um

1443
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,640
It was a little avant-garde a little

1444
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:14,640
I don't remember the shower speedrun thing at all to be to be honest

1445
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:21,040
For from last week the whole Nate was like going like the beginning of the other thing. He was like talking about speed running

1446
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:27,200
Getting in the shower. Oh, yes. Lathering. Yeah. Okay. No. Yeah, I do remember. No. Yep. Yep. Got it. All right

1447
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,400
I see. There's like what if try baby piss

1448
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:38,240
Yeah, what what if that was uh seinfeld and also said by real my ass batman. That's that's that's the the voicemail

1449
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,120
I think it was pretty good. That's the voicemail

1450
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:45,440
All right. We we did it. We got we got a little bit of everything in today

1451
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:48,240
And with just the two of us

1452
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:52,720
Uh, uh, uh, we can we can now reap the spoils

1453
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:58,240
We can now reap all that sweet ad revenue from our channel that doesn't fucking exist anymore

1454
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,080
I'll be a little I'll be a little embarrassed

1455
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:07,040
I'd be a little embarrassed if like the channel came back and this goat does go up on the channel

1456
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,640
But like that's fine. But like it's worth it. We don't know at the moment

1457
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:14,800
It's worth the risk. We don't know at the moment people understand that like if it comes back then

1458
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:20,320
You know, we'll have egg on our face. But at least it'll be a tasty egg. We could we could yeah, we can have an egg

1459
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,080
I'm willing to risk it. I'll if if that's what it takes like I'll be fine

1460
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:29,280
I'll be I can accept some embarrassment. Just please just you two just don't be fucking shit

01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,760
