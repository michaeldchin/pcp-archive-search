00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,600
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:44,520
I am the best guy ever and I am here today with Hippocrit.

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,240
I haven't seen you with a tiny hat in a while, I'm getting disillusioned and also Digibro.

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm still alive, somehow, despite all that drug and alcohol content.

5
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:10,320
Our topic for today is the elusive, mysterious concept of a convention, specifically a nerd,

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,960
geek, stupid, retard convention for babies who poop in their diapers.

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Which you, as I understand, are a huge fan of.

8
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,760
I love more than pooping my own diaper, I love to poop in other people's diapers, and

9
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,960
smear it all over my manhood.

10
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,560
Right, so we're talking about conventions.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,600
So I know that Digi and I and Munchy have been to conventions, Gibb, what's your experience

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
with conventions?

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Well, I've been to three conventions ever, the first one was London Expo, I don't know

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,320
what it was called, I think it was just called the London Expo and it's this huge big thing

15
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,840
in London, near the river, and it was just nerd stuff, there was games, there was anime,

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,560
it was all sorts of stuff, I got a Phoenix Wright book and some badges for Hitman Reborn

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,640
and I don't know, I was going there with friends and it was really my first experience

18
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,880
of seeing cosplayers in real life and it was actually a lot cooler than I thought it would

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
be.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
That was that.

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Then there was...

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
Well, those good cosplayers, yeah.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,920
Yeah, and then the second one was the Bronycon, which is slightly documented on my channel

24
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:30,160
on Gibb and Tay, and that was the first time I met you guys, in fact all of you in school

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,600
is the first time I met you in real life.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,000
And after that is Radcon 1 and 2 and that's it.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh, I know those.

28
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,680
That's a conference though, it's not a convention.

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
That's close enough.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,240
It was certainly a con, I feel ripped off.

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,520
Yeah, I got'em.

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
It's gay.

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,480
Well, okay, I don't know about you guys, but I have not been, I mean yes, I went to

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,800
Bronycon with you guys, but that was like for a good reason.

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,360
When I was young, I used to go to anime conventions very frequently and would cosplay and would

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,240
be really excited for them, even though I always had a shitty time, but now I realized

37
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,960
it's kind of like my experience with D&D, when I was young I got really excited for it,

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,960
but now I realize that they're terrible and I don't enjoy them at all, but it's possible

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,280
that there's new ways for me to experience them, and in the future I'll figure out ways

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,120
to make them fun.

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,120
And looking forward to that one day, for example, doing a panel and being praised by the public

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,000
for my genius and my creative abilities, that would be cool.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,480
I kind of feel like I missed out on the con experience, because the second con I went

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,440
to, I was already on a panel, and the first con I went to, I wasn't really doing anything,

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,040
I was just walking around overwhelmed by it, but I kind of liked, you know, I saw somebody

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,040
in a Luffy, like they cosplayed as when Luffy was wearing wax on his hands and feet.

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,280
Yeah, Champion Luffy, I remember that.

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,600
Yeah, and I was just like, whoa, this is like things I know and like, and people are making

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,000
good costumes, and there's like a fucking metric ton of key blades, I didn't really know

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,240
how that was.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,520
Yeah, I kind of wish I was going to cons earlier, because they seemed like fun for a kid, or

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,400
a young teenager, and I missed out.

53
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,080
Oh, and which I am, and greatly enjoy.

54
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,240
Allegedly.

55
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,000
I think you're an undercover adult.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,240
I think you're trying, I think what you are, are a plant by the FBI to convict us all of

57
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
pedophilia.

58
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
That's what I suspect you are.

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,600
You're trying to bait us into it, but I'm not going to crack.

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,000
In Andrew Hussie's webcomic, whistles the clown, there's a species of plants that only

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,360
eat clowns, and that's what I am.

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,280
I'm a plant that only eats clowns.

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,680
I've been to a few conventions in my day, but which ones did you go to?

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,800
I've mostly been to Otacon a bunch of times, and it's sort of similar to Unate.

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,600
The first time I ever went to Otacon was in 2008, and it was the greatest experience

66
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
of my life.

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,640
It was mind-blowing, and life-changing, it was the coolest thing ever, and every single

68
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,120
year since, it has been worse.

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,640
Like progressively, it's less and less interesting, less and less fun, and there was one time

70
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:30,920
that I went to NecoCon, which is a local anime convention, and that was enough.

71
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,920
I went to one local convention, and my conclusion was local conventions aren't worth it.

72
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
You go to the big ones.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
That's definitely true.

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,960
Because there's nothing at a local convention.

75
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,560
It's just an excuse for a bunch of nerds to stand around together.

76
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,360
There are a few functions that are served by a convention.

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,560
Mostly my experience is with anime conventions, and to me, they serve as A, a gathering place

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,160
for like-minded people.

79
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,160
That one is already horrible, because I've never met a person at a convention I liked.

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
It's always been terrible.

81
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Yeah, that's fair.

82
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,920
I mean, it is a huge gathering place for autism.

83
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,140
It simply is, and I don't like hanging out with autistic people.

84
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
They make me uncomfortable.

85
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,160
More so than autism, just nerds.

86
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,280
I mean, I would say we're all on the spectrum there when it comes to nerds, but it's not

87
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,560
even that most of them are weird.

88
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,760
They're just kind of awkward, or have a different sense of humor.

89
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,960
I feel like the problem that I have with nerds in general of hanging out with them is that

90
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,880
nerds are a class of people who think that having a shared knowledge is the same thing

91
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:49,880
as having a personality, or a joke is simply stating a reference to a thing, and at conventions,

92
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,160
that's really amplified to the upteeth degree, where you could have a panel going on and

93
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,240
someone makes reference to, and not all shows are good, and then someone in the crowd is

94
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,840
going to go, like, guards is wing, and then people go, I also know what that is, and that

95
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,520
kind of shit, that's the element of conventions that always makes me want to not be there

96
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
anymore.

97
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,920
I don't blame people for wanting to share that kind of relationship with each other.

98
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,160
It's just that that, with the absence of a decent person behind it, or just a personality

99
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,480
behind it, that's where it's a problem.

100
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
I agree.

101
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
I hate conventions.

102
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Don't go.

103
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,480
I think people who are awkward are awkward, and fuck them, but I do appreciate the nerdy

104
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,360
convention area for allowing real human beings like us to convene, because like, BronyCon

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,800
was like, I mean, at the time everyone was kind of tired of the pony stuff, but it was

106
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,120
just really cool to just go to a place and generally know people that know you.

107
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,040
I need some huge scare quotes on real people when it comes to us.

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm real, I think.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's true.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,040
But really, I wanted to talk about what is the function that a convention serves that

111
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,480
draws people to it, because you've talked about this before, Digi, and how, like, the

112
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,960
only thing that you can get out them.

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:23,920
I think it's precisely because it's mostly nerds, because nerds don't go out and have

114
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
friends.

115
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,640
This is their only chance to get together and make their stupid jokes and not be ridiculed

116
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
for it.

117
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,840
They just want an internet forum, but in IRL, you know, IRL, internet forum.

118
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,000
But see, okay, you know, that's true, that's true, but all right, it's just a much bigger

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,680
deal for everyone, so which is why it keeps getting funded all over the place in different

120
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
forms.

121
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Yeah.

122
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,960
And I mean, maybe people have figured this out better than me, all right, but I've got

123
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,600
an axe to grind here, because I kind of had this idea when I was young, and I started

124
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
going to conventions.

125
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,880
Me and my brother went to anime Boston every year for, like, eight years, and...

126
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,400
Your brother being Ben St.

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Ben St.

128
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Ben St.

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
That's right.

130
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Not up on the times here.

131
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
That's true.

132
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,520
And Connecticut, which is a smaller one, and was less worth our time, but still went occasionally,

133
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,360
and I've been to a few here and there.

134
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,440
The highlight of my entire congoing experience was when I found out that, and this is like

135
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,320
one of the things that cons are useful for, actually, Yoshitaka Amano, illustrator of

136
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,920
Final Fantasy, was at, like, New York, not Comic-Con, but like some New York comic convention,

137
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,040
and me and a friend from my anime club and college found out, and she wanted to go.

138
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,280
I can't remember why.

139
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,000
Um, actually, this was funny.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,400
This was when Gurren Logan had just taken off in a big way, and I had not seen it yet,

141
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,640
so we went to the convention, everything was Gurren Logan, and I had no idea what any of

142
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
it was.

143
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
It was...

144
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
It's funny to think it back to that.

145
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Crazy.

146
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,960
But anyway, I met Amano there and got to shake his hand and have his autograph that I have

147
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,520
to this day, and that was like the best thing Akon has ever provided for me.

148
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,680
But when I was a little kid, what I wanted out of an anime convention was nerd friends,

149
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,280
and I would go there, I got dressed up like fucking Monkey D. Luffy, I sewed my costume

150
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,920
with my mom for weeks, if not months, worked really hard on it, got together, you know,

151
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,800
all my money so I could afford to buy things and have a fun time there, and I went there,

152
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,720
and I stood in halls, and I walked around, and I looked at things, and no friends appeared

153
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
to me.

154
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,280
No friends magically sprung up for me, and I will never forgive conventions for hyping

155
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,920
me up for making friends and then not delivering.

156
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,520
I'll never forget the disappointment I had when I was coming home, and I had just spent

157
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:43,240
a bunch of money on anime bullshit I didn't need or want, and was still a sad child.

158
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,680
That was cruel of you, fucking anime Boston, that was very cruel of you.

159
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,840
How cruel and unusual to present merchandise, and then have the option to buy it.

160
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,720
That is, resist capitalism, baby!

161
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,880
I kind of like that whole like, I mean, not like being sad, I mean like making a costume

162
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,560
and being a bit of a loser faggot idiot, making a costume, wearing a costume.

163
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,320
I kind of want to do that still, like even though I know there's nothing to really be

164
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
gained from it.

165
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,760
I kind of want to make like a really terrible home stuff come play of some kind.

166
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
Well that's the thing though, it's fun, it's fun in and of itself.

167
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,040
And then to go with friends though, it's totally different.

168
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,560
I never went with friends, I went with my brother who it wasn't cool to hang out with

169
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
and my mom.

170
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,400
So, like I was just there hoping things would happen for me, and they didn't.

171
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,760
Nate, we have to understand this, the reason I like cons, because I exclusively go to cons

172
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,360
with friends, and it's always a fucking blast.

173
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,480
Because really like the difference between going to Disneyland by yourself and with friends.

174
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Exactly.

175
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,640
Like there's stuff to do, but it doesn't feel the same.

176
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,680
I'll say that I do think part of what has made cons that are like Otacon weaker for

177
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,120
me year after year, is that like I do go with my friends, but we don't stay together.

178
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,000
We all split up and go do different things, and we don't really hang out during, like

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,880
Victor always, my brother Victor, he always goes with his girlfriend Hope, you know,

180
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,000
and so they, like he immediately fucks off to hang out with her the whole time, you know,

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,520
even if we, I mean last year he drove up with her, but it used to be he'd come with us,

182
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,600
and she would just happen to also, you know, be going.

183
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,000
But then like, you know, my other friends, we all have kind of different, you know, anime

184
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,240
we're interested in, or different things we want to see, so we all just split up and

185
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,800
we rarely end up encountering each other, and it can be weird, like going around to

186
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,440
this stuff alone, and then just kind of feeling like, is this, like does this mean that much

187
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,440
to me, that I'm like, that I'm willing to, you know, drive four and a half hours and

188
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,360
spend all this money just to like be in this place, so I can sit alone and, you know, and

189
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,200
just see this thing that I've seen some variation of eight times already, you know, no matter

190
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
what it is.

191
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Yeah.

192
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,360
To me, it feels really like 2006, in the sense of like, I don't know, like it reminds

193
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,000
me of a time when like full metal alchemist, the first one had come out, and everyone was

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,840
getting really excited about and watching things on the fucking adult swim and to Nami,

195
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,800
and like there was an emergence of this culture, but now, I don't know, I feel like it's gotten

196
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
a little stale.

197
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
I mean, there was a time where-

198
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
I'm over it.

199
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,880
Yeah, there was a time where you could go to a convention, and like every con, every

200
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,680
anime convention has like screenings of different shows, and you know, there was a time when

201
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,240
they would be screening something that you legitimately couldn't find, you know, like

202
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,680
you did not know where to buy the DVD or the VHS, you didn't know where to stream it or

203
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
download it.

204
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,440
Like you could go to a convention and see something that, that like, you know, just

205
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
sitting and watching anime could actually be valuable.

206
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,080
And now it's like, there's no, like when you go to those screenings now, they literally

207
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,480
stream them off Crunchyroll, like it's just them playing Crunchyroll on a screen, you

208
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
know.

209
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,560
Just thinking about that is hilarious.

210
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Yeah.

211
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,080
Like, even if you were going with your friends, it's like, I could sit with my friends and

212
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,800
watch this at home, and instead I'm watching it in a giant group, and like, there are times

213
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,440
where that can be fun to see an audience react to something, but then there's the other times

214
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,880
where the audience is laughing at the wrong moments, and it like, I get, I'm a fucking

215
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,320
pretentious elitist faggot when it comes to this shit, but I really can't stand being

216
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,560
in a crowd that seems to be getting something very different out of something than what

217
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
I'm getting.

218
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Like-

219
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Dude, I totally agree.

220
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,640
I can't stand consuming media with one other person there in the, in the fear that, like

221
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,200
not even that they do it, but in the fear that they'll get it wrong or not be in sync

222
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
with me.

223
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,240
Can't stand, if I'm taking it seriously, can't stand it.

224
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,200
Like it was so great when we all watched Mad Bull together at Radcon too, which is like

225
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,280
nine guys screaming the whole time at Mad Bull, and that's very much like what the convention

226
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,240
experience should be at its height, but could you imagine watching that, like watching Mad

227
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,720
Bull with like different people, and you don't know who they are, and they could be, you

228
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,480
know, like, that's a show that a lot of people say is, quote, awesomely bad, or is like a,

229
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,200
a really terrible show, and like imagine if you're in that crowd, the, you know, this

230
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,920
is a, oh, like the title of the panel is, So Bad It's Good, shitty anime that you should

231
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,400
check out, you know, Mad Bull 34.

232
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,360
I promise that's it, like that has happened, Mad Bull has been in those panels, I've seen

233
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,840
it, you know, so like, yeah, that's, that's how I feel in those crowd situations is like,

234
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,600
on the one hand, I love, like my favorite thing, well, one of my favorite things about

235
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,740
conventions is the, like the feeling of these are my people, you know, these are the people

236
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,440
who are watching anime, who I'm talking to online, this is, this is the crowd who gets

237
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,520
what I'm about on some level, but at the same time, they're totally not my people, because

238
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,800
they're, they're walking around dressed as Kirito, you know, and being like, anime is

239
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,760
great, and I'm like, I'm like, Japanese

240
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,240
Japanese

241
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:25,680
you guys are completely off base, off color, and this is based totally in the fact that

242
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,760
you guys are losers, if you guys, if you guys weren't losers, then you would realize that

243
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,520
cons are great, I can still imagine myself enjoying a con, definitely, well, I would,

244
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,960
I would never call him a loser, I'm, I'm, I'm talking about the other two numbskull

245
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,840
knuckleheads, of course, of course, exhibit, I'm hoping, I'm hoping this year to fly out

246
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,920
to stay with Munchie for anime X though, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, but believe me, I have like

247
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,320
a whole like, like fucking history of every con I've been to, and the ups and downs of

248
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,640
each con, I heard the crinkling of a piece of paper, you said that, you actually wrote

249
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:07,760
this down, I actually have, anyway, cons are great, because they offer three things, and

250
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,080
by three things, I mean, I'm thinking of one in my head, and once I'm done with that one,

251
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,240
I'll probably have more ideas in my head. Okay, when you, when you get, when you get

252
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,920
your bros, when you get your beefcakes, when you get your, your manly fucking men that

253
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,320
you surround yourself with on a daily basis, you know, the fucking, the, your people, your

254
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,280
stash, your handboys, your handboys, your handboys, when you get them all in the car,

255
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,160
and you go up to some like shitty, like anime, like, like, you all hate anime, not you, but

256
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,640
as in like, like, you and your friends all hate anime, and you go up to an anime convention,

257
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,120
it's fucking great, because you just get to be, be little, ridicule, and antagonize all

258
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,080
of the goers of the con, go to panels, ruin them, you know what you are, Munchy? You're

259
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,800
a fucking Chad, that's who you are, you're a disgusting fucking Chad, I'm just a little

260
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,960
boy trying to make friends, and here you come, with you, we're a bully squad, trying to embarrass

261
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,280
you, one of the things that I love, go fuck yourself, Munchy.

262
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,320
Munchy, have you been to a furry convention, and done that?

263
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,800
Oh my god, no, but that's been, that's been a fucking top billing, dude. Well, I guess

264
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,160
you could, well, I have been to various Brony conventions, so, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

265
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,240
Is, is, is that why you were at BronyCon? Just to laugh at us?

266
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,320
No, no, no, that was, that was, that was a fucking joke, that was a charade, that was,

267
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,360
that was, that was a meme, that was a jest. I like to go with my friends to conventions,

268
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,080
A, we, we, we, like, like, me and my friends are both in sync, and we know what we would

269
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,280
like, and we'd go to the same panels together, because, you know, we both have an appreciation

270
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,760
for whoever the fuck Japanese retard bitch, whoever's talking, you know, you want to-

271
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,760
I like how this has gone from me and my friends to we, the two of us, have this connection.

272
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,960
You're, it's, it's one totally different feeling from this description mask.

273
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,800
Well, see, well, yes, well, it's, it's one guy, but he changes masks, more often than

274
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,680
you. He plays many roles in the munchy, like, in munch's life.

275
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,360
Cosplayers. You know?

276
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,840
No, no, he, as in, like, one, like, one to two people come, but it's always, like, different

277
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,280
people.

278
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
As in he finds victims and he skins them and wears their skin.

279
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,080
As in I kill Native Americans.

280
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,720
What was they fucking, oh yeah, we go there and we all-

281
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,040
Talk about how you like conventions.

282
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,120
Yes, and we all, we appreciate the panels together, and then we go buy merch where

283
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,760
we couldn't buy it anywhere else, or at least I don't know how to. I don't want to use a fucking

284
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,000
computer, it's hard.

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,560
I see the one one is a big thing. That's like the one good thing about convinced one time

286
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,600
I literally ask did you how to buy anime because I didn't know how to and then he taught me and then I still didn't know

287
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,440
Did I did I did did you ask me that and then I immediately made that entire 40 minute buyers?

288
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,120
No, no, I asked you like a year after that and then like like while you were teaching me

289
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,720
I Google search like how to buy anime merch then I saw that thumbnail and then I remember that I

290
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,400
Linked you the thumbnail with fire around your eyes and like you glowing like a fucking golden crisp God

291
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
Anyway, so you can buy the merchant with you with your meaty your meaty your meaty sockets

292
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:17,360
And you just have a fucking good time you get to hang out and you get to spend time in an exotic city with exotic sluts

293
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,960
Doing gay shit, and you get to fucking you just look at lots and it's sick

294
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,000
Tell me about the sluts and if I go to a convention are there exotic sluts there? What's what's happening here?

295
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,720
Oh my god, it's Jesse. Oh shit. Okay. I've been here the whole

296
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,520
Jesse did join like ten minutes ago. I wasn't sure if he was like you sound like you're underwater. Yeah, I was gonna say

297
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:49,520
Yeah, you're like you were just drowned you were drowning in water. Do I are you mouth deep and pussy again, Jesse?

298
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,260
That is a possibility there are many possibilities

299
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:01,440
The other possibility could be that my microphone is broken from the flood nobody knows everything. Oh my god

300
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,240
Oh god the fucking three hundred dollar one broke. I don't know as you guys are saying I sound underwater. I haven't heard it yet

301
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,120
I don't fucking know nothing. Oh, yeah, it broke in the underwater boy

302
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,440
Either a broker you're just recording through the wrong microphone, which I am an underwater boy

303
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,600
And I have aids and no one can stop me

304
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
from having a

305
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
right now Jesse yeah

306
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,840
Yes, all right, that's cool. Jesse. You want to talk about your convention actually much you motherfucker. I'm not done

307
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,320
I'm fucking you alive. Wrap it up. You're taking the whole fucking

308
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,160
I'm saying is damn at

309
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:45,640
At an expo. I'm munchy. Oh my god. Listen buddy. I deserve time. Okay. Hey, it's his catchphrase listen buddy

310
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
It's my favorite

311
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,220
Get on the ground you fucking nigger

312
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:09,240
An expo I got a girl gone. I imagine a sitcom about munchy like he's the Kramer he comes in the door

313
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,800
I and like whatever something weird happens. He looks at the camera and goes get on the ground you

314
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,480
Hired out like a clown to children's parties. Hey kids get on the ground you fucking niggers

315
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,280
Imagine you're watching like like a normal sign-of-the-lip episode and like Jerry's in his apartment

316
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,640
He's talking to George about how he can't get late or something and then like like I burst through the door like Kramer

317
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,080
Like like in my piece of jumpsuit and never just wetter. I'm just get on the ground you fucking diggers

318
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,280
And George would be like I'm getting frustrated by all these racial slurs. I'm not even black

319
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,960
To wrap this up. I like her in the gun. I got a girl in the gun book

320
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,040
I couldn't have got that anywhere else other than a so and it made me happy and I really like it and um, yes, okay

321
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,680
Okay, bye merchandise is cool. That's that's one fun thing

322
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,360
I never would have ever gotten Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix plus if I hadn't seen it well that fateful day

323
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,400
A good like convention piece of merchandise yet. It's about the fucking experience

324
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,400
I guess I've probably spent you by your diamond tiara fucking plushie yet. Yeah, but that was a piece of shit

325
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,080
It was like the one that the cheapest made plushie. She's she's sure I'm a chair is crying right now

326
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,960
She's diamond tiara is so rich. She deserves to be made out of fucking gold

327
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,320
I got the cheapest one because I'm a bitch

328
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:41,320
I should I couldn't find a better one and that was I've probably lifetime spent like at least five grand on

329
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,000
Merchant conventions

330
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,320
Like that's that's one of the big reasons I go there is to drop a lot of money

331
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,680
I spent more money there than anywhere else, but I was never that big of a spender on that kind of stuff anyway

332
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,880
I go to conventions to spend money and kill people. Yeah a huge part of

333
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,660
Why I went to Otacon so many times is that it happens to almost always fall directly on my birthday

334
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,960
Which is August 8th and so my dad would usually like you know like he'd he'd you know

335
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
Buy me the trip to Otacon and give me a bunch of spending money, and I just blow through it all there

336
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,080
Oh, yeah, so so it's like a big birthday thing for me

337
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:26,920
That's where I got a lot of my figures a lot of my posters a lot of my art books and just a bunch of other shit

338
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,440
All of which I regret none of this none of that money should ever have been spent

339
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,200
With me is at the moment is like I don't have any like huge

340
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,960
Like desire to own things about a thing like even though my little pony wasn't that great

341
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
I have a lunar plushie, but that was like a gift

342
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,280
So you know that's great, but like I wouldn't buy a lot of brony stuff

343
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,680
The only thing I would buy is like home stuck but home sucks dead and no one will make any home

344
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,000
Suck art not an animax bro. Not an animax, bro X bro

345
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,440
There's so much home stuck shit there. I was in my boggles my mind. Oh shit. Well, I gotta go there then

346
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,980
I gotta go. There's this one risk. There's this one brisket cosplayer that was just like

347
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Oh

348
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,620
Is that

349
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,500
Attraction is that what that's I like it

350
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,340
Yeah, you know when you start to foam at the mouth and also foam at your penis

351
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,180
Yes, yes, I do you've all you've all kind of covered my my main reasons for going to conventions

352
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:34,020
But I want to summarize them like that that there's pretty much three big ones and then a fourth one that applies to me and you guys to some extent

353
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,020
Well, to the same extent really but anyways

354
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,500
The first big reason is you know being around your people to whatever whatever

355
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,300
Ills or games that may entail and for me the best like the ultimate being around my people thing

356
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:54,140
Cuz like, you know out in the convention halls. I don't care man. It's just a bunch of fucking, you know

357
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,220
People I don't want to talk to you know in the panels. I don't care

358
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,060
But there's one place I go at Otsa Khan every year and I spend hours there

359
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Which is Otsa karaoke?

360
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,180
I hang out in the karaoke room all day and just listen to people

361
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:18,060
Attempt to sing anime songs and that's when I truly feel at home because you have to have a certain level of

362
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:24,700
Like passion to want to do it. It's to an audience of nobody. There's only like ten people who hang out in there

363
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,420
There's a bunch of regulars who every year. It's the same few people singing there

364
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
You know singing the songs

365
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,100
You're getting up every year and I recognize all of them though. I don't talk to them. We communicate only through song

366
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,020
That's not entirely true. I do I I trade a few words, but I you know

367
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,180
I don't like fucking buddy up with them or anything

368
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,260
They're they're often cosplaying and stuff

369
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:54,060
I mean you're gonna hear the fucking every song from Inuyasha a thousand times and you're gonna hear a bunch of the same songs every year

370
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,060
What it's always interesting to hear

371
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,060
God bless

372
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,180
You know that Haruhi one not a lot of that not a lot of not a lot of God knows

373
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,740
I would be the one probably to go up and sing that

374
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,180
I do that one. That's a classic, but

375
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:14,580
But it's always interesting to see which song is the big one that year like this past year. It was all JoJo, you know

376
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,780
JoJo so big is that a JoJo reference?

377
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,300
What indeed

378
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:37,020
Anyways, yeah, I always hang out there. That's my best like connecting with the nerds place. Then there's the merchandise which

379
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,820
Was a lot more impressive when I was younger because Otakan has a merch room

380
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,780
that's the size of a fucking aircraft hangar and

381
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,100
And and you know, it's it the first year I went there

382
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,940
I legitimately got lost for like an hour and just was exploring this wonderland of anime crap

383
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,260
I have returned. I left the call

384
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Welcome back bloody dead man

385
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,300
Oh, no bloody dead man's gonna bloody kill us. I left to increase my age. That's Babadook spook

386
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,460
This is just me. This is just my voice now

387
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,020
I'm just a broken man

388
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,060
Bloody dead man has like a British accent. That's true. What he dead man is the father of under Taylor

389
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,340
I thought I told you that I disowned you you're not my family anymore

390
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
Oh

391
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,980
You're a disgrace to the dead man family name because you're you're weird and just slightly a different way than me

392
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,780
This it makes total sense like the bloody dead man disowned his son because he liked undertale too much and now

393
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:04,820
Sansa is a surrogate father. He's like he's perverted in just slightly the wrong way, and I don't want him anymore

394
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,300
And I never had a father figure. That's why I want to suck your weirest of my own fathers

395
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,100
They're sending you little and great. I've tried to suck mini a lemon pipe in my day

396
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,380
And when I do it I bite him because I'm kind of a vampire maybe or something. I don't know

397
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:29,380
Dad it's not my fault the bot flies choose me. They chose me. I didn't choose the bot fly lifestyle

398
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:36,500
Listen the last bot fly that I was in a committed relationship with was your mother and she was a vampire bot fly

399
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Oh my god, his mother was a bot fly

400
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,540
You think bot flies had

401
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,700
After these vampire bot flies they get inside your lemon pipe and they turn it into a kool-aid pipe

402
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,420
They turn you into a bloody dead man

403
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,420
They turn you into a fucking ruddy leaky bloody dead man cock is what I've done for god damn dead boy

404
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,780
No

405
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
Does anyone else fuck you son?

406
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,620
No dad you're gay. Do you stop?

407
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,460
Some have called me that. Many have called me that in my 5000 years on this earth gay

408
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,260
But it's only one of the many things I am

409
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:23,700
Bitch, I'm on a crest to save sense and told me to kill all the gay people and I'll have to kill you

410
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:29,140
That's what I've talked to you. I haven't talked to in 16 years, but now I'm finished if I

411
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,140
Years is but a blink of an eye to me. I've been here since before the dawn of time

412
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,340
I only went down to the store to get a pack of cigarettes

413
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,860
I was going to come back one of these centuries. I swear

414
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:49,940
Lend me strength so I can kill my bitch dad. There's no such thing as sense and I hate my son. Fuck you

415
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,740
You're just gay

416
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,260
Oh, no, they left. Where'd they go? Oh, they're gone

417
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,020
Oh, it's

418
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,620
What lore what adventures we have here in the procrastinator's podcast

419
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,140
You know what? You know what we could the amount of characters that we have in the pcp

420
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,340
We could we could all cosplay them and go to a convention. Oh my god. I mean this there's even yeah

421
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:17,620
I'm gonna cosplay the undertaler my son. You should. Oh, does that mean I'm the bloody dead man? Oh, shit

422
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,460
Yes, I'm like the young years. You know like the once learn that like the laurax movie

423
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,940
I'm like that version of the bloody dead man. Oh, like the young like that makes sense. That makes sense

424
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,940
Yeah, one she the twink

425
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,140
But she's a fucking six foot one

426
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:42,180
230 pound twink well well compared to the bloody dead man who is like the like like the the opposite of a twink

427
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:49,540
Like the polar opposite that makes sense. What are we talking? What's the plot? Oh, oh, oh, this is this is the pcp lore podcast, right?

428
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,460
Hey, uh, here's the thing that I wanted to mention

429
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,820
Uh

430
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,780
One thing that I like about convention or rather okay, so now I don't care about this at all

431
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,340
But when I was young this was something that I was very interested in so I talked before about you know

432
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,660
How you should talk almano was going to convention that was cool

433
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,260
But before that when I was even younger I got excited because I still cared about uh voice actors

434
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:22,420
And uh, I used to go that that's my number my number three. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay. Well here take it away

435
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,980
Go ahead. Oh, well, I'll just finish my number two point first. Yeah about the merch

436
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,620
Because the merch was such an such an ocean of of possibilities when I was young

437
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,420
Um, and then I realized by like the second or third year that they all sell the same shit

438
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:42,500
Every fucking booth is the same shit and it's only like the most popular shows that have any merch

439
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,700
Um, and they just they never have anything I want

440
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:54,020
So I'll wander around for like hours in this fucking endless sea of merch and walk away with one thing

441
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,420
That was like, you know what the thing is, you know, what the thing is

442
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,420
Uh, a con is inversely proportional as in the more

443
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:08,660
It's your the what you will get out of going to a con is inversely proportional to how much you already know about like anime culture

444
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,060
That's the more you learn the less you get out of it. I just absolutely agree with that

445
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,820
that because

446
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,300
Another part of the appeal when we talk about panels

447
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,860
Is that uh, you learn a lot like for me in the early days one of the coolest things about conventions was I would go to a panel

448
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,620
About something I'd never heard of and then learn like all this interesting amazing shit about it

449
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,660
Uh, and now I know everything like there has not been a panel in the last few years that the ones I started going to

450
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,020
Uh

451
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,020
Instead of going to like ones about anime now

452
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,260
I go to all the like weird japanese culture like like a panel about noodles or something

453
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,460
Just so I can have something new that I don't know about because any anime panel you've reached

454
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:58,020
You've reached weeb bedrock at this point and it's just there are directly diagonal to bedroom bed. Yeah, it's actually the same place

455
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,180
but uh

456
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,460
There's been like a ton of panels that I go to and not only do I feel like I could give the panel

457
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,900
But I feel like I could give it better like half the time. Oh, you know calling you out con panel holders

458
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,740
And I mean I've run on the universe. That's right

459
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,540
but

460
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,700
But um, but yeah, so with the with the the shit like last this past otacon

461
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,300
I literally went there with the intention of sparing no expense

462
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,420
I was like i'm going to spend as much money as I can

463
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:33,540
And I will buy anything that interests me and I still there was nothing like I came away with like a few posters

464
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,420
And that was about it. Um, so yeah, it's

465
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,940
That aspect is kind of dead to me now and then again with the panels, you know, there's too much stuff

466
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,540
I already know. Um, and it used to be that one of the coolest things that you can meet

467
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:50,500
Japanese guests because yeah, wait, wait, wait before we get into that just about that topic

468
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:56,100
I wanted to share one just small anecdote about this whole things you can learn when you go to convention

469
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,860
I have to admit my first visit to a convention was definitely

470
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
I want to say almost definitely worth

471
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,900
Going because I remember this was when I had gotten into one piece in a big way off of the four kids dub

472
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,660
And so I was there in my full luffy costume with my big captain's coat

473
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,660
That I still wear my my gur and login one is I I don't know if I've ever mentioned this

474
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,900
But like the gur and login coat I wear is a is just my one piece coat

475
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,020
I made way back in the day just with the gur and login thing sewn onto the back. There's there's some lore for you

476
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,380
but um

477
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,980
When I was there, uh, uh, like I happened upon another cosplayer a zoro cosplayer

478
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,900
And this exchange would come to define my life for decades to come

479
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,460
Because what he told me what he said to me

480
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,380
He walked up to me or we were taking a picture and like we he got into it with us or something

481
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,940
Because it was me ben and like a friend. We were all cosplaying one piece. This guy joined his zoro

482
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,420
And so he uh, after we took the picture a ben was sanju sanju

483
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,900
He's a big sanju fan or at least was um

484
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,780
But uh, so this guy like I

485
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,620
You know, I had watched the whole show up to that point that was aired and I thought it was great

486
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,980
And this guy just looks at me and he's like, hey dude, nice costume. Like yeah, you too

487
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:13,620
Of course at this time I was young and timid and was just like, yeah, thanks. And um, he uh, he just said so like what's

488
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,980
So, uh, what's your favorite part and I'm like, oh, I don't know

489
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:22,820
I liked when they fought like captain coro like something like that and he just says yeah, that's pretty cool. Uh, how'd you like skypea?

490
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,420
and

491
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,900
Skypea had not been aired. Skypea would never air. I don't think at this point

492
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,660
Yeah, like basically what happened here was that he introduced the concept of manga to me

493
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,500
And I was I had no idea that one piece was even based on a manga or that I was behind

494
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,620
And the shame the deep shame that blossomed in me at that moment of not knowing

495
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,260
I thought I knew everything there was to know at this point

496
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,020
And then I learned there was a whole universe beyond my reach and on that day

497
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,220
I vowed to never allow someone else to have more knowledge of something I like than me

498
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,580
What I would what I would give to have been that man

499
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,820
Yeah

500
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,420
He he would man. Oh, because I found out about one piece through the manga before the anime even debuted in America

501
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,780
Um, I'm a true fucking patrician. Yes, you are. You know, anyway, uh

502
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,500
Yeah, I'll never forget you zero cosplayer. You're a legend like wherever you are out there, buddy

503
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,260
If uh, if you're uh, unless you're gonna like talk with like number three or number four

504
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,340
I don't know what you're gonna say to you, but

505
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Well, yeah, I'm gonna go into number three

506
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,660
Unless you want to continue or whatever you want. Well, I was gonna I was gonna sort of change gears, but I'll do it after

507
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,380
Let's finish these examples that will yeah. Um, well

508
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,740
So to to to broach the subject of number three

509
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,940
I just want to talk about that first con I went to the first ozakan and why it was so magical that day

510
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:54,340
Because it happened the first day of the con was on my birthday. I was turning. I think 17 and uh, you know, it was

511
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,380
Everything about it was the craziest shit I'd ever seen. There's more people than I'd ever seen in one place

512
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,700
I'd never seen cosplay, you know, so that was

513
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,780
Magical and now it means nothing to me. I've seen every cosplay

514
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:12,580
The only thing I get out of cosplay now is seeing what is the most popular show to cosplay that year is always interesting

515
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,980
Um, like, you know, recently was like tokyo ghoul is like the big one. Anyway

516
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,220
Um, I'm seeing all this fucking cosplay all this stuff and everything all these people

517
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:27,700
But the thing that truly made this concert this uh, this con experience was that they were having a concert

518
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:33,460
Um with jam project whom all of you have probably heard at least one jam project song

519
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:40,100
They did the one punch man opening most famously recently. Um, is that what they're most famous for? Okay. Well, yeah

520
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,660
Everyone knows the one punch man opening so I can easily give that as an example

521
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:50,900
Um, oh and you know members of it did the one piece opening and the dragon ball z opening

522
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,140
So, you know, they performed those at this show

523
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,380
um, but

524
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,260
The japanese ones of course not the fucking yoyo yoyo, but

525
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,140
jam project

526
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,860
Is a five person it's like five singers who are all famous for anime music

527
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,580
And they have a super group and they mostly do like robot shows

528
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,980
But anyways, they were they were doing a show

529
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:18,660
On my birthday at otsukan, you know and I went to this show and they fucking, you know, they they sing all these incredible songs

530
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,820
And for their encore they sang the op to the soul taker

531
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,940
Which is my favorite anime opening of all time that I'd you know that I'd sang like

532
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,580
The the opening the opening lines of the soul taker is this woman singing like

533
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,900
It's like this like epic rise up and me and my brother would like sing that when we were like

534
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:47,220
Unboxing like it's like a new piece of equipment or something like, you know real autism shit

535
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,940
So I they they played that song. It was the the greatest thing I'd ever seen in my life

536
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:57,140
You know cool band my favorite anime op on my birthday at this convention. Everything was magical

537
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,980
I spent all this money and I saw all these japanese guests, you know, I met like

538
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,460
Well, I didn't go to any meet and greets. I didn't actually do that till this past year, but like

539
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:12,100
Um, you know, I got to see these people talk about the anime industry and I learned all this stuff and over time

540
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,900
All of that like has gotten lesser

541
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:21,300
There's like, you know, ozakan has fewer and fewer japanese guests because they all go to anime expo now because anime expo is way bigger

542
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:28,580
Um, you know, there there hasn't been these magical panels where I learned things there hasn't been these epic encounters

543
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,380
There hasn't been you know a beautiful moment on my birthday

544
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,340
It's like every year I get more jaded and more cynical and more and more like why am I even

545
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,620
Going to this anymore and like last year was the last year they were doing it in baltimore. They're moving it to dc

546
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:48,100
I was almost I wasn't gonna go to ozakan this year, but now they've announced they're actually bringing back jam project

547
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,780
So now I totally want to go um, but man, that's great

548
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:57,140
Yeah, but like it was definitely like this downward spiral and now I want to go to anime expo to see if

549
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:03,700
See if it can reignite the spark because it's it's now like twice the size ozakan ever was

550
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,420
And has all these great japanese guests and shit and uh, I could hang out with munchie though

551
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,540
We'll probably just split up because of her ways because he won't know anything I want to go to

552
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,900
Uh, no, I I mean I hate anime so no matter what I do

553
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,380
I wouldn't be happy like actually paying attention to it. So I might as well just make myself like miserable

554
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,380
Because it'll be funny

555
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,660
Oh, and I hinted earlier there was a fourth reason to go to conventions that only applies to me and and us

556
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:36,100
Which is to run panels to to be a part of the convention whole different world

557
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,980
It's like a whole different flip side of the coin where it's it's really about

558
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,020
This epic moment of showmanship because it's it's one thing to like, you know run a youtube show and you could see

559
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,380
Oh, I have 250,000 subscribers. I have comments and stuff like that

560
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:59,380
But when you actually see like a thousand people sitting in front of you listening to you laughing at your stupid jokes

561
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:05,460
Then it's like that's when you really realize like I am a wizard god like I control people, you know

562
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,340
I wasn't I I don't know whether I liked it when I was up there with the brony con stuff

563
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,940
I mean for one thing I embarrassed myself by swearing too much when I shouldn't

564
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,580
That was hilarious. It's fine. I guess it was funny, but I felt like oh no

565
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:24,660
Oh, no, I'm doing wrong things. I was hey at least you weren't the one who when we did the concert where we

566
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,860
For anyone fucking punched celestia in the goddamn face you fucking drunk

567
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,860
No, I wasn't even gonna bring up that. I don't think I actually like hit her dude

568
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,740
You watched if you were close to her face, dude, you were real

569
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,020
It's my birthday

570
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
It's my birthday

571
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,460
If you if you watch the footage that hippo has of otacon, you'll see that we we got to we

572
00:42:53,700 --> 00:43:01,140
They were having a big concert and we for whatever reason were like the djs who went up in between songs and like and or in between sets

573
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:08,100
And announced it and I believe that the very first thing I did was like to run on stage and be like what the fuck's up

574
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,100
The lady running it was immediately like I've made a huge mistake

575
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,100
Because I was yet she kept us going for the whole two hours or whatever the fuck it was

576
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Well, they eventually took the mic away from me. They wouldn't let me uh like everyone else went on and did like the dj thing

577
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,580
And I went up there with a roll of toilet paper. It was just throwing it in the background

578
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,500
She gave me the mic and it was like you're the responsible one hold on to this mic and make sure they don't do anything crazy

579
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:42,340
From my perspective that was it was it was terrible at the time because I wasn't drunk and I was like, oh no

580
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,260
Yeah, everyone's having a good time and I'm just sitting here being gay

581
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,100
But watching the footage it was great, you know, even though when I went up on stage

582
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,060
I didn't know what to do. I was just standing in the middle of the stage for like five seconds

583
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,300
Not really doing anything. I didn't have a mic. I didn't know what to do. So I was like, uh, here I am

584
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,660
I'm definitely a little embarrassed. I'm pretty sure I had the most fun I've ever had in my life at that

585
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,740
concert

586
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,900
Yeah, I mean looking back on it like remember when uh, there was that one part where like everyone backstage like all went out and

587
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:17,300
Started dancing all together. Yeah, and we were just it was we were all fucking going nuts. It was it was crazy and uh,

588
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,260
I don't know that that was awesome. I definitely

589
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,460
Was embarrassing myself and looking at it now actually not now, but when I first watched it back

590
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,700
I was like, oh god, I will never be okay with this

591
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,620
But at this point now, I'm totally comfortable with it and it just is just a music

592
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:38,820
Digi the image of you being completely like like drunk like not even be able to like recognize your surroundings

593
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,060
Being sang to by nicole oliver. You are my sunshine

594
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,380
It was tearing at like nothing. It was the weirdest

595
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:53,860
Fucking thing because no one warned me. No one gave me stage directions or told me what was going on

596
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:00,740
I just all of a sudden have like a you know a I don't know if she's a famous voice actress per se, but you know

597
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:07,300
She is for in the context of this convention essentially a literal goddess, you know, that's true

598
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,460
Um putting here and I remember

599
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,620
Having this moment where I felt really bad because of the fact that I didn't care about my little pony anymore

600
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:20,340
Like oh, yeah, like I felt it was like if this had happened two years prior

601
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,540
I would be like crying, you know, like this would be so meaningful to me and instead i'm up here

602
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,180
obliterated shit

603
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,940
With like I don't care about anyone in this place at all

604
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:38,180
I have like, you know, I'm out here because it's fun for me to be a drunken idiot not because I actually care about this crowd

605
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,220
um

606
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:44,020
And like their goddess is singing to me for my birthday and I was just like this is wrong

607
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:50,100
I am a bad man your god to me is just another slut and it's my birthday

608
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,460
What's that what is that clip I said that somewhere right? I don't know

609
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,180
It's it's it's when we're all walking to the thing and victor or maybe I was holding no it was victor holding the camera

610
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,820
Watching you be drunk and punching natin and stuff and then yeah, yeah

611
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:15,460
Uh victor comments that I wish I was as drunk as you is like it's my birthday, bitch, and I just

612
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,180
onto the part where you almost

613
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,580
When you were pretending to fight jesse

614
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,940
That was one of the funniest edits i've ever seen in my life

615
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:32,180
That was the funniest the best part about that was her fucking face like she real like I just sang to this person

616
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,660
I just sang like you're my sunshine to this person and now they're like fighting

617
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,940
You changed her whole view of the human race and what to expect when you know like good things are always

618
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:49,300
When I watched that footage I got the impression that she realized what was like like that she you know

619
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,260
She was scared to try to get out of the way, but she realized that this was a drunken insane party and that

620
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:00,260
Like oh, yeah, you know these are I actually remember seeing her backstage just thinking oh, what's going on up there?

621
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,660
Is like is is someone getting a birthday like I was backstage looking at I was like that

622
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,300
Is that who I don't know who that is, but I think it's someone

623
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,260
I mean let's she went and did that. It's just so weird. Let's be real the brony community

624
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:20,180
There's a lot of infantilization in there right like the idea of the character princess celestia singing to you

625
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,140
Is like oh, you're like you're my child, you know, you're all my children kind of thing

626
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,460
It's like but in that moment. I think she remembered. Oh, yeah, this is like a drunken 23 year old man

627
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:36,180
When you started swinging. Yes, I think this is a grown bearded fat dangerous man

628
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,540
And dangerous

629
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,900
That should be the name of your biography fat and dangerous

630
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:49,540
Gayer than god is the name of my biography. Okay. All right. Fine. Fine. But fat and dangerous would be the sequel

631
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,300
It goes it goes dead and gay and then

632
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,220
Dead and gay right and then gay and god. I think it will be the finale

633
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,140
I was already planning to make a gayer than god song for the gay and dead album

634
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,940
But I I think I'll also make fat and dangerous a song

635
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,900
It'll be like a big fat like fucking

636
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:13,380
Atlanta style heavy beat like killer mic song. It's gonna be one of the samples is it's my birthday

637
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,700
Yeah, that should definitely be one of all I should definitely be one

638
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Oh my god. Yes

639
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,820
So, okay, so I think it's fair to say that if you're on the side of

640
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:31,620
Like of of making or being you know the one up on stage doing things at cons that changes the game and it's pretty fun

641
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,100
Most of the time it's pretty fun if you're if you're used to it

642
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,660
I was so overwhelmed like in the panel and on the thing that I kind of hated it at the end

643
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,220
Well, you know like that was only your like second convention though

644
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,100
So like you were probably still acclimating in general and then going up on stage is just like another big change, you know

645
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,860
So also, I think I think personally you should give us more tracks. We all had

646
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,220
The group

647
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,340
I did to shit through that whole panel. I forgot about the group shit. Oh my god

648
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:04,260
Literally all of us. Yeah, we we we ate wendy's on our way to the convention and we were like fucking late

649
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:10,020
Like we almost missed our own panel which had all of us on it because we like woke up late

650
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,380
And then we went to wendy's and they took forever and we ate and it was like totally all of us felt shit

651
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,340
And uh, so we second we got to the convention

652
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:24,340
We went to the bathrooms like right by the you know right by where the the panel was gonna be and we like all

653
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,940
Simultaneously took a shit. I forgot about the group shit

654
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,620
Oh my god. Yes. That was the best thing that ever happened. I was so I was so conscious of my point

655
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,380
I didn't want to poop my pants on stage as well as

656
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:44,740
Well, yeah, I mean munchy that by that point by by this brony con I went to three of them

657
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:51,380
And by that one literally the only reason any of us was there was to hang out with one another

658
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:55,780
Yeah, yeah, which is why rad rad con happened because it was like after

659
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,740
You know after going to brony con it's like we're really here to hang out with each other and to try to get laid

660
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,100
Um, I think

661
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:06,900
Yeah, the main reason we went to brony con that that year that I was there is because I hadn't been to one yet

662
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,340
And I wanted yeah to go. Oh, yeah, that's that was a big thing before it was totally over

663
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,860
Yeah, and while you were still like someone with like clout in the community who could enjoy being famous kp

664
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,060
kp is like the top billing guests. I really want to see here. Oh, yeah, dog. Oh, yeah

665
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,940
Uh, that's what conventions are. They're just locations for play dates

666
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,020
And that's why they're incredible. They are incredible play date material

667
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,940
They're like theme parks, but I but wouldn't you say munchy that it was even better at rad con than like

668
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,540
Them brony con. I would say it was better

669
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:46,820
However, I don't like like just the fact that it was better doesn't mean that I wouldn't I wouldn't also cherish going to a convention

670
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,220
It's not it's I'm not saying that hanging out with your friends is inherently like

671
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:58,100
Like better or worse with the convention, but do you think it's an interesting location and it breeds a lot of discussion

672
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,060
And uh, like like it's easy to ridicule people and therefore very funny

673
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,060
Yeah, it is a definite like different because like in digi's house

674
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,940
Some people have rooms that they go to when they're not, you know doing something with the rest of us

675
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:19,620
And so like in a convention, you know, you're you're always having to do something other just sitting around talking or

676
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,420
Or like going to a panel or just eating, you know, it's just everyone's doing something at the same time

677
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:29,300
Panels are the fucking worst thing but like what I mean is everyone's doing something at the same time

678
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,780
It's a different sort of feeling than just being in a house together

679
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:38,500
Yeah, because you know people wake up at different times and sleeping arrangements are kind of rough. Yeah. Well, I mean for sure

680
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:44,500
It's the the thing about conventions and the reason that I wanted like well aside from the fact that I just want to hang out with

681
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,500
You guys and make stuff. Um, the other thing I don't like about conventions is

682
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:55,300
Uh, it's hard enough living in one house with everybody. It's even worse when you're all in one room

683
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:00,340
And it's like yeah, like for me. I have terrible insomnia and I

684
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:06,180
And I also can't stand silence. So I'm used to you know going to bed playing music

685
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,820
You know having like a certain certain way

686
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:13,860
Jacking off you can't jack off and you're all in the same hotel room big problem. That's what you think amateur

687
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,180
Well, you know, you can take a long shower, but uh

688
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,780
It's harder to get we'll say it's hard to get away with jacking off

689
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:27,060
When you're all sharing a room, but um, you know for me every convention I've ever been to

690
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,380
By four in the morning

691
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,580
I'm going to be stepping over everybody to get out of the room and then just wandering the hotel for like hours

692
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,700
And then I'll probably sleep for 30 minutes and then go to the con, you know

693
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:44,820
And and be like miserable and sick all day. So, you know, that's that's like as many like there's

694
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,780
All the cons are worth having gone to

695
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:54,340
Like it's worth it to be able to tell these great stories and to be able to say have all these fond memories

696
00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:00,740
But the actual experience of living it is often hellish because it's always like no sleep

697
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,780
Very difficult to remain uh to keep up your hygiene at all, you know

698
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:13,220
Which is is actually a problem when you're in baltimore in the summer and it's fucking 95 degrees and you're walking all day

699
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,620
you know, so like

700
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:21,380
Usually by the end of a convention, I am physically broken like my voice doesn't work anymore. I can't see

701
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,460
I'm like sleeping. I usually sleep for like almost a whole 24 hours the day after a con

702
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:35,540
Um, so yeah, it like there's a lot of nightmarish elements that make it that that are like why I wouldn't just like like

703
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:42,660
Even if otacon wasn't that great, you know, um, it would it would still be worth going to right because why not?

704
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,740
It's something to do for a weekend

705
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:50,020
Except that it's something that involves like a four-hour car car drive, which isn't that bad

706
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,940
But then they're sharing a hotel with a bunch of other people not getting any sleep physically exhausting yourself, you know

707
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:02,580
And then the existential ennui of realizing that you've put yourself through all of this and for what, you know

708
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:09,620
That's what gets me the most. I always end up like by sunday. I feel like I hate the world at most conventions

709
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:14,100
So, yeah, it's fun. I've had that at the end of radcon. Well, that was physically

710
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,180
I felt like that through all of radcon

711
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:24,180
But radcon 2 was for totally different reasons. Um that I felt that way I understand what you mean and I appreciate it

712
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,060
However, uh, I think it's wrong and I think you're gay. Uh

713
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,220
I I I

714
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:34,580
One way to put it is that radcon 2 was like if we went to a convention and we ran every panel

715
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,540
That's that's how I describe radcon 2

716
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:45,300
Uh, I mean, uh, it is exhausting. However, like I I don't feel pain in the sense that like

717
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:50,740
Like you don't feel pain at all pain is like really funny to me and like like whenever I get hit by it

718
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,820
I just like dude like dude

719
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:59,220
And and uh, like like I like I'm literally here is a like like

720
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,340
This is like a like a part of my life that you need to understand to get me

721
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:11,140
Uh, and I I will I will title this chapter of my life. Seinfeld was like a mindbreak dosion for real life

722
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:20,500
Yeah, I'm I'm always thinking about my life as if I was a character on Seinfeld

723
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:25,860
And so every bad thing that humanly happens to me. I just think that's really fucking funny. That's sick

724
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:31,940
That's that's that's amazing because victor does the exact same thing but with curb your enthusiasm as opposed to side

725
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:39,540
You know, that that's the ironic age relivering. We're living in now where our own suffering is merely an amusing fact of uh, you know

726
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:46,260
I think again, it's easy for me to see it that way in retrospect, but in the moment. It's just like I do in the moment

727
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,500
Yeah, um

728
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,820
But you just got a faster processor for this shit

729
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,100
Because I got a mindbreak dosioned

730
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,060
I wanted to talk about this for a while

731
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:03,620
Uh, you've been talking about anime cons and and brony con. I don't know whether any of you've gone to like a video game

732
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:09,300
Convention like just for video games. No, I have not I would say this

733
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,460
But I kind of wish jeff was here because he has gone to all of those

734
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,860
Oh

735
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:21,940
You know, uh, and he could we could talk about that because like I don't think they're that different though that he wants us to go

736
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:27,460
To to magfest. I kind of would like to go like to magfest or packs or something because like from what I've learned

737
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,220
From watching like

738
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,020
You know youtube content people who are video game ish

739
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,500
Like total biscuit and jontron or whatever game gross

740
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,820
They it's a different sort of feeling because it's not like I don't know

741
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,660
I feel like I I would have more fun at one of those perhaps

742
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,100
But maybe not I'm just not I'm skeptical that there's much difference really

743
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:51,780
Yeah, I don't know because I haven't been to a game. There's there's someone who's been to like a shitload of uh otakans

744
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:55,700
Like there's off. There is a huge contingent of gaming there

745
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:02,180
Like otakans is really an everything convention. It's not really about anime per se if you go there as just a gamer

746
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
There there's a huge arcade room

747
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:08,020
There's people who just hang out in there and play street fighter the whole convention

748
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,100
You know they have gaming tournaments

749
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,180
Even brony con had like smash tournaments and shit. Um, yeah, that's what i'm saying

750
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,700
It's I remember there was a guy who was like wider than he was tall playing smash. That's all I remember

751
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:26,500
And uh, it was in there just sort of yeah, I think victor competed in that actually and um, yes

752
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,260
There's a pretty big there's a pretty big arcade room

753
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,660
I personally I I never have the patience to like wait to be able to play one of the games

754
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,820
The only time I the only time I was excited enough about a video game

755
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,940
They had because they they they don't have like a lot of really cool interesting arcade cabinets at otakon

756
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:49,060
Unfortunately, and that's I would like to go to a gaming convention if they had like an like a legit arcade

757
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:55,140
Like if they had games that I really had, you know heard of and spoken in soft whispers and always wanted to see

758
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:59,140
The only time I got really excited was when they had dengeki bunko fighting climax

759
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,980
Which had not come out yet in the us

760
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,660
Which is the game where you fight like novel characters and get to beat up kirito and shit

761
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:10,100
Except that there was this fucking guy at the like, you know, they had two cabinets

762
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:16,500
So everyone was fighting each other and there was this dude there who was playing kirito and had obviously played the game

763
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,220
Like he had it

764
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,820
He must have had the japanese version on vita and was just destroying everyone

765
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,660
But he would never

766
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:28,180
Move like, you know, he was just like taking each new challenger and kicking their asses and everyone was dead silent

767
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,500
Because like the the atmosphere this guy gave off was like a total douchebag asshole

768
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:37,700
Who was like here to beat people to prove that he's so good at this game that none of us have ever played

769
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:40,740
Because it's not out in america specifically. Yeah, just at this

770
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:45,620
And so there's probably like six people and we're all we're each like moving through the line

771
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:51,700
And each person will like get up fight him lose and then just silently walk away and the next person goes up

772
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,700
Why don't anyone make this guy fucking move?

773
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,860
Just because you know

774
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,380
You lose the match and you walk away and it was like it was new people coming up

775
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:03,460
You know like nobody was like hanging out around the machine. It was just like people were you know, all right

776
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,540
that's fine lining up to play and

777
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,740
Realizing this guy

778
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,180
But I was there long enough to see that he had you know beaten down all these people and of course

779
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,700
I tried and I got my ass kicked because he knew the like the auto combo

780
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,780
You know, he wasn't even like great at the game

781
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:21,780
It's just he had played the fucking thing and I was so mad at that guy. I literally wanted him dead

782
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:28,100
I was like I will train at this game for the rest of my life just so I could beat this guy and rub it in his face

783
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,260
You know, um

784
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:35,940
I'd like to see your uh oreimo against his uh, I assume he was a kirito player. I just yeah, he was playing kirito

785
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,100
How did I know how did I know I said it but uh, well, that's how I knew

786
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,660
but

787
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:47,460
I was at the time I I had tried playing shana because I shana was gonna be my main

788
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:53,780
I wanted her to be like the one I would play in the game, uh, but I ended up being good with uh, what's kirino?

789
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,780
anyways, um

790
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,020
Yeah, like so I haven't hung out in the gaming room much

791
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,860
But I I I do kind of want to go to magfest not so much for the gaming

792
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:05,380
But because it's specifically a gaming and music convention

793
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:12,900
Like there's it's more about like nerdcore bands and shit playing. I'm sure uh Tupperware remix parties probably played there

794
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:18,340
Protoman plays there. Yeah, they have and I want to see them there one time. Yeah, I just got back

795
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,500
Yeah, like

796
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,620
I don't know. I wouldn't have been like unwilling to go to magfest

797
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,380
But jeff wanted us to go to that and radcon and I was like we can't

798
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,660
Radcon's an event for making things and there's like a schedule for it

799
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:39,380
And we cannot afford to go to that and magfest, you know, I kind of would like to go

800
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:42,180
At some point with jeff and all

801
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,300
Just as a big old procrastinators magfest

802
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,180
Yeah, it would be fun. That could be cool. It's just affording it

803
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,700
Maybe he could he could be the guy to introduce us to I don't know fucking

804
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,180
Everybody's super buddy hop. I hate all of those

805
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:00,980
I don't I don't dislike them. I would be I'd be happy to just see. Oh, yeah

806
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:06,900
I mean, it's just that it's just not my crowd right now. You know, I mean, maybe it could be

807
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:12,260
I mean, I just didn't know anything about it. I'd certainly like to meet buddy hop. He's cool. But anyway, uh

808
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,060
Yeah, but

809
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,460
Oh, yeah, so I do I do agree though that

810
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:23,780
Gaming conventions seem different going by because there's a lot more gaming like there's more hands on

811
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:32,580
There it is it's it's more of like, you know, you're going there more to do something as opposed like with an anime convention

812
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,260
You know, if you go to all these panels that are like the informative ones again

813
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:39,460
Like if you already know the stuff, it's completely useless, you know

814
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,540
Like you might get to meet some cool industry people but at a video game convention

815
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:49,620
There's often actually a game there that you could not play elsewhere that and that's interesting

816
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,420
You know, that's probably what I'd want to go for the most

817
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:59,060
But I doubt they're that different from anime cons, you know, I'm ready to make a sweeping proclamation about

818
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:04,980
The function of conventions and and what they should be used for and what purpose they serve

819
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,140
Conventions are something that children should go to

820
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:16,180
Yeah, they are they are best for for young adults like, you know, 12 13 that that sort of range

821
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,220
And they're just gonna you're gonna get less out of them as you get older

822
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:23,140
And I'll tell you why and if you go with friends and you just tool around then that you can go at any age

823
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,180
That that'll be fine

824
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:28,020
But the usefulness of the actual thing is best for the young and I'll tell you why

825
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:33,060
It's because I mean there's this thing I said before of just the more you know about the subject matter

826
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:36,660
The less you get out of it and and that really applies in a lot of ways

827
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:39,700
Like when I was when I was young one of the first panels

828
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,260
I went to at some convention and this blew my mind

829
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,340
This is like one of the first sort of analytical lectures I ever heard about

830
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,500
Anime or in this case a video game

831
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:54,660
It was a lecture that some dude was giving on how like teetus from final fantasy 10 represented the

832
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:02,980
The like the human ideal of the ubermensch and like his role in final fantasy 10 was like a representation of like the ideal man in a

833
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,260
Like a fantasy world or like some bullshit like that

834
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:13,380
But I had never heard any talk like that before which is now a format that's kind of you know people talk about that show on youtube now

835
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,620
But at the time I'd never heard anything like that

836
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:20,820
Um, but other than that there are the there's like so there's that little bit of information you can gain

837
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,860
But then there's the distinct like magical moment factor like when me and ben were young

838
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:31,060
Um, and I think this was even more important for ben or more enjoyable for ben than was for me

839
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:36,340
When we were young at anime boston the pillows played and it was one of the most

840
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:44,420
Awesome things we'd ever seen our lives and and in addition to just hearing all the songs and being completely blown away

841
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,180
And the place just going insane and just loving every second of it

842
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,340
There was also this moment where up on up on the rafters

843
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,340
We were down on the ground floor watching them play

844
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:59,140
But up in the rafters there was a couple of people standing and watching the band from up above

845
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:03,380
There was a mamimi cosplayer just dancing by herself

846
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,340
And just watching her dance while listening to

847
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:11,460
Fucking crazy sunshine and and you know all the shit from the show

848
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,460
Uh, fuck. What's that one? I think I can all that shit

849
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,140
Watching her dance by herself was just such a magical moment

850
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,620
And I'll always regret not going up and joining her that's stuck with me my whole life

851
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,380
My relationship with women

852
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,500
I mean, I would still lose my shit for a pillows concert

853
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:33,300
But I can't even imagine like me at 17 at the same age I saw jam project

854
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:40,660
If I if I had heard fucking hybrid rainbow live when I was 17, I would have cried a river

855
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,300
I would have been losing my fucking mind to that

856
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:46,100
So yeah, I can definitely appreciate what you're saying there

857
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:50,580
So that was great, but then also at the time I still gave a shit about voice actors

858
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,900
And I don't think I'd really care about these things as much now

859
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:57,140
But there were two incidents that were that are very memorable to me

860
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:03,140
One was when I met Steve Blum. He was doing something. I think it was it was this was the gurren login thing

861
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,940
He was signing autographs. I think for his role as learon

862
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:10,740
And um, I went up to him and and and said hi and shook his hand and I told him

863
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,620
I'll never forget this. I I said hey, dude

864
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:17,860
I know that you get this all the time, but I just loved you as spike and I was like

865
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,740
I know he's doing some other character, but that's what I remember before

866
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:25,380
I'm sure he's gonna hate me for it. He's just like dude. It never gets old. I love it every time

867
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,540
And he smiled at me and I went on my way and I just felt so great about my life

868
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,620
I I think it was incredible. Yeah, I might hate dubs more than anybody in the world

869
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,500
But I could still probably mark out for Steve Blum like

870
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:43,060
He's a fucking legend. He's he's a legend been in everything. Um, and then there was this other moment

871
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,020
Here, this is my last thing. I even have to say

872
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:51,620
When I was at some like fma would gotten really big and I was at a convention

873
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,660
I think this was anime boston and it was a panel

874
01:05:55,140 --> 01:06:00,500
Uh, like the voice actors or something and I didn't give a shit about anyone except vik manjana was there. He was cool

875
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:05,220
Tell me a case of vik manjana story. I know and this this is classic vik manjana

876
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:10,820
Like just being weirdly obsessed with the character of ed, but he did this thing. He's like, hey guys, um

877
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:15,540
I was like taking questions or whatever and somebody asked him to like do a line from the show

878
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:19,540
I mean, of course, right and so he's like, okay. All right guys, but I've gotten good at this

879
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:23,620
So let we're all going to go through an exercise because this is the best way for you to experience this

880
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,460
I don't want you to see me god

881
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,580
This is this this is this tells me so much about him as a man right now

882
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:33,700
But he's like, okay. I don't want you to see me as like this old like 30 something, you know, slightly balding

883
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:37,380
That motherfucker is 15 now. So he was probably in his 40s

884
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:43,380
Yeah, okay, maybe he even said 30s and was lying. I don't know. I can't remember but uh, that that'd be hilarious

885
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:43,780
That was true

886
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,380
But he said like I don't want you to see me as this old man

887
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:50,420
Everyone close your eyes and just listen to my voice and he did like I think he did the monologue from

888
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:56,900
After the barry the butcher fight, you know what I'm talking about where he's like crying about like he realized how vulnerable

889
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,100
He is how much he cares about that's the scene that that

890
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:05,380
Made his whole career oscar bait scene from fma. It's the reason that he won every fucking

891
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:12,100
Voice actor award for dubbing ever and that's why he's so fucking famous is for that one scene pretty much

892
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,180
And he did it and at the time I was definitely an fma fan

893
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,980
And he did it with such passion and just clearly

894
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:24,020
Loved doing what he did so much and loved the character so much regardless of the reasons why

895
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:29,460
Yeah, it was just that was just a great experience that really made me get into anime in a big way

896
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:33,460
If this was like 2006, I probably would have felt exactly the same

897
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:38,100
I I loved that performance when I was young. Um, he killed it on that one how I hate it

898
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,700
I did get to just that that's the just that's the end of my case for how

899
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,740
These things I think like now like like you were saying

900
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:48,740
I don't think these would really make as much of an impact on me because I've had all these experiences

901
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:52,500
But when I was a kid first getting into the stuff not knowing much to see the world

902
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:55,940
That's out there and the passion these people are putting in I can see why

903
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,940
Like I get this stuff and I understand why it's valuable

904
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:04,500
Seeing the stuff and and seeing the things people can do with it and like why my parents just don't

905
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,820
They haven't had any of these experiences. They don't get shit about this. They just think it's goofy cartoons

906
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:15,940
You know just two or three years ago at ozakan. I also met ed's voice actor, but the real one talk to rome

907
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:21,140
Uh, the japanese voice actress who's one of my favorite voice actresses and she was so fucking

908
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,740
She was the

909
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:28,420
You know sometimes you see someone there's there's certain celebrities that I have that that like

910
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:36,660
That waifu or idol like crush on she's one of those she's just so perfect and hilarious and

911
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:40,580
And adorable and I absolutely love her and I would

912
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,300
Sacrifice my life to for her

913
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,500
No, she's she was great

914
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:49,220
Yeah, I want to throw in a bit

915
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:55,460
Uh, I'll probably have more to say about this possibly in the future if I take up any of these because I've run

916
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:58,020
I've run a few uh panels at conventions

917
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,580
The first one I did was at necocon, which is why I went to necocon that year because

918
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:08,900
Me and this guy named uh, what who? Oh, sorry. I just said that makes sense as to why you went to this one

919
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:14,420
Yeah, yeah, um, it was like 2010. I think and it was me and this guy named pats who is another anime blogger

920
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,900
And uh, we ran a panel called

921
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:23,700
Released and relinquished shows that had been licensed and dubbed in english, but no one paid attention to them

922
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,620
So yeah, it was just like a you know, it was just a recommendation panel

923
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,300
Which that's another thing that like at the time kind of made sense

924
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,660
But now it's like why would you ever want recommendations?

925
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:39,700
There's there's the internet has entire websites dedicated to anime recommendations

926
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:43,860
You don't need a panel not that it would still be a successful panel, but um

927
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:50,660
The internet's definitely made these things even more obsolete obviously. Yeah, uh, but it was a pretty good turnout for it and

928
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:54,580
Um, and then of course I've done three panels at brony con

929
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:02,020
One with tom one with the you know with you guys and and then another one with with just the pcp members

930
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,100
uh

931
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,900
I think that was actually called the horseshoe crew or something that time. It was called the horse cast live dog

932
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:11,700
Do you guys remember my ancient lumarian questions?

933
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,780
I I remember I I know I've blocked them out

934
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,500
Smurfs too, right? No, no, no, no something far more sinister

935
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,500
He he had like a long question about ancient lumarians that are at uh

936
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:29,620
That of course I I I basically just relayed to you the history of spirit sign

937
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:34,260
Science at a horseshoe panel that went on for easily seven minutes

938
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:39,620
And by the end there's no way it was seven minutes long. I don't believe you and no the entire crowd

939
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,380
Hated me. You know like like is he reading this off his phone?

940
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,620
Why why is it taking so long?

941
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:49,860
And I just kept going on and on about how like the ancient lumarians are like

942
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,660
Fucking building bunchy like the animal you are

943
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:59,620
Are fucking behind all my little pony and and how trial at sparkle was like like like an agent of the fucking devil

944
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:04,660
And it was uh, it was great. I remember your I think it was I think it was you specifically Nate

945
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,180
Uh, you said something along the lines of I don't know. I don't care

946
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,660
Stop good. Oh, thank god

947
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,580
I had enough to do something about it. All right. I remember wanting to kill you

948
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:21,140
You're so fucking good. I loved there is a video of that of that. Um panel on my channel

949
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,540
I haven't looked it in a long time. So far. I remember anything

950
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,580
I started a lot if I if I had given that one today

951
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:31,380
I would have been a lot more confident in my assertion of luminary that would have there have been more niggers in

952
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,940
Oh, there would be oh, there would be so oh, yeah

953
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,420
He's really come into his own with the whole

954
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,500
Yeah, uh

955
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,380
I would say I've never liked panels

956
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:48,660
And then like like I've I've been to maybe five panels and all my like seven cons I've gone to

957
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,300
Uh, they all fucking suck

958
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,460
I've had some of my like

959
01:11:53,700 --> 01:12:01,140
A lot of my best con experiences have been panels like the one uh, charles dunbar gave on kill lock hill that totally changed my opinion of the show

960
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,860
Um, and like I've seen a bunch of wish I could see that panel. I'd like to see that panel

961
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:13,540
Yeah, I wish it existed somewhere. He was supposedly writing a book of that panel and I don't think it ever came out. Okay. Yeah, but um

962
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:15,460
So

963
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:19,540
Yeah, I've been to some that like really changed my opinion of shows or just educated me on stuff

964
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:25,540
Some are just fun and interesting like uh, there's one dude who always does like a japanese noise panel

965
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:31,140
Like literally about noise music, which is such a weird fucking obscure thing to do at a con

966
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:36,260
But he was like this really knowledgeable dude like being in a room with like 40 other guys

967
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:42,100
And listening to fucking noise music is a surreal and hilarious experience

968
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:50,020
Um that I highly recommend you know why I fear every panel I go to it's because I I've mentioned this before

969
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:53,540
I don't trust congoers to not embarrass themselves

970
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:58,420
And I am such a wonderful sensitive human being that when other people humiliate themselves

971
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:05,060
I feel humiliated so I can't I can't abide cringes. Thankfully. I've gotten I guess so I've gotten really good at both

972
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:10,020
I mean, there's certain people who do panels like charles dunbar the guy who did that kill out kill panel

973
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:16,660
He goes to like he gets invited to like 13 cons a year and does like five panels per con

974
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,620
So like he it's practically a job for him

975
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:24,900
So for someone like that like you know, they're gonna put on a good panel. It's good. You know, I'm not talking about him

976
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:27,220
I mean when well, I mean that's always a possibility

977
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,940
But I just specifically meant when they get questions from the crowd

978
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:35,540
Those people like the good ones the good panels usually don't do that. Like yeah, thank god

979
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:41,460
You know the really good the people who know what they're doing will probably have a fully stacked 90 minutes

980
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:44,740
I mean, there's a lot of panels that are an absolute garbage fire

981
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,020
Even at like ozacon because it'll be people who don't know what they're doing

982
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:53,700
And they'll get up there and just like either not know their subject or not be prepared or someone doesn't show up

983
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,140
Or something breaks

984
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:59,220
But i'm pretty good at figuring out which ones those are gonna be because like every year at ozacon

985
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:02,660
One of my friends will tell me like yeah, we went to that one because you know

986
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:05,460
It had a hilarious title and it sounded like it would be great

987
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:09,540
But it turned out they had no idea what they were doing and I was like you could tell that by the description

988
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:15,620
You know like if it's just a hilarious title, but it does but there's no like indication of who's running the panel or like

989
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,460
You know, uh

990
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:21,700
Like something something in the description that catches your eye. It's probably not good

991
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:26,340
God I had something like that at brone con it was like like there was this one panel

992
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:29,300
But I went to and I could have found out that was bad by the description

993
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:34,900
It was it like I read the description and it was something like thoroughly analyzing my little pony live or something

994
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:38,020
Fucking awful like that. I wouldn't anyway see that one coming

995
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:46,180
Press one if that was the shittiest joke you've ever heard your entire fucking life

996
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,900
I actually didn't see it coming

997
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,300
really

998
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,940
But but you know our panels were like awful. I mean people loved them, but

999
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:59,140
Literally had no plan for any panel

1000
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,220
I tried to put together a plan, but you guys were just like let's just say questions

1001
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,460
Let's just say question which frankly was a better idea

1002
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,260
So just because the the crowd just wants to hear us talk

1003
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:12,500
They don't give a fuck and we're all funny and we can just riff off of whatever they say, you know

1004
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,580
um, yeah, and I think I mean for me personally, I think that

1005
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:23,220
My sense of humor nowhere shines better than in answering questions at a at a convention panel like that

1006
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:26,580
I think that's if when I make videos, they're not funny

1007
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:32,500
On this podcast I hit or miss, but I think I can actually be funny in that situation

1008
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:38,020
Well, whatever I see my favorite panel that I've um, I've ever like seen in a video

1009
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:41,220
setting has always been like ego raptors like

1010
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:46,020
Solo panel where he's just talking about stuff to a crowd. He's he's standing around with a mic

1011
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,620
He is good at that. He's good at that. That was just it's just such a night

1012
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:55,700
It made me like the idea of panels and want to be on a panel by myself just say yeah, yeah

1013
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,740
I'm just chatting with it. I mean, I knew it would be like I gotta admit

1014
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:04,660
He handled that panel like a pro the way that ego raptor runs favorite videos of his the way that he runs his panels

1015
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:09,620
Is exactly how I tried to do so like I mean with the with the two that we did as a group

1016
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,220
Then there was a lot more like spread out as a group. It's kind of difficult

1017
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:16,980
Yeah, because everyone wants to say something but the one that was just me and tom

1018
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,380
I mean, you know

1019
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:24,500
At all the panels. I usually am the one who does the most talking but the one with me and tom in particular was like

1020
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:30,740
It was pretty much me in the crowd and then tom offering thoughts sometimes about you know, like when I asked him

1021
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,900
Tom, what do you think about this?

1022
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,340
But it was great fun to do that and I'd love to do yeah

1023
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:40,820
Doing solo panels is super fun and I'd love to do it all the time

1024
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:48,260
Just imagine how important you feel as the only guy up there, you know, yeah, I'm interested in it mostly for the power trip

1025
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,180
That's what I want. That's what I want the power trips a lot of fun and just the feeling well

1026
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:58,900
Because like what what I think makes it what what makes it fun for me is that it's an opportunity to simultaneously

1027
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,340
Like

1028
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,260
Say to the crowd, you know

1029
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:07,620
Hey, you guys are all great and I really appreciate all of you while also just ragging on them incessantly

1030
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:12,260
Because that's what I like when people ask me a dumb question. I will I will make them

1031
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:15,700
I'll I'll answer it in such a way that's like you're a dumb

1032
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:22,500
But thankfully you've given me the tools for me to use my genius to make this interesting, you know

1033
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:25,380
That's the right way to do it. Yeah, it's uh, it's fun

1034
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,620
Great

1035
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,620
Uh, and and I've I've been um

1036
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:33,540
Recently I've been invited to some conventions

1037
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:38,180
There's one in particular in new jersey and they want me to come up. It's in like

1038
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,180
I don't know

1039
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,820
April or may or june, maybe june

1040
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:49,300
Then they're like they want me to come up and they they they said we want you to do like two or three panels

1041
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,380
and I was like, uh

1042
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,940
Is anyone else presenting at this convention?

1043
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,820
Um, but yeah, they were they're offering to like, you know pay for my trip and everything to to do that

1044
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:04,660
It might be worth and I'm considering it. I haven't decided yet because I don't know what I'm gonna be doing in june

1045
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:08,340
Like I might not even live in virginia by june. Um, that that's true

1046
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,140
So, you know what though, can I just say on that point?

1047
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:16,580
There's one thing I didn't mention that is actually by far the most important thing to me about conventions

1048
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,820
Uh, and so I would definitely go to that and any other ones that were offered to me

1049
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,860
Because of my dream I've had since I was a very young man

1050
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,020
And it's not it's not a lofty dream

1051
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:26,900
But it is a dream

1052
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:32,580
I've had consistently for most of my life and it's to fuck a cosplayer girl at an anime convention

1053
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:37,380
I will do whatever it takes to make that happen at some point in my life if you want to get into fucking

1054
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,860
stories of fleeting but very deep and real love

1055
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:47,140
Uh that I've had with women at conventions who I did not speak to my god

1056
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:52,660
Like I have I have a lot of like vivid memories of women

1057
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,420
I immediately fell in love with

1058
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:58,900
Here's one that we all shared uh, at least most of us who are in our remember our spot at brony con

1059
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,900
We all looked down to get collectively

1060
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:05,620
I know jesse was there and I think most of the people here were we looked down and there was just a raven

1061
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:12,180
From teentines cosplayer sitting there alone with a book open just reading a book on the side of the open convention hall

1062
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:16,980
But not bothering anybody just quietly being there perfectly cosplaying raven

1063
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,980
Just being by yourself reading a fucking book and we all instantly fell in love with there

1064
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:24,980
All of us together in the same way nate that you were like always wondering

1065
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:29,780
Uh, I should have gone on dance with that girl that I I was always like remember that and I'm like

1066
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:33,860
I should have just gone up and said that's a really it's really cool that you're reading like that

1067
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:39,780
Why didn't we damn nothing nothing is cooler to me than method cosplayers. They are truly the best

1068
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,100
There's this one dude um who

1069
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:48,100
One year at the karaoke. There's this guy who was dressed as kamina and he had like the perfect build for it

1070
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:54,020
He was like an he was a you know a perfect kamina cosplayer and he was like dancing and raving

1071
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,100
He's saying the masinger opening

1072
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:59,620
Yeah, which is awesome and he was like totally down for everyone else's stuff

1073
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:06,660
He was like being this hype guy right then the next year. He shows up as uh, dr. Frankenstein from soul leader

1074
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:11,300
Again a perfect spot on cosplay and he even had the he had the giant

1075
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:15,300
I don't know if you know Frankenstein, but he has like a screw coming out of his head that he twists

1076
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:20,660
Yeah, it's got the big bolt. He actually had that and was able to turn it and make clicking sounds when he turned it

1077
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,660
He put a hole in his fucking brain

1078
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:32,260
Goddamn, okay, additionally he he had he was insisting insistently sitting in chairs backwards because that's how stein sits

1079
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:36,740
Yeah, and I was just like the fucking dedication like in this guy's mind

1080
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:43,380
He just is dr. Stein and it was so legend like it because it made me realize that like him acting so hype the year before

1081
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:48,180
Was because he was Kamina like you know because this year he wasn't being hype

1082
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:52,900
He was just like sitting on the chair, you know being that man's name was dustin hoffman

1083
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,140
What a legend of cosplay

1084
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:04,260
That's the first method actor who came to mind that was the first one I could think of that's right

1085
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:09,220
Also could have gone with christian bale or whoever the fuck you want. Uh, why not uh the guy from

1086
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,580
The guy with the mustache from there will be the guy who killed himself

1087
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:20,420
Uh, uh, heath ledger heath ledger. Yeah, there you go. And that man's name was yon renkowski the actor jace w commons

1088
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,780
Yes, it was him all along austin

1089
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:27,060
Uh, that is the the the whole method acted thing

1090
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:33,460
Like that the fact that people can do that is the reason i'm i'm always apprehensive of being a cosplayer because nobody likes

1091
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:38,180
You know somebody putting the costume together and it being yeah, it's pretty good pretty good

1092
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:41,140
And then you go up to them and they're just some fucking actually actually

1093
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:46,660
There's an entire uh giant legion of of people who dress up as a they dress up really well

1094
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:50,580
But don't act the part at all and it's called fucking women every fucking time

1095
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,540
They can't act a for shit. They just they're just

1096
01:21:54,660 --> 01:22:00,340
Talking about slots. What what what about the raven cosplayer we were just talking about she's completely

1097
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:06,180
I don't respect her or women. No, it's uh, she she's a hero. She's a hero

1098
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,940
I don't respect sexy cosplay girls outside of wanting to fuck them

1099
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:13,780
And that is what I will use them for throughout my life. So, you know, I appreciate that on that basis

1100
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:19,380
How much of okay, I feel like I might be the ultimate convention creeper, but it's all on the download

1101
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:23,140
It doesn't hurt anybody so it's okay. That's fine because because you know

1102
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:27,620
You always hear these stories about women who like have guys like all over them and stuff and like

1103
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,540
Predator tactics and they're always taking now at a convention

1104
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:36,020
Everyone takes pictures of cosplayers and I've always been super duper shy

1105
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:41,940
About like asking to take someone's picture. I don't know why I just feel really like I know that everyone expects it

1106
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,740
And yet I feel like I can't do it

1107
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:48,100
And usually I'll just jump in when someone else is taking the picture

1108
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:55,940
But there's particularly been cases where I saw a girl in a cosplay and I was so in love with her that I felt

1109
01:22:55,940 --> 01:23:02,820
It would be wrong of me to take a picture because I secretly am doing so because I'm nefariously in love with them

1110
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,940
So I won't I get even more afraid

1111
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:13,460
But man, I'm just I'm running through the like rolodex of images of like I remember that girl's cosplay

1112
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,940
I'm just curious. Well the very first girl

1113
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,460
I remember just being absolutely in love with based on their cosplay

1114
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:23,620
Was the first year at otacon because we were in the line going into the building

1115
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:27,220
And this girl just like kind of like fastly walked past

1116
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:31,460
And it was a really small asian girl in a boogie pop costume

1117
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:38,180
And I was I at the time boogie pop was my favorite thing in the universe and no one knew about it or talked about it

1118
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:45,460
Most people didn't even know that boogie pop is actually a you know, a little girl who or a young teenage girl

1119
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:51,540
You know a small one so conventions are a place where you go to fall in love as a young man

1120
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,620
It's really true and as an old man

1121
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:57,140
Every year every year at karaoke broken man as well

1122
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:02,420
Every single year at karaoke some girl will get up and do a performance with so much heart that i'm like

1123
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:07,380
Why am I not I actually do like this with with the younger ones when it was just cosplay

1124
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,340
That was more of like this fleeting sense of brilliance of like

1125
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:13,540
Oh my god, if if only but when it comes to the karaoke

1126
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:16,820
I actually legitimately feel like i'm an idiot for not talking to those girls

1127
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:20,660
I had this woman tied up in the back of my car driving away right now

1128
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,900
Yeah, if only I was reenacting the stan music video with this girl right now

1129
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:29,860
But but like with like last like for instance last year at otakon

1130
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:33,140
There was this girl who did like a cosplay performance and it wasn't that she was like

1131
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:40,900
Unbelievably cute or anything. She just did a really great karaoke performance and I was like I can't imagine a more perfect

1132
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:46,340
Like like legitimately a more perfect match for me than a girl who does passionate anime karaoke

1133
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:52,020
Like this is literally the kind of person I should be seeking out to date and of course I didn't say anything

1134
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:56,580
Uh, and I I regret it weak man. It's a different kind of regret

1135
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:02,820
There's that there's that that that hopeless romantic regret of I saw like the you're beautiful

1136
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:07,300
And I saw your face in a crowded place

1137
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,700
And I don't know what you know, and he kills himself at the end of the song

1138
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:19,700
That is more like the early cosplay stuff. This is more like. Yep. Wow. I'm a fucking idiot. Why didn't I talk to this girl?

1139
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:26,580
um the feeling I think that's sort of the uh, the the the digivolved form of this emotion, you know, it's leveled up

1140
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,540
To use the term that you people will understand

1141
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:36,740
I I know what you're this has only happened once to me before and just as that zoro whoever

1142
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,740
Cosplay changed Nate's life

1143
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:43,860
There's one cosplayer that changed my life and and jumpstarted me into the era of my life

1144
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:49,300
I like to refer to as the overly sentimental gay asshole not seinfeld era

1145
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:54,020
Okay, okay, I wish I will not go into detail about uh, just hope it had happened

1146
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,940
Could you tell us what the cosplay was? Uh, no

1147
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,740
Okay

1148
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,940
I have um, I think I know I've seen a few

1149
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:10,020
Digi digi, dude, if you talk, I'm gonna I'm not I'm gonna act. I'm gonna actually pee my pants

1150
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,500
Don't do it. Did you don't do it? I won't

1151
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:20,420
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I've uh, yeah, I haven't really um

1152
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:24,260
Like had a an amazing experience with a cosplayer

1153
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:29,380
I mean, I really like a lot of them and it's been like cool to see that some people are actually really good

1154
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:36,980
But the moment I see a risk of cosplayer, I will not waste a second. I will go up to her and I will say

1155
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,660
Uh, uh, you're you're cool or something

1156
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:44,900
Because good that'll that'll be my my ultimate pickup line. You're all

1157
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:49,460
Becky, you're cool. You are cool with just the letters. You are cool

1158
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:54,420
I'll say it like that and then they'll she'll hug me. Oh, what a what a dream

1159
01:26:55,380 --> 01:27:00,580
What a fantasy that is, you know, cosplayers are real hugs sluts, you know, they're past that shit out easy

1160
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:04,900
Oh, oh, they they can't wait for that. Let's go to anime for right now

1161
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:09,860
You know, it's kind of a shame because it used to be back in the day that cons were a lot more like physical

1162
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:14,180
Like yeah, glomp me people used to go glomp me sign. Yeah, they used to be glomping

1163
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:20,660
They used to be the yaoi paddles where they were hitting girls just walk around hitting people with paddles and I don't know

1164
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:25,700
And now there's all these cosplay is not consent. Well, which it totally is so that's bullshit

1165
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:31,540
Boy, is that actually a thing? That is exactly a thing. Yeah, that's that's that unfortunately is a very real thing

1166
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:38,180
Well, I wonder if it's actually real that this was a problem like did people assume cosplay was consent

1167
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:44,580
That's news to me. There there is a lot of harassment of of a of female cosplayers at conventions

1168
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:47,060
I get that but I and male actually

1169
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,700
Okay, I I don't mean to to go over the top here

1170
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:55,220
But aren't they I mean I'm talking about harassment in the sense of like calling to them in like reasonable ways

1171
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,940
No, I'm talking about harassment kind of asking for it

1172
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:05,460
I'm talking about like actual physical harassment does happen a lot of conventions. Well, that's not okay. Yeah, that's yeah

1173
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,660
But unless they're dressed like a slut in which case

1174
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:10,900
I mean

1175
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,660
Unless they're brisket. Yeah, and in my very complex and not useful

1176
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:21,700
Notes that I jotted down that don't bode well or don't don't translate well into this type of podcast

1177
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:29,140
And therefore I wasted about 30 minutes. I wrote down the words uh slut in all caps at least five times

1178
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:35,460
Yeah, is there anything else at your notes you want to read off? I think we're kind of winding down here

1179
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:43,700
Well, see my my my notes were just ever kind I've gone to and how I felt at each con and the interesting parts of it

1180
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,220
Hmm

1181
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:50,580
So that sounds a little detailed, but we get the gist of how positive of why you enjoyed them

1182
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:55,060
And how it's a little bit different than our experience in general. I mean, there's some weird themes

1183
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:58,260
Yeah, you reminded me. I wanted to talk about uh a way that cons

1184
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:01,300
Um have started evolving for me. I'm trying to make them evolve

1185
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,340
And it didn't work out as well as I wanted it to at this last note to con

1186
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:11,060
But um, so I know a lot of older congoers and eventers like there's this one

1187
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:18,100
This one anime blogger called omoe kane who's like probably in his late 30s now and he's like a he's a lifetime eventer

1188
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:22,020
He goes he like flies to japan just to go to events and stuff got a lot of money, right?

1189
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:28,340
Goes to lots of shit and um those guys always talk about how like when you go to a convention

1190
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:35,140
It's not really about just going to the convention. It's about going to that city and doing stuff there, you know

1191
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,620
and baltimore

1192
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:41,060
You know where the convention center is is right in the middle of like a big strip

1193
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:44,020
That's like famous for its restaurants and stuff and and bars

1194
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,020
So like at this past otacon

1195
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:51,460
I really went there with the intention of like i'm not going to hang out at the convention center most of the time

1196
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:52,820
I want to go

1197
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:58,420
And uh, you know go go out and eat go to all these fancy places because I'd been going to this con since 2008

1198
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:04,100
You know, it's always in the same place and I never really been to all the places around that are like all the tourist attractions

1199
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:07,540
Like all that stuff is advertised on the website for otacon

1200
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,900
You know, they really push the idea that like hey, you're in baltimore try the crab

1201
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,860
We're famous for our crab, you know go to go to all these different places

1202
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,740
I tried the crab and then you were betrayed by that restaurant

1203
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:22,980
Well, not only was I betrayed by yeah, we tear in a dog was one of the worst restaurant experiences ever

1204
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:28,020
That was a brony con wasn't it or yeah, I like that place. I don't know. Yeah, we went there brony con

1205
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:31,220
They were fine when we went at otacon. It was absolutely garbage

1206
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,700
But then like

1207
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:39,940
Aside from that there were two major issues that I didn't account for and that made it not worth it to go to all these places

1208
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:43,460
Because I didn't care about the money. I had money. I had saved up a bunch

1209
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:49,380
I was like i'm gonna go and spare no expense go to all the interesting stuff the two big miscalculations were one

1210
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,700
I was the only person with money

1211
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:55,860
So I had no one. Oh, that's the word. I just went to all these places alone

1212
01:30:56,180 --> 01:31:01,620
You know like yeah, and number two is that it was like the hottest day in recorded history

1213
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:04,740
For like one of the days of the con so like

1214
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:11,060
And and also just that baltimore stretch is it's not a great it's it's honestly

1215
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:12,900
It's too spread out

1216
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:18,100
There's too much space in between all the all the restaurants and stuff and none of them are that great

1217
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:20,340
It's it's overhyped, you know

1218
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:24,420
I remember one point. I like walked a mile in the fucking

1219
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:30,500
Unbelievable heat, you know sweating fucking balls and I went to some crab place and

1220
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:38,980
It was I don't even really like crab like I I was I was hoping that by eating like such a high class crab

1221
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:42,260
That it would be different. But no, it's just crab, you know, so

1222
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:44,740
I was like well

1223
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:49,780
Fuck fuck these restaurants. Fuck this town. Fuck baltimore. I'll go somewhere else

1224
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:55,460
But I do think that's a very interesting way to explore conventions is to not just worry about the convention

1225
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:59,140
And I kind of learned more of that from brony con where each year at brony con

1226
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:04,260
I only spent like probably half of it in the con spent a lot of time in hotel rooms with other people, you know

1227
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:08,420
Unfortunately not having sex like no fucking panels didn't even yeah

1228
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:15,460
No, we literally other than the panel we ran we did not attend a single thing at the last brony con right to

1229
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,100
We just sat around

1230
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:20,340
And it was a much better time for it. Yeah

1231
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:21,940
Uh

1232
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:27,940
Although that year their fucking was no seating anywhere like we spent the whole first day just looking for where to sit

1233
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:30,900
Our spot too, which was fucking bullshit. Yeah, it was retarded

1234
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,180
That was that was a huge part of why I didn't want to go back because I was like, you know

1235
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,860
It'd be one thing if we were all going to go and sit, but there wasn't even anywhere to sit

1236
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:41,540
We were like fucking roaming around looking for where we could fucking hang out

1237
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,340
That's that was fucking garbage

1238
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:48,180
But yeah, I hang out in a lot of hotel rooms hang out with people, you know

1239
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:54,580
Stuff like like what what bunny hop just did at magfest where he made that video about the sony playstation

1240
01:32:54,660 --> 01:33:00,660
Where it's like, you know, he got to go like into this very exclusive room where they endo playstation. Yeah, that's what I meant

1241
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,220
the nintendo playstation and

1242
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:07,620
You know and there's video of like him doing vr with jeff and shut shit like that

1243
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:12,100
Like that's that's fun stuff at conventions that people don't take into account when they think about it

1244
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,460
And that that's the element. I'd like to explore more

1245
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:18,820
Um going to conventions in the future, especially the money spending part

1246
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:22,420
Like it's a great way to just treat it as a vacation and go to a bunch of places

1247
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:27,060
Unfortunately, if all your friends are fucking poor then uh, you're gonna do all that stuff alone

1248
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:31,540
Which is you know, when you when you go to an expensive restaurant by yourself

1249
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:34,340
All you're thinking about is how much money you're spending on the food

1250
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:38,340
Like there's no like that's that's all it is. It's like I sit down and I go

1251
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:42,980
This is a 16 dollar crab cake. I'm about to spend 16 dollars

1252
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:49,700
So all I'm thinking while I'm eating it is is this worth 16 dollars? This probably isn't worth 16 dollars, you know

1253
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,780
Yep, um

1254
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:53,780
Yeah, dude, uh

1255
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,380
Conventions are great

1256
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:59,220
All this talk about how you don't like conventions just convinced me even more that I love conventions

1257
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:05,380
I mean, I wasn't trying to present the idea that I don't like conventions just that as I've gotten older

1258
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:09,780
My what I get out of them has changed and I definitely think I will enjoy them again

1259
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:13,060
If I go about them differently going with the the crowd

1260
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:16,820
I've been going with where we all just kind of split up and go our own ways is not fun

1261
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:22,420
Uh, you know, that's why we're gonna stick together bro. I'm gonna be on your ass like your dick is fucking gay

1262
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,500
Which is very

1263
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:30,420
Both of the both of those can be preceded with the adjective very and and also, uh, I don't I don't know

1264
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:34,820
Where your hotel is muchy and relative in relative to the convention right next to it

1265
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:36,900
Yeah, I highly advise

1266
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:44,500
Everyone if you're going to a con plan ahead get a fucking room near the convention. It's so much vastly superior

1267
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,220
It's like a whole different world when you're close enough

1268
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:52,100
And this this past otacon we tried to do that think think about how you're gonna get girls back to your room guys

1269
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,820
Plan your route plan out how you're gonna do that shit

1270
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:59,060
I mean even beyond that just like like every year at these conventions

1271
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:06,100
We would always get a a hotel that's like 10 minutes out of town and like you can't hang out and drink all night because like

1272
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:10,660
Some if you're especially for sharing a room if even one person gets tired

1273
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:16,740
You know, then it's like the rest of us are holding that person like forcing them to be at the con while we do our shit

1274
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:18,500
You know and then

1275
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,260
You know, we all have to leave at a certain time

1276
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:24,660
There's sort of like a curfew and you can't just hang out and enjoy it at your own pace or anything

1277
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:30,820
And then like this past year we got a place that was like close enough to the convention that it could be walked

1278
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:33,380
But it was it was a fucking

1279
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,260
40 minute walk. So it was not fun

1280
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:42,820
Um, especially in that heat like we ended up, you know, my friends mostly ended up taking like lift uh to and from the convention

1281
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:45,140
It was like, oh, yeah, that's what I would you know, it wasn't even worth it

1282
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:46,820
um

1283
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:50,020
To walk that distance so like by all means get a place nearby

1284
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:53,700
It makes it so much easier to hang out and enjoy the uh atmosphere

1285
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:59,460
So, okay, uh, Gabe, do you have any closing thoughts on your uh, convention?

1286
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,940
We're only an hour and 36 minutes into this

1287
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:05,540
All right, but I want to go to questions because I feel like we've explored this pretty thoroughly by this

1288
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:09,140
Yeah, I want to talk about fucking brony con

1289
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:14,900
You already talked about brony con. Go ahead. I like brony con. If you have anything worth saying, then go ahead and say it

1290
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,900
Brony con 2013

1291
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,900
boring digi-bur

uh next note brony con

1294
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,980

1296
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:32,420
I love ben sainte. Yep actual activities. I told you met him, right? No

1297
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,380
Yep, that's where I met him the first thing that ben's ever said to me

1298
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:38,580
Uh, uh, I was I like I shook hands with digi

1299
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:43,860
I was like, hey and then like like he moves out of the way like out of out of like the camera like view

1300
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:49,940
Like the eye camera and then I like pan over to this fucking retard and his name is ben sainte

1301
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:55,140
And he shakes my hand that time he was named phantom horn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and and he just says hey

1302
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:57,300
I've heard a lot about you

1303
01:36:57,460 --> 01:37:01,940
And I haven't heard anything about him, but then I found out brony con 2015

1304
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:06,340
Hey, you know when I uh you this might amuse you to know munchie at that time when ben told me about you

1305
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:10,020
I thought you were way over hyped. I thought you

1306
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:15,620
That's right, buddy. What does that mean exactly? What what?

1307
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,860
How is he hyped exactly?

1308
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:21,460
This is my art that I'm presenting to you for you to interpret however you wish

1309
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:24,900
So you were over hyped. There you go. Like like like over hyped

1310
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,620
I don't remember ever

1311
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:33,540
I'll explain the joke I guess because ben was really excited about munchie and thought he was really cool and I was like

1312
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:40,820
Oh, yeah, ben was definitely ben ben was in love with munchie from a from an early point. It's been a big cheerleader of yours

1313
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:47,620

Okay, anyway, we interrupted gibb. He was gonna say some some bullshit. I mean

1319
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:20,580
No, no this this is not real

1320
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,860
This is fake

1321
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,100
All the things that could interrupt me. No

1322
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,140
No

1323
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:31,140
He's pouring water. He's pouring water

1324
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:34,020
I'm honestly not

1325
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:41,620
Nate you brought this upon your fucking self. I don't believe you. There's no way that we've devolved to this level on my fucking show

1326
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:46,180
Munchie, I won't have it still going. What could you possibly that's too long? Yeah, you blew it buddy

1327
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:49,300
You went too long now. I know that you're pouring shit. Do you want me to send you a picture, Nate?

1328
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:53,060
Do you really? Yeah, send me a goddamn picture of you pissing on your computer. Okay?

1329
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:56,660
Yeah, snapchat me bro snapchat

01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:03,620
I really hope that was into a bottle or something. Oh my god. We we have hit rock bottom folks

1331
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:06,180
I can't decide if I believe that was real piss

1332
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:08,820
No, I don't believe it for so long

1333
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:12,500
All right. Well, he's a big boy. He is a big boy. I'm gonna send it to you, bro

1335
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:24,260
Okay, anyway, we were supposed to be listening to fucking gibb talk about something

1336
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,620
Take it away, buddy. I don't think I can top that

1337
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:31,860
Anything could top that that was rock bottom

1338
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:34,820
Okay, all right

1339
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,220
I'm gonna go to

1340
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:40,900
I don't know. What was the anime expo where there's homestuck stuff? Yeah

1341
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:47,140
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna find and talk to a human being called brisket and I'm gonna say you're cool and I'm gonna

1342
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:48,660
She's not a human being hopefully

1343
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:52,980
Oh, oh, yeah. Well, I'm gonna troll an alien girl alien girl

1344
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:59,620
And uh, I'm gonna buy a homestuck thing and that's gonna be my future for cons

1345
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:05,380
And or going with jeff to magfest to meet real cool guys

1346
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:08,340
The good news is there's lots of risk of cosplayers at least there were

1347
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:12,900
How how long is hippo? Do you think like what what's the timetable on this plan?

1348
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:15,620
Like could you actually afford to do any of this in the next year?

1349
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:19,460
um in the I mean I

1350
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:24,420
Technically I can but it would be eating into stuff that I kind of want to save up for like

1351
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:29,940
In case I you know die. Yeah, because I'm probably going to anime expo with munchie this year

1352
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,260
So there is a room out there. You can join

1353
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,780
In july

1354
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:43,220
Yeah, some of plain journeys are really yeah, you could room with us. There'd be no problem

1355
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:46,820
I could just have to hear me piss a lot. Munchie has just apple juice, dude

1356
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:51,780
I know you're a big apple juice guy. You poured apple juice into that glass. What happened? No, no

1357
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:55,140
Maybe you should have a taste Nate. It looks pretty fuck. It looks like piss, dude

1358
01:40:55,220 --> 01:41:00,340
I think he actually pissed although that cup looks too small for the amount of time that piss went on for

1359
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:05,300
It's not there would have been less. Oh, you're actually looking at it. You gross gross

1360
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:12,020
It's just apple juice, dude. Don't worry. Don't worry. He made sure to post this in the ben saint chat, by the way

1361
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:14,020
Yeah, he sure did

1362
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,500
sure did

1363
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,580
uh anyway

1364
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:24,340
Maybe I could come to anime expo. I would need to make a bit more of a patreon buck

1365
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:30,020
Yeah, or something go to youtube.com slash patreon slash louis batton

1366
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,380
I guess

1367
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:32,980
Give me money for that

1368
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:35,380
So I can go find briska and live my dream

1369
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:43,140
Of saying hello. My briska's living her dream. My briska's living her dream. My briska's living her dream. That's an old good meme

1370
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:47,780
Um, yep. Good old meme old good. Are we ready to answer the uh questions here?

1371
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:52,500
I think so. Uh, by the way, I just want to reiterate my point everybody. I still think it's a good

1372
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:57,700
I think that's a wise policy. It's for children conventions are for children

1373
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:03,620
Take your kids somewhere if you want them to be indoctrinated into that culture and to have some crazy experiences because they're kids

1374
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:08,100
And they don't know what real life is like yet. There you go. Okay. All right. Here's some questions. Um

1375
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:12,500
Now actually there were some pretty good questions on here as I was looking through

1376
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:16,820
Oh, where's the one I was looking at? Um, oh, okay. Here's a very specific question

1377
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:21,780
But I liked it. I thought you might like this digi. This is by uh at monkey away

1378
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:28,820
Uh procrastinators. Uh, what should I listen to while I play dark souls 3 now that I've run out of tpc

1379
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:34,100
Podcasts in digi bro after dark content the biggest problem in the universe and then that's what I was thinking

1380
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:37,700
Which is what I listen to almost exclusively while playing dark souls

1381
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:43,700
There you go monkey. Perfect. Um, uh, give suggestion. No, no, it doesn't matter

1382
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:49,700
Okay, there you go. I'll listen to dick show or biggest problem in the universe. Uh, okay. What have we got here?

1383
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:57,780
Here's a terrible question. Uh, if you could choose any youtuber to survive the apocalypse with who would it be?

1384
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,820
No duplicate answers. Uh, that anime snore

1385
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:10,580
You would how fast would you fucking die and you would be no wait movie bug because there's plenty of

1386
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:14,980
That's smart. I could survive for quite a while on that. Uh, I'm gonna choose

1387
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:20,500
I'm gonna pick the only other human who's responsible that I know other than myself

1388
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:23,140
So because we'll probably actually figure out what we're doing

1389
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:27,540
That's true. I would choose. Um, I would choose lacy green

1390
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:32,900
Oh, because she has those because she's a because she's a dirty slut and she's got wide birthing hips

1391
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:34,980
So it could re could quickly

1392
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:40,500
Create a new human race and that that would be a I'm going. I'm she's a breeder. She's my breeder is what I'm picking

1393
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:46,020
Why did I stick? This is why I can't get a girlfriend. I I only think about my stupid guy friends

1394
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:48,020
I'd ever think about women out there in the world

1395
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:53,140
That I could be trapping on island with me. I couldn't think of like a I couldn't think of like a youtuber

1396
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:56,820
Who is a female we're trapping in a post-apocalyptic sniper wolf? She's

1397
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:01,380
It doesn't even matter like the answer should have just been any female

1398
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:06,900
And if you yeah, it's just the only two of you. Yeah, that'd that'd be the thing to do. Uh, okay. Let's see. What else do we get?

1399
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:11,380
I didn't get to answer you fucking. Oh, I'm sorry. You fucking whore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please go ahead

1400
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:15,540
It would be any female. Obviously you didn't let me have my input

1401
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:17,300
Okay

1402
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:20,260
You could you could sex change ben saint and bring him. Oh

1403
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:25,780
Um, no, that would work out. Well, no, that'd be that would be against nature. That'd be against god

1404
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:32,900
Oh my god, there's so much piss in my fucking there's this one person asking these incredibly emotional questions

1405
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:38,340
I can't but she went so far for that piss joke that it's like ruined like he's now

1406
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:41,220
uncomfortably sitting covered in piss and like

1407
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:46,820
It really is really fucking sad like how much like piss didn't go into the

1408
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:51,780
Audio only piss joke that he could have faked easily

1409
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,500
He went all out

1410
01:44:54,980 --> 01:45:02,020
To me like to me. I know it's real and to the listeners. I know they know it's real too. So just imagine me doing it

1411
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,060
Hey, um, this person

1412
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:10,020
Uh, okay. Well, I'm gonna answer this one real quick. Uh at ripe. Oh god, ripe

1413
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:12,420
Rony pasta

1414
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:17,380
Yeah, I think that's it ripe rony pasta asks opinion on the rants series. It's the best

1415
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:21,780
Sengoku rants the genius game, uh, the rants like Sengoku rants, um

1416
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:27,940
Gay japanese one through seven. It's all these it's these these crazy sex arrow games where you do awesome shit

1417
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:31,540
It's a game about trying to rape your way through ancient japan

1418
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:38,020
Yeah, but in that universe rape is like a handshake. So it's great. No one loves it. So yeah, I played, uh,

1419
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:39,780
15 minutes of it

1420
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:43,460
I played up until when the gameplay starts and then I looked at it and I went

1421
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:47,380
I don't fucking comprehend this at all and I quit it. Yeah, it's fucking brutal

1422
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:51,540
But I have one of the hardest games I've ever played. I have a hug pillow of usugi kenshin

1423
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:53,940
Didn't know who she was for like years

1424
01:45:54,260 --> 01:46:00,980
I I got it because it was it was it was like I bought a manga magazine from japan that was it was only 30 dollars

1425
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:05,540
Like after shipping and it came with the free dakimakura. So it was like the best deal in the world

1426
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:08,500
I'd buy that. Um, yeah, me and my friend donson both bought it

1427
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:13,140
We both bought the same same set because he just like told me about it. He was like, hey free dakimakura

1428
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:17,780
And I was like, well, shit. I I just I only wanted it for weeb cred like of course

1429
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:22,580
I mean most of what's in my room is not here because I like it. It's here because I

1430
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:25,220
Because I wanted to have an otaku room

1431
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:30,900
Uh because back in the day that was like a thing that they would people would post these images of the otaku

1432
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:34,820
Room, which is like no white space anywhere. It's all anime posters and shit

1433
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:39,620
And I always thought that was super cool and I wanted to have it so and you're you're carrying that toward this very day

1434
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:44,180
I'm starting to work on the ceiling. I've put up a line of posters, but they look like shit and they keep falling

1435
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:49,540
So and it's and I and I'm realizing that it's going to take even more posters than I thought to cover my whole ceiling

1436
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:51,620
So, uh, I gotta do it before I move

1437
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:55,380
To note on that poster things and it goes slightly back to the cons

1438
01:46:55,540 --> 01:47:01,700
Another reason why I actually like conventions is because I live in literally like minimalist like a painting

1439
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:05,460
Like I there I have nothing in my room. I have no possessions

1440
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:11,620
Why I'm looking up at at my at my like the only things that decorate my room

1441
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:18,820
As a like like the only thing that isn't playing white walls is an american flag and like two undertale posters

1442
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:24,820
I don't understand what fills the hole in your life left by not having any human companionship if you don't have stuff

1443
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,420
How do you

1444
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,420
Live myself and piss and

1445
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:33,140
Yeah, how'd you get the piss out through all those hot flies?

1446
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:37,940
Well, they joined in too. Oh, okay

1447
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:41,540
Munchies as do you have less stuff than davoo in his room?

1448
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:46,020
Uh, you know what? I actually have one more poster than he has

1449
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:51,460
Impressive. Yeah impressive. Uh, okay. Let's move along here

1450
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:57,860
Uh, here's a bunch of questions by this guy, but let's only answer one decent one by at gypsy gypsy

1451
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:04,260
Who are your smash bros mains and why he said no, okay? Okay. No, no, shut the fuck up. This is my this is my question

1452
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:05,380
This is my question

1453
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:10,180
Okay, when I was a little baby boy when I little when I was a little baptist when I was a little baptist boy whipper

1454
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:15,380
I loved curbie and so I played curbie. I got really good as curbie. This was in brawl

1455
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:18,260
I I played melee a lot, but I didn't play a melee a lot

1456
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:20,500
I played brawl a lot and I played brawl a lot

1457
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:25,300
So in brawl, I really like to play curbie and then smash fork him out and I was like, hmm

1458
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:29,700
curbie definitely is the worst character in this entire fucking game

1459
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:33,300
And I'm really upset, but uh, you know, I really like curbie

1460
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,420
So I'm gonna I'm gonna stay like a curbie curbie like a curbie curbie guy

1461
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:41,460
Not like a not like the guy curbie, but as in like the greater like expanded star wars universe curbie

1462
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:46,900
Uh, so I played ddd. Uh, I know how to play dd a lot. I like dd. He's a good guy. He's really slow

1463
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:49,060
I'm slow and not in the mental way

1464
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:52,980
I'm the fastest guy around but I'm slow as in I'm really fat and I can't move my limbs

1465
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:55,700
And I also piss way too much because I'm full of piss

1466
01:48:56,500 --> 01:49:00,580
Anyway, and also I really like mute 2 because mute 2 is like really good in that game

1467
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:01,700
And he's also fun

1468
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:07,220
Um, Ganondorf is fun because he's like big and like you do like fucking has like a huge dick like huger than my like forearm

1469
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:14,900
He's like a huge like horse dick and um, um, um, um, yes, I love super smash bros. Please. Um, I'm I'm honestly I can drooling

1470
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,660
I'm drooling right now

1471
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:21,380
All right, let's keep it together. Uh, Ganondorf's pretty good for I think he's fun to play but uh

1472
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:22,500
Oh, he's fun to play

1473
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:27,140
But if a tierless or any way to view the game then he's like he's like the worst

1474
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:34,100
I I cry tears. I was gonna say I have a tear on my cheek every time I talk about tierless. You're right. You're right

1475
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:39,540
You're right. I you are right. I can't even like I played smash. I know in smash one

1476
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:42,180
I played Pikachu

1477
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:48,980
But you know that game's ancient and grappling with the onset of menopause and uh, what?

1478
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:53,140
It's a line from billion mandy, uh in in super special is melee

1479
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:58,740
I think I played Pikachu briefly and then link or something. I don't know all I know is eventually I found

1480
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:04,260
Samus and I've been playing samus for like eight years and she's the only character I'm any good with

1481
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:10,980
And uh as as the people here can attest to am I not actually a pretty okay samus player

1482
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:13,540
Yeah, it was it was funny when I played you on digi bros

1483
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:18,100
I expected you to be like literally the worst player in the entire fucking world

1484
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:20,340
Yeah, everyone thinks I'm just garbage at all video games

1485
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:24,340
But I've been playing samus for so fucking long that I can actually do it

1486
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:28,900
I still beat you. It was easy. Well, it helps that I have the way I play here is different from

1487
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:33,700
I think how anybody else plays smash at all. So it's yeah, I think it's use or something

1488
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:36,900
What I'm saying is I think it's just it's not that I'm great

1489
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:42,500
It's that the way I play is so different that it takes getting used to and once much he probably figured out the patterns

1490
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:43,780
He was able to deal with it

1491
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:47,460
Smash is all like like you could go up against like one of the best players in the world

1492
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:52,740
And if you just play like a retard slash differently, yeah, as as he's known to do then yeah

1493
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:58,580
Because I just I just I fucking spam missiles and jump around like an asshole and that's how I uh, all right

1494
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:00,980
there's acting of

1495
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:03,860
Yeah, um, my my main since uh

1496
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:11,300
Nintendo 64 days was always been samus and kirby because kirby could you know when he gets hit

1497
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:12,900
You can fly it a lot

1498
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:18,500
So that made it easy to get back to the stage and also samus because the up b was ridiculous in that first game

1499
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:25,220
And also I hate link because my brother's always played link and that's why I don't like legends zelda as much as the metroid series

1500
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,580
Yeah, I

1501
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:30,260
Unironically have the exact same emotion my friend

1502
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:35,140
I have like okay. My friends are divided into two types of people

1503
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:39,780
The fucking assholes and the even worse fucking assholes

1504
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:45,860
The first fucking assholes are the people who are like actually good at the game and they all play link

1505
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:49,540
I'm serious. Literally everyone gets guess guess who my main is

1506
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:51,940
Guess who my main is

1507
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,140
Toon Link

1508
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:55,540
Yes, to link to one. Yeah, I know

1509
01:51:55,620 --> 01:52:00,420
I know he's way worse and and and and the other assholes and people who play samus

1510
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:05,860
So it's it's funny that we have two fucking degenerates in this call right now

1511
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:06,660
You know

1512
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:09,780
To be on to link was the guy that I've played the most over the years

1513
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:14,580
I I have not played him much in smash 4 and now I almost exclusively play

1514
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:18,100
Peach is my probably number one most played

1515
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:23,860
Jigglypuff who I love to play so cool and now I play a lot of cloud because those are like s tier

1516
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:29,700
Characters are you telling me jigglypuff is s tier wait wait wait. Yeah, hungry. Hungry box fucking

1517
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:32,740
Is like the champion of the world just because

1518
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:37,700
In fucking melee, not in smash 4. Smash 4 fucking jigglypuff sucks

1519
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,340
Yeah, we're I'm talking about

1520
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:43,380
I forgot to mention pacifist donkey kong is also

1521
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:50,180
I was gonna I was gonna ask you to I was gonna ask you to explain that but then I remembered we do it in the smash

1522
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:53,780
Let's play that I haven't uploaded yet. Yeah, which is

1523
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:59,300
Funnily enough like during radcon. I actually edited and uploaded that video

1524
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:02,900
But the the audio sync was like 30 seconds off

1525
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:07,060
So I was gonna read you know like re-sync it and I just haven't gotten around to it yet

1526
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:12,820
So that video has videos been uploaded on private for like three weeks and I just haven't fixed it

1527
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:18,100
But it will be there. There is a like two hour long smash bros

1528
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:21,300
Let's play with all the pcp boys in it. Yeah, it was

1529
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:28,580
Uh, let's let's move along here. We don't got time to spend smash bros all day here. Um, yes, we do

1530
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:32,580
What okay by on we on me once again. Hey there on we

1531
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:37,380
Uh, what is one medium you want to create in but probably never will

1532
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:44,900
Oh comics uh, what uh, just one just pick one. Let's not fuck around anime

1533
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:49,300
Anime yeah, okay. There you go. Honestly honestly like

1534
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:54,340
Uh, modern art sculpture because I've always been like really good with my hands

1535
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:57,540
But the idea of just doing that is a career. Oh, baby. He's good with this

1536
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:02,500
Does does architecture count as a uh art form? Yeah, sure. Why not?

1537
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:06,660
I've always had like a hard on for architecture

1538
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:10,740
But it's not something I have like any because it's it's all math and I hate math

1539
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:15,300
So like there's no chance I will ever do anything with architecture, but I think it's super cool

1540
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:22,660
Yeah, if anybody knows um anish Kapoor the guy who did that giant like mirror thing in some city and

1541
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:27,380
And some other cool things. He's like uh an inspiration when I was in art

1542
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:29,060
Do studying art

1543
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:33,060
Is this the mirror thing that like caused fires on people as they were walking home?

1544
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:38,900
It looks like a big beam that you can walk under and it's just a big mirror

1545
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:41,380
Cool. Oh, I know that you must have seen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course

1546
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:47,940
No, he's a famous guy. Um, he does lots of really cool sculptures like that and I've always wanted to be like a

1547
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:55,620
Like like low-key wanted to be a big sculpture person making really cool things like that because he's one of those those fine artists

1548
01:54:56,100 --> 01:55:00,100
Who like who is actually making stuff that's interesting and not just like a

1549
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:03,140
Something that's really delicate and has to be inside

1550
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:05,780
Behind a glass case that's boring

1551
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:12,660
Like he makes huge structures that the the london 2012 olympics has a giant red tower that he built and designed cool

1552
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:15,540
Yeah, that's sick. Oh

1553
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:23,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, I want to get into but probably never will do anything with my voice including podcasts

1554
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:26,900
You blew it mind she you blew that one

1555
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:33,780
Well because blew that horn. Yeah, see the thing is I like I don't it's not that I dislike my voice

1556
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:35,780
But I don't I don't think it's very versatile

1557
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:41,460
And I would like to like sing. Well, no, I wouldn't want to sing. I don't want to do anything. I'm never mind

1558
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:46,340
I'm looking at that red tower and it looks like a roller coaster like crumpled into a ball

1559
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:52,260
Apparently there is like a slide that you can actually go down in that. That's pretty cool

1560
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:59,460
Hey, um, does did the terrorist axe count as an art form because if so, oh my god, I would be so into that

1561
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:06,020
That's just like that guy from Naruto the guy who thinks explosions are out and he makes things a little mouth. Oh, yeah, that guy

1562
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:10,580
Deidara, Deidara, whatever that guy's name. Yeah, I don't think I made it that far into Naruto

1563
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:15,940
Um, okay, I got katsuki. I got two more questions. I think here's one another one

1564
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:22,900
But this is this is a good one by at gypsy gypsy. Um name one good thing to come from the pcp

1565
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:26,020
I just helped me dude. I got under Taylor 587

1566
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:28,340
The undertale, you know what?

1567
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:34,740
You got it there, but and I think I think in general the the the royal rumble the royal rumble is pretty great

1568
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:38,980
We got so much art and shit from that. It was it was great. It's the best video we've ever made

1569
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:44,660
Also, also the new meme of me pissing on the pcp

1570
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:47,860
Which will be a meme. I've already first seen it

1571
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:54,740
That's also another great thing that's come out. It'll start a chain reaction every podcast that anyone is in somebody has to pee

1572
01:56:56,980 --> 01:57:03,220
I'll always be the one to do it until you pee in spite of being someone who loves peeing outdoors and in strange places

1573
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:08,260
I could never pee into a bottle. It's just uh, it's a hang up. I can't do it

1574
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:10,260
That was the first time I've ever done it in like six years

1575
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:14,980
I've told that story about how my roommate pissed in bottles when I was in college, right? That's yeah

1576
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:18,660
We don't need to go into that shit. Uh, do you think Tom my nightmare is sick?

1577
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:23,300
Um, okay, you know, if you don't know a bottle just piss into your mouth. That's much more efficient

1578
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:29,860
I was gonna say one more, but here's a question that I didn't see and I got to address this one by at joestar 93

1579
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:35,380
Nate, how good was that one piece movie that you were tweeting about and let me tell you buddy

1580
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:41,860
That one piece movie that I was watching tweeting about earlier. Um, movie six. Yeah, like baron okutsu

1581
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:47,700
Omatsuri and the island of mystery or some bullshit like that movie number six

1582
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:51,940
Uh, it was great. It was by far the best one piece movie

1583
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:54,260
I've seen everyone was right. It is great

1584
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:57,540
Uh, and to answer other questions that people were asking me

1585
01:57:57,860 --> 01:58:01,780
Now's as good a place as any because I kind of wanted to talk about this and thought I'd never get a chance

1586
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:03,940
But here one has fallen into my lap

1587
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:10,020
Uh, yes, I did watch it because I was reminded of that movie's existence by super eyepatch wolf

1588
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:14,500
Um, uh, and and watching his new video about one piece today

1589
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:19,460
Did not love his video and I watched that movie only because I was reminded that it exists

1590
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:24,260
And do not want cucks like him to lord the fact that they've seen that movie

1591
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:26,340
Literally no one can any longer

1592
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:29,060
I care, right?

1593
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:32,900
And uh, and by the way, he's dead wrong. That is not a great place to get in one piece

1594
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:37,540
To start from chapter one of the manga. Don't listen. He's an idiot. Okay. Let's move on and last question

1595
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:42,980
Now this guy actually asked a couple and they were all like full of pathos and were

1596
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:48,820
Really god like I when you hear this you'll you'll know like where this guy was when he asked these questions

1597
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:50,820
So this is a rato

1598
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:52,180
Or uh

1599
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:58,100
At intrepid feline. Okay. Here's the first question. How hard is it for you guys to meet new people?

1600
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:01,460
And before we answer that let me just read his other questions

1601
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:05,700
Next one. What advice do you guys give to trying to make friends?

1602
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:10,100
And then the next one is how talkative are you guys outside of the podcast?

1603
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:16,820
So I'm starting to get the kind of guy that this is and brother brother. I love you and I I want to legitimately

1604
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:19,380
Answer these questions. So, um

1605
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:25,460
Who wants to take any of those? I well I'll I will say that the reason we talk to each other

1606
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:30,340
Is not because we're good at meeting new people. It's because we like the content that each other makes

1607
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:34,740
Right. So that's that's one way to talk to people. It's just to be someone really good

1608
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:38,820
That doing stuff. I mean if you're trying to if we're talking about on the internet

1609
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:44,340
The best way to meet new people is just like hey, I love your work or uh something

1610
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:50,100
You know or just like go just go to any community anywhere and find someone who has similar interest to you and talk to them

1611
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:54,580
I think making friends on the internet is like a dime a dozen. You can easily do it

1612
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:57,140
It's just about having literally anything to talk about

1613
01:59:57,620 --> 02:00:03,060
I don't think this guy needs internet friends though. I mean based on these questions. I can tell this is a lonely individual

1614
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:09,540
I got the sense it was more about you know, like making real friends or human connections in which case you are barking up the

1615
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:13,300
Absolute worst tree you could be barking up at this situation

1616
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:15,620
I haven't met a new person to be an expert

1617
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:17,940
In years

1618
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:23,860
The last like the only times I meet new people are either, you know online like either we meet them through

1619
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:28,020
They're them being great like the last new person I met online is monkey, you know

1620
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:34,100
Right made great videos got in contact with them slowly developed a sort of like hey test the waters

1621
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:36,980
This guy seemed like our kind of guy. He does seem like our kind of guy

1622
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:41,780
All right, let's drag him into the crew and now I've met him in real life. He came by my house cool guy, right?

1623
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:44,260
um as for offline

1624
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:46,900
I only ever meet people if

1625
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:53,460
For some reason someone is assimilated into my friends friends and even then I don't hang out with my own friends anymore

1626
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:57,620
So I've actually not not only have I not met a new person in years

1627
02:00:57,700 --> 02:01:04,740
I've actively repelled almost everyone I knew before so like now I'm at probably the least a number of friends

1628
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:06,820
I've ever had is right now

1629
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:11,300
So I just like to say I am in a similar situation right now

1630
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:15,060
Tomorrow in fact I'm going to go to a local pub

1631
02:01:15,620 --> 02:01:19,620
Just to see how easy it is to to talk to new people

1632
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:24,180
Meet real people that I can say I mean, it's not like I'm bad at talking

1633
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:27,300
The only way you get good at talking is by you know practice

1634
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:32,900
But the the the act of like going up to a person is completely different from knowing how to talk

1635
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:37,140
As the conversation has got I've truly realized so it's it's it's really just um

1636
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:44,100
I don't know just go into places where people are and eventually something might have I've realized how awful I am at like

1637
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:48,020
Even wanting to talk to people because the other day my mom

1638
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:50,820
My mom's a part of a school of rock program

1639
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:56,820
And they were doing a show a live show at this bar called hot tune out the street for me and like

1640
02:01:57,540 --> 02:02:01,700
Basically everyone my mom knows was invited. I didn't know they were all going to be there

1641
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,180
But like it was at a bar and so I was thinking hey

1642
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:08,980
I can you know have a few drinks. Maybe I'll talk to someone. Maybe there'll be a girl

1643
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:14,580
I could talk to who knows um, and I wore my fucking giant fur coat because it stands out in school

1644
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:20,740
Alpha's peacocking dog peacocking peacocking in my in my big coat and I had like a glass of wine before going

1645
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:22,740
But it wasn't enough to get me drunk

1646
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:26,100
Unfortunately because I should have just gotten like sourced before I got there

1647
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:31,700
But like I showed up and of course it's mostly my parents's friends and like everyone wanted to talk to me

1648
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:36,660
I got tons of people like commenting on my jacket lots of people, you know my who know me

1649
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:41,060
But I don't know them because you know they all know my work and stuff from from facebook

1650
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:43,940
My parents share my shit all the time especially my raps

1651
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:48,340
So I was getting a lot of questions about like my rap and stuff and I was just like yeah, uh-huh

1652
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:55,460
Oh hi, you know like like actively deflecting everyone and like wanting nothing to do with anybody and I was just like

1653
02:02:55,860 --> 02:03:01,060
What am I doing? I just I don't even like like people are actively trying to connect with me

1654
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:04,820
And I am just telling them to fuck off essentially in so many words

1655
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:10,420
Um, so yeah, I am the last person to come through for advice on this. Hey rato. Hey rato

1656
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:16,180
I mean okay much you go ahead go ahead. I'm the best person to come and do a task about this because

1657
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:21,300
Okay, here's we have to understand. I'm the saint like like there is no like real life me

1658
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:24,740
There is no other me. I am like this all the time

1659
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:27,860
However, there is one there is one difference

1660
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:30,580
If you meet me on the side of the street

1661
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:35,220
Then you will realize and you observe my actions and you observe me in my natural habitat

1662
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:37,540
You will learn the meaning of fear

1663
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:46,900
Actually, you will learn the meaning of friendship and charitable actions because I am the nicest person in the entire

1664
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:51,380
Fucking universe. Just just not for the kikes. That's all. You know, that's the one thing

1665
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:55,700
As all the people in this call are right kikes and niggers, you know

1666
02:03:56,260 --> 02:04:01,940
Uh, I am like like like no matter even if you're just some random fucking normie

1667
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:07,140
I will I will actively try to be your best fucking friend if I meet you in real life

1668
02:04:07,620 --> 02:04:12,740
Like like if you just bump into me or something you're like, oh, hey, I'm I'm a tourist here and redacted

1669
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:20,100
Uh, do you uh, do you know how to fucking kill people? I'll be like, do I ever bro here?

1670
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:25,060
I'm gonna be your dad now. We're gonna kill people together. That's what it's like

1671
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:32,100
Um, well, you have to understand. Okay. Uh, not about me you you you who asking this just act like you're crazy

1672
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:38,660
And act like you are unstable and if you do that people will come in and they will have to be your friend

1673
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:42,900
Or else they'll be scared. They're gonna die or else. They'll be scared. You're gonna kill them

1674
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:46,980
So if you just act like you're going to kill people then people will like you

1675
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:50,820
Well said munchie

1676
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,300
Let me I want to comment on this

1677
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:57,700
I feel I feel your suffering here

1678
02:04:57,780 --> 02:05:03,060
I know what it's like to be to be lonely and want to make friends and and not be able to communicate very well

1679
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:09,380
Uh, I was like that for a long time and still am in some ways. Um, so I just want you to know

1680
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:12,020
it sounds like

1681
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:15,620
I mean, I feel like I know you that you're a guy if you're watching this podcast

1682
02:05:15,860 --> 02:05:22,100
Uh, which clearly you are then I feel like you you fit into kind of this nerdy guy on the internet group

1683
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:26,660
Probably doesn't socialize a lot. Uh, you know by your own volition or by your question

1684
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:29,060
I'm inferring that you're not a very talkative person

1685
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:35,940
I would just highly recommend that you just change your life in such ways and it doesn't have to be drastic

1686
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:40,340
But just try to make changes in your life where you're around more people more of the time

1687
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:44,580
Because really what you're talking about is grinding a skill set of communication

1688
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:46,980
As and like meeting new people

1689
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:49,060
So like just if you can

1690
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:53,620
Try to make changes in your life that put you in contact with a lot of people so that you can you know

1691
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:57,140
Kind of practice grind up your talking skills as fast as possible

1692
02:05:57,380 --> 02:06:03,460
And put you in contact with lots of people so that you as fast as possible will meet people that you find a kinship with and like

1693
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:09,620
And I wouldn't really recommend like pursuing internet friendships that much because there's just as human beings

1694
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:14,740
There's just such a there's just such a great benefit to having like contact with people physically and face to face

1695
02:06:14,980 --> 02:06:18,020
As opposed to talking online, which can you know cause all kinds of problems

1696
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:24,660
So you know just try to get out there more and and make like small changes

1697
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:30,420
Like go to the library and do your homework there instead of doing it in your room or something like that because you know

1698
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:31,540
There will be people there

1699
02:06:31,540 --> 02:06:33,540
Maybe they'll say something and try to push yourself

1700
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:37,700
Little by little to to say things that maybe you don't feel comfortable saying right now

1701
02:06:37,940 --> 02:06:41,540
Like maybe complimenting somebody or if someone's got a shirt with something that you like

1702
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:46,340
Like if someone's wearing a fucking death note shirt, dude, get in there. Let him know that it's your favorite anime

1703
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:49,460
You know, it's not a joke like that. That is why I wore

1704
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:56,580
You know, I wore anime shirts my entire like young life and I I just looking back at myself

1705
02:06:56,580 --> 02:07:01,860
I know it was that so I would get people to comment on them so I could make friends and and that's a weird thing

1706
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:06,900
People didn't so be the hero who does man. They want to be talked to about that if they're wearing them be empowered

1707
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:12,180
I've never like really worn shirts with like logos and stuff on them because I just generally thought

1708
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,940
That's tacky. I'll just wear a t-shirt that is a color. Yeah, and

1709
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:17,860
Nobody comes up to me

1710
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:22,260
But then that one time at brony con where I was wearing the sweet bro and hella jeff shirt a guy

1711
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:24,740
Was playing as dave. Oh look to me

1712
02:07:25,060 --> 02:07:28,900
He was also very shy and I didn't really we didn't really approach each other

1713
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:31,540
We were saying hey, you're wearing my stuff and I was like, yeah

1714
02:07:32,260 --> 02:07:34,100
my stuff

1715
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:39,460
It was cool is like I'm with you, you know, I'd never really experienced that that much before to expand

1716
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:45,700
That's kind of the magic of cons, you know shared experiences can bloom into friendships, you know to expand on that point

1717
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:49,780
Like don't not just that you should go up and talk to other people if they're wearing something cool

1718
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:53,460
But if someone talks to you make sure you like

1719
02:07:54,180 --> 02:07:56,180
That's true. Be prepared for

1720
02:07:56,420 --> 02:08:03,540
Because for me I I actually get it's shocking how much I get talked to when I'm out and how little I say in response

1721
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:07,140
Because I'm always wearing something fucking weird something that attracts attention

1722
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:12,740
I go around in a bathrobe and everywhere I go people are like, oh man, you look comfortable, you know

1723
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:18,580
And it's like they're being like genuinely friendly and all I ever do is go like, uh, yeah, you know like

1724
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:22,740
There's very few times that I that I actually go and like

1725
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:26,580
Try to make that into a conversation. It's not hard to do

1726
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:31,860
I all the time when I'm out because you know, I eat out like every day and I'll hear people having

1727
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:39,140
I'll hear people having like just conversations all the time, you know

1728
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:41,940
The other day I was at a at a Filipino restaurant

1729
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:45,140
Someone came in and they're just you know, they're waiting for their food to be cooked

1730
02:08:45,140 --> 02:08:49,860
So they just strike up a conversation with the cashier and the two of them are just shooting the shit about whatever

1731
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:54,500
And like if if you talk to someone like that, you know, you might

1732
02:08:55,140 --> 02:09:00,660
Become friends with them some, you know, maybe there'll be you'll realize that they're really fun to talk to you

1733
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:06,020
You know, and I went up to the counter and I was standing there and the guy had the guy at the cash register

1734
02:09:06,020 --> 02:09:09,220
Who I'd just been listening to have this conversation with some, you know, just some guy

1735
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:15,220
I'm looking and there's a 3ds right there with the majora's mask logo on it and I

1736
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:17,940
And I'm thinking to myself

1737
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:19,620
Just say

1738
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:21,300
What are you playing?

1739
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:27,380
You know, what game are you playing? What are you playing? And I kept thinking it and I didn't say anything and then just left

1740
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:29,300
so

1741
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:35,780
Be in that situation and say what game are you playing because you'll probably have a conversation about video games

1742
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:38,500
And maybe you guys like the same video games

1743
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:44,260
Maybe he wants to you know, give you his xbox gamer tag and you guys can fucking play games together and become friends

1744
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:48,260
And then remember that you live in the same town and you can actually go hang out with them, you know

1745
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:52,500
That's what this is. It's constantly be kind of putting out little

1746
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:58,660
Little constantly be extending little olive branches to people or little, you know friendship offerings

1747
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:01,460
And because eventually someone will take it up, you know

1748
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:08,660
Like I mean the the problem with me and a lot of people like me like being shy is that you think about all these things

1749
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:13,220
You know, you try you go to a place where there are people but you don't end up saying anything you just think

1750
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:17,060
Oh, but what if it doesn't work? It's always about like being

1751
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:23,540
Being prepared to look like a complete idiot. I think is the most important thing for for people

1752
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:26,260
It's just like you know that it's not going to be that bad

1753
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:28,020
But you're thinking it is going to be terrible

1754
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:32,500
Well, and you just got to be you got to be prepared for it to be the worst thing that could ever happen

1755
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:39,380
And like listen like I recommend listening to other people's conversations because when you do so what you'll quickly realize is that

1756
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:44,900
Everything everyone talks about is vapid and retarded and nothing you will say is going to sound dumb

1757
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:47,860
Because everything everyone talks about is totally stupid

1758
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:51,940
Like people just get you know, like that guy having the conversation at the counter. It's just like, you know

1759
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:59,620
Oh, yeah, uh, you know, well this trump guy whoo-ho like yep. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, you know like not even saying words

1760
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:04,580
Just like just emitting sounds from your mouth is enough. It's just about the human connection

1761
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:08,500
They're not having a conversation that's meaningful or interesting

1762
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:14,980
They just want to i'm sitting in a place with another human. Let's you know make it not quiet in here

1763
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:17,460
Like that's all people want you don't have to come on

1764
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:20,740
You don't have to be a charming cool smart funny guy

1765
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:24,340
You just have to be willing to talk and you've you're in you know

1766
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:29,300
Just about togetherness and and feeling like you're in the part of the same community as one another

1767
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:33,380
It's so I just want to leave you with with like an action plan here

1768
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:37,620
Just try to change your life a little bit so that you go out in public

1769
02:11:37,780 --> 02:11:40,900
There are people that you could theoretically talk to around you

1770
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:44,660
Uh, and and you know try to make some effort to uh

1771
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:50,580
To reach out to them in in whatever small way that that you can and this I want to emphasize this really is a skill set

1772

What the hell is wrong with me i'm supposed to be

1800
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:57,780
Making money

02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:05,460
Things that the people

Artistic genius. That's what they came for instead. I'm tweeting

Hashtag repeating

That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling

1808
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:29,780

Being a genius
