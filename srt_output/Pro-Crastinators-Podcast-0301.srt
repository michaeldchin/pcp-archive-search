1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh yeah, it's pretty based, alright.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, but I do plan on watching that documentary, or is it a behind the scenes thing?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's a behind the scenes, I guess you could call it a documentary, it doesn't really have a story or anything.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's documentary style footage in a sequence.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to it, it's always interesting to see pre-gamers tavern PCP lore.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, I don't know, do you want to just start recording like now, just go?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I've already been recording.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, well I had Craig, but now I'm recording. Did you watch the doc Gibb?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I caught some of it while I was premiering, yes.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I was there, I was there the whole time in the chat.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, let's sync real quick, on the count of three, say sync, one, two, three, sync, sync, one, two, three, sync.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Right, we're talking about, right until the documentary just came out yesterday, I put it out, it's up.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The premiere was fun, there was like a hundred people in the chat, it was a good time.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What else is there to say about Riot Country?

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, the commentary, Gibb, you and me did the commentary, and I think we...

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I liked our conversation while we were commentating that...

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I thought we had some good insights and some good stuff to say about the goings on.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It was nice to watch and remember, even if it was bittersweet at points.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's very bittersweet, it really is, because it...

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, I'd imagine so.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It was, I should mention, right, the commentary track is for patrons, it's in the master post, it's listed as a bonus episode on the Patreon,

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so you can get our commentary of the uncut version with all the language intact.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You mean it's a PCP patron?

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, where else?

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Anyway.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't know, I thought it was going to be the Trixie patron.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Never, never!

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I lost patron, I thought.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Right, because it was very fun at the time, and it's like, oh, the good old days, the golden age, whatever you want to call it.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And it's also the like, oh, remember how the people used to talk about PCPHQ?

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, this was going to be the future, this was going to be forever.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What happened?

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What happened, man?

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And now look at us, scattered to the winds, broken on the rocks.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But when you say people, you really mean Trixie mostly, right?

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mostly.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The idea that we might all...

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And the PCP was never like each individual person's main thing, it was all just sort of a side thing that we were doing in conjunction with our own creative endeavours.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So like we're scattered to the winds in podcast world, but like we're doing stuff.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In hindsight, it's a little silly, like the fact that like, you know, like the fact that me and D'Vu did in fact move into Trixie's house, the three of us live there and the practical benefits of that were minimal, right?

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because like, D'Vu doesn't need to live in the same house to edit the videos, I didn't need to live in the same house to do nothing related at all, right?

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, I think she...

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Nevertheless, this idea of the HQ persisted.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, I think she mentioned in one of her videos that you took forever to do her art stuff.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, she mentioned that in that one video, she complains that like, Ben Saint, I had to pay Ben Saint to do art for me and he took a while to do it, whereas Mint Salad draws whatever stupid shit I tell her to for free.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
My new friends just work for me for free.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The thing she neglects to mention in that is that she didn't pay me up front, she said she wanted the art, the channel art, and then I did take a while to do it, but I didn't get paid until after I had done it, so whatever.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's true though, I did take a while.

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It sounds to me like you're a worse Mint Salad.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Aren't we all just a worse Mint Salad in our own way?

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's a good point.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Anyway, the PCPHQ is a bit, in hindsight, it's kind of a silly idea, but the idea persisted and it was a nice thought for a while.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It was a cool idea.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I feel like it was almost entirely watching Red Letter Media and being like, wouldn't it be cool to just hang out in a place where you make videos?

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And also the Game Grumps Super Studio where they had all that Let's Play stuff in their recording room and they're like in walls of games and Amiibo figures and like, dang, that's the dream.

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's really just like, what if we had an office space?

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That would be it.

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What if we...

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Lots of stuff.

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That basically is the dream.

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What if we had an office space?

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It was the set.

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It was the plebenweeb set.

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I feel like it was the actual draw of PCPHQ, the set that we all used to do the lectures and stuff in.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I think Victor built it.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's the Red Letter Media set, but then also on top of that, she had the idea like, well, everyone should move into my house.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Everyone should move into my parents' house with me.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
My parents gave me this house to live in.

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Everyone's just moving here and then we'll be like the PCP, but they're all in one house.

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And then that didn't work.

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The parents eventually were like, okay, we actually are selling on that house.

76
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You gotta move.

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And he's like, hmm, well, okay, maybe we can't all live in the same house, but we can all live in Boston, right?

78
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We can all live in the same area of Boston, but then, you know...

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And then we sort of did, but then still nothing happened.

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like me and Munchy and Tom and Trixie and...

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I think that's it.

82
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We did all live in Boston eventually, but we still didn't do anything.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And again, it's like, what benefit does being geographically near each other really give to the specific stuff we're doing?

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We're not even really working together on anything anymore.

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Maybe we could have if we'd done another...

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, I would imagine the main benefit would be that you could do more lectures.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, yeah, maybe, possibly.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And you wouldn't have to organize kickstarters to meet like the Radcon stuff.

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, I feel like that was part of the pitch.

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, you know what?

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's true.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We don't have to spend a lot of money flying people around.

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's good.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That actually is true.

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Not for day-to-day stuff, but for what would have been stuff we would do at a Radcon.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, that's true.

97
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sure.

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, it would have been interesting if the lectures just became a regular thing you did as opposed to just like a yearly or every couple of years kind of thing.

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Especially since the lectures were real popular.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They were real popular.

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They were real popular.

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's a bit of a conundrum, actually, because they were real popular.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Some of the most popular stuff any of us ever did.

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But we could only do them together as a group.

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So we only did them at Radcons, and now the group is shattered.

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I guess there's nothing in theory stopping us from doing something like that on our own, but who would we do it with?

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's no equivalent group.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I guess it would be possible to put one together.

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Maybe you could put one together with all the guests you've been having.

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I saw actually a comment.

111
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There was a comment left on one of the PCP videos.

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't remember which one.

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It said, Radcon 5 stretch goals should be to get Cybershell and Gamerstaven in person at Radcon.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So I guess that's an idea.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, Cybershell live.

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where do you live, Gamerstaven?

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I think Cybershell lives in like Washington, Seattle or something.

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I was going to say that.

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I have the same sense, and I don't know where I got it.

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So that's probably true.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't you live in the Midwest or one of the Dakotas?

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No, I live on the East Coast.

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's just say I live to the south of where you live.

124
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

125
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Alright, fair enough.

126
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Would not be unfeasible, I guess.

127
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I guess it wouldn't be impossible.

128
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm going to have to talk to everyone about it.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Anything is impossible if you put your mind to it.

130
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Sure.

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I want to say Radcon, but I said Gamerstaven.

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Radcon 5 with you, me, Cybershell, Oblivionfall, Gamerstaven,

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Cheesy Manfredo, Simsie, I don't know.

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Tectonic Improv, Crack, the gang's all here.

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, that's basically everybody.

136
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The Merlogic, of course.

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We could get Merlogic as like a trap and then kill him.

138
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh yeah, I forgot about that guy actually, but I just remembered who he is.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We could get some baseball bands.

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It'll be like the big video that we make.

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, the new Handboy Winter War will just be us actually killing Merlogic in real life.

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
In Minecraft.

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was talking about, there's a tweet that said the skeletons are not really scary,

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but they're kind of used in video games a lot.

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It would be a lot scarier if like a nervous system just walked up to you without any bones or anything.

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Like in Watchmen.

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Have you read Watchmen?

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah, I've seen the film where they take that for a second.

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, I watched a movie.

151
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh yeah, I guess it happens in the movie too.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's just like one scene of when Dr. Manhattan is trying to reconstruct himself

153
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and for a minute he comes back and he's just a brain and nervous system.

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I saw a picture of a person's nervous, I assume a real person's nervous system

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
like displayed in like a museum or whatever.

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It was preserved and it was like, it was sort of like a rayed out like held up

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
in like a position that it would be in the human body, but it was just the nervous system.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So like brain up top, spine coming down, tendrils like coming down the arms and legs.

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And it's like that's your whole like mind and stuff in your body.

160
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Just take the rest of it away.

161
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Scientific like illustrations and diagrams of the human body, the central nervous system,

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the blood vessels, capillaries, the fucking arteries and stuff and the skull

163
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and those like sort of medical, here's how to learn about skeletons, the human body books.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That stuff's like real body horror.

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know why people think they need like Junji Ito or like like scary things

166
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
when the real actual stuff is the stuff that makes me faint.

167
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I open up a thing and I see like a liver and it's like this is what a liver looks like

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
if you sliced it in half, I'm like, oh no.

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why would you do that?

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The scariest things were in us all along.

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't believe we're so fucked up.

172
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The scariest thing is just the horror of your own existence and how fragile it is

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and how like a simple, such a small disruption to one's physical body

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
will just end your pitiful existence.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Something as flimsy as like a single bullet that just happens to pass like in one eye socket

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and exit the back of your skull.

177
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Something as small and random and pointless as that can just kill you.

178
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I mean, if you pick up any given thing anywhere near you,

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
you could probably turn it into a weapon that can like kill you.

180
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I think about this, how easy, how many forces are arrayed around us at all times

181
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
that could kill us?

182
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like for just my go-to example, trains go everywhere.

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They're so big and if one day you ever happened to be in the path of a train

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
as it was going, you would be torn to shreds in an instant.

185
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I live on the first floor of my apartment building.

186
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's kind of a big brick building.

187
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Think of how heavy that building is if something gave out.

188
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There's so much potential energy stored in the bricks of this building.

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If it came down on me, I would be crushed and smothered

190
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and smeared across my floor underneath all of that.

191
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Another one is outlets, electrical outlets.

192
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The connection in an electrical outlet represents an electric potential drop

193
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that is akin to a cliff that you could walk through in terms of potential energy.

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If you just stuck the right thing in there, or if you just touched it in the wrong way,

195
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
then suddenly that potential energy would release and go through you

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and just burn you to a fucking crisp.

197
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You don't have the super safety plugs.

198
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I thought we do have the super safety plugs.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Maybe you do have some of them.

200
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You have the shitty ones.

201
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No, no, no. We've got the three-pronged plug.

202
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We've got three pronged plugs.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Well, you copied us then because we came up with it first.

204
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And I say we because I want to assume the smarts of people

205
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
who are somewhat generally associated with me by nationality.

206
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And I did it, actually. It was me.

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The glory of the British race.

208
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You want to bask in your racial heritage.

209
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's not the only thing that Americans copied from the British.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Quite a lot of those things, too.

211
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Transphobia.

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You know, slavery?

213
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, of course, slavery.

214
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The British didn't really do slavery.

215
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No, we did slavery all over the place.

216
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We did slavery better than everyone else.

217
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We were the best at slavery.

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You didn't really have like slaves in England, though.

219
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You kind of traded them elsewhere.

220
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We made a lot of money as a country by occupying foreign lands

221
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and taking their people and using them as slaves to sell to other places.

222
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It was really fucked up.

223
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
British Empire, one of the worst.

224
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What was it like?

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You get slaves in Africa, and then you trade them in the Caribbean

226
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
for molasses or rum or something, and then you trade...

227
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There's a triangle, right?

228
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Sugar and...

229
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Sugar and rum and stuff.

230
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Slave sugar, rum. Slave sugar, rum.

231
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And you trade in a big triangle.

232
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And I think the triangle...

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The triangle was like slaves from Africa to the Caribbean

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and sugar from the plantations back to the UK

235
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
where sugar is hard to make.

236
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And then from the UK to Africa, weapons to sell to African tribes

237
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
in exchange for people.

238
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I think that's the general idea.

239
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It sounds like capitalism to me.

240
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah, of course it was.

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I saw a Stefan Molyneux tweet that I had never seen before.

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It was just a screenshot of it.

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It was the most insane thing I had ever seen.

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The tweet was like...

245
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Okay, if I remember correctly, it was like,

246
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
who's worse, the drug user or the drug dealer?

247
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
In the context of slavery, whites were the users, blacks were the dealers.

248
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay.

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's an interesting way of looking at it.

250
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I guess he's probably specifically...

251
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He's probably specifically referring to the fact that

252
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
we did trade weapons and rum

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and whatever other commodities to the tribes in it.

254
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We did trade for the slaves.

255
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Some of them were just kidnapped, but there was trade.

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We did obtain them.

257
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Maybe that's what he means. He means specifically that.

258
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We bought the slaves in some capacity.

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But we also had military might in order to take them if we wanted to anyway.

260
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Right. That's true.

261
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And also in this metaphor...

262
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It is interesting when you think about it.

263
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In this metaphor, the black people are also...

264
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They are also the drugs being smoked, I guess.

265
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Which kind of muddies the metaphor a little bit.

266
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's like if the dealer was dealing you the drugs,

267
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the drugs they're selling you are cutting off their own arms and body parts

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and giving them to you.

269
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And that's the deal.

270
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And then you're asked, what do you think about that?

271
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And you're like, I don't get it.

272
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You say...

273
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Who's the real villain?

274
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I say, chopping my arm off.

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's probably best not to think about it.

276
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's how these things work, right?

277
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You just have to accept them without thinking about them too deeply.

278
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's what I say about roles in society and colonialism.

279
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because as soon as you start thinking about it, it kind of doesn't hold up.

280
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I just thought that was interesting.

281
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Very funny.

282
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So is that everything you wanted to say about the documentary?

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, let me think if there's anything else to say about that.

284
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Just the footage, it's not a documentary.

285
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's sort of a documentary.

286
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's not a very structured one, but I mean it is one.

287
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It doesn't have enough of a narration through line.

288
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like every so often Victor will point the camera at somebody and ask,

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
so what are we doing today?

290
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And then we would say it and it would usually be not that interesting

291
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
until the Pleeb and the Weeb starts and then the documentary ends

292
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
because Victor was busy and he couldn't film anything.

293
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, it ends because Pleeb and the Weeb started in earnest

294
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and Victor was always filming that and he was no longer around.

295
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Is the documentary of the fucking around leading up to Radcon 2 basically?

296
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah.

297
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Which is the most memorable part for me.

298
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I can't even really remember what happened day to day.

299
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't know how many days it was, I guess that's one of the things.

300
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I could look at my old vlogs because I remember making a vlog

301
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
at least of Radcon 1 where I was trying to make sense of everything

302
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
because there was a lot of stuff going on.

303
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It did look like a lot of fun.

304
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I watched some of the episodes of the Pleeb and the Weeb and not all of them

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and the main one that I keep remembering is the one with Munchy

306
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and Victor B stuff and the N-word counter.

307
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Munchy, I'm sure he hates that.

308
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't remember if he said that outright.

309
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But he was so embarrassed of how he was acting.

310
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
When I made the Blu-rays, I think,

311
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
okay, I saw those guys a little while ago and there were some people visiting

312
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and I gave some people had bought, they had back the Kickstarter.

313
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And I was like, hey, since you're in town, here's your Blu-rays, LeMau.

314
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And they were like, lol, cool.

315
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And someone suggested like, hey, let's put on the Blu-rays.

316
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's put on Pleeb and the Weeb.

317
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And Munchy was like, I don't want to see my episode.

318
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No, he does not like it at all.

319
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Honestly, I can't really blame him.

320
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We were going through, we watched through the uncut version and it's funny.

321
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Like, he's not the only one, he's not the only one, but he does do it a bunch of times.

322
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He makes these, the remarks are, they're obviously meant to be uncomfortable.

323
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Like they're meant to be like off-putting on purpose and everyone laughs.

324
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Everybody always laughs whenever he says it.

325
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Because it's shock humor.

326
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We all have a good laugh, but it's shock humor and we all laugh.

327
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But I think sometimes more than others, it's an uncomfortable laughter.

328
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But I think that was the point, right?

329
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I certainly laughed.

330
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's kind of weird, but it's pretty funny.

331
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah, so it was...

332
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I like the kind of weird interview with Jesse at the beginning of that episode

333
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and he keeps cutting back to that interview about it.

334
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh, you're talking about the actual Pleeb and Weeb episode?

335
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah.

336
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I haven't rewatched it.

337
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The only thing I remember of that one is that Munchy is so full of energy and so talkative

338
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and he starts pacing around the room just talking while Trixie and Jesse are sitting in their seats

339
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and they are sort of slumping down and being like,

340
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I remember him being...

341
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't know what to do anymore.

342
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Munchy's completely bowled us over.

343
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah.

344
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah, I remember him being like just beside himself about like,

345
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I can't believe we're watching Kirby Flight to the Finish.

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
My favorite show.

347
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah.

348
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, he's definitely a big ball of energy.

349
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You know, he's a pretty...

350
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I think he's a pretty talented performance artist and he got like a lot better since that time.

351
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah.

352
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So he's pretty cool.

353
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
He's a funny guy.

354
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He's a cool guy.

355
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I guess I don't really have that much else to say other than we did have a lot to say during the comment...

356
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I won't rehash everything that we brought up during the commentary.

357
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If you're a patron, check out the commentary track.

358
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I think it's cool.

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That's it.

360
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What else?

361
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I guess we already...

362
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I guess you probably don't want...

363
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You probably don't want to discuss the conversation we just had.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No.

365
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay.

366
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll say what.

367
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We did have a talk in...

368
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Nate wanted to talk about the Blu-ray situation, which is fine.

369
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We had a little pow-wow.

370
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I think he called it a pow-wow.

371
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And Jesse actually showed up, which I was surprised about.

372
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That never happens.

373
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But we did get into it, which is fine.

374
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And we've reached some sort of agreement about it, I think.

375
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Which is fine, I guess.

376
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But we don't need to get into the specifics of it.

377
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But that's an interesting thing that happened, I guess.

378
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't know.

379
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So I guess everybody is happy after all?

380
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh, yes. Everybody's ecstatic.

381
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Jumping over with joy over the moon.

382
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Everybody's over the moon about how everything has shaken out.

383
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I couldn't be happier.

384
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's good to hear.

385
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Instead of that, Ben, talk about your game and comic.

386
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
The Slame Phantom's Revenge.

387
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well, sure.

388
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I've been drawing...

389
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I think I have 35 pages drawn of...

390
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Right, because Phantom's Revenge, the game I made for a year,

391
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I spent a year making it, that is done.

392
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It is out for my patrons, not PCP patrons,

393
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
patreon.com slash ben saint patrons.

394
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
My patrons have played it.

395
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Oh, really funny...

396
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Okay, remind me to say the funny thing that happened with the game.

397
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You know what? I'll make a note.

398
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm going to make a note right here, so I don't remember.

399
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Forget it.

400
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Marriage. The note is marriage.

401
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So the game goes with the comic, so I've been drawing the comic.

402
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I need to draw...

403
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Slime and Punishment ended with the video called S. Revert,

404
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
which was sort of the S. Cascade of Slime and Punishment.

405
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And now there's some...

406
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And now I have to do the Act 6.

407
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Everybody's favorite.

408
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
No, it's much shorter than that.

409
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I have to do just a little bit of story to explain what happens right after that,

410
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
to get Phantom from there to the game,

411
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and then I have to draw what happens after the game and the end of the comic.

412
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So I am currently...

413
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I've drawn about 34 panels,

414
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and he is most of the way from there to where the game happens.

415
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I think I probably have to draw maybe like eight more.

416
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So I meant to do that yesterday,

417
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
but I ended up spending a lot of my day doing a PCP channel

418
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and red con documentary related stuff.

419
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But oh well.

420
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So yeah, I've been drawing the comic.

421
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
That's basically all I've been doing this past week or so.

422
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So the game is finished?

423
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, the game is finished.

424
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
On my Patreon, the last post,

425
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
there's all the different versions of the game that I released.

426
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
There's the first version,

427
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
which is...

428
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Well, there's an old post with the demo,

429
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and then there's three versions of the game that have more and more features added.

430
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And actually, the final game, as I will eventually do the full release,

431
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
does have a few graphical changes.

432
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Specifically, I added them.

433
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I made it so that the damage numbers change size,

434
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and they shake depending on how much damage is dealt.

435
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I feel like it makes it a little more impactful,

436
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
but it's purely a visual change.

437
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Other than that, the game as it is on my Patreon right now is the final game.

438
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But a really funny...

439
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
What are you waiting on for the final release until you finish all the comics?

440
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, the comic.

441
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And you worked on the game entirely by yourself,

442
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
or did you have any help on it?

443
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, I did it all myself, except for...

444
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I stole some assets from other games.

445
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Just a few...

446
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The only sprites that I took were explosions sprites, animations from Secret of Mana.

447
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I stole all the music from...

448
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I think we talked about this because I was looking for a game to get music from.

449
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The game I ended up settling on was Front Mission 2 Gun Hazard.

450
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I took all the music.

451
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
That's pretty cool.

452
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, like I said, I was vaguely familiar with the Front Mission series.

453
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I had played Front Mission 3, and I had liked it as a kid.

454
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I had never played Gun Hazard, but I like the music from it a lot.

455
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I stole some sound effects.

456
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I used a couple sound effects.

457
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I made some myself, like the sound of a soda can being thrown on the ground.

458
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I just did that myself.

459
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
The phantom's voice sounds, like when he says stuff and when he burps and stuff,

460
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
that's just me, that's just recordings of me.

461
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I got some sounds from YouTube, like sounds of horses galloping,

462
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
sounds of a sword being drawn and sheathed were from YouTube.

463
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Some sounds were from Mega Man X, Secret of Mana,

464
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and Mario RPG for spell sound effects and stuff.

465
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Menu sound effects.

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's pretty cool.

467
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm going to get a lot of references when I play it.

468
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You probably will, yeah.

469
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's mostly those three games.

470
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Four games.

471
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The last feature that I added between versions 2 and 3 was weapon marriage.

472
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I added the ability to anoint to your weapon with a podron to increase your weapon skill,

473
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
and when you increase it high enough, you can marry your weapon,

474
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
which increases your skill even further.

475
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And when you get married to your weapon, there's a little like wedding ceremony.

476
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And I was looking for...

477
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That's nice.

478
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, it's lovely.

479
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Phantom Horn finally ties the knot.

480
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
No more migtail life for him.

481
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But he...

482
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I was looking for a pixel, like a 16-bit sounding version of the wedding march.

483
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

484
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And I was looking around and the only one I could find, or the first one I could find,

485
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
was from a game called Libble Rebel,

486
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
which I had just happened to hear of recently,

487
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
just because Tim Rogers goes on a long aside about Libble Rebel in action button reviews Pac-Man.

488
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And I was just like, wow, what a coincidence that this game I'd never heard of before,

489
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
but only recently heard a bunch about.

490
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This just happens to be the easiest, the most readily available 16-bit wedding march sound.

491
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What system is that game for?

492
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I believe it's on the Super Nintendo.

493
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That's interesting, I never heard of it.

494
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And I'm kind of the Super Nintendo expert.

495
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It might have not been released outside of Japan?

496
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I mean, I'd never heard of it.

497
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm not like an expert, but I'm a big Super Nintendo fan.

498
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And I'd also never heard of it.

499
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I would have thought of trying to check the Harvest Moon games for a sound effect like that,

500
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
but I don't think any of them actually do have that.

501
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It would make sense if they did, though.

502
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I have no idea why it's in Libble Rebel.

503
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I haven't played it.

504
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Libble Rebel is a game about controlling a line and drawing a rope around posts

505
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and surrounding little monsters on a field with a rope.

506
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And I don't know why there's a wedding in Libble Rebel.

507
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You're tying the knot.

508
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You're trying to ensnare them into a relationship.

509
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You know what they say?

510
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
They say that marriage is kind of like a prison.

511
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And life...

512
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
What was that great quote by that philosopher?

513
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Life is like a box of chocolates.

514
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
No, I mean, life is a cage and death is a key.

515
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
That's what I meant.

516
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It's funny.

517
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
In Phantom's Revenge, because the mechanics are based on Endless War,

518
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I used in-game text from Endless War when you use the data command to get the data on yourself,

519
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
or on Virginia, or when you use...

520
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, when you get text responses from Endless War,

521
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
like when you try to attack but you don't have enough slime, for example,

522
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I used the same quotes that are in Endless War when you try to do those things.

523
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And the ones related to marriage are all very cynical.

524
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's very funny. I think Munchy wrote them, which is funny.

525
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But they're all about how when you get married,

526
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
it's all kind of regretful and resentful of how the good old days have passed.

527
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Like now, we've settled into our boring married life or whatever.

528
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That's amazing attention to detail.

529
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah, I didn't end up implementing weapon divorce,

530
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because how much is it really necessary?

531
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Like, there would be no possible strategic value to getting weapon divorced in the game.

532
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So I was like, ah, fuck it.

533
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So I didn't add divorce to the game.

534
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The divorce ones are like, to go through the...

535
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You have to endure all this shit about how marriage is a scam and stuff,

536
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
if you want to get weapon married and weapon divorced.

537
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You have to go to the dojo.

538
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Who hurt Endless War?

539
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I bent the rules a little bit, because in Endless War...

540
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Endless War's the one who says it all the time.

541
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Endless War was married.

542
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah, he...

543
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You know, there's...

544
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We were talking about in the last art contest, Matt brought this up.

545
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
We were judging Endless War art entries,

546
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and Matt was reminiscing about a post that we both remembered.

547
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It was drawn by someone named Gabe, who has since deleted all of his social media posts

548
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and all of his art.

549
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
He used to be a big Endless War artist.

550
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
He did a lot of great stuff.

551
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And apparently a lot of it's deleted now, for he had one of these...

552
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
He had one of these episodes that so many people seem to be prone to,

553
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
where you just say, everything I ever did needs to be destroyed,

554
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and you just like leave the internet forever and delete everything for some reason.

555
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And he did that, as many people do.

556
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But there was a comic about Endless War and this spirit woman in space.

557
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It was supposed to be a prequel.

558
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It was before...

559
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh, yeah.

560
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It wasn't a factual history.

561
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It was something like a little Kirby.

562
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It was like a what if.

563
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It was someone telling a story.

564
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The little Kirby before they had a real character design.

565
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And they made a comic.

566
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah.

567
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I didn't know that was deleted.

568
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That's pretty good.

569
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It was good.

570
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We all remembered it fondly.

571
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And it might be that the only record of it that exists now

572
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
might be in that art contest, in the lore contest,

573
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
where we judged it as a contest entry.

574
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That might be the only place to see it.

575
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I think the idea in the end was it was...

576
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
In the end, it's framed as Gabe just like...

577
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
He's like drunk and he's like telling the story at a bar or whatever.

578
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So like who knows if it's true or not.

579
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But supposedly like this spirit woman is like Gabe's mom.

580
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Because Gabe is like this...

581
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
He's like a Kirby star child from space, you know?

582
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So he's this cosmic...

583
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Endless War and this spirit woman are like these two like cosmic entities

584
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
that like met in space and Endless War came to Earth.

585
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Got divorced and came to Earth afterwards.

586
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So yeah, maybe that's why.

587
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Maybe that's why Endless War is so bitter about marriage.

588
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Because it didn't work out with what's her name.

589
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Well you know what they say, marriage is an endless war.

590
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I hear that every day in my heart.

591
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You hear that endlessly.

592
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Kind of like a war.

593
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What was...

594
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
What was...

595
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
What were we talking about?

596
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
How did I get on this?

597
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh, the thing that I wanted to say, a funny thing was...

598
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I had added in the weapon marriage system

599
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and the weapon skill system, the anointing and the marriage.

600
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
They changed your weapon skill.

601
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So they do increase your weapon damage.

602
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And so it was an open question about whether it could be worth it to...

603
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Do you spend those podrans leveling up so you can then get married

604
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and get that damage boost from the weapon skill increase,

605
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
or is it better to keep the podrans so you can crunch them

606
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
to get the slime from them and also increase your level,

607
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
which does increase your damage,

608
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
but also that increases the cost of your attack.

609
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So it's a bit of a trade-off with leveling up as well.

610
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Also, leveling up is sort of like a hidden mechanic.

611
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Like nothing in the game tells you that you can level up.

612
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You sort of have to like find it yourself,

613
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
but now everyone listening knows that now.

614
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Actually, I think Chrono Cross did something like that.

615
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
In Chrono Cross, you don't see what level your characters are.

616
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
They just gain stats every once in a while.

617
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Really?

618
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And it's not extremely obvious what increases your stats.

619
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I mean, if you look at guides online, you can eventually figure it out,

620
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
but in the game itself, it just seems totally random.

621
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, I ended up taking information out of the game.

622
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Before, I had it so that when you beat the game

623
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
in any of the prior versions,

624
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
you would get an end screen that would display a bunch of information.

625
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And that information was useful for me.

626
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I wanted to know how many times were people leveling up,

627
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
where were they leveling up,

628
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
how many times were they attacking,

629
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
how many times were they being attacked,

630
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
how much slime were they entering the final room with when they won.

631
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So that was info for me.

632
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And then for the final version,

633
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
most of that stuff is not interesting to the player.

634
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I think the player would care about certain...

635
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
What's the word I'm looking for?

636
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Game state things?

637
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Whether Phantom's horn broke or stayed intact,

638
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
whether Virginia was killed or stayed alive,

639
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
whether you ended the game married,

640
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and your stats...

641
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Not what level you were, that's not really important.

642
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It doesn't really matter in terms of your state at the end of the game.

643
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But I added stock trading.

644
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So there's a mechanic that's totally unrelated to everything else in the game.

645
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It means absolutely nothing, it doesn't interact with anything else.

646
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But you can trade stocks in every room,

647
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and then in between rooms, the stock values will fluctuate

648
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
according to a little routine that I came up with,

649
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
which may or may not be possible to game for maximum profits.

650
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
A little dancing routine, I imagine.

651
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And so at the end of the game, it tells you your net worth.

652
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Like how much money did you make?

653
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You can find out if you become Jeff Bezos at the end.

654
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But it was an open question whether getting married was useful at all.

655
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And I tested it out, and I decided,

656
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
okay, I actually think that spending the two potorins to anoint your weapon twice

657
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
and then getting married...

658
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Spending those two potorins is actually too costly,

659
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and it actually makes it impossible to...

660
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Well, not to win, but to get the good ending,

661
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
because there are things you can do that will let you win,

662
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
but will give you the bad ending.

663
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So it's actually impossible to win and get the good ending and get married.

664
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And then Prince Isolation, the same...

665
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But just like real life.

666
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Yes, and honestly, I was okay with it.

667
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But then Prince Isolation, this is the same guy who sent that voicemail the other week

668
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
asking me to explain who Cold Corona is, which is very funny.

669
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
He tested the game out, and he just completely, at random,

670
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I think just lucked into a combination of moves,

671
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and strategy that actually...

672
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
He found the one way you can actually get married and win and get the good ending,

673
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
which we had all thought was impossible, but he just found it at random.

674
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And I was like, yes, yes, it's strategic depth.

675
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And actually, it's funny because doing so involves making what I had already considered

676
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
to be the optimal play in a situation where you have decided

677
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
that you are going to sacrifice Virginia to preserve your own...

678
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Your health, to preserve your slime.

679
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And if you do it...

680
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If you make that play that I was aware of as being statistically optimal,

681
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
if you make that play, it actually does work.

682
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You can get to the end and you have...

683
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And Virginia has been destroyed,

684
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
or not like destroyed, destroyed, but she's been reduced to her heart.

685
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And then you can get to the end and you do have just enough that you can eke it out.

686
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And if you spent the potions getting married, but it's okay,

687
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
you have just enough that you can beat the final boss.

688
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's always cool, I'd imagine, if you're a game creator,

689
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
to find out when the people playing your game come up with strategies

690
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
you never thought was possible.

691
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I was so excited.

692
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I was so excited to learn that the possibility of space in the game

693
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
was just a little bit wider than I had even realized.

694
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Just a tiny little bit.

695
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
There were a couple of new options in there.

696
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I think maybe, I'm not sure if this is the case,

697
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
but I think for Smash Bros. Melee,

698
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I think maybe the creators didn't know you could wave dash.

699
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah.

700
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And then that completely changed the entire game.

701
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I don't really understand what wave dashing is.

702
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I mean, I've heard of it.

703
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I don't really know how it works, but I know that...

704
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh, it's when you go with the controller.

705
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I know that Melee is full of shit that the devs didn't intend.

706
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's kind of a broken game, but that's what makes it...

707
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It's like there's a whole other game.

708
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
There's a whole other game there that developers had no idea about.

709
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

710
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And that's what people have been playing all these years,

711
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
basically, is that other game.

712
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You know what?

713
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm willing to admit that Phantom's Revenge is not as strategically deep,

714
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and it does not have as many systems interacting

715
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
to create beautiful, spiraling, intricate webs

716
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
of potential player interactions as Smash Bros. Melee.

717
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That's just a small game, you know, so...

719
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yeah.

720
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I couldn't match Nintendo.

721
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Maybe next time.

722
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I have to say, as somebody who has tried making a game in the past,

723
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
it's pretty impressive you did most of this yourself.

724
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I watched a tutorial.

725
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I found some tutorials from a guy called Game Maker Rob on YouTube.

726
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
He had...

727
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Because I knew that I wanted it to be...

728
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I wanted it to be built as like a menu-based JRPG turn-based combat,

729
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
so I looked up some tutorials and I spent...

730
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I think it took me like a week or so to follow this guy's tutorials

731
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
to build a menu system.

732
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And it's funny, at the time I was like so confused,

733
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
but I was just like, I'm just gonna follow the steps,

734
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm just gonna follow the steps and like figure it out

735
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
and like hopefully when it's done,

736
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
when I've followed all the steps, I'll have something that I can use

737
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and I don't need to know how it works.

738
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
As long as it works, I can build on top of it.

739
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And now looking back, I'm like...

740
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I was thinking about this on the bus the other day.

741
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I do feel confident now.

742
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I didn't set out to learn anything.

743
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I hate learning.

744
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But I do think that if I tried to now,

745
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I could just do what he did like off the top of my head.

746
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Like the way...

747
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
At the time, the way that he was setting up the menu system,

748
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I was like, why is he doing that?

749
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I have no idea.

750
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Whatever, I'll just copy it.

751
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But now I'm like, oh yeah, I understand.

752
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You had to set up like the way the in-game object

753
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
sets its states.

754
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And basically the menu is a collection of states

755
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
that tell you what is the menu active,

756
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
which state of the menu or which sub-menu are you currently in.

757
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And it draws the options here and there and wherever.

758
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And I understand it all and I could do it.

759
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I could do what he did now

760
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
because I've worked with that fucking thing for like a year.

761
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I probably could have at some point gone back in

762
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and remade it from scratch

763
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
and maybe it would have been better and easier to work with.

764
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Instead, I just kept the like kind of fucked up and broken

765
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
and not broken, but messy,

766
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
probably needlessly complicated menu

767
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
that he had like basically given me in his tutorials.

768
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It has all these like unnecessary states

769
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and these unnecessary options that are just not available.

770
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Like they're in there.

771
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Like there is a magic menu in the game

772
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
that just has like two spells that don't do anything.

773
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Like that is in the code.

774
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It's just not accessible

775
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
because that was how that was what the tutorial told me to put there.

776
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Maybe with all the stuff you've learned,

777
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
you can rebuild the game and make a sequel,

778
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
you know, instead of actually rebuilding the first game.

779
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I think even with real developers,

780
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that's a lot of what happens.

781
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
They make a game, they learn a lot from the experience.

782
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And then when they rebuild everything,

783
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
they just make a sequel that's better in every way.

784
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I wouldn't make a sequel

785
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
because Phantom's story is,

786
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
well, I mean, I guess there could be more stories

787
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
with Phantom Horn in New Los Angeles City.

788
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It wouldn't be impossible, but like,

789
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the story I wanted to tell with him is over.

790
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This is the end.

791
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
It could be like a spiritual successor kind of gameplay sequel.

792
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
If I made another game.

793
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
If I made another game, I would,

794
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I probably wouldn't even use,

795
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I might use some pieces.

796
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Actually, I used some pieces of that old, the champion game

797
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
that I made, like the text boxes in Phantom's Revenge are,

798
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
they use a lot of the same assets

799
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and they're built of the same code that I used

800
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
to make the text boxes in the champion game.

801
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
With some added stuff, like I added code in there

802
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
to make it so that the text does not like,

803
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
type out like half a word before realizing

804
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
that it doesn't fit on the line

805
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and then it jumps the word down to the new line.

806
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
That's actually a fairly common issue I see

807
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
with a lot of indie games.

808
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It, yeah.

809
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
My, the early versions of my game have that in there

810
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and I always intended to fix it.

811
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I was just, I didn't really know how

812
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and I was like, whatever, this isn't the final version.

813
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Fuck it.

814
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
When I eventually got around to like,

815
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
okay, final version,

816
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
actually got to fix this like shitty text wrapping issue.

817
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It actually wasn't like that hard.

818
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Maybe it took me like a day.

819
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It was funny.

820
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Crack, I think Crack was complaining at me

821
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
about the text wrapping issue and I was like,

822
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I know, I know, I just, I haven't gotten around to it.

823
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I know it looks ugly.

824
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And then I did it and it worked.

825
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And he, and then later he sent me a video,

826
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
or no, he sent me a tweet thread from some code person

827
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
who was like, a big problem in indie games text shit

828
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
is that it looks like shit in this particular way

829
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and it was like, you know, the line,

830
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
the word jumps midline.

831
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And the thread was like, here's how to solve it.

832
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And it went through like a very particular step

833
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
of like, first you do this, then you do this,

834
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
then you do this, and that solves the issue.

835
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And I looked at it and I was like,

836
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
and it made me really mad

837
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
because the solution that they gave was way worse than mine.

838
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But they presented like, this is how you solve it.

839
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's like, and I'm like, see,

840
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I feel like if you know anything,

841
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
if you know what you're doing at all,

842
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
you don't need someone to tell you, here's how to do it.

843
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You just have to think about it for like a little bit

844
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and come up with something

845
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and you can just fucking come up with something.

846
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And that's what I did.

847
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And it was so much better.

848
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
This person's solution involved like taking every,

849
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
you would take the text string you wanted to write

850
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and then you would break it up into words

851
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and then you would break up every word into like letters

852
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
and then it would do like a word count

853
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and it would create like a new string

854
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
out of every individual letter

855
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
and then it would add the strings together

856
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
until it exceeded some value.

857
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And then it would, mine doesn't do that.

858
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Mine just like every time the string writes a space,

859
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
it counts characters until the next space

860
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
and then it adds that number to a value in the text box code

861
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and it compares like, okay, will this exceed the horizontal space?

862
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
If so, insert a line break into the string

863
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and then continue writing, otherwise continue writing

864
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
without adding a line break.

865
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Mine is so much more efficient.

866
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
That sounds pretty elegant, pretty elegant solution.

867
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Thank you.

868
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It took me a little bit, it took me like a day to figure it out

869
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and make it, because it did have some problems where like certain screens,

870
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
like certain instances of text that had line breaks already in them

871
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
would get confused when they needed to add a line break

872
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
and it would like insert like infinite line breaks

873
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
and that was bad obviously.

874
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
But that's not good.

875
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So I needed to flick futz with it for a while,

876
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
but in terms of like, yeah.

877
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I tried programming a few games like 15 years ago in C++

878
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and I would always have trouble when I stopped following the tutorials

879
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
that I had online.

880
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And when I had to like think of how to do things on my own,

881
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I always kind of had those issues trying to come up with solutions

882
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and common problems.

883
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Well, I have a lot of respect for anybody that can actually do this kind of thing.

884
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I was lucky to find that tutorial because it gave me,

885
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
like even though the menu system that I ended up building by following it

886
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
was maybe not exactly suited to what I wanted,

887
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
it gave me a framework that from then I could just be like,

888
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
well, he gave me, you know, attack items magic

889
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and I'm like, all right, well, I'll just, I'll cut out the magic system.

890
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'll just cut that menu off, but then I kind of want to add in another thing.

891
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Like, shit, what's another, what's even, like a data one,

892
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
one that you can like get a data reading on your enemies and yourself.

893
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So I'll take that magic menu and I'll copy paste it

894
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and then I'll just say, okay, what do I need to change about the magic menu

895
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
to make it into this?

896
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Okay, well, I wanted to take out any battle effects

897
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and instead insert sort of a, like a pause in the menu

898
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
and then it inserts a basically a text event.

899
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And then I just need to create all these custom text events for each enemy.

900
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But then the command is just like, it's just a menu command that leads to,

901
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
all right, run a text event, reset the menu to its initial state.

902
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Okay.

903
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And like, and every, every new thing I needed to add to the game

904
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
just became a matter of being like, okay, what is already in the game

905
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
that is the most similar to it?

906
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Okay, take copy paste that into wherever I need it to be

907
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and then be like, okay, what do I need to change about that

908
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
to turn it into this, right?

909
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Right.

910
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So that's probably how you started out,

911
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
but as you get more experienced and confident,

912
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
you can just kind of do your own thing eventually, I'd imagine.

913
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Yeah.

914
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
If I were to do it now, I would, I would not have any trouble

915
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
making a menu system from scratch.

916
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I wouldn't need to like follow tutorial for it anymore.

917
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And you made everything in Game Maker, right?

918
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yeah.

919
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Game Maker with GML.

920
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah.

921
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I tried using Game Maker years ago, but I think back then it sucked.

922
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So I kind of just stuck to C++ and later on when C sharp came out

923
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and was new, I tried C sharp.

924
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And then there was also like XNA, which was for like Xbox Live games.

925
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
This is quite a long time ago.

926
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Wait, Xbox Live had its own like programming language?

927
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It's not really like a programming language.

928
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's like an extension library like SDL.

929
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So XNA is kind of like an extension of the C sharp language.

930
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So that just means you have a bunch of pre-built functions you can use

931
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
for game making, which makes game making easier.

932
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So I tried all that and I sucked at it.

933
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I never really, I never really fully programmed the game,

934
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
but I made a few shoddy prototypes.

935
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And now I think C sharp isn't used anymore.

936
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I don't think anybody...

937
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
People use C++.

938
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah.

939
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
There's like a new C++ now.

940
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
C sharp in the music.

941
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That's all I got to say about that.

942
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
All these numbers and letters is confusing.

943
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Ben finally reached the meme status of learning to code.

944
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yeah.

945
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I used to be a trucker, but now I've learned to code.

946
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yeah, precisely.

947
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Yeah.

948
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Is that a meme?

949
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah.

950
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Yeah, learn to code is like...

951
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's a funny thing that tech pros say.

952
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It's like, oh, technology is going to displace our jobs.

953
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
All these truckers are going to be out of business once self-driving cars become a thing.

954
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh, well, they just need to learn to code.

955
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
They just need to learn to code and then they'll have jobs.

956
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I used to create products, but now I code instead.

957
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
In the future, everyone will just work at a fucking data center doing data entry

958
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
in a fucking spreadsheet.

959
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
In the future, everybody can just be writing programs all the time.

960
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
That's the future.

961
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The future is Ben St.

962
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I remember reading a short Isaac Hasimov story where kids were thinking about what they were going to do after they got out of school

963
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and that the only jobs they were talking about were all different types of programming jobs.

964
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
There's just different genres of programming.

965
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
The idea of building stuff and having other things is like, what's that?

966
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
What is this ancient thing?

967
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
What is this book?

968
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Will you open it?

969
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I mean, that sort of funny story.

970
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:55,000
In a world where automation is at a point where physical manufacturing, where you could just fucking 3D print literally anything,

971
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
what would you need?

972
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
A craftsman, a physical...

973
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
What would you need a carpenter for?

974
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It makes sense to me.

975
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Sounds cool.

976
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I think automation is good, actually.

977
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I think we need less jobs, but also we need communism.

978
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Wow.

979
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
We need both of those things, and then it's good.

980
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
No jobs with no communism is bad.

981
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And communism with jobs is maybe bad?

982
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Is that like...

983
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Oh, everybody works in the mines.

984
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's also...

985
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Or whatever.

986
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But both together is good.

987
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Communism has lots of different flavors and culturally confusing historical examples,

988
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
which are not really actually communism or dictatorship.

989
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I thought it was all about a way to gain power.

990
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Wasn't it all about labor?

991
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah.

992
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I mean, in theory.

993
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
In theory, yeah.

994
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
If you remove labor from the equation, doesn't that change things a lot?

995
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You give them...

996
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Well, I mean, the idea...

997
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's like in Kropotkin, right?

998
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
In Kropotkin, he talks about how agriculture...

999
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Even when he was writing, agricultural technology had come so far that the productive output of land

1000
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:40,000
could easily exceed the need for people to actually work producing it.

1001
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And this is as a type of automation.

1002
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
You could construe it in the same way as like, oh, well...

1003
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
We need less labor to get the same amount of stuff done.

1004
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So what should happen in a functioning communist society, what then should happen is,

1005
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
okay, everybody needs to work less.

1006
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Everybody can get the same amount of stuff, because we're still producing the same amount of stuff.

1007
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Everybody can still get what they need, but we all just need to work less.

1008
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Whereas in the trucker self-driving car situation,

1009
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
it should be a good thing that self-driving cars mean that these people don't have to spend their lives

1010
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
doing the hard work of trucking freight across the country.

1011
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It should be good, but it's like, oh, no, but my job, though.

1012
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
But my job?

1013
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Well, I gotta do something.

1014
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I gotta work.

1015
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Sure, this labor is no longer necessary, but I must work at something for its own sake.

1016
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Otherwise, I do not deserve to feed my family or whatever.

1017
01:00:49,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's like on paper, it sounds good to most people to say...

1018
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Wait, no, not on paper.

1019
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
What am I trying to say?

1020
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm trying to say the responses to communism, you say, you won't have to work as hard.

1021
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And it's like, well, how's that gonna work?

1022
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It's stupid, actually.

1023
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
The idea that you'll be given everything you need, but people always default to thinking like,

1024
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
oh, so we'll be like peasants.

1025
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
We'll all have the same amount of dusty dry bread and nothing else.

1026
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Right, right, right.

1027
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
We'll all be given rations.

1028
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
We'll all wear denim jumpsuits.

1029
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And it's like the idea is that capitalism makes sure that that will happen unless you work.

1030
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And on the communism, on paper, you can live...

1031
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
But you don't have to work.

1032
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You can live in a nice way.

1033
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
On paper.

1034
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Yeah.

1035
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
It's hard talking about it because I'm stupid and I'm not like a video essayist.

1036
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It's definitely...

1037
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:11,000
In theory, the thing about automation should reduce the need for labor.

1038
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Seems like a slam dunk.

1039
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Obviously, that's true.

1040
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
The nitty-gritty of implementation or whatever is like...

1041
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
That's a lot.

1042
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
That's a lot of stuff.

1043
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,000
In the future, Utopia, when nobody has to work, they'll have more time to listen to the PCP.

1044
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:39,000
When all the labor that ever needs to get done is completely automated,

1045
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
well, I guess then you need people to maintain the computers or whatever that run everything.

1046
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But maybe even once that's done, once that stuff's all self-sustaining,

1047
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,000
once all the work is done of like, well, you know, our fucking AIs,

1048
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
they do all the work for us, they make everything we need to have made,

1049
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
they build the houses for us, they make the food for us, they take us from place to place.

1050
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
There's no more work that needs to be done.

1051
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:13,000
There's a lot of science fiction that takes that idea and makes it sound scary.

1052
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And I sometimes buy into it because it's like, if everything has been done by the robots,

1053
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
why do they need us anymore?

1054
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
We'd just die out and they'd kill us and they'd destroy us

1055
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
and we wouldn't have any way to fight back because they control everything.

1056
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's very like...

1057
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It's like, I guess that's true.

1058
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It's just like, I guess that's true.

1059
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I guess we would like, if human life is less necessary to sustain everything,

1060
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
maybe less people would exist.

1061
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's a very like...

1062
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
The idea, it's like, things can't be good.

1063
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Anything that seems really good must actually be bad somehow, right?

1064
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:08,000
There must be some hidden downside to removing the need for humans to spend their labor.

1065
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Or whatever, right?

1066
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It has to destroy the world somehow, if we were to do that.

1067
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Because otherwise it would just be like a really, it seems like a really good thing

1068
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
if there's less need for humans to work.

1069
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Seems like good, but it must be bad because if we're good, shouldn't we be doing it?

1070
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
But we're not.

1071
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
There must be a reason for that, I guess.

1072
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I don't know.

1073
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I was thinking about this in the shower.

1074
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
This is a real shower thought.

1075
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I was thinking about human beings invented capitalism.

1076
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And I have to wonder, is that like somewhat ingrained in just normal human behavior

1077
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
to want more, even if we have what we need?

1078
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Naturally, the reason we've taken over the planet as the number one species

1079
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
is because we've been wanting more than we needed to literally survive.

1080
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And so we built capitalism as the way a society would run

1081
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:19,000
if we were an individual once more than they need

1082
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
and they don't want people to take it.

1083
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So they start like othering people and, you know, I want to be the rich guy at the top.

1084
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Everyone kind of feels like it would be cool if they were that guy

1085
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
if they don't think about like the ramifications

1086
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
or they otherwise don't care about the people who get left behind.

1087
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And it's like, yeah, I guess capitalism isn't like a problem.

1088
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
We can just say, all right, no more capitalism and nothing bad would happen

1089
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,000
because human nature has some sway in the way these systems end up happening.

1090
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
So it's like, how do we actually do anything about this?

1091
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
What do we need to do to the human?

1092
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
You're going to have black market capitalism in this communist utopia, probably.

1093
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
People would always want to be on top because it feels cool.

1094
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
There'll always be markets.

1095
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And yeah, I think it is a thing of like, I think most animals,

1096
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
just animals in general, yeah, they'll take more than they strictly need

1097
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
because like it's useful to have surplus, right?

1098
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Yeah.

1099
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah, something like capitalism or whatever,

1100
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
or even like an oldie system like feudalism

1101
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
that is about like one guy's hordes at all

1102
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
and everyone else just has to deal with it.

1103
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yeah, it grows out of that animalistic hoarding instinct, right?

1104
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
That feeling that one must accumulate for survival,

1105
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,000
for one's own survival benefit at the cost of, you know,

1106
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
you got to choose between whether you want to hoard

1107
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
and increase your own survival odds

1108
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
or whether you want to collaborate, share with the tribe or whatever.

1109
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Humans are a social species, right?

1110
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Humans' survival is more guaranteed by their harmonious teamwork.

1111
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
This is something I was thinking of.

1112
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
The survival of the group is more guaranteed

1113
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
if everyone in the group like mutually collaborates with each other,

1114
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
benefits each other, shares with each other.

1115
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's more beneficial than keeping everything away from the group for yourself

1116
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
because then if you're not working with them

1117
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
and they're not working with you,

1118
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
that's the most beneficial thing that humans have going for them

1119
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
is their ability to collaborate.

1120
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
This is the thing I was coming into my brain in the shower.

1121
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It was like the reason we are like safety in numbers, social animal

1122
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
is because that's a good way to survive,

1123
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
but it's not because we care about each other necessarily.

1124
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
We feel like we need to be part of a larger group.

1125
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
We don't want to be outcast and we want to be safe and secure

1126
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
because cooperating does that,

1127
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
but at a large enough scale,

1128
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
you're cooperating with a group that is competing with another group

1129
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
and so you don't actually care about other humans necessarily.

1130
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You can and many people do because it's just sort of,

1131
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
oh, it's a person, that's part of my species, cooperation.

1132
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But it's very easy to, if you feel like your group is under threat by another group,

1133
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
to suddenly not care about them and their livelihood.

1134
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It's like it doesn't come from a place of real wholesomeness,

1135
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
it comes from a place of survival, our instinct to collaborate.

1136
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I mean, yeah, that's how it is for me.

1137
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I know that it's just a better idea to not fuck people over.

1138
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It's a better idea to collaborate when it's possible.

1139
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
To have people on your side is good.

1140
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,000
This is the Ben St. philosophy is to use everyone around you to your own benefit.

1141
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I mean, you could phrase it like that.

1142
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think most of my Japanese anime would call it the power of friendship.

1143
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
So I mean, I guess it's all in how you want to look at it.

1144
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It's no matter of perspective.

1145
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Sora is such a fucking sociopath, right?

1146
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
He's always telling Riku, my friends are my power.

1147
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Oh, so he's just using Donald and Goofy for power?

1148
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
What a sick fuck.

1149
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
He just, just so we can power up his damn-

1150
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
All he needs to do is press-

1151
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Just so we can power up his damn Keyblade.

1152
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Yeah, it's kind of like a naive, deep thing.

1153
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
We don't actually care about each other, it's just mutual benefit.

1154
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Wow, love doesn't really exist.

1155
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Pog.

1156
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Oh, I'm just like Light Yagami, I'm a creature of pure logic.

1157
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Yeah.

1158
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Speaking of using your friends as power, did you guys talk about Riley leaving Trixie's Yig thing?

1159
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I think you did.

1160
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I may have mentioned it on the last one.

1161
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
There he goes.

1162
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
There's really not.

1163
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Well, it is-

1164
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I mean, do you have anything to say about it, Chrono?

1165
01:10:52,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I just think it's kind of ironic that Trixie basically burned every bridge with everyone

1166
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and ruined her career just to be with Riley, to work with Riley.

1167
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And now he's gone, you know?

1168
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
It made me remember the old-

1169
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
It's been taken down now.

1170
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I saved a copy, cleverly.

1171
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I think it was called Introducing Yig Video, where she sits there wild-eyed,

1172
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:30,000
like leg jittering or whatever, looking off camera,

1173
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
reading from a script for some reason,

1174
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
and talking about the future of Yig, I think it was called.

1175
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And she explains, like, yeah, we're putting red borders around the people movies

1176
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
and the cartoon movies or whatever.

1177
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I remember that.

1178
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And movie movies and music movies and cartoon movies, which-

1179
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
all that shit.

1180
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
And then she-

1181
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
whatever talks about them.

1182
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And then at the end, there's the part where she explains,

1183
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:10,000
oh, and also here's why all these other people don't want to work with me anymore.

1184
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And she explains it very diplomatically.

1185
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
She's like, I allowed myself to be fired by the best guy ever from Cantet.

1186
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:25,000
He did not want to work with me or Riley or be involved in any of the things we're doing.

1187
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Okay, moving on.

1188
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And it was like, hmm, if there were a few more, there's like that.

1189
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And then this one in the latest video where she's like, oh yeah, by the way, Riley is not-

1190
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Voidgazer is cancelled, Riley is gone, he's not involved with Yig anymore.

1191
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Okay, moving on.

1192
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
If there were a few more of those, like, just like three or four of those in-

1193
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
two is not very enough.

1194
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
But those two form a symbiotic circle.

1195
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
What happens to one will affect the other.

1196
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
You must understand this.

1197
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I don't know, it was like poetry.

1198
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
You know, it rhymed.

1199
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Two things happened that were similar to each other.

1200
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
She sure put a lot of eggs in the Riley basket, and now that basket's not there anymore.

1201
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Well, that basket has gone home to roost.

1202
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

1203
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
The eggs have come home to roost.

1204
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I think it was talking about this in my Discord a little bit,

1205
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
and I think a few people have made the observation that like,

1206
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,000
that whole, yeah, that whole Yig, like introducing Yig like, oh, Yig Studio is like this new,

1207
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
bold production company.

1208
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm taking things in a whole new direction.

1209
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I'm doing this with Riley, I'm doing this with Bird,

1210
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
and we're making a whole anime with Mint, and it's gonna be great.

1211
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And like the entire next year was just like the slow dissolution and walking back

1212
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
of everything that that video said Yig was going to be,

1213
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
and everything that, like, Void Gazer, now Void Gazers,

1214
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,000
and more recently the music reviews and other stuff before that,

1215
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
all that stuff was gradually taken off the channel and put on some other channel

1216
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:14,000
only to get like 30 subscribers and then be completely forgotten about and pretend it never happened.

1217
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Yeah, it's pretty surreal when you think about it.

1218
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And she's, you know, when Yig started it was like, you know,

1219
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
fuck, fuck, fuck Digi Bro, fuck the whole, that whole thing.

1220
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
You know, I'm moving in a whole new direction, I'm doing a whole new thing.

1221
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Yig Studios is this whole new thing, it's totally different.

1222
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And then of course, and now it's like, well, everything that,

1223
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
okay, but everything that isn't, everything that isn't me talking about an anime,

1224
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
take that off the channel, hide it, pretend it never happened, everyone,

1225
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
the whole group has fallen apart, nobody's working on any of it anymore,

1226
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I'm just making anime videos now, actually.

1227
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And then those anime videos get like, they're getting like 8,000 views,

1228
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
the last several videos she's put up have gotten like under 10, they're all under 10k,

1229
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
the last three, which is very funny.

1230
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Low, even by my standards.

1231
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Well, it's still better than my stuff, so.

1232
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Well, it's all about the ratio.

1233
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:22,000
But anyways, at the very least, I guess you can commend her for finally having the humility to kind of,

1234
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I guess this is kind of her way of admitting that she was wrong about everything, I guess.

1235
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Wrong, she doesn't, she'll never admit that.

1236
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
She'll just never acknowledge it.

1237
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
All that other stuff goes to another channel, I'll never acknowledge it.

1238
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I'll continue, I'll just keep making YouTube videos and then pretend that that was actually,

1239
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
actually that's kind of what the plan all along.

1240
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Actually, I never said that I wasn't going to stop making anime videos,

1241
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
so the fact that everything I said I was going to do in the Introducing Yig video,

1242
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
the fact that all that is canceled and was a waste of time and I just made it all up.

1243
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
No, this was the plan all along, actually.

1244
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
She'll know she hasn't admitted any faults, she'll never will.

1245
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Well, this is like her, you know, not actually admitting it,

1246
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
but her actions kind of tell a different tale if you get my...

1247
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Well, sure, I mean, sure, if you're paying attention.

1248
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Yeah, it's obviously, she's walked back all the other stuff.

1249
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Where's Lorent Witch? Where's Lorent Witch?

1250
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Yeah, I'd sure like to see that one.

1251
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I was this biggest fan.

1252
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I guess she must have gotten evicted.

1253
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Can I, can I just, can I just bring up the fact again?

1254
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Can I just bring up the fact again that in all seriousness,

1255
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
in complete sincerity, with no trace of like irony or sarcasm or anything,

1256
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Trixie and Riley and Mint all sat there on stream and said,

1257
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
yes, Mint has drawn thousands of frames.

1258
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Mint has drawn thousands of frames of the Lorent Witch anime.

1259
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
It's coming, it's getting there, thousands of frames.

1260
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And then when they showed the animatic, it's like...

1261
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Maybe like 20 frames.

1262
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And what they met...

1263
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
In one video, she showed a little bit of one.

1264
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
It was like a couple shots, a couple sketches of like the witch

1265
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
by like a wall talking to some like cats on a wall or something.

1266
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
There were, there were a couple of drawings, there were a couple of rough sketches.

1267
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I think Riley might have tweeted some.

1268
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, that's long gone. Riley deletes his tweet, his Twitter all the time.

1269
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But I think she did show some at some point.

1270
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
But the point is, it was like a handful of drawings and like, and it became clear.

1271
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
It dawned on me in hindsight that what they meant, what they meant by thousands of frames

1272
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
is that, yeah, it's only a couple drawings, because it's just an animatic.

1273
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
But it goes on for like, you know, 30 seconds or something.

1274
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And 30 seconds, you know, at 60 frames per second.

1275
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
That's like 1800 frames.

1276
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Mint has drawn 1800 frames of Lorent Witch.

1277
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
That's what they think things mean.

1278
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
They just don't know what things mean, yeah.

1279
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And it reminds me...

1280
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
It reminds me of how Trixie would have talked about how she bought a house.

1281
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
She would constantly say she bought a house in Boston.

1282
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Seemingly unaware that renting is not buying?

1283
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Like, seemingly not even understanding.

1284
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Did she actually say that?

1285
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Yeah, all the time. She would say she bought a house.

1286
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
She said she was married to Mae. She says Mae was her wife.

1287
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It's like, like, seemingly not understanding that like, two things are not the same thing.

1288
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,000
20 drawings of Lorent Witch, a dozen drawings of Lorent Witch,

1289
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,000
it displayed in 60 frames per second for 30 seconds, is not 18,000 frames of an animatic.

1290
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But whatever. Never mind, yeah.

1291
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
By the way, you know, since you brought it up, did you send Mae her Blu-ray copy?

1292
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Mae didn't buy a Blu-ray. She did buy Road to Radcon.

1293
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
She backed Road to Radcon and she did...

1294
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I guess that's what I was thinking of.

1295
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
She had me send it to her parents' house.

1296
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
So I did not send it to Ralph's house. I sent it to Mae's parents' house.

1297
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
You're a very fine, upstanding citizen.

1298
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I know, I know. I would put it that way, for your information.

1299
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Hold on, I need to grab another sparkling water.

1300
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
By the way, did you know that the Flat Earth Society has members all around the globe?

1301
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I did know that. I think I've seen that meme, in fact.

1302
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Where, like, that was said by an actual Flat Earth Society.

1303
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
As like an advertisement on like a wall.

1304
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Yeah, that's pretty amusing. Pretty amusing, those Flat Earth guys.

1305
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Gotta give them credit, you know. They have a lot of passion for what they're doing.

1306
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Flat Earth has become a worldwide phenomenon.

1307
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Oh yeah, you missed a little joke.

1308
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
They're talking about it all around the globe, you might say.

1309
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It's a very common meme.

1310
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Well, it's easy. Simple and clean.

1311
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I actually wanted to mention something.

1312
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Speaking of like pony games, you know, you made one.

1313
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Like Phantom's Revenge, yeah. The famous Brony game.

1314
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I don't even, can I just say, I guess it is a Brony game.

1315
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I don't consider it to be that, although I guess you could call it that.

1316
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Like the fact that it has, the fact that it features-

1317
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I don't think it's a Brony game, because Brony's specifically will not find anything interesting in it.

1318
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
The fact that it features a pony as its protagonist,

1319
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,000
and the fact that Ponyville features in the comic

1320
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
is almost completely incidental.

1321
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It just happens to be the case, but it's not like, it's not really that important.

1322
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
It's not about that, you know.

1323
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Well, in any case, I actually discovered a pony game that I thought you'd find interesting,

1324
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,000
because it combines Mega Man and my little pony two things that you're known to like.

1325
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Bro, I know. Are you talking about Megapony?

1326
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Yeah, exactly. I guess you already knew about it.

1327
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Bro, me and Keg, Phantom Horn and Keg Standard did a whole Let's Play of Megapony back in the day.

1328
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Back on T-Bat plays.

1329
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Oh, wow, really? I didn't see that.

1330
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,000
The soundtrack, Megapony has a great soundtrack. I have gushed about it before.

1331
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:24,000
The Megapony soundtrack is made of these gorgeous, gorgeous, 8-bit mashups of classic Mega Man video game music

1332
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:33,000
mixed with leet-like motifs of well-known MLP songs.

1333
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:46,000
What's that one from, that one that the cadence sings when she's in jail or whatever, mixed with the wily theme?

1334
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That one's great.

1335
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yeah, I guess I need to watch the LP you guys did back then.

1336
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
You could, if you wanted to.

1337
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:04,000
This looks pretty cool. I saw some gameplay previews of this game and it actually looks like something I want to play.

1338
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:12,000
It's good. Yeah, it's a whole new, it's got its own levels. It's a whole Mega Man game. It's a whole Mega Man fan game.

1339
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:19,000
It just so happens to feature ponies in it, but whatever.

1340
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the pony stuff, but I do like Mega Man.

1341
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:35,000
You could play it as just a Mega Man game and the fact that it is pony-related is just a funny quirk, just a funny graphical quirk.

1342
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yeah, I love Megapony. There were a bunch of really good, this was one of my favorite things about having a pony channel on the side channel,

1343
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:55,000
getting to play and bring what little attention I could to some of these.

1344
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Yeah, there was ponyvania. Ponyvania was pretty good. There was a little bit incomplete.

1345
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Megapony, Legacy of the Pony was a really good one that I think was based on a Metroid, it was based on the Game Boy Metroid, I think.

1346
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
There sure are a lot of these pony fan games.

1347
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I mean, the hype was huge. You could make, if you made anything at all and branded it as pony stuff, and it was good at all, people would lose their minds about like, oh, it's Metroid but with a pony in it.

1348
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Oh, it's Dubstep but with ponies in it. People craved it.

1349
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And it was great. It was a whole little self-sustaining culture.

1350
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Yeah, it sounds a lot like the Sonic fan community which Cybershell is well acquainted with.

1351
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah. I mean, there's so... Yeah, it is actually. I guess the Sonic fan of has basically never waned, has never died.

1352
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah, that's a good way to put it. Yeah. I mean, it has changed. It has changed its tone.

1353
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Yeah, it changed much like War has. Like never? Sonic and War both have a lot of common.

1354
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Wait, War never changes? Doesn't... Wait, one thing says War has changed.

1355
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I was referencing Metal Gear Solid 4, I think.

1356
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Metal Gear says War is always changing. Fallout says War never changes.

1357
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It says War has changed. War has changed. I think that's Metal Gear Solid 4, right? Is War has changed? Or maybe even earlier than that. Maybe not.

1358
01:25:51,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It definitely in 4 because that's when like, you know, all the weird technology shit starts to really fuck shit up.

1359
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Have you ever seen wacky game jokes for kids? The animated series by Hot Diggity Demon?

1360
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
No, but it sounds interesting.

1361
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Probably have seen it. That sounds familiar.

1362
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It's the thing he did before the Pony.Mov series.

1363
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Is it like kids? It's like kids with blue hair. One girl has blue hair or something, right?

1364
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:32,000
The girl is June and she has blue hair. She's a gamer girl. And then there's a nerd kid and they're making YouTube content about wacky game jokes for kids.

1365
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And there's this other guy, Mickey, who is forced to be part of the YouTube show for some reason and he's like a real dick.

1366
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And that's the joke. And it's a really fun series actually. Really well animated.

1367
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Anyway, he makes a point about the war is always changing and war never changes thing. It just reminded me of that.

1368
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I check that out. I think I like that guy's stuff if I remember correctly who he is.

1369
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Here's...

1370
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Yeah, Max Gellardi.

1371
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Here's a question. Here's a question. I don't know what to do with about this.

1372
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Somebody whose name I won't say for their privacy sent me, I just got a PayPal. I just got money from someone on PayPal.

1373
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It's got $16. Someone just sent me $16 and attached a message that says upload the podcast on Google, you cuck.

1374
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,000
And people have been telling me that the podcasts have not been going on. I think Tom has been busy.

1375
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I think Tom, because Tom is the one that knows how to do that. I don't know how to do that.

1376
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Like on Apple podcasts and Google and whatever.

1377
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So this guy just sent me $16 and I...

1378
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Okay, I thought maybe because he included there is a shipping address here.

1379
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I'm wondering if I should now send him Road to Radcon. I feel like this looks like he was trying to buy Road to Radcon, but he...

1380
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:18,000
$16 is... No, that's $20. I think... Why $16?

1381
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I think he was trying to...

1382
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
It sounds like he was just trying to get your attention.

1383
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
That's a possibility.

1384
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,000
You didn't need to do that. He just wanted to give you money for something that you weren't doing.

1385
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I don't know. I don't know what to do about this.

1386
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
You should probably give him his money back because this isn't even your duty.

1387
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I don't think I will. He gave me this $16 fair and square.

1388
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Guy, if you're listening, if you want Road to Radcon, send me five more dollars.

1389
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Otherwise, thanks.

1390
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Otherwise, hit the road.

1391
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Otherwise, hit the road. Jack and Tom, please upload the stuff to... Upload stuff, wherever.

1392
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I heard someone say... I think Tom might be driving somewhere.

1393
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I heard someone say that Tom is traveling somewhere, driving somewhere. I don't know.

1394
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Maybe not. I don't know anything that's going on.

1395
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Tom's an enigma.

1396
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Tom is an enigma.

1397
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Tom has been in a state where people think he's moving for two and a half years now.

1398
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I know he hasn't because I saw him recently.

1399
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I don't know if I mentioned this. I hung out with Tom.

1400
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:57,000
It was surprising. He showed up at Munchie's house because Sixton was there.

1401
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Three weeks ago because Sixton was there and Tom wanted to see Sixton.

1402
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I think that was what...

1403
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Oh, that's the meetup that I would have been at.

1404
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Yes.

1405
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Tom was there.

1406
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
We have invited Tom to stuff and he has never...

1407
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
He has come a couple times, but he...

1408
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I got him out to my house like two years ago, maybe like twice,

1409
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
and then he never came to anything ever again, but Sixton showed up and Tom was like,

1410
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
okay, well, in that case, I got to go.

1411
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I was like, okay.

1412
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
And you know what? Fair enough because Sixton's really good at music.

1413
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
So it makes sense, I guess.

1414
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
True.

1415
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Tom really needs to put his...

1416
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Go check out Sixton's music. Go over on Sixton.com.

1417
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I don't know what their thing is.

1418
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Slamrarn.

1419
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
They have a band camp.

1420
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Their band camp is Slamrarn unless they've changed it.

1421
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
It sounds like Tom really needs to put his back into things more.

1422
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Mmm.

1423
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Very has so much to give.

1424
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Very funny.

1425
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,000
In the documentary, when Tom shows up to Radcon too, we're asking him how he is,

1426
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
and one of the first things he mentions that he recently threw his back out,

1427
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
grim portents of the future.

1428
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That's some grim foreshadowing.

1429
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Exactly, exactly.

1430
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
There's a lot of foreshadowing in that documentary.

1431
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Yeah, that's true. I guess a lot of it is.

1432
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I think people were like leaving comments about that while they were watching.

1433
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I saw in the premiere.

1434
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah, there was.

1435
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
A lot of people being like grim foreshadowing.

1436
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
A lot of people being like, damn, kind of...

1437
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Sad, seeing everyone having fun, knowing what would eventually happen,

1438
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and like, lol, true...

1439
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
What else?

1440
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Was Jeff in that one?

1441
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
He is.

1442
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
He was.

1443
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
He actually...

1444
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
It reminded me...

1445
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I hardly talked to Jeff when he was there.

1446
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Same.

1447
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I think Jeff was basically there to talk to Digibro.

1448
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Because Digi was bigger than Mother's Basement,

1449
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
and it was a networking opportunity for him, I think.

1450
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Not that he was rude or anything,

1451
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:37,000
but he was there because his colleague had invited him to participate in a collaboration.

1452
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
An anime-related collaboration.

1453
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I did talk to him a little.

1454
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
We went on a car ride.

1455
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
We went on a car ride.

1456
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
No, no, no, this was not...

1457
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:55,000
There was a car ride where apparently DeVue and Jeff got in like a political argument,

1458
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:04,000
because, you know, Jeff, Hillary Stan, still with her, Libguck, DeVue,

1459
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
only like six months ago, was like...

1460
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I think Trump was kind of bad, actually.

1461
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
So, you know, I could see how they might have had this agreement.

1462
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Apparently they got in an argument.

1463
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I don't... I wasn't there for it, so I didn't see it.

1464
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I definitely was in the car at one point with Jeff,

1465
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
but I don't remember talking to him about hardly anything.

1466
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I think he was there. He had a one-track mind.

1467
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
It's pretty interesting to see that.

1468
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Wasn't he like a member of the PCP at one point?

1469
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
He was.

1470
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
This was... Yeah, this was back...

1471
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
He was at that time.

1472
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
This was back when Mother's Basement was a smaller channel than the Digi Channel.

1473
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
So, it was a...

1474
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And it's really funny to hear in the documentary when they talk about...

1475
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Trixie is like...

1476
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Jeff, you know...

1477
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
They're talking about like making good videos.

1478
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Like, you gotta make good videos.

1479
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Like, oh, you gotta shill more.

1480
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Like, oh, well, you know, hey, I'm making good videos, though.

1481
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
They're like talking shop and like...

1482
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Trixie is like giving advice and stuff.

1483
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
It's like, you know, another like...

1484
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Weird to see that knowing how things shook out.

1485
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Apparently, she should have taken her own advice more, I guess.

1486
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
She really should have. She really should have.

1487
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
She used to give kind of good advice.

1488
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
She kind of knew what she was talking about,

1489
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
but it was sprinkled with like, dumb shit that's like...

1490
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Obviously, this is just like survivorship bias.

1491
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Like, it wouldn't work for anyone.

1492
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
It just happened to work for you.

1493
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
This isn't real advice.

1494
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
But, you know, making a thumbnail and titling a video...

1495
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
You know, I guess she had that down.

1496
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
She really attributed her...

1497
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So much of her success to like knowing how to make a good thumbnail and title a video.

1498
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
When like, that's actually like so simple.

1499
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Like, it does not take a genius to understand that like a big, appealing face as your thumbnail

1500
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
is like an attractive thing that will make people want to click on.

1501
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's really not just a matter of knowing that.

1502
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
To make the difference between success and failure.

1503
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Yeah, there's a little bit more to it than that.

1504
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Yeah, she talked about it like it was.

1505
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
It was just little tricks like that that were like the reason...

1506
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
She just knows all the tricks.

1507
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
The reason why she's successful is just because she knows all the tricks.

1508
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
There was no luck involved or anything.

1509
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That's why they call her Trixie now.

1510
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
She knew all the tricks.

1511
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Ah, true.

1512
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
But it's crazy to see how...

1513
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I think Jeff now has over a million subscribers or something.

1514
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I looked.

1515
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
He's got like 1.25 million, yeah.

1516
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It's more than I thought.

1517
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:56,000
So he started out as being smaller and Trixie probably looked up to her

1518
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
and now he totally eclipsed her.

1519
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
So it's pretty interesting.

1520
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Yeah.

1521
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I guess I could have been Trixie if she just kept doing what she was doing.

1522
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
She...

1523
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
I mean, it wouldn't have been exactly the same, but...

1524
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Okay, you know what?

1525
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I feel like Trixie's content was always a little more niche

1526
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
because of the personal angle.

1527
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I'm gonna say...

1528
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I don't know too much about what Jeff's content is like,

1529
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000
but it seems more like wider, appealing, but less emotionally interesting

1530
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
from a review or analysis perspective.

1531
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Trixie could have gone a different route and ended up much more successful.

1532
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
But it's not like Yig was like the end.

1533
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It's not like everything was going great and then Yig was like,

1534
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
oh, she changed her formula, she changed her name, she changed all this stuff.

1535
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
That's what ruined it.

1536
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
It was already...

1537
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I mean, how they marketed was a big failure.

1538
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Yeah, I noticed there was a decline before the Yig stuff.

1539
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,000
There was a big decline and then it led to stuff like the rants, right?

1540
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Stuff like the rants are her basically being like,

1541
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,000
okay, my channel is floundering, like my numbers are stagnating.

1542
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So what I need to do to make money is to lean more into the niche parasocial element of it,

1543
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
which I'm not saying that it's wrong to do that,

1544
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:39,000
but it's a sign that my metrics, my pure numbers are not pulling the weight.

1545
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
The crazy thing is the rants were really successful.

1546
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
She was getting more of them than she could have even done.

1547
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
They were.

1548
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Looking at her Patreon, it's funny.

1549
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I'll bring up the graph.

1550
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
The graph I always look at.

1551
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I cleared my cookies now and now I have to reload every page.

1552
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I think every page that I've loaded is broken.

1553
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I remember she stopped doing the rants because she was getting so many of them.

1554
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
She had a hard time working on other stuff.

1555
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Yeah.

1556
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
So it was a very lucrative business.

1557
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
It's her peak.

1558
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:28,000
We looked at the timeline while we were doing the commentary, watching the documentary.

1559
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
That was in January of 2017.

1560
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:42,000
A few months later in May 2017 was when she would switch from the per video to per month Patreon model.

1561
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
That was when her number went up from 1,300 to over 4,000.

1562
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Then it dipped for a while and then I think in around mid-2018 it starts going up again.

1563
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:07,000
It briefly rose even above that initial peak in March of 2019.

1564
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It hit almost 5K.

1565
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
It hit 5K but it was right there.

1566
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I think that was the rant era.

1567
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
That was when she was making the most money ever on Patreon.

1568
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
She was deep in the rant era and then that continued for a few months.

1569
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Around February 2020 is when it completely falls off a cliff and now we're at 500, 600.

1570
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
She shouldn't have stopped doing those rants so soon.

1571
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I'm sure they would have eventually dried up but she should have just kept doing them for as long as they came in.

1572
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
The numbers don't lie.

1573
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:51,000
That's super easy. Those rants are the easiest things to do.

1574
01:39:51,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I made a post on Twitter about the incredible ratio of 300,000 subscribers on that channel to getting 7,000 views.

1575
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,000
On a main upload, on a real upload that's not an updated video.

1576
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Like a real video. 7,000 views.

1577
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I've seen YouTube channels with worse disparities than that.

1578
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I struggled to think of any. Maybe there's some.

1579
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I've seen a few.

1580
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:32,000
A YouTube channel that had a super viral thing or two and then didn't have any good ideas for years after that.

1581
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
They get a couple thousand even though they got hundreds of thousands of subs.

1582
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
That's what we're talking about.

1583
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I think the rebranding and stuff she did also killed her algorithm performance or whatever.

1584
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I think there's something to that.

1585
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
It probably did.

1586
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I think at the end of the day, it's just that people don't like her anymore and don't want to watch her stuff.

1587
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
It's definitely part of it.

1588
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:09,000
You could be as fucked by the algorithm as possible but if people want to watch your stuff, they're going to watch it.

1589
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
You can't just blame the algorithm for everything.

1590
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:19,000
At the end of the day, you're responsible for making stuff people want to see and being someone that people want to watch.

1591
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
What was I going to say?

1592
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I had one other...

1593
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I was talking to Mimeori, the Among Us girl on Twitter.

1594
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,000
We were talking about the rebrand and how stupid it was.

1595
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I wrote a reply and it made me think.

1596
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:58,000
When she was talking in the Future of Yeg video, she was talking about all these projects that they're going to be doing.

1597
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Then I think in the I Hate Digi Bro video, she's talking more in the past tense.

1598
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
It's what she wanted to do.

1599
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
She kind of reiterates it again.

1600
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:22,000
The idea is I want to live in a truck or a trailer or an RV, live with my boyfriend, go around, meet people, make stuff,

1601
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:29,000
and then just go from place to place, meet up with people, make work on projects.

1602
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
The way that it sounds to me is that...

1603
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And the way that she describes Yeg as her crew.

1604
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:46,000
When she says her crew, to me, it doesn't sound like she's talking about a one-piece Nakama.

1605
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
It's like a production crew.

1606
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
They're there to work for her.

1607
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:58,000
They're there to set stuff up,

1608
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
make connections for her.

1609
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
This is consistent with how Riley presents himself.

1610
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Riley says, I'm the producer.

1611
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I have the connections.

1612
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I'm going to set it all up for you.

1613
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I'm going to bring in professional people.

1614
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I want to make Radcon 5 happen.

1615
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I'm going to make it a professionally hosted event, like a catered event or whatever.

1616
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
It's going to be a real rap show this time, not like whatever bullshit you were doing.

1617
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
When she describes them as a crew and she talks about the things they're doing,

1618
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,000
it sounds to me like the goal here was to become...

1619
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:35,000
And she talks about how she wants to be the director.

1620
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
She wants to be like the director of a studio.

1621
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I really think she just wanted to get these friends that she could just tell them what to do,

1622
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
tell them to make stuff, and they would just do it and make stuff and put it on her channel,

1623
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and they would do shit for her, and other people would make shit,

1624
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
and she could just get to take credit as the I'm the director of this studio.

1625
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
This is all under my umbrella.

1626
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I don't have to do anything. I don't have to do any work.

1627
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I can just smoke weed, and other people will make shit for me.

1628
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
And isn't that the capitalist dream?

1629
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I think so.

1630
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:18,000
She never quite puts it in those terms, but that's my read of when she describes what she wanted for Yig.

1631
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I think that's what it is.

1632
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:26,000
She just wanted to be able to step back and have a self-sustaining content machine

1633
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:34,000
under her branding, under her control, that she could just profit off of, live off of.

1634
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I don't know how accurate that is, but it does seem like...

1635
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
That's just my opinion.

1636
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Her creative drive to make stuff is sort of gone.

1637
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I mean, she was writing Kusomega, which was like a light novel,

1638
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
and she seemed like she was really into it, and lots of people were like,

1639
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
oh, this is cool. You should really make this a thing.

1640
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And I felt like she was going to, but I don't know what's going on with that.

1641
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
For Nanarimo.

1642
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
She sort of stopped.

1643
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
For November last year, for Nanarimo, she said at the beginning of the month,

1644
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:12,000
she said she was going to write a novel, maybe three, like maybe two or three.

1645
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
And then the whole month goes by, and literally all she does,

1646
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,000
she writes like a one and a half page short story about...

1647
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
First of all, she asks people, like, give me an idea for a short story on Twitter.

1648
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Someone suggests, I don't know, something about a robot or whatever.

1649
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
She writes like a one and a half page short story about a robot, and that's it.

1650
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,000
What happened to the three novels you were going to write?

1651
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,000
That's something that's been the case with her for a long time.

1652
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
She starts a lot of projects and doesn't finish most of them.

1653
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Yeah.

1654
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I mean, I guess that's always kind of been true.

1655
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:55,000
But it's sort of been held up by her work ethic.

1656
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:00,000
She was able to make lots of stuff, even if a lot of the projects didn't go anywhere.

1657
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:07,000
The human content machine as like a gimmick.

1658
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I don't know why that has also gone with Yeeg.

1659
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:19,000
She's not interested in making stuff on like a large scale,

1660
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:29,000
because I think that's a lot of the reason why she remained and became so big as an internet figure.

1661
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
But she did used to...

1662
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Just the amount of stuff she was able to produce.

1663
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
She did used to have a pretty good work ethic.

1664
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Not all of it was the best.

1665
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I think it's...

1666
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Because from my perspective, I don't really have a say in what an internet person does for their internet job.

1667
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,000
If you don't want to make your videos or create things anymore, then whatever.

1668
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I don't care.

1669
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
That's your prerogative.

1670
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
That's your life.

1671
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
But if we're talking about her as like a person,

1672
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I don't know why she thinks letting go of the work ethic is a good idea

1673
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:15,000
if she wants to continue the internet stuff with people doing the work for her instead.

1674
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
It just seems like it's not going to work.

1675
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
It seems like it hasn't.

1676
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It has not worked.

1677
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I mean, at this point,

1678
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I think she said in the I Hate Didgeridoo video that if the views continue to only get the amount of views they've gotten,

1679
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
she will eventually quit.

1680
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And they've only gotten worse since then,

1681
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
which is very funny.

1682
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
The video is, I think, why I was saying before that.

1683
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,000
It does seem she has a little bit of humility about what's been happening.

1684
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I don't think you're...

1685
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Maybe not as much as she's showing, but...

1686
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I think that you see what she's saying,

1687
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
and you feel, you rightfully feel,

1688
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
wow, this is embarrassing.

1689
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
She does not feel that way.

1690
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
She doesn't understand.

1691
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,000
She does not recognize that a failure has occurred publicly

1692
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
and that she ought to be humbled by it.

1693
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
She is frustrated.

1694
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I think she's noticeably frustrated in that video.

1695
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Compare her attitude in I Hate Didgeridoo to her manic energy in The Future of Yig.

1696
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
It's like night and day.

1697
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I think she's frustrated that the outcome has not been what she wanted,

1698
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
but she's not like,

1699
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I messed up.

1700
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I made a mistake.

1701
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
She's just explaining, like,

1702
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
here's what I'm gonna do.

1703
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
It's gonna work.

1704
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Okay, bye.

1705
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
All I'm saying is, at the very least,

1706
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
she's admitting the outcome is bad,

1707
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
whereas before, she seemed to just completely...

1708
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
She acknowledges that the numbers are low.

1709
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
She acknowledges the numbers are low.

1710
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
So, like, good for her. She can count.

1711
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
She notices that there's less money in her bank account.

1712
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Before, she wouldn't even acknowledge that there's a problem.

1713
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
She would kind of, like, censor all mention of it on the channel.

1714
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
People would post comments saying the views are bad or whatever,

1715
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
and those comments would be deleted.

1716
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Yeah, the dislike ratio, yeah.

1717
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

1718
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Of course, of course.

1719
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Uh...

1720
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Uh, well, I was gonna say, um...

1721
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Yeah.

1722
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
So, she's...

1723
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I understand her motive,

1724
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
even though her creative verb or whatever,

1725
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
her enthusiasm for it seems gone.

1726
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Like, she seems checked out, frustrated,

1727
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
unengaged in, like, the...

1728
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I hate Digipro video, and again,

1729
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
in the recent one, the, like, best-looking anime video,

1730
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
the one where she says Riley quit.

1731
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
She just doesn't seem happy to be there.

1732
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Uh, she's gonna...

1733
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
But I can understand keeping at it,

1734
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:14,000
because even now, even after, like, losing most of everything,

1735
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
she still has, you know,

1736
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
she's still making, like, 600 something on Patreon a month.

1737
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Just, that's just free money forever that will never go away.

1738
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Uh, she still...

1739
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
She said she, like, has, like, put more, uh, ads on her videos

1740
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
or her channel ad revenue,

1741
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
just on passive old views and old videos,

1742
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
is probably making hundreds,

1743
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
maybe over $1,000 a month, just by existing.

1744
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
That's just free money forever.

1745
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
So, like, in a sense,

1746
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
she is kind of making a living at it,

1747
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
even though, like, not really.

1748
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
It's more like a passive living was already made,

1749
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
uh, and it will just continue to be the case.

1750
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I think the, um, the thing about it is,

1751
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
it was lucrative for a really long time,

1752
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
and she believes that it can become lucrative again,

1753
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
but I don't think she realized quite how much luck played a part

1754
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
in her, her rise.

1755
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Absolutely.

1756
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
And so she doesn't realize what needs to be done to rectify it.

1757
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
This is what...

1758
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
In the state that it is now.

1759
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
This is what I was saying about how she thought,

1760
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
she really believed that it was just her own genius.

1761
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
She taught, like, remember at Radcon 4,

1762
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
she was gonna give us all, like,

1763
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
she was gonna give us all, like, uh, like advice, right?

1764
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Like YouTube career advice.

1765
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
She wanted to take us all aside,

1766
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
talk about, like, the state of our,

1767
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
the state of our, like, careers or whatever,

1768
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
and, like, give us personal,

1769
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
like, a personal advice program,

1770
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
but, like, here's what you need to do to, like,

1771
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
to, like, supercharge your career.

1772
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
At Radcon 4?

1773
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Yeah.

1774
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I remember that.

1775
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
She didn't, she didn't really end up doing it forever.

1776
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Like, she never did it with me because I wasn't interested.

1777
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I think she might have done it with one or two people,

1778
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
but she was talking about it.

1779
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Like, this was a thing she wanted to do.

1780
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
It was like, I want to take everyone,

1781
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
maybe it was gonna be filmed, I don't even remember,

1782
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
but, uh, that was,

1783
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
she was talking about that at Radcon 4,

1784
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
and she, she really just attributes all of her success.

1785
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
This is, you know what, this is a thing of, like,

1786
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
lots of people, lots of rich people are like this.

1787
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
They attribute all their, all their successes

1788
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
are due to my own genius,

1789
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
my own good decisions,

1790
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
my own skills and abilities.

1791
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
All my failures are bad luck.

1792
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
The market, the market was against me.

1793
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
The, the, uh, you know, the, you know,

1794
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
just something happened that I was out of my control.

1795
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
It was an act of God, you know,

1796
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
and nobody could have predicted this.

1797
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Yeah, all her, uh, successes kind of got to her head

1798
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
and gave her a big ego.

1799
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
We got kind of, uh, a little bit conceited.

1800
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
She's not that special.

1801
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
She's not particularly smart.

1802
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I, she's not, I wouldn't say she's,

1803
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I wouldn't say she's even a good writer.

1804
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
What she was is a prolific writer.

1805
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
She wrote a lot, and that's not nothing.

1806
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
That's something.

1807
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Uh, and she had a weird personality

1808
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
that I guess appealed to a certain niche

1809
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
and it wasn't well served in the anime YouTuber market,

1810
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
and I understand the appeal there

1811
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
and how it led to her just hitting,

1812
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
striking the right chord

1813
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
with a certain demographic of people

1814
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
and it got her popular with those people.

1815
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
That all makes sense.

1816
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
But it's all, also,

1817
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
pretty much just complete happenstance.

1818
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
It all just happened to work out that way.

1819
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I do think she does have some, some genuine talents,

1820
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
maybe not as much as she thinks she has, but

1821
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
she kind of...

1822
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I'm not saying she's...

1823
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
She had a pretty good ability to like talk about stuff

1824
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
and make it sound more interesting than it was.

1825
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah.

1826
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Yeah, sure.

1827
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Right.

1828
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm not, like, I'm not, I'm not saying she had...

1829
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm not saying there was nothing to her at all.

1830
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
But she, she really thought it was...

1831
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
What I'm saying, Gabe's right, there was a lot of luck involved,

1832
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
but she doesn't see it that way.

1833
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Yeah, I agree with that.

1834
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,000
She just thinks that, like, she just was such a,

1835
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
such a marketing genius or whatever.

1836
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
It's definitely...

1837
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I don't know.

1838
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
There's some truth to that.

1839
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
There's a lot of luck involved in YouTube success, you know?

1840
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
It's, it's sad but true.

1841
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
We have, we have now turned this into

1842
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
the Bitch About Digi podcast that Trixie says,

1843
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
the pod, that Trixie says the PCP now is.

1844
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Which is, it's fun.

1845
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I feel like...

1846
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
It's fine, it's fine.

1847
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I feel like this is, this is fine,

1848
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
if only because we're largely talking about

1849
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
the Red Con 2 documentary.

1850
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
That's true.

1851
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
That just came out.

1852
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
In, in that context.

1853
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And we're reminiscing, in a reminiscing mood.

1854
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Yeah.

1855
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I think, I, you know, I've never really, like,

1856
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
DM'd her about my thoughts on her channel direction

1857
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
or what she could do.

1858
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I don't know whether she'd appreciate me doing that now.

1859
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Didn't she, like...

1860
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I could just tell her.

1861
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
What do you think, what do you think she...

1862
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Just make more stuff if you want to get big again.

1863
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Why would you want to help her?

1864
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I don't know.

1865
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Didn't she just burn her bridge with you,

1866
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
like, everybody else?

1867
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I mean, she's, like, whatever.

1868
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I'm not, like...

1869
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I'm not, like, terribly, like, hurt and, like,

1870
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
betrayed by her, as I think you feel been.

1871
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I still don't like her.

1872
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
I, but, like...

1873
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I, I hate her.

1874
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I hate her and I want her in the gutter.

1875
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
That's literally what I want and I'm not ashamed of it.

1876
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
But it's a very, um...

1877
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Yeah, I'm not quite there.

1878
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
It's a very saint core thing to say.

1879
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And you know what?

1880
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
And I'm a good person and I am full of light.

1881
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I am Kingdom Hearts because she deserves it.

1882
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And evil should be punished.

1883
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I am the good guy.

1884
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
And I mean that and I'm not joking.

1885
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Yeah, that's exactly what a good guy would say.

1886
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
This is what a good guy would say!

1887
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Listen, I think she...

1888
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I don't know.

1889
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
In my opinion, in my opinion, the karmic scales of balance

1890
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
are out of whack.

1891
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
And she, and even to this day, even now,

1892
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
she has so much more than she deserves.

1893
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
What she has now, you know, maybe like $1,500 in passive income,

1894
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
just money that she gets just for breathing,

1895
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
that's so much more than so many, than most people have.

1896
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
That's amazing.

1897
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
An incredible blessing.

1898
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
She doesn't deserve it.

1899
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Literally, she's a bad person.

1900
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Literally, she deserves nothing.

1901
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:46,000
So if, you know, fucking a fire at Internet headquarters

1902
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
occurred tomorrow and all the servers went down

1903
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
and YouTube died forever and Patreon died forever

1904
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
and all that money was gone and she was back to zero,

1905
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I would laugh and I would say good.

1906
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
This is what should have happened.

1907
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
This is just a good thing that's happened.

1908
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Justice has been restored.

1909
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
And that's where I'm at.

1910
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And I will always be there.

1911
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,000
It sounds like YouTube is the UBI we fell to make.

1912
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Why didn't everybody, you know,

1913
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
if everybody had just started making YouTube videos back in 2015,

1914
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
everyone would be rich, just like if everyone had just bought

1915
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Bitcoin back in 2014.

1916
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Exactly.

1917
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Everyone would be rich.

1918
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Stupid.

1919
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Duh.

1920
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
It was the solution to the economy,

1921
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
but everyone who just didn't recognize it at the time

1922
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,000
is just too stupid and they deserve to be poor.

1923
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Yeah.

1924
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Duh.

1925
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Precisely.

1926
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:43,000
But anyways, speaking of RVs,

1927
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:50,000
did anybody catch the RV joke in that video I did like months ago?

1928
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Yes, I did.

1929
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I did see that.

1930
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I can't remember the joke, but I've seen the video.

1931
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I forget what the video, what was the title of it again?

1932
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I posted it in the chat.

1933
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
It's the Astros Playroom review that I did.

1934
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I'd never heard of Astros Playroom before.

1935
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
It's a PS5 game.

1936
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
I caught the RV jokes in there.

1937
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
This wasn't a real review.

1938
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,000
It was just kind of like a joke review kind of goofing around.

1939
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:30,000
But I did do a real review of Metroid Dread.

1940
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I don't know if you guys saw it.

1941
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
You know.

1942
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I did see that, yes.

1943
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I don't think I did.

1944
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I'll just kind of link it in there.

1945
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,000
As well, if you want to put the link in the description for anybody listening to this.

1946
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Of course, of course.

1947
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
It's like an actual serious review.

1948
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
I did that recently.

1949
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I've done many actual video reviews, have you?

1950
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
You've mostly been on your website.

1951
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Yeah, this is my first attempt at a real video review.

1952
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
So people can check that out.

1953
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:15,000
You can kind of imagine this like one of my website reviews, but with video to accompany it.

1954
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:23,000
And also, I did a podcast with Cybershell a couple of...

1955
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Oh.

1956
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
That's also a little while ago.

1957
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:33,000
We talked about Sonic 06 and gaming stuff in general and that kind of stuff.

1958
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
So if you like Cybershell, you should probably listen to that one.

1959
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Wait, did that just work?

1960
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
You know what?

1961
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I do like Cybershell, actually.

1962
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
You know what?

1963
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Maybe I will listen to that.

1964
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I'm almost finished.

1965
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I've almost caught up with Animorph in time.

1966
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Oh, really?

1967
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
So, yeah, almost.

1968
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I'm a few episodes behind still.

1969
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I listened up until the one where they say that I'm sexy.

1970
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
That's a good place to be.

1971
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
That's episode 39.

1972
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
That's book 39.

1973
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
So that's three episodes behind where we're at.

1974
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Yeah, they say I'm sexy.

1975
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Oh, wait, no, actually, I think they've probably released like two more since then.

1976
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,000
So, yeah, I just wanted to...

1977
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I will give a listen to that.

1978
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,000
I just wanted to plug this stuff to kind of give you guys an idea of what I've been up to.

1979
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Yeah, it's been a while.

1980
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
It's been a little while.

1981
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:46,000
And I'm working on a major secret project that maybe will come out this year,

1982
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,000
hopefully in, you know, 50 years from now.

1983
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,000
A major secret project, huh?

1984
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Do you want to...

1985
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Do you have any hints about it?

1986
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:03,000
It's just a video, but it's probably going to be long, like maybe 40 minutes to an hour long.

1987
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:13,000
And it's a new idea, but it incorporates some of my old trademark humor.

1988
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Because, you know, back in the day, I used to do those pun LPs.

1989
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1990
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
So I just...

1991
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
That's what we knew you from.

1992
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I just figured out why not take that kind of humor and incorporate it into a video

1993
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,000
that people might be more interested in watching instead of it just being a let's play.

1994
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
That sounds like a good...

1995
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
That sounds like a pretty good idea, yeah?

1996
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Makes sense to me.

1997
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1998
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
So I'm hoping to see if people will like that.

1999
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Well, let me know when that's out.

2000
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I'll check it out, whatever it is.

2001
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Yeah, I'll definitely let everyone know about it because it's going to take quite a while.

2002
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Good, good.

2003
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Good, good.

2004
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I see.

2005
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Well, it's not good that it'll take a while, but interesting.

2006
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Well, it's just going to take a while because I'm really slow at this kind of thing.

2007
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Well, same.

2008
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I was hoping that I'd be done drawing the Slime and Punishment by now.

2009
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Almost halfway through February, and I would say I'm probably more than halfway done with drawing, probably.

2010
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
It's hard to say.

2011
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I was hoping to be further, but...

2012
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,000
So you're basically just finished with the game and you're just waiting for the comics, right?

2013
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Yeah, and it's a bit of a...

2014
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
I was actually...

2015
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
This sounds wild.

2016
02:02:52,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I had actually intended not to release the Sonichu 102 lecture until I had finished this game and the comic.

2017
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I'm well aware of that.

2018
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Really? Yeah, okay.

2019
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Well, I was going to release them all at once, but then that other stuff happened and I was like, now's the time.

2020
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Now's the time to release.

2021
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
That was kind of a bad idea in retrospect.

2022
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
You mean holding on to it?

2023
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Yeah, it was.

2024
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I'm sure when you first came up with the idea, it sounded cool.

2025
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I didn't think it would be like a year.

2026
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:40,000
And it probably would have been cool if you didn't take as long on the game.

2027
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Yep.

2028
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
True.

2029
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
But I did.

2030
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:56,000
So if nothing had happened on that front, I would be saying, yeah, I'm about to release the game and the comic and that video.

2031
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:04,000
But you know, game development takes a very long time, so I'm not really surprised that it took you so long to put it together.

2032
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:13,000
You know, well, the game, the little game that I made for the champion, it took me less than a month to make that.

2033
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:20,000
And so I thought this game would be maybe a few months, but it ended up ballooning out.

2034
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:26,000
A lot of people don't know how much hard work it is to develop a game, even if it's small.

2035
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Because you kind of, like if you go back and you look at some of those old games on Genesis and the Super Nintendo, you know, like Mega Man X, for example.

2036
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:44,000
A game like that, it's only like around two hours long, but it took the development team like maybe a year or more to make it.

2037
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Yeah.

2038
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:52,000
You know, and it's, they had to do a lot of testing and polishing and bug fixing.

2039
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,000
They were pretty serious about bug fixing back in those days because there were no patches.

2040
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Yeah.

2041
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:12,000
The, the, uh, yeah, it just, I didn't expect it to be quite, I knew it would be a big undertaking, it was bigger than I expected.

2042
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Oh well. But the, the, so what I'm saying is I feel a little stupid, a little bad about holding onto the game when it's done.

2043
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
And I'm like, this is kind of like what I did with the lecture.

2044
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Like, am I, should I just release the game?

2045
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:40,000
But like, I don't think so because the game is not something that anyone like knows about or is expecting outside of like the small circle of people that maybe follow me.

2046
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Uh, I don't think it's not like something that has like a broader, much of a broader like appeal.

2047
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I think kind of whenever, whenever the game comes out will be basically the same.

2048
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Like there won't, there's no real difference in releasing it like this year versus last year versus next year, like whatever.

2049
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I guess there's the other weird thing about all of this is that you're, you're working really hard on something that has like very limited outside appeal.

2050
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:30,000
It, I, I, to, to finish my last thought, I just, yeah, I hate holding onto it, but I don't think it will suffer very much from being released later where like, the, the, the, uh,

2051
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000
I mean, it's so, it's so tight in it, the, the, the lecture is kind of its own thing.

2052
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
It's not really part of the same thing.

2053
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
It's related, but like the, the game and the comic are based, are literally one in the same.

2054
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:48,000
So I feel like, okay, it's okay to, it's okay to hang onto this for another month or whatever.

2055
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
As long as you don't take another year.

2056
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I am hoping, I hope that the game is, is cool and good enough that maybe it will make a little bit of a splash.

2057
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Maybe it will get seen around a little bit.

2058
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Maybe, maybe indie game fans in some circles might talk about it a little.

2059
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Maybe it'll get seen.

2060
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I hope, I kind of hope that like some new people maybe just find it because it's a game and they like games and maybe some people pass it around and comment on it a little bit.

2061
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Uh, that would be cool.

2062
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I would kind of like that the most, actually, more than like, you know, fucking God, fucking Sonichu fans, Chris Chan fans.

2063
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I hate those people.

2064
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I don't, I don't want them to play the game.

2065
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Fuck, fuck them.

2066
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Kind of the worst.

2067
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Yeah.

2068
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,000
It would be nice if it has like a wider appeal because you did work very hard on it.

2069
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
It's, um, I mean, I don't know.

2070
02:07:51,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I guess I don't know that much about like the indie game scene, but you know, I made it to be, I made it to be a game that's fun and challenging.

2071
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:05,000
And so I hope that it appeals to gamers.

2072
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:12,000
You know, I hope it's a good game that stands on its own as a game and people appreciate it in that way.

2073
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
That's my hope for it.

2074
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,000
If it does appeal to other people, it might get them interested in all the other stuff connected to it.

2075
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:25,000
May, that's, that's what I, that would be what I would most hope for would be my optimal.

2076
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:32,000
You know, maybe somebody will play it and then be like, I wonder what all this stuff is about, you know, and look up the comic or whatever.

2077
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
That's what I hope.

2078
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
That's what I really.

2079
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,000
It could be like a marketing tool.

2080
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:47,000
It's a, it's a thing that I made and I hope it gets seen and it ties into some other stuff I made.

2081
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
So maybe if it gets seen, it would get that stuff a little more seen.

2082
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Kind of, it kind of reminds me of how like back in the day, they used to have those cartoons to market the toys.

2083
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,000
You know, I think that was the case for transformers.

2084
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Hmm.

2085
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
So this, you're saying this is the new transformers?

2086
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Yeah, basically.

2087
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Hmm.

2088
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Yeah, it's, it's very similar.

2089
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
It's very similar to transformers.

2090
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
It's just there to sell the toys.

2091
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I mean, I mean, what would you do if Hasbro came to you and said, Hey, we want to buy the rights revenge.

2092
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
More like they would cease and desist it.

2093
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Because it's an OC.

2094
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
They can't do anything.

2095
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Hmm.

2096
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
It's just a parody.

2097
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
All right.

2098
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Well, I would say I would take their money.

2099
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:44,000
But it's not a very interesting answer, but expected.

2100
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
What else?

2101
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Why?

2102
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
What would you do?

2103
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
No, I would sell it as well.

2104
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Yeah, of course.

2105
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:58,000
It's funny to imagine like toy, like little toy phantoms revenge or like Hasbro-ified family friendly versions.

2106
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:03,000
You have to imagine what happens after you sell the rights.

2107
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
What happens after I sell the rights is I just have some money.

2108
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
I don't know.

2109
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
If they, what would they do?

2110
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
They would, okay, in this ridiculous scenario, they come to me.

2111
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
They're like, wow, we love your game.

2112
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:20,000
We're going to make, we're going to make our own, we're going to remake Phantom Horn on the, on the switch.

2113
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,000
We're going to, we're going to make a whole series of like comic books about him.

2114
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:29,000
We're going to have a whole, it's going to be tied into like the G5.

2115
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
We're, we're going to, we're going to make some changes though.

2116
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
We're going to make some changes with the character.

2117
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I would be like, sure, whatever.

2118
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
It would, it just wouldn't matter.

2119
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Will they get the rights to TBAP?

2120
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Will they get 50% of the rights?

2121
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:49,000
It just wouldn't matter that much to me because like, they could do all that if they want to.

2122
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Honestly, like it wouldn't, even if like they did that, it wouldn't, it wouldn't change anything.

2123
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
It wouldn't like stuff that, it wouldn't change what I think about the character.

2124
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Like just none of that would be canon in my mind.

2125
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Like it just, there would be a, there would be a line between like the stuff that I made,

2126
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:16,000
like the stuff, the story that I wrote about this character and all that shit.

2127
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:21,000
And like, and, and then like I sold it and then they did some stuff with it.

2128
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I'd be like, whatever, they can do whatever they want.

2129
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,000
You should, my story is, my story is still my story.

2130
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
This is my story.

2131
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
And you're not part of it.

2132
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
You know, you should just.

2133
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:38,000
God, if they, if they wanted to put me in charge of like, I mean, yeah, I would definitely, yeah,

2134
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I would definitely take a job like that.

2135
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
No question.

2136
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Yeah.

2137
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Okay.

2138
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:49,000
In that case, if I'm like on the project, I'm like working on it, then yeah, sure.

2139
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Well, I take, I take that job.

2140
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,000
And I, and I, I'll have, I'll have the project decision to take.

2141
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Yeah, it is easy.

2142
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Get your OC and like the, but the backing and funding of like a large studio company to like make stuff.

2143
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Of course.

2144
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
If I get to say what I want.

2145
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
You sold out Ben.

2146
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
You used to be indie.

2147
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Just, just imagine if that happened to Christian was a sonic shoe.

2148
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:27,000
People were saying, someone was saying in the comments of the last video that I guess Christian was going to be on smiling friends.

2149
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Oh yeah, I saw that.

2150
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Christian was, was, was going to be the voice.

2151
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I have, I still have not seen smiling friends with Christian was going to be the voice of the puddle.

2152
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Yes.

2153
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I guess.

2154
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
I saw this clip.

2155
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Too expensive.

2156
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It was, I don't know, they didn't get into like why that it's expensive, but they said something like,

2157
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,000
you can't just get one person to do one line and one thing.

2158
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:55,000
You can have one and they got like a chills the number 15.

2159
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Yeah.

2160
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Yeah.

2161
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:58,000
They got that guy.

2162
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:04,000
But like, if you want Christian to voice characters, they need to be in multiple episodes.

2163
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I'm, I don't know why that costs more to have them only in one voice clip.

2164
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Something must be like, I don't know.

2165
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Was that actually true?

2166
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Some sort of workers thing.

2167
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Well, that's what Zach said.

2168
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
And there was a clip he was talking about why they couldn't do it.

2169
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:28,000
So that the show's budget, the show's budget wouldn't allow for it.

2170
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:35,000
And they didn't want to have Christian on multiple episodes because it would have been a nightmare to get her to do things.

2171
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Yeah.

2172
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I guess it's kind of like trying to get a dog to do something.

2173
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:43,000
I mean, yeah, she would, it would be incredibly.

2174
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Wait, is that really the reason just like they were like, it would be hard to work with her?

2175
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,000
No, no, no.

2176
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Well, it's more complex than they explained.

2177
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:01,000
But the gist of it is, is that the budgetary reasons mean they couldn't really do that.

2178
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
And then later, like, I don't know.

2179
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,000
So it's not that she's expensive is just that having her on the show.

2180
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
No, it's not that Christian has like a high price tag.

2181
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:19,000
It's that the way that they do like a hiring people would have made it more expensive beyond the budgetary thing.

2182
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I guess because you've got to compensate them for using their voice in a small part rather than like a larger part.

2183
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I don't really get it.

2184
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I have no idea why that's the thing.

2185
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
You can't just use them for free like, you know, somebody else might.

2186
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Well, you'd have to pay them something.

2187
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
But I don't know why it would be more expensive for just a bit part like one line.

2188
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
You can't just have a crew of people work for you for free.

2189
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
It's just like the thing we were saying before.

2190
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Yeah, has absolutely no relation to anything that we've discussed previously.

2191
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
What, smiling friends?

2192
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:57,000
No, I just made a comment about, don't worry about it.

2193
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Yeah, don't worry about it, Ben.

2194
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:02,000
What's going on?

2195
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Anyway, speaking of working hard, I've been working hard on my secret project, I think.

2196
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
That damn thing.

2197
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
So there's two secret projects.

2198
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:18,000
I was saying, you've been saying that yours is getting close to being ready.

2199
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:23,000
And it's, and I'm like, I was expecting mine to be done.

2200
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Shit.

2201
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Oh, no.

2202
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I was sure it was going to be done this month.

2203
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
It's still, I still might be done this.

2204
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I think I can still do it this month.

2205
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I don't see why not.

2206
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:38,000
But if you, depending on if it's like this week or next week or the week after, you might beat me.

2207
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I might beat you.

2208
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I can't say for any certainty.

2209
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:47,000
But like last year, I was hoping that I could wrap that up.

2210
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
And it turns out no.

2211
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Okay.

2212
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,000
So it became more clear that it would take a few moments, but it's been a few moments.

2213
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,000
And we've got, well, it's got closer.

2214
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:05,000
I'm very excited to be able to like say it's coming out and all that.

2215
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:13,000
But because I've been working so hard on that, I've sort of fallen behind on like fulfilling Lord of Ghost Kickstarter things.

2216
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Mailing stuff is expensive and confusing and scary.

2217
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:28,000
And I actually got like, I sent a few of them out and I got like somebody telling me that there was a gash in the, the envelope.

2218
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
And the red man comic had fallen out.

2219
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Everyone's supposed to get a red man comic.

2220
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
They only got the Lord of Ghosts.

2221
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Did they like, they cut the envelope open?

2222
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I don't know why it came with a gash.

2223
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I'm assuming customs cut it open to look inside because customs is customs.

2224
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Customs is customs.

2225
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Customs is customs for sure.

2226
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:53,000
And they didn't seal it up or something because I kind of imagined they'd be delicate.

2227
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
It's a postal service.

2228
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
They don't give a shit.

2229
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Yeah, that's the issue.

2230
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,000
It's not first class.

2231
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:04,000
You're located in the UK and I think the majority of the fans are in the US, I would assume.

2232
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
It's, it's weird.

2233
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:11,000
It's not like, I guess it's a majority coming from one country, but like there's quite a lot coming from other countries.

2234
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Yeah.

2235
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:19,000
There's a, it's like 60, 40 US and other.

2236
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:24,000
So shipping to other countries is pretty expensive, I'd imagine.

2237
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
It's expensive.

2238
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I've been like looking at like prices and been like, is it cheaper to go through this?

2239
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Which has tracking and, but I don't know like how reliable it is or is it cheaper to go through this?

2240
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Which is probably more reliable, but doesn't have tracking unless you pay a lot more.

2241
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,000
I'm like, how important is tracking?

2242
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:48,000
If the parcel arrives with a, with a fucking hole in it and something's fallen out.

2243
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I don't want that to happen more than once.

2244
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:57,000
So I'm like, I'm not sure really what to do with all that stuff.

2245
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:03,000
That's why whenever I saw stuff on eBay, I just sell it to the US locally.

2246
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I hate having to deal with shipping stuff overseas.

2247
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Yeah.

2248
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I mean, I think part of the reason it's stressful was because I didn't know the, the cost of sending all these things would, would be so high.

2249
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Um, because of the weight of the comics.

2250
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I, I tried not to have like the comics have too thick of paper to keep down the weight,

2251
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:32,000
but even at like a normal, like, oh, this is a normal page and it's not too thick and it's not like flimsy thin.

2252
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Um, it still weighs quite a bit and it bumps the price up.

2253
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Yeah, paper is a lot heavier than you'd expect.

2254
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I have a, I have a bunch of old issues of Nintendo, Nintendo Power Magazine stacked on top of each other.

2255
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,000
And one time I tried lifting it and it was so heavy.

2256
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I couldn't lift all of them at the same time.

2257
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,000
You know, that was, I was back before I worked out.

2258
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Now I can lift them just fine, but you know, they are pretty heavy.

2259
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
One little finger.

2260
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Oh, I just haven't worked out in over a month now.

2261
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Oh, almost we're going on two months.

2262
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I'm getting, I'm nearing the two month barrier.

2263
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
So I've, I've been losing weight though.

2264
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I've been losing weight.

2265
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
So that's cool.

2266
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,000
That's good.

2267
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
So I'm doing something.

2268
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Yeah.

2269
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:18,000
But have you been losing a muscle weight or fat weight?

2270
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
I could, I think I'm losing fat weight.

2271
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I don't think I'm looking a little skinnier.

2272
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I'm probably, I mean, I'm probably losing muscle too because I'm not working out.

2273
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
So that's bad.

2274
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I could stand to lose a little more.

2275
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
You know, not all weight is bad.

2276
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:34,000
It depends on the quality of the weight.

2277
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Yeah.

2278
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
The weight is in the boobies.

2279
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
That's great.

2280
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Nah, get it all out of here.

2281
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Cut it all out.

2282
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Scoop it out of me and dump it in the trash.

2283
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Speaking of boobs.

2284
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Hey, you seen February?

2285
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
February?

2286
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I've seen a little bit.

2287
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Actually, I do have something.

2288
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I've seen a little.

2289
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Something that relates.

2290
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,000
They're here and there.

2291
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
And it relates to that.

2292
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
No, I just started saying my thing.

2293
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Well, I guess the only thing is to say, go check out my tweets.

2294
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I'm posting daily boob art on big girl squish.

2295
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
All right.

2296
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Yeah, I've seen that.

2297
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Pretty good.

2298
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I've been, I've been, I've been seeing a little bit.

2299
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I feel like, I feel like I need, I need to like actually try to improve my, my skills.

2300
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
It's, it's one thing to like keep drawing every day and get a habit of it.

2301
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:38,000
But it's another thing to like make the drawings count for more.

2302
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:51,000
You know, I want it to be both a funny thing, a habit building thing and a skill improving

2303
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
thing.

2304
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
But a lot of the time I get to the end of the day, work it on secret project.

2305
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
And I'm tired.

2306
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,000
And I'm like, fuck, I'll just draw something.

2307
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
There we go.

2308
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Put it up.

2309
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:07,000
And sometimes it's great that a lot of the time it's just sort of a little doodle, not

2310
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,000
to it.

2311
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Yeah, it's hard to like do a bunch of different things at the same time because you, even

2312
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,260
if you have the time to do it all, you kind of spend all your energy working on one thing

2313
02:21:18,260 --> 02:21:24,000
and then you're exhausted to, you're too exhausted to work on something else.

2314
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Yeah.

2315
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:31,800
I'm looking forward to the secret project being done and I can focus on sending a lot

2316
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:35,840
of ghost things and then don't know what I'll do with my time.

2317
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:38,080
But I think the lot of ghosts is going to take a while.

2318
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:42,640
I still got all those doodles to do, still got all the lot of ghosts, plush costumes

2319
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,480
to make, which shouldn't take too long.

2320
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:48,000
I just need to cut out the bits of fabric.

2321
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,240
So on the fucking funny buttons on the, on as the eye holes.

2322
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:55,400
Yeah, those, those bushy things look pretty cool.

2323
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:58,640
And I noticed you changed, you changed the design.

2324
02:21:58,640 --> 02:21:59,640
Did I change the design?

2325
02:21:59,640 --> 02:22:03,000
Well, yeah, I mean, he doesn't have buttons in the comic.

2326
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:10,840
Well, no, it's just like a, I feel like if I tried to cut holes in a little sheet and

2327
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:16,440
then put like a black bit of fabric behind them or leave them open, that's a whole lot

2328
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:17,440
more like stuff.

2329
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:22,520
I thought, I assumed I thought it was just like drawn on with like a Sharpie.

2330
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:24,280
Well, I didn't want to go that.

2331
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:26,120
That would have looked terrible.

2332
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:27,120
Yeah.

2333
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:32,880
But like, isn't that like the, the point that like it kind of looks terrible?

2334
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:39,240
I suppose, but like, there's a part of me that wants it to like at least be durable.

2335
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:45,360
And, and like, I don't know if like Sharpie will wash off if you try to scrub it or if

2336
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:46,560
it gets dirty or whatever.

2337
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:51,440
Oh, I mean, I feel like a little, a little so Sharpie would probably be Sharpie would

2338
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:52,680
be a bad choice for that.

2339
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:53,200
Yeah.

2340
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:58,920
I could probably find something, but like, where when in real life, when fabric is like

2341
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:03,440
ruffled and something's drawn on it, it completely distorts it to the point where it

2342
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:04,440
doesn't look like anything.

2343
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:10,520
So just like a, like a black smear, I feel like a button is cuter and does the same job.

2344
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:11,520
And I have some buttons.

2345
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:12,520
So it's fine.

2346
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:13,520
Yeah.

2347
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:14,520
That makes sense.

2348
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:15,520
Yeah.

2349
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:16,520
I'm satisfied.

2350
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:26,360
Well, I do have something that's kind of titillating, I don't know, it's kind of related.

2351
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:27,360
It's kind of weird.

2352
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:28,360
Yeah.

2353
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:34,520
I've seen this, if you're like into anime stuff, I know this might have a reputation.

2354
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:39,200
I linked, it's called a Keiko Kamin.

2355
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:42,080
I've not seen this.

2356
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:46,720
You know, you can read the Wikipedia entry on it.

2357
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:51,400
It's kind of, it's kind of weird.

2358
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:52,400
Kind of weird.

2359
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:53,400
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.

2360
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:54,400
I don't know.

2361
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:56,840
Maybe somebody, some people find it funny.

2362
02:23:56,840 --> 02:23:59,200
It's a weird Japanese thing.

2363
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:04,240
Have any of you ever seen it before?

2364
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:05,840
I'm reading about it.

2365
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:11,520
Teachers are something, something, misadventures of a student named Mayumi Takahashi who attends

2366
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,520
a boarding school.

2367
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:16,640
The teachers are constantly looking for ways to torture or humiliate the students and from

2368
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:20,000
this teachers derive sexual satisfaction.

2369
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:23,840
And then there's a superhero involved, I guess to kill the teachers.

2370
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:24,840
Yeah.

2371
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:26,320
It's, it's kind of weird.

2372
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:34,040
I encountered it recently and it's like a hero, a female hero that doesn't wear any

2373
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:36,560
clothing for some reason.

2374
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:39,160
It's pretty, pretty interesting.

2375
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:41,120
Oh, I thought she was wearing a white jumpsuit.

2376
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:42,120
Oh, she's naked.

2377
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:43,120
Yeah.

2378
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:44,120
That's her costume.

2379
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,120
You know, I don't know.

2380
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:50,400
I don't know who came up with this, but it's pretty, pretty weird.

2381
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:57,160
And they made a surprisingly large amount of like media out of this.

2382
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:59,160
She's got, she's got nunchucks.

2383
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:01,480
Did she always use nunchucks?

2384
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:02,760
Is that like her signature weapon?

2385
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:03,760
I don't know.

2386
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:07,960
I haven't really watched this because, or read it because there's like a, I think there's

2387
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:14,320
a comic book series and there's, maybe there's an anime and there's, I think even a live

2388
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:15,560
action show.

2389
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:21,080
So I saw a clip of the live action show, but I haven't seen any of the other stuff.

2390
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:28,320
It doesn't strike me as a work of quality, but it's definitely interesting or funny in

2391
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:31,440
an ironic way.

2392
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:32,440
I'm reading the plot.

2393
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:33,440
Okay.

2394
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:38,760
First year student, Mayumi Takashi, attends a junior high school called Sparta Academy

2395
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:43,520
where the penalty for any student, usually girls, making the slightest mistake is being

2396
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:49,680
sexually humiliated by the perverted, corrupt and misogynistic teachers running the school,

2397
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:55,520
the principal being a demonic jester like villain named toenail of Satan.

2398
02:25:55,520 --> 02:26:00,360
However, before the teachers can take their sexual advantages too far, Keiko Kamen steps

2399
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:05,680
in and delivers a sound beating to the teachers and usually performs a finishing attack by

2400
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,760
jumping into the air and landing crutch first onto her opponent's face.

2401
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:21,800
Yeah, that's some, you know, Yosuke from Yu-yu Hakushoi has the spirit ray gun thing.

2402
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:29,840
And I guess that's what, you know, this Keiko Kamen has, you know, her own special move.

2403
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:32,000
You can call it that.

2404
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,920
It's pretty special.

2405
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:36,400
This entire thing is pretty special.

2406
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:44,520
If you say so, man.

2407
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:45,520
It's just a really weird.

2408
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:46,920
Is it good?

2409
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:47,920
But is it good?

2410
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:48,920
No, I don't think so.

2411
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:49,920
It's pretty terrible.

2412
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:50,920
Okay.

2413
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:51,920
Okay, cool.

2414
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:56,720
It's just, it's just kind of amusing from like an ironic perspective.

2415
02:26:56,720 --> 02:27:04,480
You know, I saw, I saw somebody review this on like some bad movie review blog.

2416
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:10,000
So, I just thought it was so fascinating that something like this actually exists.

2417
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:16,960
You know, that's, that's the thing about like anime and, and all the, all this Japanese

2418
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:23,120
media is that it's like almost every idea that can exist does exist.

2419
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:25,560
You know, no matter, no matter how horrible it is.

2420
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:28,680
Yeah, I mean, there's nothing, there's nothing new under the sun.

2421
02:27:28,680 --> 02:27:30,960
Every idea has been done before.

2422
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:38,200
This doesn't seem that strange for Japanese, like anime weirdness, like all this perverts.

2423
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:42,840
And there's a girl who beats them up, you know, funny costume or, you know, lack of

2424
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:43,840
costume.

2425
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:46,600
Says a lot, says a lot, says a lot about society.

2426
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:47,600
Yeah.

2427
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:49,000
Well, it says a lot about us.

2428
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,080
I guess we brought this in or that I brought it in.

2429
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:53,080
It's you.

2430
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:55,080
This is all you.

2431
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:57,720
No, it's, it's your guys is fucked.

2432
02:27:57,720 --> 02:28:00,080
This is your, your weird show.

2433
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:01,880
I guess we, we invited you.

2434
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:04,680
So I guess it's sort of our fault by extension.

2435
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:08,240
You're, you're corrupting the Gamer's Tavern brand.

2436
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:09,240
Just like that one.

2437
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:10,240
Yes.

2438
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:11,240
That one.

2439
02:28:11,240 --> 02:28:12,240
So long ago.

2440
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:13,240
Yes.

2441
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:14,960
We've turned you evil and edgy.

2442
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:17,120
We've turned you into an anime knower.

2443
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:19,200
You know about anime now.

2444
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:21,200
That is pretty unforgivable.

2445
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:22,200
Yeah.

2446
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:23,200
Yeah.

2447
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:26,440
Actually, I thought about trying to do some anime content, but it doesn't seem very

2448
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:29,280
appropriate for, you know, Gamer's Tavern.

2449
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:30,280
For Gamer's.

2450
02:28:30,280 --> 02:28:31,280
Yeah.

2451
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:36,800
I can't think of anything that I, anything less, that I'd less expect a Gamer to like

2452
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:37,800
than anime.

2453
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:38,800
Yeah.

2454
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:41,800
That's, that's a good point.

2455
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:46,160
Well, just got to do an anime game.

2456
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:49,160
You got to make a video about an anime game and that'll bridge the gap.

2457
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:52,440
You got to do that as like your, your, your dues, pay your dues.

2458
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:57,120
You got to make a separate channel called the anime algorithm and then, and put all

2459
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:59,320
of the, the anime stuff in there.

2460
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:00,320
Yeah.

2461
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:01,920
That's probably, that's a good idea.

2462
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:07,360
And then I can collaborate with, you know, famous anime YouTubers like Trixie the Golden

2463
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:11,880
Witch.

2464
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:14,920
I thought it was really funny.

2465
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:22,880
You know who replied to that, the tweet that I made about her, her terrible ratio was Shade,

2466
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,880
the younger Collins.

2467
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:24,880
Oh yeah.

2468
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:25,880
I saw that.

2469
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:29,720
Shade, I was, I was, I was surprised.

2470
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:34,560
He replied just to say that like, yeah, can't, can't ride those coattails anymore.

2471
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:35,560
Yeah.

2472
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:38,080
I'm didn't, didn't work before, but now I can't even try.

2473
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:39,080
I think that's what he said.

2474
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:40,080
And I was like, wow.

2475
02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:42,200
I mean, true.

2476
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:44,000
I mean, it's just true what you're saying.

2477
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:49,240
I'm pretty surprised that that was his attitude about it.

2478
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:53,320
I, I guess it doesn't really, I guess it doesn't surprise me.

2479
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:57,160
I mean, it, it's a fair attitude.

2480
02:29:57,160 --> 02:30:08,840
I guess I, you know, I guess it's like his, his mom, Trixie's mom and Shade's mom unfriended

2481
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:11,240
me on Twitter, unfollowed me on Twitter.

2482
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:12,240
Oh really?

2483
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:13,240
That's pretty sad.

2484
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:14,240
Yeah.

2485
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:20,480
We were, we were Twitter followers.

2486
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:28,640
We were, we were Mewchies because we were both Bernie supporters and Trixie, I guess,

2487
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:33,960
I think this was when Trixie had moved back in with her mom.

2488
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:39,400
And I got to assume that Trixie said, nah, Ben's mean, Ben's mean to me.

2489
02:30:39,400 --> 02:30:43,000
And she said, oh, well, I'm going to unfollow, I'm going to unfollow him on Twitter then.

2490
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,560
Like, I won't follow such a bully.

2491
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:47,560
And I assume that's how it went.

2492
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:48,560
Yeah, I'm sure that's how I played out.

2493
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:51,800
So it's exactly how, how else.

2494
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:52,800
So she unfollowed me.

2495
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:58,840
So I guess I had just kind of assumed that by making an enemy of Trixie, I was making

2496
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:03,720
an enemy of her whole family, but maybe not.

2497
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:10,480
There was actually, there was a video that Victor did a while back, or kind of recently,

2498
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:17,280
I think, where Trixie was sort of in it towards the end on the Vic and Hope channel.

2499
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:18,280
Yeah.

2500
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:19,280
Yeah.

2501
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:24,000
And she just kind of pops in towards the end of one of their, like, I think they were

2502
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,160
playing Bloodborne or something like that.

2503
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:30,360
It's like a, you know, that's really weird.

2504
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:31,360
It's funny.

2505
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:32,360
I didn't hear about that.

2506
02:31:32,360 --> 02:31:33,520
That's interesting.

2507
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:37,720
I guess it doesn't shock me too much because I do know, I did know that they're living

2508
02:31:37,720 --> 02:31:39,360
in Virginia again.

2509
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:41,920
So I guess they could do that.

2510
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:47,120
So I just brought it up because I figured this means that, you know, Vic and Hope, you

2511
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:51,720
and Trixie are on good terms, I would have imagined.

2512
02:31:51,720 --> 02:32:00,200
I would never imagine, I would be shocked to hear that like Vic was not on good terms

2513
02:32:00,200 --> 02:32:06,800
because Trixie has spent like her entire life like bullying him and he has just been fine

2514
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:09,280
with it.

2515
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:14,000
You could see it in the, you could see it in the, in the documentary, Trixie like snaps

2516
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:16,640
at Vic several times for no reason at all.

2517
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:19,800
She just like snaps at him and treats him like, like, like shit.

2518
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:21,520
I wasn't, I wasn't aware of that.

2519
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:25,240
I guess I should watch, watch that, that footage.

2520
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:27,640
There's one or two moments in the documentary that left me.

2521
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:30,520
It's like, why, why are you, why are you talking to him like that?

2522
02:32:30,520 --> 02:32:31,520
Yeah.

2523
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:37,120
I mean, it's not, I mean, it's not all the time, obviously.

2524
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:41,880
It's just, it's just sometimes it would take, I feel like it would take a lot.

2525
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:45,560
to make Vic be like upset.

2526
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:51,120
Well, I wonder what his opinion is on the whole Yegg studio thing, because he doesn't

2527
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:53,720
mention it in that video at all.

2528
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:54,440
And they don't talk about it.

2529
02:32:54,440 --> 02:33:02,600
I would, I would imagine that he takes the common sense approach, which is, well, my

2530
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:07,840
sibling had a pretty lucrative career and that's pretty much down the drain now.

2531
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:15,720
Same one, same one, Shade took, and also just the factual truth.

2532
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:21,200
Well, then I wonder if Shade is going to be cut out of the family or something.

2533
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:27,360
I very much doubt it's so serious.

2534
02:33:28,360 --> 02:33:30,280
Yeah, Shade can do what they like.

2535
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:32,560
Shade can do whatever they like.

2536
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:33,560
Yeah.

2537
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:38,440
Um, yeah, what are we talking about?

2538
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:40,440
Shall we get to voicemails?

2539
02:33:40,480 --> 02:33:43,080
Oh, God, fuck, I forgot about voicemails.

2540
02:33:43,480 --> 02:33:45,440
Did you forgot about voicemails?

2541
02:33:45,560 --> 02:33:46,920
Hang on, I get, I get a pee.

2542
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:50,360
I will go to the, I'm going to go to the bathroom and when I get back, we will

2543
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:52,880
hope there's not too many.

2544
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:59,960
Now is a, now is a good time to do our routine negative Ben St.

2545
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:00,960
talk.

2546
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:04,520
Nah, I think that joke's played out.

2547
02:34:05,240 --> 02:34:06,240
Yeah.

2548
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:07,320
Now it's for real.

2549
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:08,320
It's no longer a joke.

2550
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:08,840
Yeah, exactly.

2551
02:34:08,840 --> 02:34:09,320
We've got to.

2552
02:34:09,320 --> 02:34:10,320
I hate Ben St.

2553
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:11,520
Gotta get all the negativity.

2554
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:12,520
So mean.

2555
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:20,320
He's real, he's real mean on Twitter, you know, he has a big, mean, mean issue on

2556
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:22,280
Twitter, big, big, mean streak.

2557
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:25,240
He's a beast on the internet.

2558
02:34:25,720 --> 02:34:30,880
He's a ravenous beast and he'll bite you and suck all your blood out and he'll

2559
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:31,680
laugh about it.

2560
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:33,800
No empathy or, and that's not untrue.

2561
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:35,120
And he would, he would agree.

2562
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:36,600
No empathy or compassion.

2563
02:34:38,240 --> 02:34:39,240
Pure logic.

2564
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:40,920
Light yagami.

2565
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:44,560
If he had a death note, he'd use it on you.

2566
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:49,400
Yeah, maybe.

2567
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:50,640
I mean, I don't know what I did.

2568
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:54,960
We just use it to make more money, you know, because less people on the show

2569
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:57,000
would mean more money going to him.

2570
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Now, if I think of the draw, think of the give and take draw, I'm a lucrative

2571
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
brand.

2572
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Yeah, that's true.

2573
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:10,000
If it was just him, probably viewership would sink to an all-time low.

2574
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Would sink to zero.

2575
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Everyone's here for me.

2576
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Yeah, that's a good point, you know.

2577
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:19,000
99.9% are Gibb fans.

2578
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:23,000
That's the, that's the last holdout of the PCP fan base.

2579
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Okay, speakpipe.com.

2580
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
We're just saying lots of really great things about you.

2581
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
You're the, you're the best.

2582
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Yes.

2583
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Well, we should change.

2584
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,000
We should call you a best saint from now on.

2585
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:43,000
I think so as well.

2586
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Shit.

2587
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Fuck, what's the password?

2588
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
123 PCP, you remember?

2589
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Yes.

2590
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Yes.

2591
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Thank you.

2592
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
All right, sorry.

2593
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
I'm logged out of everything.

2594
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,000
I got to, what's the...

2595
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Just say the password to your bank account on the recording.

2596
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Oh, got it.

2597
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Oh, there's too many.

2598
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Okay, it's not, it's not that bad.

2599
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Only an hour, you think?

2600
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I, let's try and get through it in less than an hour.

2601
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,000
I got, I got, I got comics to draw.

2602
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:26,000
What?

2603
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Why is it taking you so long to download?

2604
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Two second long, okay, whatever.

2605
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:40,000
All right, the first one here is called, is, is called, it's another voicemail.

2606
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Wait, sorry, I skipped one.

2607
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
I skipped one.

2608
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Actually, the first voicemail is this image here.

2609
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,000
I will post it.

2610
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Was this my one?

2611
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:54,000
I think they're criticizing your, your, your Minesweeper play.

2612
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Notable only because Gib died at one hour by flagging all of the spaces in green

2613
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
and then clicking one of the magenta spaces.

2614
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
This is from, this is from the, is it the, is it the Minesweeper bonus episode

2615
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:11,000
or the Minesweeper Picross bonus episode?

2616
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Yeah, yeah, it must have been.

2617
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I don't think we did another one of those.

2618
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,000
No, we only did one, but it was, it was combined.

2619
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
It was both, both games.

2620
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I must have, I must have missed that because I was rushing to try and completely own you.

2621
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,000
I can't, I can't imagine playing Minesweeper for over an hour.

2622
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,000
That's crazy.

2623
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:41,000
I came to appreciate that it is actually, I came to appreciate more of the strategy involved in it.

2624
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Once there's a strategy, once you understand that it can be solved and it's not just like good luck.

2625
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
It's not, it's not just clicking around.

2626
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Yeah.

2627
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Then, then it becomes like, you know, with every click, more information.

2628
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:55,000
It's like a tiny little extra puzzle every time.

2629
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Yeah, I'm pretty horrible at Minesweeper.

2630
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:58,000
It's very engaging.

2631
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I can't last even a few minutes.

2632
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:06,000
You know, I'm pretty bad at anything involving Mines, you know, Minecraft, Minesweeper.

2633
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Any other Mines related games?

2634
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Uh, Mastermind.

2635
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Mastermind's great.

2636
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Very similar to Whirtle, as I think I said previously.

2637
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:23,000
I've been killing Whirtle, by the way.

2638
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I've been playing on hard mode and I've been getting into like threes.

2639
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
I've been getting threes and threes.

2640
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Oh, I've always played for as it sucks.

2641
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:37,000
I've gotten a bunch of threes lately and I feel I'm on top of the world.

2642
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I feel like quite a lot of my forums could have easily been threes if I just so happened to choose a different letter.

2643
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

2644
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Which is, I had most of the word there, but oh, it's another word ending in ight.

2645
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
ight?

2646
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
ight?

2647
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Okay, the next voicemail is this one that I posted here.

2648
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:05,000
It's called is another voicemail from DoidGazer.

2649
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Three, two, one, go.

2650
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Hi, it's world-renowned webcomic artist DoidGazer again.

2651
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:20,000
And I'm just calling in to let everyone know that I am opening up tryouts to be my new best friend.

2652
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Requirements are you must be less successful than me.

2653
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:32,000
You must be able to smoke weed at a similar rate as I, which is a lot.

2654
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
We smoke a lot of weed.

2655
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Also, you have to enjoy birds cooking and yeah.

2656
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
So less successful.

2657
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Be my friend.

2658
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:47,000
So yeah, apply on my Twitter at DoidGazer.

2659
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Thanks.

2660
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Head over.

2661
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:56,000
We should all head over to DoidGazer on Twitter.

2662
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:04,000
I'm not a big DoidGazers fan personally, so how do you recommend somebody be DoidGazer's friend?

2663
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:07,000
I do recommend anyone that has not seen it.

2664
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Check out DoidGazer's comic about, I'm in it.

2665
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:18,000
They made a little comic about, you know, about Yig.

2666
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,000
The comic is real.

2667
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I thought that was a joke.

2668
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:25,000
No, they did draw a little comic.

2669
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
I'll check that out.

2670
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Just Yig things.

2671
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I retweeted it.

2672
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Yeah, check them out.

2673
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Okay, next one is a Vokeroo.

2674
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
I guess it doesn't have a title.

2675
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Three, two, one, go.

2676
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:42,000
My conclusions that I would draw is, I hate Big Mac.

2677
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I hate cross-tresses.

2678
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I hate transchangers.

2679
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I hate transsexuals.

2680
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
I hate trans.

2681
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Everybody, everybody sucks.

2682
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Fuck you all.

2683
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Yeah, that's agreed.

2684
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Absolutely.

2685
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Back in the base era of the PCP.

2686
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,000
What happens?

2687
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
That was a T-Bat episode that me and Jesse were on, I think.

2688
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Remember that?

2689
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:11,000
We were talking about Big Mac, an episode where he dresses up in a dress.

2690
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Was that before or after the PCP existed?

2691
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
That was after, I think.

2692
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
I don't really remember.

2693
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Wait, that was on T-Bat?

2694
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Yeah.

2695
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,000
It must have been a T-Bat podcast, one of the later ones.

2696
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Yeah, one of the later ones.

2697
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
I forget about those.

2698
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:34,000
I think my angle, it made for a bit of a laugh.

2699
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:41,000
But I think in terms of analyzing the episode, I didn't know what I was talking about.

2700
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I remember you having a better take on the episode itself.

2701
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:48,000
What about it?

2702
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
I don't remember at all.

2703
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:53,000
I just remember being like, yeah, I don't know what I'm doing here.

2704
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I'm just talking about horse.

2705
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
I also don't.

2706
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:01,000
God, I don't fucking remember.

2707
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:06,000
I remember he puts on the dress to impersonate someone

2708
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:14,000
or to get into the women's bathroom so that he can molest people.

2709
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Yeah, exactly.

2710
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:22,000
I don't remember anything, but I definitely agree that my take was better than yours

2711
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
because I'm really smart.

2712
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,000
I'm positive that's true.

2713
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Okay, next one is further voice grail reparations.

2714
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Three, two, one, go.

2715
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:42,000
For their contribution to sweet, freakin' memes,

2716
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:48,000
y'all should put doigazers in the voice grail.

2717
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Also that Ben St. Biocomics was pretty great.

2718
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:57,000
I think doigazers deserves voice grail at this point.

2719
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Yeah, I agree with that.

2720
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:02,000
You haven't done that yet?

2721
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
No.

2722
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
They made a whole album.

2723
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
They made a whole album.

2724
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
They did.

2725
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
I'll give it to you.

2726
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Yeah, voice grail.

2727
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Voice grail for doigazers.

2728
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Reparations complete.

2729
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Equality achieved.

2730
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Next one is flipper.

2731
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Three, two, one, go.

2732
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
What's that flipper?

2733
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
And Saint?

2734
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:37,000
He can deadlift five times his own body weight?

2735
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,000
That's true.

2736
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Oh my god.

2737
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
That's absolutely true.

2738
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Why is flipper telling him this?

2739
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:49,000
And why is flipper screaming like a horde of girls?

2740
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:53,000
It's very exciting, you know.

2741
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
It's nothing.

2742
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Five times a body weight?

2743
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:00,000
You're just as strong as an ant.

2744
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Easily.

2745
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Easily.

2746
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Stronger even.

2747
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Okay, I'm trying to load this next one, this next image.

2748
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
It's a whole image album.

2749
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Best rival reason.

2750
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Yeah, this image, this Imgur album.

2751
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
It's the same thing twice.

2752
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Oh, why is it the same?

2753
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Yeah, okay.

2754
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Best rival reason anime, Sasuke and Naruto, Goku and Vegeta,

2755
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Guts and Griffith, Ben Saint and the Golden Witch.

2756
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
It's just true.

2757
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Yeah, that's my favorite one.

2758
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Nothing more.

2759
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
The Golden Witch.

2760
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:41,000
My favorite rivalry of all time.

2761
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:45,000
I would say it's better than whatever stupid Japanese cartoon

2762
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:49,000
other people might nominate.

2763
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Alright, next voicemail is called Voicing My Opinion,

2764
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Tee Hee, 3, 2, 1, go.

2765
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Local feminization is cool and all,

2766
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
but doing it requires you to confront and deeply think about

2767
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
the physicality of all the muscles in your throat.

2768
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
And if there's one thing I hate doing,

2769
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
it's remembering that I am in fact a physical object

2770
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:10,000
that exists in the real world and as such can be destroyed.

2771
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Each fold of muscle or vein of blood is just a vulnerability

2772
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:16,000
that will eventually cease to function and rot away.

2773
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
I don't understand how anyone can watch a Transvoice Lessons video

2774
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:22,000
without feeling like their vocal tract is full of existential horrors.

2775
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,000
That's definitely something.

2776
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:29,000
That's definitely something I feel a little bit.

2777
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:32,000
I don't feel like body horror, but I do feel like,

2778
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:38,000
if only I wasn't born, then it wouldn't be a problem.

2779
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Things were so much simpler.

2780
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Things were so much simpler back in the pre-existence era.

2781
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Okay, next one is

2782
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:53,000
whether it be a no-nate episode or a solo Vencast.

2783
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:56,000
There it is. 3, 2, 1, go.

2784
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Aw, shit. This is not going to be on episode 300.

2785
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
I'm fucking with you.

2786
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Anyways, do all you PCP heads out there.

2787
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:06,000
The best episodes and moments of the podcast

2788
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
come from the topic of friendship is magic.

2789
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,000
No buts, all fans.

2790
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
I would say that's largely true.

2791
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Wait, what do you say the best episodes of the PCP come from?

2792
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Or come from conversations about MLP.

2793
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:25,000
I mean, we're all pretty well-versed on the subject.

2794
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:28,000
I think the last big one was like the My Little Pony movie,

2795
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,000
like the Disney-looking one.

2796
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Oh, sure.

2797
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I thought the best episode of the PCP was the yellow one.

2798
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:42,000
I remember if that episode had, like, good stuff in it,

2799
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:46,000
aside from the one, like, explosion.

2800
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I understand why people were into that one.

2801
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:51,000
I get it.

2802
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:54,000
I still have to go back and listen to a lot of those old episodes

2803
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:58,000
that everybody is clamoring to say are the best.

2804
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
People just go wild.

2805
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,000
People go wild for that yellow episode.

2806
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Next.

2807
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:05,000
What?

2808
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Hold on.

2809
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Why won't it...

2810
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,000
What?

2811
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Okay.

2812
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Oh, Jesus.

2813
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:13,000
All right.

2814
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:16,000
This next voicemail is six minutes long,

2815
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,000
and it's a vocaroo link.

2816
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
I think you missed one.

2817
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Oh, sorry.

2818
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,000
Yeah, you're right.

2819
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Sorry.

2820
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Okay.

2821
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
158 is called Don't Know How to Feel.

2822
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Guess I'll Just Cringe.

2823
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
Three, two, one, go.

2824
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Months and months ago, before the falling out with Trixie

2825
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:39,000
and everything, I left a drunken, fairly cringe voicemail

2826
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:43,000
taking some easy pot shots at Nate Bestman,

2827
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:47,000
making fun of him for being a dork-ass nerd

2828
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:51,000
who doesn't understand fuck about shit.

2829
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
And I was embarrassed, although it was funny

2830
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:56,000
how it triggered Trixie on the podcast.

2831
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
And I thought it was past me.

2832
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:03,000
But then, low and behold, episode 298.

2833
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Oblivion Fall sampled that random-ass voicemail

2834
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
as a lead-in to a beat.

2835
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:14,000
And while I am honored to have been sampled,

2836
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
I don't understand.

2837
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Oblivion Fall, you're not on this episode probably,

2838
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
but I know you're listening and I know you're in the comments.

2839
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Please explain why does one of my moments of cringe

2840
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:30,000
have to be prolonged and live for even a second longer

2841
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
than it had to in the consciousness?

2842
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,000
I don't know, man. I don't know how to feel.

2843
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:38,000
It makes me feel weird.

2844
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Wasn't that voicemail one?

2845
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Didn't Trixie get mad that, like,

2846
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:46,000
I don't know, some shit about, like,

2847
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:49,000
you should say it to Nate's face?

2848
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Oh, Trixie was like, don't...

2849
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Nate's not here to defend himself or something like that?

2850
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Where did she say this, exactly?

2851
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
No.

2852
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:03,000
I don't know. He mentions that Trixie got triggered

2853
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:07,000
by this voicemail that this person left criticizing Nate.

2854
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,000
And I'm trying to remember which voicemail it was.

2855
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
I don't remember.

2856
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Where did she, like, voice or distaste for this voicemail?

2857
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:19,000
She was on the episode.

2858
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:22,000
So you mean this is on an old episode of the PCP?

2859
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
It must have been...

2860
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:28,000
It must have been, like, her last appearance ever or something.

2861
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
This person says months and months ago.

2862
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
That must have been, like, a year or more ago.

2863
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Maybe, I don't even remember.

2864
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
They're just quite a while ago.

2865
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Yeah.

2866
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Okay, whatever.

2867
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:43,000
Anyway, this next one is fucking...

2868
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
This next one is six minutes long,

2869
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:51,000
but let's give it a shot.

2870
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Uh, what does that go...

2871
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:56,000
What do I have to do here?

2872
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:59,000
You can just open the Vocaroo link

2873
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:03,000
and just play it in the browser if you want to not download it.

2874
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
You got it?

2875
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Yeah, I have it.

2876
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Okay.

2877
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Alright, let's see.

2878
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
Three, two, one, go.

2879
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
The show's dark now.

2880
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Everybody cries.

2881
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:21,000
No more funny times for a kind, funny man.

2882
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:25,000
It's dark and depressing, but that's what makes it good.

2883
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:29,000
It's Kyle and Funny Man

2884
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:37,000
in space.

2885
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Alright, calm down.

2886
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Don't shit yourself.

2887
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Don't fucking cry.

2888
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Don't slobber all over your keyboard

2889
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:47,000
and fucking circuit yourself into oblivion and die.

2890
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Okay, we're still in the dark arc, alright?

2891
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:56,000
But this episode is a special musical episode,

2892
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:59,000
so you might enjoy that.

2893
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Just watch the episode, alright?

2894
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
It's like five minutes long, longer, maybe six.

2895
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Who knows?

2896
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Listen carefully and get emotionally invested now.

2897
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Huh, sigh.

2898
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Oh, man.

2899
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:20,000
I came to this weird, freaking wacky jungle planet

2900
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:23,000
to go on a crazy adventure,

2901
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:29,000
but instead I'm sad and confused about my place in life.

2902
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Same.

2903
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
And this is all because of last week,

2904
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,000
I had a huge falling out with Funny Man,

2905
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,000
and he went to have his solo episode where he goes to therapy.

2906
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:43,000
It's a deep psychoanalysis episode,

2907
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:47,000
and this is my episode where I go into the woods and be sad,

2908
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:50,000
and that's a recap of the storyline.

2909
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,000
So, yeah, I don't know what to do, man.

2910
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:59,000
I'm just feeling sad, and I guess I'll self-reflect

2911
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
through song?

2912
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I guess that's something I would do.

2913
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
I can hear the music.

2914
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
I can hear the backing track.

2915
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:17,000
I remember when we first met.

2916
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Funny Man broke into my ship.

2917
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:25,000
I thought he was a space pirate.

2918
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Did he come to rob me blind?

2919
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Oh, then we went on crazy adventures,

2920
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
and everybody loved it.

2921
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:40,000
We had fans, but now we hate each other.

2922
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
It makes me so sad.

2923
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:45,000
It makes me want to shit.

2924
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,000
How can you just leave me standing

2925
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:52,000
alone in a world that's so cold?

2926
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Maybe I'm just too demanding.

2927
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold.

2928
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Maybe you're just like my mother.

2929
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:07,000
She's never satisfied.

2930
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Why do we scream at each other?

2931
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:16,000
This is what it sounds like when Kyle cries.

2932
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Oh, man, I'm so fucking sad.

2933
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Wait, what is that?

2934
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:36,000
A spaceship landing on this planet?

2935
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
This remote-ass planet?

2936
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
What's going on here?

2937
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Hello, Kyle.

2938
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Mr. Funny Man?

2939
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
You're here?

2940
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
But...

2941
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Yes, I had my epic episode where I did psychoanalysis,

2942
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:01,000
and I worked through all my issues, and now I'm here.

2943
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Back with you, because I realized what was important was

2944
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:10,000
you, Kyle, being with you, having fun, going on adventures.

2945
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
That is what Kyle and Funny Man is all about.

2946
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:16,000
None of this deep stuff.

2947
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:22,000
It's all about funny, referential jokes to things,

2948
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:27,000
especially PCP memes, and that's what's so important around here.

2949
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:31,000
We need to have more funny, referential memes, Kyle.

2950
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Oh, my God, Kyle, I totally agree.

2951
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:38,000
While you were gone, I had this episode where I was stuck in the forest

2952
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:41,000
on this planet, and I was going crazy,

2953
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:45,000
and I did like an epic psychoanalyze as well,

2954
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:50,000
and I did like a thing where I sang a song, because it's a musical episode,

2955
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:54,000
and I sang a song, and I compared myself to my father,

2956
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,000
and yourself to my mother.

2957
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
It's kind of fucking weird, Kyle.

2958
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
It's kind of weird.

2959
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:06,000
I think a psychologist had a field day with that one,

2960
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:11,000
but at least we're back together, finally.

2961
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Yes, finally, the iconic pairing, Kyle and Funny Man.

2962
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:18,000
We're back together, and we're going on new, sweet, fucking cool adventures,

2963
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
and it's going to be the best.

2964
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Oh, my God, this is so good.

2965
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:26,000
And we went through our entire emotional arc in just like three or four episodes,

2966
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:30,000
so we still have like 17 episodes left of fucking sweet, juicy-ass content.

2967
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Oh, my God, the future's looking bright.

2968
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Well, Kyle, since you did say this was the musical episode,

2969
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:45,000
how about we end this episode off with a sweet musical performance?

2970
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Oh, my God, Funny Man, you're so on the money, so correct,

2971
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:55,000
and I think I got the exact right song.

2972
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Oh, yes, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

2973
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Yes, it's a song the people have been clamoring for.

2974
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:06,000
We haven't even heard it in like two episodes,

2975
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:09,000
and we're finally going to bring it back.

2976
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Let's go, yeah.

2977
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Oh, say can you feel safe by the dawn's early light?

2978
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:31,000
That was very heartwarming and touching performance.

2979
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:35,000
It took me through the whole range of human emotion.

2980
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:39,000
It started out in the depths,

2981
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:45,000
and then it swelled to triumphant heights in its darkest hour.

2982
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:49,000
I especially like the use of the music they use

2983
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:54,000
for when somebody's about to be voted off of a competition on television,

2984
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:59,000
and then they cry about it, and like, I tried my best.

2985
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:02,000
That was my favorite part, too.

2986
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Pretty good.

2987
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
I don't know.

2988
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Kyle and Funny Man for Voice Grail?

2989
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Are they already Voice Grail?

2990
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Are they already Voice Grail?

2991
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
I don't remember, actually.

2992
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Whatever.

2993
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Well, fuck them.

2994
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:19,000
If they're not, no, chuck them in there.

2995
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Chuck them all in there.

2996
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Ever in it.

2997
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Well, that was a, what more can I add?

2998
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:31,000
What can I add to the experience that was that voicemail?

2999
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Honestly, kind of justify that slide.

3000
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:35,000
I can't believe it.

3001
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Six-minute voicemail?

3002
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Didn't even mind.

3003
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Wasn't even bored.

3004
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Crazy.

3005
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Good shit.

3006
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Next voicemail is, it's a, this one is called

3007
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Red Man Comic Impression?

3008
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Three, two, one, go.

3009
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Here is my review of Rayman 2.

3010
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Wow!

3011
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Rayman!

3012
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:07,000
What the heck?

3013
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Nine out of ten?

3014
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Based!

3015
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
I remember that.

3016
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
The little Red Man Comic I did.

3017
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
I don't remember that.

3018
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:17,000
I don't remember that.

3019
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:21,000
It sounded just like I imagined he would sound.

3020
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:24,000
He reveals, reviews Rayman 2.

3021
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Bangs, pups and pangs together.

3022
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:31,000
That's totally forgot, totally forgot about that one.

3023
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:34,000
You'll find it in the Red Man Comic once I send you.

3024
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:35,000
I can't wait!

3025
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
I can't wait for my copy!

3026
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:42,000
I remember telling you that one of my favorite things you did was a Red Man Comic.

3027
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:48,000
So I'm quite pleased to see that you're turning that into a physical item.

3028
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Yeah.

3029
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:56,000
I can't wait to have mine all snug in my clutch to my bosom.

3030
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Next one is a image.

3031
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:03,000
My Norwegian aunt posted this on Instagram.

3032
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:08,000
I don't think she knows what Family Guy or Final Fantasy 7 is.

3033
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:11,000
What does it mean?

3034
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:14,000
Peter, I told you you have to stop.

3035
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
You must stop doing push-ups.

3036
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
One like.

3037
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:26,000
This reminds me of like, did you guys see, we probably know when the Final Fantasy 7

3038
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:30,000
like porn thing was played on the Italian...

3039
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Oh, I heard about that.

3040
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
The Italian Senate, Tifa.

3041
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:37,000
I heard about that.

3042
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:40,000
That's great.

3043
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:47,000
This, if you didn't know who Cloud or Peter was, I would see this and I would just think

3044
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:55,000
that it was like a fit guy being like, you did too many push-ups, bro, to a fat guy.

3045
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:59,000
If you didn't know who Cloud was, you'd probably be like, what the heck is he wearing?

3046
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
That's a really weird get-up.

3047
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Yeah.

3048
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:05,000
I think you'd go to the hair first.

3049
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
That's the more unusual part.

3050
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
I just don't...

3051
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:15,000
I don't see what would be funny about this if you didn't know.

3052
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
She must know...

3053
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
They must have Family Guy in Norway.

3054
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
How could she not know who Peter Griffin was?

3055
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:25,000
I would imagine she at least knows Family Guy.

3056
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
I mean, if I take...

3057
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
I guess I'll take this guy's word.

3058
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
I'd be surprised if she didn't know who Peter Griffin was.

3059
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:35,000
And if you don't know who these people, either of these people are, what's the joke?

3060
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
I don't get it.

3061
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Yeah, I can't explain it to you.

3062
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
My dude, I really can't.

3063
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:44,000
We know at the very least that Ben will never have this problem.

3064
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
He can never do too many push-ups.

3065
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
I can push...

3066
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:54,000
I can do push-ups ten times my body weight.

3067
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
Shit.

3068
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
The next one is called...

3069
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Shit, where did I put it?

3070
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
I think it's this one's 62.

3071
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Sorry, I'm looking for it.

3072
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Alright, 62.

3073
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
Here we go.

3074
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
One, go.

3075
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Hey, Gib, have you read the manga versions of the Ace One Piece novels?

3076
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
It came out a few months ago, and it's...

3077
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:24,000
The art's done by a Boichi who does the art for Doctor Stone.

3078
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
It looks really, really good.

3079
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
So if you haven't checked it out...

3080
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
I have seen those. There's like a...

3081
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:34,000
Firefist, Ace, Adventure, bit, and...

3082
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
Manga chapters.

3083
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
I don't know how much there is.

3084
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:41,000
I've seen a few of them. They look very good, yes.

3085
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:46,000
They sort of depict the events that are not shown fully in One Piece itself.

3086
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
It's like a side story.

3087
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
So they were mangas made about...

3088
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Manga chapters. I don't know about full-blown...

3089
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Maybe like two or three big chapters.

3090
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Did this guy say that they were based on novels?

3091
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Did I miss you?

3092
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:09,000
No, it's just part of...

3093
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Like when Ace was on Whitebeard's crew.

3094
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:15,000
Or like how he became to be on Whitebeard's crew.

3095
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:20,000
And stuff relating to Blackbeard and...

3096
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
Fucking some other stuff.

3097
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:25,000
So that's Canon?

3098
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Technically, I think yes.

3099
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
I don't know if all the characters would be considered Canon.

3100
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:32,000
I don't know if Oda invented them or not.

3101
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:35,000
But yeah, I have seen them. They look pretty good.

3102
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:38,000
Well, that's pretty cool.

3103
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
Okay, next one is called...

3104
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
Keep the Momentum Going.

3105
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
Three, two, one, go.

3106
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Alright, Ben.

3107
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:50,000
You've already made approximately five million dollars of sales

3108
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
off of the Plebe and the Weeb Blu-ray.

3109
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
But you must keep it going.

3110
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:58,000
Ben, you must create Plebe and the Weeb Season 3.

3111
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:59,000
Kickstart it now.

3112
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:06,000
You can get new guests with watching new, sweet anime or whatever.

3113
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Maybe just review comics.

3114
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
You got to do it, Ben. You got to do it.

3115
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
I got to do it.

3116
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
Plebe and the Weeb Season 3.

3117
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
I got to do it. It was on the Kickstarter.

3118
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
You got to do it.

3119
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:22,000
If I watch some anime, I can be a guest on that season.

3120
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
You'll be...

3121
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
Yeah, we'll do a guest episode with you.

3122
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
We'll have Cybershell on one.

3123
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
We'll have Living Fall on one.

3124
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
To Snake on one.

3125
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
Minerva.

3126
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Who's the guy who did Frog Fractions?

3127
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
Shit, what's that guy's name?

3128
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
How do I look like that guy's name?

3129
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3130
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Wait, he has a real name.

3131
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
He has a real name. Jim Storm Dancer.

3132
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
Jim Storm Dancer. That's it.

3133
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:56,000
You might have to change the title of the show.

3134
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
It could actually work because

3135
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:04,000
every episode only had, I think, around three people, usually.

3136
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
So...

3137
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
Yeah, it's easy.

3138
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
No, it'll be easy. We don't have to change anything.

3139
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:14,000
In fact, we can just recreate all the original episodes, word for word,

3140
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
just with new people.

3141
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
That saves us on writing.

3142
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
Right, exactly.

3143
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
We can arrange that for you.

3144
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:28,000
He's got connections. He's got big money connections.

3145
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:32,000
The next voicemail is...

3146
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
What is this called?

3147
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:38,000
I missed the 300th episode voicemail, so here's 301th.

3148
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:44,000
I wish I had 12 hours of PCP instead of heavy machinery at aah.com.

3149
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
Three, two, one, go.

3150
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:54,000
Congratulations on your 301th episode, guys.

3151
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Thanks. Is that Solaris to say?

3152
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
Thank you. Thank you.

3153
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
And good night.

3154
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
Yeah, 300.

3155
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Cool.

3156
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
We did it.

3157
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
Next one is called...

3158
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
Urgent Message from Wong Chan.

3159
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
Three, two, one, go.

3160
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:24,000
Hello. It is I, Wong Chan, calling you from China again.

3161
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:30,000
I have urgent message for the man known as Tom Oliver.

3162
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:36,000
You can send this message for me on behalf of the Wuhan Town in China.

3163
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Please, thank you.

3164
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:44,000
There is a message I need you to send to the man known as Tom Oliver is.

3165
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
Hello. How are you?

3166
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Thank you. Wong Chan, turning out.

3167
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:56,000
That's a very important message, so you better deliver it.

3168
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:06,000
I don't know about the deliberately super racist Chinese voice.

3169
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:14,000
I'll be a little honest, I zoned out. I sort of don't remember what he said just there.

3170
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
At least it kind of wasn't paying attention.

3171
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:20,000
At least he didn't say it a N word 43 times or 46 times.

3172
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
Sure.

3173
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
I think there's a difference of like...

3174
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:28,000
Because the obvious parallel is like, oh, Samurai Samma.

3175
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:32,000
But Samurai Samma just felt like it was...

3176
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Samurai Samma and better.

3177
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:40,000
Was an accent, but it was not about the accent.

3178
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:45,000
The joke was not how racist stereotype voice.

3179
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:49,000
I think this Chinese thing is entirely that.

3180
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
And it's like, yeah.

3181
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
Not as good.

3182
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
Are we going anywhere with this?

3183
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:56,000
No.

3184
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Okay, next one is...

3185
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Oh, we got another image here.

3186
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:06,000
Let's just see about that.

3187
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:10,000
All tiggers can't get enough of that malt extract.

3188
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:14,000
The malt thing is a racist stereotype.

3189
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:17,000
People of stripe surely enjoy their malt extract.

3190
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:22,000
Just say otherwise would be an erasure of their rich culture.

3191
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
I don't even know what this...

3192
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:29,000
I mean, I'm sure this is like, some sort of...

3193
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:32,000
Okay, I don't know what...

3194
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:37,000
I don't know why it's malt extract of all things,

3195
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
but sure, whatever.

3196
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
Just trying to make a statement about like,

3197
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:44,000
black people in watermelon or something.

3198
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:47,000
But they're using tigger and malt.

3199
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:48,000
Maybe something like that.

3200
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
They're making a statement on like,

3201
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:56,000
the ways to react to a racial stereotype.

3202
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:59,000
Like the dumb thing is to say, ha ha, the stereotype.

3203
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Then the next thing up is Winnie the Pooh normal,

3204
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
saying it's a racist stereotype.

3205
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:09,000
And the apparent enlightened,

3206
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:12,000
whatever you call it, this version of Winnie the Pooh,

3207
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
the tuxedo and the funny eyebrows.

3208
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
I like that Winnie the Pooh, he's just reading,

3209
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:19,000
just reading, just some light reading on critical race theory.

3210
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:20,000
For race theory.

3211
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
For Winnie the Pooh.

3212
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:25,000
He's so smug about it, he loves it.

3213
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:30,000
It's like to deny the stereotype is in a ratio of their culture,

3214
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:33,000
which is not even a thing that is said.

3215
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
People of stripe, people of stripe.

3216
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:39,000
So it comes off as like, I don't know,

3217
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:42,000
dumb the whole way through.

3218
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:43,000
I think...

3219
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
Isn't that what makes it funny?

3220
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:51,000
I feel like maybe I could try and read something into this

3221
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:52,000
that might be offensive.

3222
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,000
Maybe I would disagree with something,

3223
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:58,000
but I don't feel like it's meant that seriously,

3224
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:05,000
and I'd be missing the point if I tried to take issue with this meme.

3225
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
So I'm just going to say...

3226
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:08,000
Listen.

3227
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:09,000
Funny joke.

3228
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:10,000
Listen, everything...

3229
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
It's funny that Winnie the Pooh is reading a book.

3230
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:16,000
Everything is funny when it's ironic.

3231
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:19,000
Yeah.

3232
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:23,000
People of stripe.

3233
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:29,000
Okay, next one is called New Plan.

3234
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Posting.

3235
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:37,000
But that's what Trixie is going to do very soon.

3236
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:40,000
Three, two, one, go.

3237
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:41,000
Hello, comrades.

3238
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:44,000
Nikolai decided not to invade Ukraine,

3239
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:49,000
and Nikolai instead is going to invade PCP headquarters.

3240
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:50,000
That sounds good to you.

3241
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:53,000
Good luck finding it.

3242
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:56,000
Yeah, good luck finding something that doesn't exist.

3243
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:59,000
Wait, was he looking for PCPHQ?

3244
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
Yeah.

3245
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:04,000
You got to have to go to the realm of...

3246
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,000
The realm of dreams.

3247
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:07,000
The realm of dreams.

3248
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
That's where the podcast is.

3249
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:10,000
Where's the podcast?

3250
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
Where's PCPHQ?

3251
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:13,000
The realm of dreams.

3252
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:19,000
Yeah, also, this is still just Digibro's anime podcast.

3253
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
Now that...

3254
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:22,000
No one is...

3255
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,000
No one's...

3256
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:29,000
Now, Chrono, no one's saying this isn't Digibro's anime podcast.

3257
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:32,000
However...

3258
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,000
Nothing.

3259
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:36,000
Okay, next one is called...

3260
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:41,000
End of Otatwai 3.33 You Are Not Otaku.

3261
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:42,000
Crunchyroll Awards.

3262
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:44,000
Three, two, one, go.

3263
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:47,000
Main character, Eren, won antagonist of the year.

3264
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
That isn't what antagonist means.

3265
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Star Wars vision, zero nominations.

3266
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:54,000
Attack on Jujutsu, Demon Titan, Slayer, Kaisen, Socks.

3267
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:55,000
Done with anime.

3268
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
I'll taco no more.

3269
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:58,000
Good.

3270
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,000
I don't...

3271
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:00,000
I don't know.

3272
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,000
I guess I agree with all of that.

3273
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,000
It's good to be done with anime.

3274
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:05,000
I like...

3275
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
Finally, you're free.

3276
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:08,000
I like...

3277
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:09,000
Chinese cartoons.

3278
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:15,000
But Chrissy was done with anime, but she appears to have gotten back into it.

3279
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:16,000
Here?

3280
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Wait.

3281
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:18,000
Oh, did I?

3282
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:19,000
I think I forgot one.

3283
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,000
Never mind.

3284
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
This next one is called...

3285
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,000
Wake Up.

3286
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
There we go.

3287
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:29,000
Three, two, one, go.

3288
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:32,000
Ben, wake up.

3289
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:35,000
The accident wasn't your fault.

3290
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
What do you think Gibb is called?

3291
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:38,000
Gibb?

3292
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
It's because she's your id, Ben.

3293
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:41,000
She's your id.

3294
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:42,000
It doesn't make any sense.

3295
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
What does that mean?

3296
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:45,000
What?

3297
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:46,000
Id?

3298
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:49,000
Like the youngy and psychology thing?

3299
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:50,000
I don't know.

3300
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
Considering you do...

3301
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
Because it's a B backwards?

3302
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Whatever.

3303
03:11:55,000 --> 03:12:02,000
Considering you do these shows now really early, like 10am, you do need to wake up more.

3304
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:03,000
I do need to wake up.

3305
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
But I always do.

3306
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:10,000
Okay, next one is new character, WREE, wree, wree man.

3307
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:17,000
Three, two, one, go.

3308
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:22,000
Anyway, what do you think about spiders?

3309
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:30,000
I think they look pretty aesthetically pleasing.

3310
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:33,000
There's so many different kinds.

3311
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:38,160
guess I mostly don't like them I mostly think they're unsettling and I

3312
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:43,080
wouldn't want to be around one or even look too closely my favorite spider is

3313
03:12:43,080 --> 03:12:56,000
spider-man because he's a man and I also hear he's a good web designer I like

3314
03:12:56,000 --> 03:13:13,280
spider-man because he's a man and I'm a misogynist yeah whatever spider-man

3315
03:13:13,280 --> 03:13:19,960
what about what about spider woman where spider man what why is he white

3341
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:36,120
your blood please I don't want to listen to this whole thing our education systems broke wait maybe

3342
03:17:36,120 --> 03:17:41,760
it's the other way around I don't know I got a high school education nostalgia critic the height of

3343
03:17:41,760 --> 03:17:48,480
comedy be like hell remember the one teacher who seemed cool he wasn't it's all part of the plan

3344
03:17:50,480 --> 03:17:57,600
hey who cares all this bitch and sales remember that one teacher who seemed really kind and give

3345
03:17:57,600 --> 03:18:06,880
candy well oh well we gotta another hit in the wall oh god it's so obnoxious so

3346
03:18:06,880 --> 03:18:16,560
well so school sucks grow a damn pair of walls I don't have any original thoughts about this I

3347
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:26,040
just agree with everything that Dan Olson said in that one video it's so it's so irritating so

3348
03:18:26,480 --> 03:18:37,640
so fucking bad okay well thanks for that thanks for that I guess geez okay next one is Prince

3349
03:18:37,640 --> 03:18:46,920
Annihilation announcement three two one go what's up Ben since last week's 300th episode was jam packed

3350
03:18:46,920 --> 03:18:52,000
with guests and banter assuming that this one will have to rebound into a solo band close enough

3351
03:18:52,240 --> 03:19:00,240
totally accepted 301 the dawn of a new age we have to face it on our own so as an avid

3352
03:19:00,240 --> 03:19:07,200
enjoyer of the endless war of slime and punishment and a phantom horse revenge I've recently had

3353
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:13,320
the realization that perhaps in being so busy with working on the conclusion to these older

3354
03:19:13,400 --> 03:19:24,200
storylines you might not have had the time to be as up on the newer events in lakakam so with that

3355
03:19:24,200 --> 03:19:34,120
in mind I figure since you seem interested why not give a little report of some relevant news

3356
03:19:34,120 --> 03:19:41,560
and current events in the city and the server so I'm here by announcing the slime and times weekend

3357
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:51,400
update as I cram my lore down your little throat honestly okay goodbye yeah uh yeah okay I remember

3358
03:19:51,400 --> 03:20:00,520
the slimes I remember I wonder if Prince Annihilation is is aware that there was a news and a real

3359
03:20:02,440 --> 03:20:07,080
a real and in-game newspaper called the slime times slime times was great

3360
03:20:07,480 --> 03:20:13,400
uh wish they'd kept it up but I mean it must they made a bunch of them they sure it was a lot of

3361
03:20:13,400 --> 03:20:19,480
work that's pretty cool uh so a game that you created has all its own lore that its fans are

3362
03:20:19,480 --> 03:20:23,640
coming up with that you might not even know about it and you're you're the creator of it

3363
03:20:25,160 --> 03:20:32,920
yeah I can't I can't even keep track of it um I'm I'm not super like active over there I pop in

3364
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:40,840
every every so often uh for for one reason or another um all right uh well let's do the next

3365
03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:46,840
one then I did find I did get that one that was having trouble downloading but we'll do the next

3366
03:20:46,840 --> 03:21:00,760
one it is called uh it's gonna take 10 seconds seven six five four three two two one okay uh

3367
03:21:00,760 --> 03:21:07,640
the next one is called slime times weekend update number one there you go three two one go

3368
03:21:09,800 --> 03:21:15,160
top of the morning tally ho welcome to the first installment of the slime times weekend update

3369
03:21:15,800 --> 03:21:21,080
straight from the beating heart of neo milwaki in this week's news a killer by the name of

3370
03:21:21,080 --> 03:21:26,760
ungin got arrested for having a rowdy alt named splat cat when rowdies became suspicious of the

3371
03:21:26,760 --> 03:21:32,360
imposter and asked for discord screenshots to prove that splat cat was legit the alt reportedly

3372
03:21:32,360 --> 03:21:38,600
claimed they needed time to clean up their servers first because it was quote 50 furry porn

3373
03:21:39,160 --> 03:21:45,240
ungin's official statement on the matter after coming clean we do a little trolling in other news

3374
03:21:45,240 --> 03:21:50,280
wordless taken over nurses office and the hunt for relics of the olden days is still in full force

3375
03:21:50,840 --> 03:21:55,400
some rowdies and killers have even allied themselves to more expediently solve the riddles

3376
03:21:55,400 --> 03:22:00,760
leading to the relics we'll see how long that lasts that's it for this week we hope to see you next

3377
03:22:00,760 --> 03:22:08,840
time and remember the slime time is the best time right the the the in-game uh sort of a meta or

3378
03:22:08,840 --> 03:22:14,520
lore at the moment is that they're uh right they're hunting for uh ancient relics is kind of a

3379
03:22:15,400 --> 03:22:22,280
is the current uh the current uh thing that's happening just like uh the plot of every 90s j rpg

3380
03:22:22,440 --> 03:22:34,360
uh yeah uh thanks for that uh prince uh good uh keep keep me updated if there's if there's news

3381
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:38,680
that's a pretty cool feature um it'd be nice of uh you continue doing that

3382
03:22:40,360 --> 03:22:48,440
yeah um okay the next one i'm this is the one it's called crypto enjoyer volume two three two one go

3383
03:22:48,440 --> 03:22:57,480
hello it's the uh unironic crypto enjoyer trend episode 300 uh i've changed my setup a bit so

3384
03:22:57,480 --> 03:23:04,440
audio is a bit different also i'm a little bit sick so explain so that i was sick i got boosted

3385
03:23:04,440 --> 03:23:09,480
i got my booster and it made me sick for a day i need to expand my my thoughts a little bit for you

3386
03:23:10,280 --> 03:23:15,320
it was like having cove it all over again ethereum and these in these mostly gpu mind

3387
03:23:15,400 --> 03:23:20,840
um cryptocurrencies are really bad for the environment right don't tell me about proof of

3388
03:23:20,840 --> 03:23:26,600
stake use they take up so much power um for the hash rate that they get and because you have to

3389
03:23:27,400 --> 03:23:33,400
clock up the speeds um they're pretty much worthless once you're once you're done mining

3390
03:23:33,400 --> 03:23:39,320
on them so you have to basically either throw it away or sell it to some poor soul for way too much

3391
03:23:39,320 --> 03:23:48,280
money now that crypto i was talking about um so so 300 manero okay it's actually cpu mind so you

3392
03:23:48,280 --> 03:23:54,280
just mine it on the cpu that's already in your computer um do you have a clock then ruin what that

3393
03:23:54,280 --> 03:23:58,680
does basically is lower power consumption because there's been a focus on increasing efficiency

3394
03:23:58,680 --> 03:24:06,760
for cpus for quite a while because they're used in laptops and stuff like that and um cpus aren't

3395
03:24:06,760 --> 03:24:16,120
very sellable um um you know aftermarket stuff so basically uh once you i mean you can still

3396
03:24:16,120 --> 03:24:21,400
use it after you've done mining it it's basically the same yeah but it's still using energy that

3397
03:24:21,400 --> 03:24:28,280
otherwise would not be being used okay this this is all okay i get all right this is this is this

3398
03:24:28,280 --> 03:24:34,520
is just a more you're telling me that there's a more efficient way to do something that i still

3399
03:24:34,520 --> 03:24:42,920
think is bad the core idea here of cryptocurrency is and the blockchain is it's just bad and i would

3400
03:24:42,920 --> 03:24:48,680
rather not even if it were free even if it took no power at all i would still say sucks don't do it

3401
03:24:49,240 --> 03:24:55,400
uh that's that's the core that's the core disagreement we have here i don't see a reason

3402
03:24:55,400 --> 03:25:01,880
of making a distinction between the cpu and gpu because uh you know i don't really get that either

3403
03:25:01,880 --> 03:25:09,400
i have no idea basically just a cpu that's dedicated to graphics processing you know so it's

3404
03:25:09,400 --> 03:25:17,640
not really that different hmm that's yeah i don't i don't understand that at all

3405
03:25:19,240 --> 03:25:26,840
uh okay next one is called confirmed question mark uh there it is three two one go

3406
03:25:27,640 --> 03:25:32,520
i saw that elias are in and live in fall are under the this episode's procrastinators thing

3407
03:25:32,520 --> 03:25:38,360
in the description does that mean they're new procrastinators confirmed hell yes no more new

3408
03:25:38,360 --> 03:25:49,560
procrastinators no never never unpaid interns only it's all about uh unpaid labor that's uh

3409
03:25:49,560 --> 03:25:58,520
ben saint uh the communist champion that's that's that's exactly that's exactly right um

3410
03:26:00,280 --> 03:26:08,440
that's what i'm talking about uh next one is called speed run from how do i pronounce this

3411
03:26:08,440 --> 03:26:17,160
name is it it's friggin friggin i'm gonna say friggin okay uh three two one go

3412
03:26:18,120 --> 03:26:22,360
hey ben you mentioned last week watching commentated speed runs which remind me of

3413
03:26:22,360 --> 03:26:27,800
of all things a homestuck fan comic called spurb done quick in which two players the entire game

3414
03:26:27,800 --> 03:26:33,240
in just 81 pages the only text is a speed run commentary explaining their exploits that sounds

3415
03:26:33,240 --> 03:26:37,480
really cool the whole thing in maybe half an hour might be worth checking out that actually sounds

3416
03:26:37,480 --> 03:26:44,360
awesome that does sound good because my favorite one of my favorite things about homestuck is uh is

3417
03:26:44,360 --> 03:26:49,800
the um yeah is the the actual the mechanics of the game are the most interesting part

3418
03:26:49,800 --> 03:26:53,800
and then like that all gets dropped and like after like act three and no one cares anymore

3419
03:26:53,800 --> 03:26:59,720
speaking of speed runs uh anyone remember those races you guys used to do like the Kirby race

3420
03:27:01,560 --> 03:27:09,160
of course is there is there more to that thought or i don't know i just i watched one of those

3421
03:27:09,160 --> 03:27:13,960
videos recently i just wanted you to feel bad that you don't do anymore okay i remember i think i

3422
03:27:14,040 --> 03:27:20,360
watched the Kirby race and didn't you win that one i did i did win that one you're pretty uh

3423
03:27:20,360 --> 03:27:26,520
experienced Kirby player you're kind of a Kirby master yeah oh no that you should yeah i would

3424
03:27:26,520 --> 03:27:30,360
i would say so definitely you should have said that that's what you should have that would have

3425
03:27:30,360 --> 03:27:36,200
made more sense i'm the top racist i just won too much i won too much and nobody wanted to uh to

3426
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:45,720
race me anymore uh the the uh did you see and did i already talk about the um the yawn measly

3427
03:27:45,720 --> 03:27:52,840
video about homestuck i haven't seen it i don't think you talked about it um well you know yawn

3428
03:27:52,840 --> 03:27:59,400
measly is that one guy whatever i won't i won't explain him again uh he did have a homestuck

3429
03:27:59,400 --> 03:28:05,560
video it was like a patron reward for passing a backer goal patron uh and he was gonna do the

3430
03:28:05,560 --> 03:28:12,680
homestuck video and he i i thought the video was pretty good it was okay it was decent he

3431
03:28:12,680 --> 03:28:18,920
doesn't like homestuck but that's okay because he the things that he says are good about homestuck

3432
03:28:18,920 --> 03:28:22,840
and the things he says are bad about homestuck are the same things that i think are good and bad

3433
03:28:22,840 --> 03:28:29,960
about homestuck uh so like i guess we're in agreement he just waits them differently uh

3434
03:28:31,320 --> 03:28:35,160
i don't know it was kind of a bummer it was a bummer hearing him be like homestuck's bad and

3435
03:28:35,160 --> 03:28:43,400
here's why and i had to be like yeah true he's right yeah but if he says it's bad he must surely he

3436
03:28:43,400 --> 03:28:52,600
must be wrong only only a bad person right he's he's his reasons are actually that's a weird

3437
03:28:52,600 --> 03:28:58,440
coincidence because i was just watching like an old pcp episode where you guys talked about homestuck

3438
03:28:59,240 --> 03:29:04,760
and i think jesse he mentioned he said homestuck is bad i don't know if he was being serious or

3439
03:29:04,760 --> 03:29:11,560
not he i'm sure he was being serious yeah he because we talked about a lot and he read like a

3440
03:29:11,560 --> 03:29:16,360
little he started to read a little bit of it and he got like frustrated with it or he didn't feel

3441
03:29:16,360 --> 03:29:21,400
like continuing which i mean there was a lot of a lot of people feel like there's a lot of friction

3442
03:29:21,400 --> 03:29:28,840
on that episode yeah i remember getting pretty annoyed about it so the ben versus i remember a

3443
03:29:28,840 --> 03:29:36,680
line where it's like you ben said of jesse making fun of homestuck despite not reading it you you

3444
03:29:36,680 --> 03:29:42,680
said you're having fun but you're having fun at homestuck's expense and that's what's upsetting

3445
03:29:43,720 --> 03:29:50,120
yeah i thought that was fun because it's like it it is often the case it was like

3446
03:29:50,840 --> 03:29:57,640
it's funny to just be flippant about something um yeah you know because whatever who cares it's just

3447
03:29:57,640 --> 03:30:04,040
a thing but no it's the end of the day it's just homestuck yeah but it's homestuck and i'm like

3448
03:30:04,040 --> 03:30:10,520
i agree i i wanted him to like it but whatever i wanted i wanted him to like it i it's not that

3449
03:30:10,520 --> 03:30:15,560
i actually think it's like a problem for you to trash talk homestuck if you hate it but like

3450
03:30:15,560 --> 03:30:22,360
yeah i think what i was getting at is like you're making jokes i guess if if anything jesse says

3451
03:30:22,360 --> 03:30:31,240
is a joke who whoever knows um but he he his yeah the the the crux of the joke was like

3452
03:30:31,240 --> 03:30:36,120
homestuck is bad people shouldn't read homestuck and i'm over here sincerely believing that no

3453
03:30:36,120 --> 03:30:41,480
people should read it even if i can acknowledge the homestuck is bad on some days i would probably

3454
03:30:41,480 --> 03:30:45,880
agree that on the whole yeah homestuck is bad i thought i still think people should read it

3455
03:30:46,680 --> 03:30:52,520
so so when you when the the the the sediment behind your joke is homestuck bad no one should

3456
03:30:52,520 --> 03:30:59,480
read it i can't i can't get behind it uh so that's what homestuck is is like the simpsons uh people

3457
03:30:59,480 --> 03:31:04,680
talk about it being bad uh but there's still a lot of good stuff in there and people of new

3458
03:31:04,680 --> 03:31:10,200
generations should look into it there's a lot of people who don't know the simpsons because it's just

3459
03:31:10,200 --> 03:31:17,240
yeah before their time now just like homestuck you're just like the simpsons with homestuck you

3460
03:31:17,240 --> 03:31:21,560
should just read you should just read the first the first couple chapters i was gonna say uh

3461
03:31:21,560 --> 03:31:27,640
and maybe you should only watch like the first 10 seasons or so yeah with homestuck you should

3462
03:31:27,640 --> 03:31:33,560
you should react one if you like it you should continue on to read probably definitely till

3463
03:31:33,560 --> 03:31:39,320
act three probably through act five and then nobody should read past the end of act five

3464
03:31:39,320 --> 03:31:43,080
under any sort even if you liked it and you want to know what happens just don't just don't do it

3465
03:31:46,120 --> 03:31:55,960
yeah um okay next one is called good job ben very okay there we go uh three two one go

3466
03:31:57,000 --> 03:32:02,120
ben it's been an honor watching the rag con two documentary with you but one problem

3467
03:32:02,120 --> 03:32:09,160
you missed the fucking slur you god damn idiot i i will fix it i will fix it you did what was it

3468
03:32:10,120 --> 03:32:19,720
uh there's um there's a there's a soft there's a soft a n word and there's another one that is uh

3469
03:32:19,720 --> 03:32:25,080
it's harder to hear i i i i shouldn't have missed it but i know why i did because it's kind of spoken

3470
03:32:25,080 --> 03:32:31,960
in the middle of a bunch of other people speaking and i and i missed that it was there uh so i will

3471
03:32:31,960 --> 03:32:38,280
i will scrub those out i sure were a lot of n words back in the pcb's history and that's uh

3472
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:43,800
that's for sure i i mainly got them but i didn't get them all but i can i will fix it uh

3473
03:32:45,960 --> 03:32:55,720
i feel pretty stupid uh i messed up but i'll so i'll fix it um next one is called jumping on a

3474
03:32:55,720 --> 03:33:07,160
three month old topic there it is uh three two one go in episode 283 there was a conversation

3475
03:33:07,160 --> 03:33:12,200
about whether we should bring back media from the future to the past or i guess the present or not

3476
03:33:12,200 --> 03:33:16,440
and ben said that he wouldn't bother with it since that just lets people experience it earlier

3477
03:33:16,440 --> 03:33:22,680
which is all net neutral which is frankly dumb as fuck people die ben people die before art they

3478
03:33:22,680 --> 03:33:32,840
would have liked gets released yeah okay well i mean if you really want one specific person

3479
03:33:32,840 --> 03:33:41,640
to experience one specific work of art i guess uh is that really that important i guess it has

3480
03:33:41,640 --> 03:33:46,600
potential to be important if the right person with the right sway in the way the world will move

3481
03:33:46,600 --> 03:33:54,520
going forward reads homestuck in like 18 or more yeah you see if if if adolf hitler only played

3482
03:33:54,520 --> 03:34:02,920
megaman x he wouldn't have done the holocaust would would someone in 1804 even be able to appreciate

3483
03:34:03,880 --> 03:34:10,760
anything about homestuck maybe they can read the words they i mean they could probably

3484
03:34:12,840 --> 03:34:17,560
i don't think that i don't think they would appreciate anything that makes homestuck special

3485
03:34:17,560 --> 03:34:22,680
like yeah they could probably could understand you know the idea of these kids that are friends

3486
03:34:22,680 --> 03:34:28,840
that communicate through this messaging system going on this fantastical journey and you know

3487
03:34:28,840 --> 03:34:33,960
aliens from another world and alternate realities and stuff i'm sure they could get the gist of that

3488
03:34:33,960 --> 03:34:38,840
but everything that makes homestuck special is like its format and the way that it is sort of made

3489
03:34:38,840 --> 03:34:45,240
for the internet of its time and that just wouldn't mean anything well okay to a person of the era

3490
03:34:45,240 --> 03:34:50,680
maybe that wouldn't but i'm just saying you bring the right thing to the right person maybe they'd

3491
03:34:50,680 --> 03:34:57,560
get inspired and write a like a book that's like way ahead of its time that influences other things

3492
03:34:57,560 --> 03:35:07,480
you don't know what's gonna happen maybe but like okay i don't like like art is kind of the same

3493
03:35:07,480 --> 03:35:12,840
story over and over again really there's not that many different stories that you can tell

3494
03:35:12,840 --> 03:35:19,000
what makes a particular work special and what makes a particular work like gain traction and become

3495
03:35:19,000 --> 03:35:24,200
you know renowned and a classic in its day you know when it's made is that it speaks to

3496
03:35:25,240 --> 03:35:33,080
something about those people at that time and so i think it would be a really weird to think that

3497
03:35:33,080 --> 03:35:39,080
like oh this work of art this classic work of art that exists here at this point we need to bring it

3498
03:35:39,080 --> 03:35:46,520
back in time to a different era that can't really appreciate it or it would be it would be like

3499
03:35:47,320 --> 03:35:51,160
really it would be a really weird thing for like one work of art to like hit

3500
03:35:51,960 --> 03:36:00,040
better and make a more splash and be better suited for like a previous time except in the

3501
03:36:00,040 --> 03:36:04,760
way that it might be prescient of things that hadn't happened yet which i guess is true but

3502
03:36:04,760 --> 03:36:08,760
then that's not really about the art that's about like oh we got to warn people that world war two

3503
03:36:08,760 --> 03:36:14,280
is gonna happen and stuff like that right we got to prevent anyone from making the first blockchain

3504
03:36:15,160 --> 03:36:22,200
uh it's so on and so forth it's like i said if you just uh gave hitler something to idle his time

3505
03:36:22,200 --> 03:36:26,280
away with he probably wouldn't have he would have become a he he would have stuck with his art he

3506
03:36:26,280 --> 03:36:33,160
would have become a webcomic artist so we never would have had uh the nazi party exactly you see

3507
03:36:33,160 --> 03:36:43,080
he just had too much like there was like similar like uh political people who at the time would have

3508
03:36:43,080 --> 03:36:49,000
taken the place of adult hitler i don't know if exactly the same thing would have happened but like

3509
03:36:50,760 --> 03:36:55,720
the it's not just him like germany was completely normal and nothing was going wrong until he

3510
03:36:55,720 --> 03:37:03,240
decided to change everything and alone he managed it well i guess uh we can't know that for now you

3511
03:37:03,240 --> 03:37:10,680
know it's uh all in the past even if hitler was in his room playing super mario uh land

3512
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:19,640
i this gameboy uh color all right i i think i feel like i've explained my reasoning for why

3513
03:37:19,640 --> 03:37:28,200
bringing art from the future isn't like it's not i don't i don't think other other than like the

3514
03:37:28,200 --> 03:37:32,440
fact that with it comes like technology we've never seen before that it would give us insights into

3515
03:37:32,440 --> 03:37:37,720
the practical realities of the future i don't think there's anything artistic that would blow

3516
03:37:37,800 --> 03:37:43,880
minds about future art it would just be art from a different context that we are not really suited

3517
03:37:44,680 --> 03:37:52,040
to appreciate that's what i think um anyway next one is a an imager link

3518
03:37:53,880 --> 03:38:01,320
artistic interpretation of what ben thought give looked like before yeah why have i got like the

3519
03:38:01,320 --> 03:38:10,200
swedish flag because i because i said i thought you were like a like a blonde nordic oh i i thought

3520
03:38:10,200 --> 03:38:17,640
i thought that was like the fallout uh you know like like vault suit for a second not like that

3521
03:38:17,640 --> 03:38:21,640
not like that fat i didn't picture you as being that fat i thought maybe i would have drawn you

3522
03:38:21,640 --> 03:38:26,520
with like long hair like kind of like kind of like kind of like shoulder length hair or like

3523
03:38:26,520 --> 03:38:32,680
long ish i don't know this was just my mental image based on almost nothing it's funny how

3524
03:38:32,680 --> 03:38:38,920
this is exactly opposite aside from the blue eyes yeah which i kind of a little bit like gray blue

3525
03:38:38,920 --> 03:38:48,920
eyes hmm uh i don't know just uh i'm just so stupid i'm just so dang stupid is all is that

3526
03:38:49,640 --> 03:38:54,840
is that what some people think mage looks like no it's what ben thought i this is this

3527
03:38:55,320 --> 03:38:58,920
i i've seen mage this is exactly what mage looks like yeah in real life

3528
03:39:00,440 --> 03:39:13,480
in case you didn't know yeah um so they're uh slavic blonde so you know whatever uh okay next one

3529
03:39:13,480 --> 03:39:19,480
this is the last one unless there's a last minute please no more yep this is the last one need an

3530
03:39:19,480 --> 03:39:26,040
answer from tgt lormaster ben i'm not that much of a lormaster i haven't even read the new pages

3531
03:39:26,040 --> 03:39:35,960
three two one go so i saw this comic about shadow breaking out the time prison his bro uh he spoke

3532
03:39:35,960 --> 03:39:42,200
his bones and his heels every time he moves and it's very funny yeah when he's in style all of

3533
03:39:42,200 --> 03:39:48,440
task controls but i read all of taggill's throat and i never saw the sequence i'm pretty sure it's

3534
03:39:48,440 --> 03:39:54,440
an edit where is it then i'm pretty just like an extra panel from laser but i can find it anywhere

3535
03:39:54,440 --> 03:40:00,440
be famous meet the origins of this comic strip you probably saw it it's all around on twitter

3536
03:40:01,800 --> 03:40:07,160
yeah it's a it's a it's a strip it's a strip about uh shadows like i just came back from the

3537
03:40:07,160 --> 03:40:12,760
whatever like time void i lived there for 10 000 years i never died i never went to sleep

3538
03:40:13,400 --> 03:40:18,040
uh i just i couldn't move except by breaking my bones so i just broke all my bones over and over

3539
03:40:18,280 --> 03:40:25,320
again until they healed themselves and began my body is pure scar tissue i'm like i'm a i'm invincible

3540
03:40:25,320 --> 03:40:29,800
you know i'm so powerful that i'm just constantly breaking and re rehealing all my bones whenever

3541
03:40:29,800 --> 03:40:35,240
i move or whatever i'm pretty sure it's a it's an edit of a bunch of panels of tails gets trolled

3542
03:40:35,240 --> 03:40:41,320
that have been put together i don't know what the dialogue comes from or why it exists uh but i know

3543
03:40:41,320 --> 03:40:47,080
the one you're talking about well if cyber show we're here probably he'd be able to answer that

3544
03:40:47,080 --> 03:40:51,880
because he's not only the sonic lore master he's also the the tails get strolled lore master

3545
03:40:52,600 --> 03:40:58,360
and just like the meme guy in general like i'm sure he knows he probably knows exactly where

3546
03:40:58,360 --> 03:41:04,760
that meme comes from and who made it and why and what it's referencing uh and all that master of

3547
03:41:04,760 --> 03:41:12,360
many lures i found out uh from this is from the know your meme page the meme of uh putting

3548
03:41:13,080 --> 03:41:18,040
the two the smiling friends guy guys in front of something and him and say like uh you know

3549
03:41:18,840 --> 03:41:22,120
i know we're supposed to help this guy but if he's a lost cause you know he's already made

3550
03:41:22,120 --> 03:41:25,960
up his mind why don't we just get out of here and cut our losses i guess cybershell was the

3551
03:41:25,960 --> 03:41:33,880
first guy to put that image in front of something yeah i saw that or at least the first one that is

3552
03:41:33,880 --> 03:41:39,720
that is known or at least he's credited as the first one on know your meme which i just thought

3553
03:41:39,800 --> 03:41:45,720
was i just thought it was interesting quite a quite an obvious meme template to do yeah

3554
03:41:46,840 --> 03:41:53,480
yeah i guess so like it might have happened inevitably it's still funny that he was he's

3555
03:41:53,480 --> 03:41:58,840
i guess was the first one to do it he's the first one to do it and therefore he owns the copyright

3556
03:41:58,840 --> 03:42:03,480
to it he owns the copyright of putting one copyrighted thing on another copyrighted thing

3557
03:42:03,480 --> 03:42:12,600
just like sonichu it's a parody baby uh you could you lawyer fair use um yeah there you go well

3558
03:42:12,600 --> 03:42:22,840
that's it that's the last uh okay that's the last one hooray no more cast no more podcast i'm sick
