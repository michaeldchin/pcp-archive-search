1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Alright, what would be a funny way to start an episode?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I can't keep falling back on the classic, hello, I'm The Pro Crastinators,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but there's gotta be something better to do.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It can't just go back to the Doug Walker well all the time.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's always my first impulse.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Right.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But that's all I can think of.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I stumbled on the Crow Masticators again. Remember them?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Are they still posting?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't think so, but all the videos were years old and I was like, damn,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I better remember these guys.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I remember.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I had forgotten.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Semi-recently, I feel like we discussed them again.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They brought them up and were like, oh yeah, remember those?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Remember those guys? It might have been in my discord.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, I think it was a spiral made like, he was going through all the old episodes

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
keeping the N-word tally, and he kept notes, and he showed some notes,

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and they included like, remember the Crow Masticators?

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I was like, oh yeah, the Crow Masticators.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Our rivals, I guess.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What a journey it's been.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's me, Ben Saint, Gibbon Takes Here, and our guests this week are

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oblivion Fall again.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And Kaijukun, we're also returning.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right, you were on one another time.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, Kaijukun, art guy.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What's up?

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, yesterday, we got the tree, got a good old Christmas tree,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and today, I've been decorating all day.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So I've been up and down, step ladders, putting lights on bushes and trees and things outside,

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and running around, and people have been swearing because of untangling things,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and you know, it's the worst time of year, but it looks really pretty afterwards,

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so I'm pooped right now.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm pooped, but it's looking good, I guess.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I helped my dad decorate the tree at Thanksgiving.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He had already done the outside lights.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, the Thanksgiving tree?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, no, but you put it up, it was up early.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You put it up early, and then we decorated it.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It was great.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I loved it.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, right.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Kaijukun and Oblivion Fall, you guys are not from America, so you don't celebrate Christmas,

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
so sorry to exclude you.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I've never heard of Christmas, ever.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What's that?

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Never done one of those.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, I don't know.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That was a joke.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You guys do like Kwanzaa or something.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, it's bullshit.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We have Christmas in New Zealand, but our Christmas is better because it's hot,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and it's summer.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How bizarre.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Santa is like, he's got a ski...

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No, not skis.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What was it called?

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Surfing.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's a surfer, he's an idiot.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He's getting sunburned.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I feel like the whole point, I mean obviously Christmas comes from like,

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Norse traditions and stuff of like,

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
winter feast because it's cold, everybody warm up and try to make yourselves happy

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
because it sucks outside, but doing that in the summer,

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'd just be like, I'm trying to relax on the beach, I don't want to put up decorations,

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't want to do all that.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's summertime, it's the whole time.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Literally, it's defeating the point.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Really, it's like what's even the point of Christmas.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We still have like the fucking Christmas socking,

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
which is like a big fluffy sock that's meant to keep you warm, I guess,

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
but it's already hot.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You should do like a Christmas crocs or a Christmas flipper.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Christmas snorkel.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, that would make no sense.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
A Christmas sandal.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
A Christmas croc.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Totally.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I guess I have to buy some gifts or something.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I fucking hate this shit.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I hate gifts so much.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I hate giving them and honestly, I hate getting them too.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What a disaster.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
My family is doing a secret Santa this year,

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and that's like the only thing we're doing because a lot of us are poor right now.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm supposed to buy a gift for someone,

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and it's supposed to be like around a hundred New Zealand dollars,

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
but the two things that they asked for is something that's free

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and something that's free hundred dollars,

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and I can't get eye for a pose because the free one,

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
they could just grab, I don't think they realize it's for free,

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
so I have to find something else for them.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So get it for free.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I've been putting it off.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So do that one.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's even the question here?

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But if you have money left over, you're supposed to get something else from the list,

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
it's like, I don't fucking know what to do.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's also shit you can buy on Steam,

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
so there's no rush, I can just buy it on the day

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
or find something else for them, but it's dumb.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wait until it goes off sale so you can spend money on it.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh yeah, good idea.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I have already done my gifts for a family.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They're simple things.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Previous years, I know I've talked about this on the PCP,

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but previous years I've said,

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
ah, you know what, I'm just going to ask people exactly what they want,

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and then I'm going to buy that, so there's no chance that they'd be disappointed.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I found that there's less interest when they open the package,

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and that's kind of lame.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They're just like, oh yeah, you got me a thing.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It is lame.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I said, so now I'm not doing that.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am buying things based on what I think they will like,

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and I don't know who of them will be listening to this,

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
so I can't say, but they're pretty good.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They're like a beyond like a cheap piece of shit,

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
but not so expensive that it's embarrassing or like too much.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's just sort of a mid thing.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's good.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's good.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's efficient.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's economical.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Wow.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's correct.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What I like to do, I actually like given presents,

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and I usually look for any excuse to make presents,

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but the fun thing about it is that I like to do my own packages,

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
so I just pick some random paper stuff or something,

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and it just draw.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It do random drawings according to giving clues of what the present is,

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and people would like that.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's awfully thought.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, I mean, that's pretty thoughtful.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's pretty nice.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's more effort than I'm willing to put into it.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is fun.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is fun.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But I guess that says more about me when it does about you,

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
so that's okay.

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Pretty good.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I guess I'd like to receive a Kaiju gift.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I guess.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You would like to.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, really?

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Drawings are fun.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I hadn't thought, because family, they don't like internet things necessarily,

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
but for internet friends, drawing characters and stuff for them,

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that's good.

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I could try that.

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I could do a bit of that.

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, it was a shitty doodle.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A few days ago, one of my friends,

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
well, it was the birthday of one of my friends,

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and I gave him the volumes 99 and 100 of one piece,

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
because he likes one piece,

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and I drew the entire straw hat crew on the paper,

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and it was really cool.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ladi, that's very nice.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Very impressive.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's really fun.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I hate drawing, so I don't know what you mean.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I didn't take the picture.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Damn.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What a chore.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What a chore.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, yeah, I took it.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No, it's not fungible.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's forever a real thing.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No, no, I took a picture.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Hold on.

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No, you fucked it.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now it can be right-click saved.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now it can be right-click saved.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's off the blockchain.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Before, it existed only in the realm of ideas on the blockchain.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, now it's real.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know how to share pictures.

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hold on.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What is this?

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, you figure that out.

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I finished all my commissions.

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Finally, I haven't had my commission list clear

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
in like probably about five years.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, the vectors?

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, but my little pony things,

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
where I do hundreds of images of people's characters each.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was working on one during the last episode.

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I finished it.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then I started on that punk Tommy Oliver design,

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
which I also finish for next day.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think in total, I did one commission a day

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
for the first eight days of December,

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
since I lost a conservation gig.

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And that was like 1,500 drawings total.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But yeah, there's an image of like all the different characters

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I've done currently.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I know a bunch of these people.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I didn't see the full list before.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I know Sweetie Bloom.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is that Eliora?

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No, I don't think that is Eliora.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Who else do I know on this list?

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There's probably more.

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, never mind.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's not for a question.

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's on there.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sifisto commission, at some point.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Good.

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Not good.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm glad.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, Golden Fox.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I see Golden Fox.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I know who that is.

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I know who that is.

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, is he the one with the sunglasses there?

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, I see it.

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, what a trip down memory lane.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Base, congratulations on getting all that done.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's impressive work.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is an impressive Uber, I'm looking at.

235
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A nice body of work you've built up here.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
A good resume.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah.

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I feel intimidated.

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't want to share my drawing anymore.

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're joking.

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's never going to be as cool as many, many ponies.

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's never going to be as cool as a thousand ponies.

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's so intimidating.

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh, geez.

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, that one's good.

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's a winner.

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll give you that one.

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's a winner right there.

250
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There you go.

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, perfect.

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's her name?

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Cosmic Flair.

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Cosmic Flair.

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, this one.

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Cosmic Flairs.

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The hair was annoying.

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I started working on it in the first half of a year

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and then just put it off for six months, finishing the hair.

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Wow.

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Even though most designs I can do in a single day.

262
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, yeah, speaking of getting shown up by many ponies,

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
work, art, like doing stuff, been very hardworking on the secret project.

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And it's stressing me out a little because I really want that done.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I've got a lot of ghost stories that have all been handed in.

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And now I have to make the PDF.

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But at the moment, it's really stupid and I feel stupid

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
because basically all I need to do is like,

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
intro page, like here are the guest artist credits

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and here are all the Kickstarter backers.

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And thank you for reading or whatever.

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Make the PDF.

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I just can't choose the right font.

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't put the layout and copy paste all of the names.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And it's just like, oh, I don't want to do that.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't want to be doing any of this.

277
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm the bottleneck now.

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's my fault that it's not being made.

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It feels bad.

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, that does feel bad.

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I know what you mean, though.

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Making decisions is hard.

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I got to a point.

286
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I feel bad.

287
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm in a bad mood because the last two days,

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
consecutively, I have been working all day, every day,

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
on my not secret project.

290
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I am at a part where I needed to write some dialogue.

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I needed to stop coding and stop drawing and write some dialogue.

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And it was so hard.

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And twice now, I've written it and then I've been like, cool.

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And then I've kept working for the rest of the day.

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And then at the end of the day, I'm like, you know what?

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's bad, actually.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I need to rewrite it tomorrow.

298
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And I just feel like I'm not making any progress.

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It feels like I'm spinning my wheels and I'm upset about it.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What is it with text?

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm going to take it out on all of you.

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't know.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's just too long.

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I wrote and wrote and wrote.

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And then at the end, I'm like, wow, this is like so many lines.

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It shouldn't be this many lines.

307
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It just goes on and on and on.

308
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I have to whittle this down somehow.

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But I don't know how.

310
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So I don't know.

311
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
As soon as we're done recording, that's what I'll be doing today.

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And I told myself I wanted to get the beta version done by exactly one week from today

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
when we're recording by next Sunday.

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Will I do it?

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't know.

316
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If I don't, it's not a huge deal.

317
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I just, for my own, because that's exactly one year since when I started,

318
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I was like, it would be nice if I could have it done by then.

319
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So I'm trying really hard.

320
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know if it'll happen.

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah.

322
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's many little deadlines that are mostly self-made.

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But I would like to spend the Kickstarter money doing the printing

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and as much as I can in shipping stuff.

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Before the end of the year.

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Before the end of the year, before I have to do my taxes

327
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
so I can write all of that expenses off.

328
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah.

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Because that's going to be done for January.

330
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And it's like, ah, geez.

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Every day that I try to open the document, I'm like looking at it.

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I see all the Kickstarter back as names.

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm like, how should I arrange this?

334
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, fuck it.

335
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And then I leave.

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's been like three days in a row.

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And I come back to it and I'm like, ah, but oh shit.

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, we got to go get a Christmas tree.

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You know, I'll help with that.

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, we got to put up lights.

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, anything to prevent me from doing this thing.

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah.

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I feel that way with writing dialogue a lot.

344
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But I can't do it anymore because I have only a week

345
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and it's not enough time.

346
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And now I'm like, I just have to make myself do it.

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But then I do it and it's bad.

348
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I'm like, well, okay, I got to redo it now.

349
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So, you know, it's terrible.

350
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't know.

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Somebody, I don't know.

352
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
My life sucks.

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Everything's a disaster.

354
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What more can I say?

355
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I got really mad.

356
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I've been getting really mad at everyone.

357
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And I've been mean on Twitter, even meaner than usual.

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I got my account pseudo locked yesterday.

359
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
By pseudo locked, I mean that like everything's normal.

360
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's just people that don't follow me can't see my tweets for 12 hours.

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And I think like four hours is left at this point.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So like two non-followers, I look like a locked account or whatever.

363
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And this is a punishment.

364
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And it was, I just told someone to fuck off.

365
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I just told someone to fuck off.

366
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And I guess I had told one too many people to fuck off that day.

367
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And they were like, die.

368
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And they pseudo locked my account.

369
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I told someone to fuck off because they said it was an L.

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That I told, what's the guy's name?

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Was it not Matt?

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The guy who, someone was calling for a boycott of Toei.

373
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
A like semi-big YouTuber.

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And then like later that same day, he was like,

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
guys, I can't emotionally deal with this anymore.

376
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm revoking my call for a boycott of Toei.

377
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And like that's fucking weak shit.

378
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hey, that's exactly what I was going to talk about

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
because I'm the editor of that channel.

380
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Really?

381
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

383
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Really?

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay.

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, let me just, I just, I heard that he called for a boycott

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and then he like got upset or something and was like,

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
never mind, no boycott.

388
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And I just think that's the,

389
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and I just think that's the weakest shit in the world.

390
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So I called him weak and then somebody responded to me to tell me

391
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
that was an L for not having enough empathy.

392
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And I told that guy to fuck off.

393
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And it got my account semi-locked for 12 hours.

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And I was right.

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He didn't ask for a boycott actually.

396
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That was like the community, I guess.

397
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Uh-huh.

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So that's what he said.

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He said, he said like I'm,

400
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
let me find the tweet so I know exactly what I'm talking about.

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
No, I remember,

402
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I watched one of his, one of the earlier videos,

403
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
one of the two videos he made and he's like,

404
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
if this isn't rectified,

405
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I will not be, uh, watching your new films or something.

406
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah.

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Is that not technically a boycott?

408
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Uh, he said that he didn't want to,

409
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
he didn't want to encourage toy animation anymore.

410
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Uh, but people took like that as some kind of movement

411
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and they created a hashtag or something.

412
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And because of that,

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
uh, a lot of anxiety fell upon us.

414
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Uh, so in the end what happened is that,

415
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
because we're, first of all,

416
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
uh, we're not used to that.

417
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Uh, second of all,

418
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
um, we both have anxiety.

419
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So,

420
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't, I don't, I don't get it.

421
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I know, it's really ex, I,

422
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I wasn't expecting you guys talking about it,

423
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
uh, uh, before me.

424
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So, um, I'm a bit unprepared right now.

425
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Okay, sorry about that.

426
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But yeah, um,

427
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I just don't get it.

428
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, I guess,

429
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Not everyone wants to be the villain then.

430
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Sometimes people don't.

431
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
How is it, how is it a villain?

432
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How is it a villain?

433
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't know anything.

434
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
First of all, I don't even know what Toei did,

435
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but if they did something bad,

436
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
if they did something bad that you don't support.

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They deleted 150 of his videos in like the span of an hour.

438
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah.

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And, um,

440
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Right.

441
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And like the,

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay.

443
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The, the accumulated current,

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
you know, the revenue of those videos,

445
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
getting views over time is like how he pays.

446
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Basically.

447
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
His editors.

448
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, basically what,

449
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
what they did is just, um,

450
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
absolute abuse of the copyright system.

451
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Like, um,

452
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Okay.

453
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
How this works is like, um,

454
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
the company should watch the video.

455
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Check, uh,

456
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
check with YouTube if it's actually a violation of the,

457
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
how is this, uh,

458
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
thing called the, um,

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, I forgot.

460
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Content ID.

461
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes.

462
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Um,

463
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and if,

464
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
if like,

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
if the channel is actually doing something wrong,

466
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
they're in the right to, you know,

467
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
block the video,

468
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
but they didn't do that.

469
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
They just, uh,

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
picked a number of videos that had Dragonball in the title,

471
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and they just blocked them all.

472
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Just instantly in like an hour.

473
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And with that,

474
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
they destroy the entire revenue of the channel.

475
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes.

476
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And,

477
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and because, uh,

478
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
we're all crew has to dispute all of them.

479
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah.

480
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And,

481
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
but he can't do more than like two at once or something,

482
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
something about like,

483
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
if he does too many at once,

484
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
his channel might get destroyed or terminated.

485
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yep.

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If they come back and say,

487
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
actually no,

488
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
which they always do.

489
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Because it's like,

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
because it's like, if you look,

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
because if you dispute,

492
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and then let you dispute is not accepted,

493
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
it's like a strike or something.

494
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah.

495
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah.

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah.

497
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So he can't do that for 150 videos.

498
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Like saying,

499
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
this is fucked up.

500
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Toei, please.

501
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He made a big video pleading with Toei in Japanese.

502
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He hired somebody to speak in Japanese to them

503
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
so that they could understand why this was bad,

504
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
why this is bad for him,

505
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and being able to pay,

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
you know,

507
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
all that stuff.

508
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And then,

509
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I guess anxiety got to him.

510
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He made a third video.

511
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't remember exactly what was said,

512
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
but it was sort of like,

513
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
it wasn't backtracking, I guess,

514
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
but he was like,

515
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
not really able to deal with the hubbub that was caused.

516
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah.

517
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What does that mean?

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Well, the thing is,

519
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
we didn't expect this thing to blow up.

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
First of all,

521
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
like even PewDiePie made a video about it.

522
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Like we wasn't expecting that.

523
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay.

524
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You gotta understand from a point of view of a person

525
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
that is not really used to deal with internet shed.

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Like,

527
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
he's also a really nice guy.

528
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He's not prepared for the internet at all.

529
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So,

530
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
he just,

531
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What are you talking about?

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He's a YouTuber with 680k subscribers.

533
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Exactly.

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's exactly the one thing that is,

535
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
people is getting wrong.

536
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Like,

537
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
because someone has like a huge following,

538
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
they immediately think,

539
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
like this guy is a,

540
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know,

541
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is a massive YouTuber,

542
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
because I don't know,

543
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
he's some kind of an enterprise on its own.

544
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He's used to the internet shed and stuff,

545
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
but he's not.

546
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
We do videos,

547
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
videos get views and immediately,

548
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
suddenly out of nowhere,

549
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
100k subs just coming to the channel.

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But because we had,

551
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
like we have a huge channel,

552
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
doesn't mean like we're prepared to deal with the pressure of that.

553
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You know?

554
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Sure, sure.

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm like him and the anxiety stuff,

556
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
not being able to deal with it.

557
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't think it's too much of like a problem in and of itself.

558
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't expect that.

559
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I just feel like,

560
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
it's like maybe a mistake to shy away from a community that's trying to support.

561
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Like, I feel like a boycott of Toei is based personally.

562
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I think that's cool,

563
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
because they're fucking,

564
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
they're fucking with this channel.

565
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They're abusing content ID.

566
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
YouTube needs to,

567
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
you know, everyone knows YouTube sucks with the content ID robots and stuff.

568
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I feel like it's beneficial for YouTubers and,

569
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and you know, audience members and just people for this to be like,

570
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't know, taken as far as it can go,

571
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
like make enough of a stink that actually something does change.

572
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah.

573
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But the thing is, like from my perspective,

574
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
like the day this happened,

575
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I got so anxious that I had a panic attack.

576
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Really bad.

577
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I had to go to the hospital and stuff because the whole,

578
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
like this whole thought of maybe the channels is going to stop existing.

579
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Like maybe they're going to strike it.

580
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Maybe I'm going to lose my job.

581
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It just, it just got me.

582
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It just got me and it was really hard these days to stay positive.

583
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It was really, really hard.

584
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You have no fucking idea how hard was to like wake up every day and remember like,

585
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
yeah, right.

586
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This happened.

587
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Fuck.

588
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
How do I deal with this?

589
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
How do we deal with this?

590
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So as for me personally speaking,

591
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
like if I was Mark,

592
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I probably going to do the same thing.

593
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Like I couldn't, I couldn't understand the pressure.

594
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay.

595
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
To be honest.

596
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Well, I, but the pressure to do what?

597
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Like what, like what does, what does be it?

598
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Okay.

599
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
What, what exactly does making a video where you throw up your hands and you go,

600
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
never mind.

601
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like what, what does that do?

602
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
What does that change about the situation?

603
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
How does that relieve any of the pressure?

604
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Being like that feeling that you're suddenly in the center of the world and everybody is watching you.

605
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And you're getting notifications all day, every day about it.

606
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And you have like a,

607
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It doesn't, it doesn't fix that.

608
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It doesn't fix that problem.

609
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What problem, Ben?

610
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
That, that problem, I, the one you were just describing,

611
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
think about being, getting too many notifications and it, it's upsetting.

612
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Like it doesn't, it doesn't fix that.

613
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's not like it's upsetting, Ben.

614
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I mean, I don't know how, I don't know how I even explain it to you.

615
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Like if you don't understand how, how is to deal with this sort of this,

616
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
this level of anxiety, right?

617
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This level of depression.

618
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
If you don't know how to, how it is to deal with that every day,

619
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
with all this pressure of the entire world just surrounding you out of nowhere.

620
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Like it is really hard.

621
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm just saying, I don't, I don't, I don't see how making a video where you're like,

622
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
where you just say, oops, never mind.

623
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Like I don't see why that relieves any of that pressure or solves the problem.

624
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't make the, it doesn't make the, the strikes go away.

625
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It doesn't like take attention off of you, really.

626
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Exactly.

627
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It doesn't.

628
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So the move is just to move on.

629
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Cause how can you fight a multi-billionaire company that can strike and delete your channel anytime?

630
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I mean, how?

631
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah, it's, it seems, it's, it's hard to do that.

632
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
When we, we got a like a few videos blocked in the past and they,

633
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
it took around a whole year to get them back in the channel.

634
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Imagine like how much will it take to fight for 150 videos.

635
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We did the math and it would take around 37 years.

636
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And honestly, with this fucked up system, when YouTube doesn't want to help also,

637
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
just reminder that they don't want to help.

638
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
They do not want to help.

639
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So we kind of have to fight for our own, for our own.

640
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And you can't just go to trial with toe animation.

641
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I mean, it's fucking toe animation.

642
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well, all right.

643
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I have, I have a thing to say about that then.

644
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I think like boycotts are legal.

645
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Like, are to a able to shut you down because you're saying boycott or are implied to say boycott?

646
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Cause like, like, I'm, like, I'm honestly confused.

647
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Like, what is the problem because like, is it, is it that you said boycott until he was mad and going to threaten legal action?

648
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Or is it just, or is the decision like, okay, well, I'm simply just not going to challenge it.

649
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And I'm just going to let the videos that are down stay down.

650
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah.

651
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
All right.

652
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Cause why would he, we don't want that.

653
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We don't want to fight for 37 years.

654
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I mean, I don't know.

655
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's not, it's not, it's not my business.

656
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I don't know.

657
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I mean, it's not my business, whether he decides to challenge the strikes or not, or the takedowns.

658
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's not mine either.

659
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I mean, I just, I'm just the editor of the channel.

660
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
If he wants to, if he wants to prioritize his mental health, I think that's not, that's not wrong.

661
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And I think a lot of people understand.

662
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I don't care about it.

663
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't care about the mental health, like whatever.

664
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's, it's either way, it's his decision.

665
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Whatever.

666
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's beside the point.

667
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Like, I'm not saying, I'm not saying he, nobody is saying like, oh no, he has to fight the strikes.

668
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He has to put his channel in jeopardy.

669
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Like, I don't care about that.

670
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I don't know.

671
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I get, it's, it's, it's, I don't even know what I'm arguing anymore.

672
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't even know, I don't even know what we're talking about.

673
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I think the mark probably needs like a spokesperson or a manager to deal.

674
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Like if, if he's getting anxiety from this, I don't know how you get a manager or anything.

675
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But like, I'm imagining the sort of person who like, you got your artist, your, whatever,

676
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
a musician and he's like, oh shit, I'm stressed and you got your big manager with big fists

677
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and he points his hand, his big meaty hand at like, people who are fucking with him.

678
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And he says, fuck you, treat him right.

679
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You need people like that.

680
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You know, you need a guy like that on your team.

681
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You need a manager to like punch and take all the brunt of stuff.

682
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's actually something we did at DA games.

683
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Like Will used to be in charge of everything, but he has a lot of like anxiety issues.

684
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And there'd be a lot of points where he would like, if he was having like a really like, like bad time,

685
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
he would like be like, oh, no, maybe I should delete the channel.

686
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Maybe I should do this or that.

687
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And he would make all the social media go black and do that thing.

688
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And we're just like, God, no, don't do that, please.

689
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
What was the guy in Bakuman?

690
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Like the manga about manga.

691
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And there was that guy who was like, ah, shit, I don't want to do anything.

692
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And he had that manager.

693
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's like, just do it, idiot.

694
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And he's like, oh my God.

695
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You mean the guy with the suspenders?

696
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah, he was really good.

697
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The guy who drew Otters 11.

698
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Otters 11, yeah.

699
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, that was his editor.

700
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Editor's art.

701
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's funny to say that.

702
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
He was my favorite.

703
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Can I forget his name?

704
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah.

705
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's funny to say like, because the manager who got at DA games also is seen wearing suspenders.

706
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
No, no, no, no, nothing.

707
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The manager, he, the artist guy wore suspenders.

708
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
He was the businessman who like retired to draw manga and he had the long hair

709
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and he wore suspenders most of the time.

710
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Wearing suspenders is pretty sus.

711
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh my God.

712
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
In any case, we had one of our other friends who was on the team

713
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
who was very like mentally stable and based, I guess, just like take over the social media

714
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and take over like organizing everyone and telling like all the artists,

715
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
okay, you're going to work on this, you're going to work on that,

716
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
keeping deadlines, that sort of thing.

717
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And taking that pressure off of Will who's like the face of the channel

718
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
so that he can have a better time and it's been good.

719
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So it can be a good idea to do that.

720
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah.

721
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No, I know what you mean that like this is everything is so new.

722
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Like we actually weren't prepared at all for this kind of situation

723
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
because we never expected that one day we're just going to wake up

724
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and see that 150 videos were just going to be deleted

725
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
and then making a video about it like an updating the situation

726
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
will like trigger this reaction in YouTube in general.

727
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Like we weren't expecting that we weren't prepared for that.

728
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We weren't mentally prepared for that.

729
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I think this experience is a learning experience to be honest.

730
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Like if ever happens again in the future, we also need to,

731
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I mean, I don't know what we're going to do.

732
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
We're probably going to change the entire format of the channel.

733
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Probably we're going to move on to something different.

734
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But yeah.

735
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Okay.

736
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I lost track of what I was saying.

737
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
In my opinion, in my opinion, okay.

738
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Anxiety or no.

739
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think objectively speaking, if a company does something bad to you

740
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and then you make an announcement and you're like, hey,

741
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
company did something bad and then it makes a big,

742
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
there's a big reaction, there's a big community like outcry about it.

743
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Like setting aside how you feel about that

744
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
or if it makes you anxious or whatever.

745
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I think that's just good.

746
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That's just like a good thing that you want to happen

747
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and that is good for you.

748
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Like the initial thing, yeah, it's bad that the videos are taken down

749
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
and maybe it's, maybe, you know, maybe, yeah,

750
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
the consequences of fighting it might be bad and not worth it

751
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and risky and you don't want to do it

752
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
because it's like a bad decision for the survival of the channel.

753
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
That all makes sense and is good.

754
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But I think when the community is mad about what company did to you,

755
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
it's smarter to lean into it.

756
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I think Gibb, you were saying something kind of similar before.

757
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It just doesn't make sense to me at all.

758
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Not like the technical aspect of it,

759
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:43,000
just like the way that it is being talked about doesn't add up.

760
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, I think that point of view is right.

761
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
But personally, if it was me, I just wouldn't be capable to keep going.

762
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So I guess it depends of your mental strength

763
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
or your personal situation.

764
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I know Mark has some personal issues too, so I don't know.

765
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Well, the thing is, to close this topic, I guess,

766
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know if you could keep talking about it,

767
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
but when I talked to you the other day to talk about the situation,

768
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I was hoping to get into the podcast and talk about,

769
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
hey, we should keep pressing Toei and stuff.

770
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I wasn't expecting that.

771
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Mark was going to feel so...

772
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I didn't know he was feeling so bad.

773
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
When I talked with him the other day, I was like,

774
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
shit, he's feeling really bad.

775
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I guess I understand.

776
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I honestly wanted to keep going.

777
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I wanted to keep going.

778
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I was amazed at the...

779
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
When you say keep going, you mean pressing Toei.

780
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You mean pressing Toei publicly,

781
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
or you mean YouTube behind the scenes, like challenge.

782
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Publicly, yeah.

783
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I mean, I even was doing my own silent protest.

784
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I do a lot of fun art of Toei shows.

785
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I said on Twitter, you know what?

786
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm just going to stop doing this until this situation is fixed or whatever.

787
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But Mark is my boss, yeah, but he's also my friend,

788
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
so I need to sympathize with him.

789
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I understand.

790
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I understand because I will do the same thing.

791
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I wouldn't be capable of keep going with all this.

792
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm not... I don't think anyone should...

793
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It was the first time it came out of nowhere.

794
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Out of nowhere.

795
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
In one hour, our entire lives changed.

796
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah.

797
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It is understandable, but at the same time,

798
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
it is an experience to learn from

799
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and to get better at managing this kind of situation

800
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
if it ever happens in the future.

801
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What have we learned?

802
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I guess to manage the kind of situation better, I suppose.

803
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I would not hire a thug, get a mercenary with like brass knuckles

804
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and like a sloped forehead

805
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and tell him that he has to punch people on the internet,

806
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and he'll do it.

807
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah.

808
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But we'll see.

809
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I mean, for now, he's having a rest.

810
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
We're going to talk about it later.

811
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Here's what I think probably...

812
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Here's what's...

813
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You know, this is...

814
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I think at some point probably...

815
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
All right, I'm just going to say it.

816
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I think he's probably going to come to his senses

817
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
and be like, no, wait, we actually should...

818
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We actually should keep talking about this,

819
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and then it'll just be back,

820
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
because I think that's the thing that makes more sense.

821
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
To be honest, I think the best way to move on,

822
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
it's still animation.

823
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
It's like you're fighting it,

824
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the ant versus the elephant.

825
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I mean...

826
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Situation.

827
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, I guess, but like...

828
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Is the fear that they're going to strike even more of your videos?

829
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The fear is that they strike the channel.

830
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Well, yeah.

831
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That's the thing, the YouTube system is so weird

832
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that they give all this power to these big corporations

833
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
that they can do anything they want with your channel.

834
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And you, as a creator, can do absolutely anything.

835
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
YouTube won't help.

836
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
There are no legal help or anything

837
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
that can do anything for you.

838
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's stupid.

839
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The only...

840
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
There's a proper solution,

841
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
which is getting a YouTube manager

842
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
that can give you the ability to

843
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
block the videos of the channel on Japan.

844
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But getting one of those managers

845
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
is like you have to have inner friends

846
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
in the inner circle of YouTube

847
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
to actually get a manager.

848
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's really stupidly hard to get one.

849
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So...

850
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I mean, okay.

851
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
A channel as big as Marx, though,

852
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I feel like it would be easier than most

853
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
to get some YouTube attention.

854
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I feel like it's...

855
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I mean, the procrastinator's tiny channel in comparison.

856
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
We yelled about stuff that happened to us

857
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
when our channel got deleted once.

858
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I think it was just once.

859
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
We yelled about it on Twitter and we did get response.

860
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
For months and months we did, yeah.

861
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It took a while, but I feel like it's possible

862
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
to get the Toei thing.

863
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Because I feel like Toei is a giant company.

864
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
They're so giant, they probably didn't even notice

865
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
anything was happening.

866
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Just do a YouTube sweep.

867
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We need to do that.

868
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And then a guy pressed one button

869
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and he just scanned YouTube for things.

870
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
This channel has a lot of Dragon Ball in the title.

871
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I do that.

872
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And it was just a robot doing it.

873
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I feel like if YouTube reinstated a bunch of them,

874
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
if you could get in contact with YouTube somehow,

875
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
cause enough of a stink on Twitter,

876
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
other social medias,

877
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and then get YouTube to be like,

878
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
okay, I guess we should look into this

879
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
because the community is outraged.

880
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
They usually respond if the outrage is large enough.

881
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And then they may be able to put

882
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
most of the majority of the videos back,

883
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
or all of them.

884
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And then Toei will probably just not even notice.

885
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I feel like they're not really that involved.

886
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I don't foresee them coming down with a real lawyer

887
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and being like, all right, time to kill you

888
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
with an assassin.

889
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's the weird thing,

890
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
because I think Toei has been targeting the channel

891
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
for quite some time.

892
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
They blocked some videos.

893
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
We got them back after almost a year,

894
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and then they blocked them again.

895
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So they slowly and progressively

896
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
started to block first two videos,

897
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
then five videos, then 10 videos,

898
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and out of nowhere 150,

899
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
but they've been like targeting the channel

900
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
for quite some time.

901
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I guess the channel is on the radar,

902
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't know.

903
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But Toei's animation as a corporation

904
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
is really fucked up how it works,

905
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
because it's like,

906
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
animation and production is really cool and great

907
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and all that.

908
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
But in terms of corporate,

909
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
it kind of sucks because they still live

910
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
in the 20th century.

911
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I think it's managed mostly by lizards,

912
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
like just old guys that just won't like you.

913
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
They will block videos with people that,

914
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I don't know, you know those videos

915
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
of one guy talking to the camera

916
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and suddenly, I don't know,

917
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
they have a poster of Dragon Ball in the back.

918
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
They will block videos like that.

919
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
They will block videos like one guy saying one piece once

920
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
in the entire thing.

921
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
They will do that.

922
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And they do that.

923
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
We got several comments of people,

924
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
of other smaller content creators,

925
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
they have this problem,

926
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
they have this problem where they do fun arts

927
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and some guy draws Goku or Luffy or something,

928
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and they get the video blocked

929
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and then they get it back

930
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and they're blocking again and again

931
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
and they keep blocking it.

932
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So, I don't know, they're weird.

933
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Such a weird company.

934
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Yep.

935
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
This is like Disney.

936
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's a lot, yeah, Disney and Nintendo

937
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and a lot of companies do that.

938
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
They just claim stuff

939
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and there's no real consequences for them

940
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
if they are overly aggressive in the videos

941
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
that they claim, infringe their copyright or whatever.

942
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This is a problem you hear.

943
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Big enabler of those big companies

944
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
because they don't want to get sued

945
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
so they'd rather just fuck the user base.

946
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Yeah.

947
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Shift the blame.

948
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
One sec, I need seltzer water.

949
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Okay.

950
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
KGB.

951
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Boy.

952
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So, yeah.

953
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Anime.

954
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
What is it?

955
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Black cherry.

956
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Delicious.

957
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Okay, so what's up?

958
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What did I miss?

959
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Nothing, I just said anime.

960
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
What is it?

961
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's...

962
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And manga.

963
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You probably want a boy

964
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
working with anime on YouTube.

965
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It is a Japanese colloquialism, after all.

966
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Impossible, impossible.

967
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's true, but true.

968
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I wish that YouTube would just stop being a little bitch

969
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and I also think we should do a abolished copyright.

970
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That's over and above the YouTube situation.

971
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But it's true.

972
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
They should improve the system.

973
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
The PewDiePie...

974
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, that's a good start.

975
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The PewDiePie made about the whole Mark situation.

976
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
He also tells like...

977
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
He can't use his own music in his own videos

978
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
because YouTube claims he is music.

979
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Like what?

980
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Who is music?

981
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
PewDiePie.

982
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
PewDiePie.

983
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
PewDiePie makes music like an artist

984
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
makes an album and he can't use that music

985
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
or what sort of music exists.

986
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Hold on, that makes no sense because...

987
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Exactly.

988
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I know a bit about how that system works

989
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and they're supposed to like let you

990
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
whitelist certain channels yourself.

991
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Like you're supposed to have control of that

992
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
because GA Games does a lot of music

993
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
and they've whitelisted certain channels

994
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
to use their content.

995
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
They've whitelisted my channel,

996
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
they've whitelisted a few of the other team members

997
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and those videos don't get claimed by the bot

998
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
or at least we're not supposed to.

999
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So why can't...

1000
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Why does a PewDiePie have access to that?

1001
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
PewDiePie says something about like another company

1002
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
claiming his music.

1003
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh well that happens all the time.

1004
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
A company is just falsely claiming ownership.

1005
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
There's no filter for that.

1006
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Like I did some streams of Hollow Knight

1007
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and the Team Cherry is explicitly said on their website

1008
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Hollow Knight, you can use the footage,

1009
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
you can use the music, you can just use everything.

1010
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
We love them.

1011
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And then third-party companies will just

1012
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
say they own the soundtrack to Hollow Knight

1013
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
because they distributed it in like Taiwan or something.

1014
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So they claim it and I can't do anything about that.

1015
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I can fight it and eventually they'll say

1016
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
they'll do nothing about it but it's like...

1017
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It's stupid.

1018
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
You'll know that but what can be done?

1019
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
These companies never respond.

1020
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
They never respond.

1021
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I probably don't even hire a single person

1022
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
to do any of that.

1023
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I mean...

1024
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Remember...

1025
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Sorry, sorry.

1026
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I interrupted.

1027
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No that's okay, I burped and I forgot what I was going to say.

1028
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Okay.

1029
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Remember when Mumki got his channel deleted

1030
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
and immediately he was like more popular

1031
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
than he'd ever been before and like Keemstar

1032
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
was making videos about him and stuff?

1033
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Yes.

1034
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
In my experience it's just good

1035
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
when bad things happen to your YouTube channel

1036
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
and then people talk about it.

1037
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Not necessarily in Mumki's case.

1038
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
He's never regained all those subscribers.

1039
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Okay, well in Mumki's case...

1040
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
He's still less than half the amount he had years later.

1041
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Well yes, his subscriber count.

1042
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah, but I mean that was...

1043
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
He could have played his cards differently.

1044
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
True, I mean he did kind of fuck up everything else.

1045
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
The channel could have grown more

1046
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
if he hadn't fucked up everything else, you're right.

1047
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

1048
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I don't know.

1049
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
When PewDiePie is making a video about

1050
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
your situation about how a company fucked you over

1051
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
that's what you want.

1052
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That's like the dream.

1053
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
That's the dream of the YouTuber

1054
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
as far as I'm concerned.

1055
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I can assume that the drawcast got some kind of boost

1056
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
after we got deleted and came back.

1057
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
What's that?

1058
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I can assume that the drawcast got some kind of boost

1059
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
after YouTube deleted us and then we came back.

1060
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Maybe, probably.

1061
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I was assuming a little bit.

1062
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I mean it's really just the case of people

1063
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
who otherwise would not say the name of a channel

1064
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
are all saying the name of a channel at once

1065
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
and so a lot of people who have never heard of it

1066
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
are hearing about it.

1067
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Because I knew of Totally Not Mark through Kaiju

1068
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
but I didn't really watch their videos

1069
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and I forgot, I didn't realize it was the same guy

1070
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
when this stuff all started happening.

1071
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I was like, wait a minute, that profile picture he has

1072
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
looks familiar.

1073
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I figured it out.

1074
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's Zorro.

1075
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
No.

1076
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I didn't think it is.

1077
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It was a contest

1078
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
of making a fan art of Mark in the One Piece style.

1079
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yeah, he looks mostly like Luffy

1080
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
but a little different.

1081
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
No, he looks like Zorro.

1082
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It's like a Luffy Zorro.

1083
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
He's just Zorro but he's sticking his tongue out.

1084
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
The artist that drew that is like,

1085
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
he draws really accurate One Piece art.

1086
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It's really good.

1087
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I forgot the name sadly.

1088
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Oh yeah, it's Zorro.

1089
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Lots of people have now learned about

1090
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Totally Not Mark

1091
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and so that's why it would grow

1092
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
if it had been deleted and come back

1093
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
there would be more people, new people.

1094
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And that's why it's a good thing to happen

1095
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
but it's not like a preferable thing.

1096
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I think you can grow perfectly fine without it happening.

1097
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

1098
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It's like a little boost.

1099
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's like a Mario Kart boost on the track

1100
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
if you're in 12th place and you go,

1101
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
maybe you'll get a little further.

1102
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
It depends on the person really.

1103
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Personally, I wouldn't like to grow up as an artist

1104
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
because of some tragedy, honestly.

1105
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Well, whatever.

1106
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
We're not all you, Ben.

1107
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
We are different.

1108
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
You are dumb if you think this is a me thing.

1109
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm just saying, look, when you're a YouTuber,

1110
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
you live and die on the numbers

1111
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and things like this make a number go up

1112
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and that's really the long and short of it.

1113
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah, but again, it depends on the person, honestly.

1114
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I mean, it would be bad if your 600k YouTube channel

1115
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
were erased and you had to start a new one.

1116
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
That would probably be pretty bad

1117
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and maybe would probably...

1118
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It depends, but it would probably offset

1119
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
any signal boost that you get from something like this.

1120
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Perhaps, possibly, probably, most likely, maybe.

1121
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
There was a YouTuber who didn't have his house burned down,

1122
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
but it did, and he was one of the big fires

1123
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
in California or something,

1124
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and he was a science, something I can't remember his name.

1125
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But he lived in a van for a while,

1126
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and he kept making videos,

1127
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and people, the support definitely helped

1128
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
regrow what was destroyed.

1129
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So, tragedy is big money,

1130
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and you should try to burn your house down.

1131
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You should seek to create...

1132
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1133
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You should live as dangerously as you can

1134
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and hope that something bad happens to you.

1135
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm glad we all learned a valuable lesson today.

1136
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You got to show your Patreon.

1137
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The trick is when this happens, you got to show your Patreon.

1138
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh, wait, it happened to Teleprte, too, didn't it?

1139
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Because his channel was growing pretty fast

1140
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
at the beginning of the year,

1141
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and then YouTube deleted him over some bullshit.

1142
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
They said his videos were too sexual,

1143
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
but the videos they flagged had nothing in them,

1144
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and when people kicked up a statement,

1145
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
when he came back...

1146
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
His whole channel got deleted for a couple of days.

1147
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I remember that, yeah, I remember that.

1148
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And then when he came back, his growth was quadruple

1149
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
what it was before.

1150
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Did he have to start a new one, or did he get the old one?

1151
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
No, no, no, he got his old channel back,

1152
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
but he had slowly climbed up to around 1 or 200k or something.

1153
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But when it came back, he shot up triple that in no time at all.

1154
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Yeah.

1155
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
So, yeah, that also happened.

1156
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I forgot about that.

1157
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I remember that happening.

1158
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
On the topic of finances of content creators and things,

1159
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I've had something interesting happen in the last day.

1160
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Since the last...

1161
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yeah.

1162
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
My Patreon, patreon.com slash oblivionfall,

1163
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
was fluctuating around 250 and 253 dollars

1164
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
back and forth for two weeks.

1165
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It couldn't decide what it would settle on.

1166
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And then yesterday, it just jumped up by over 30 dollars

1167
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
out of nowhere, and I have no idea why,

1168
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and I'm almost catching up to patreon.com slash bansane.

1169
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I'm only a couple of dollars behind you.

1170
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
This is a tragedy.

1171
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm going to have to give you money if I surpass you.

1172
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
This is bullshit.

1173
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
That is a big problem.

1174
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
That would just be terrible if you had to do that,

1175
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
according to the contract that everyone with the Patreon...

1176
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
According to the blood pact, yeah.

1177
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Oof.

1178
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah, this, yeah, yeah.

1179
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
What a terrible thing to happen.

1180
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Maybe when Phantom's Revenge comes out,

1181
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
people like that, and I'll get a boost or not.

1182
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Good, good, good.

1183
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Who knows?

1184
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I pray.

1185
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Did you put anything out that did that to you, or what?

1186
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I put something out on the last day of last month,

1187
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
and I haven't put anything out since.

1188
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I've been silent, so...

1189
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
No boost in viewership on my videos.

1190
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I checked my analytics after it happened,

1191
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
and they're the same as normal, so I have no idea.

1192
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, wow, yeah, you're almost...

1193
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Yeah, you're only a few dollars behind me now.

1194
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Oh, God.

1195
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
No!

1196
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Stop!

1197
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
No, stop having money.

1198
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Only I can do that.

1199
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Stop having money.

1200
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Quit it.

1201
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Stop.

1202
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Makes me mad.

1203
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I don't want to give Ben Saint my money, jeez.

1204
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I definitely don't want you to do that

1205
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
at patreon.com slash ben saint.

1206
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
From patreon.com slash oblivionfall.

1207
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yes.

1208
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
patreon.com slash give and take.

1209
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
That wasn't funny.

1210
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
That was terrible.

1211
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I was waiting for Kaiju.

1212
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah.

1213
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So, yeah, oblivion, you...

1214
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Last week, you had a bunch of shit.

1215
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
You were describing...

1216
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
You said there was a developing situation,

1217
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and then immediately after the episode,

1218
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
you said, like, guess what?

1219
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
The shit is even worse than you could possibly imagine now.

1220
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh, God.

1221
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yes.

1222
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Do you want to, like...

1223
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
There after the episode, so please explain everything.

1224
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Yeah, I'll recap.

1225
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
So, my month, starting December 1st, was crazy.

1226
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
The first day, my job at Pennsylvania

1227
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
that I've had for three years, just poof, gone in an instant.

1228
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Yes.

1229
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And, oh, that was spooky.

1230
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And then the second day, the Twitter drama

1231
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
and regarding the plagiarism of my friend's character,

1232
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I also talked about that.

1233
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Yes.

1234
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And then the third day was the thing

1235
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
that I was considering talking about.

1236
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I've changed my mind because I think it's a bit too much

1237
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
of a personal situation, and since then, I've learned more.

1238
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
There's more grays going on.

1239
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
No.

1240
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
But that involves some stuff.

1241
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It involves some very fucked-up individuals, in my opinion.

1242
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
But I probably shouldn't rag on them publicly.

1243
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Maybe it's not the best move.

1244
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Bonus episode material.

1245
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
No, the fourth day, there was just family drama

1246
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
that from, like, six years ago that got resolved.

1247
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That was a thing.

1248
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
The fifth day, December 5th, this is the new big thing.

1249
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
So, every single day, it was some new bullshit.

1250
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And, yeah, so, on the 5th or 6th, maybe.

1251
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I found out through my sister, who works for my mom,

1252
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
who, you know, is a lawyer in New Zealand,

1253
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
that a whole bunch of churches, a whole big fuck-ton of them,

1254
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
including all the big mega-churches, including individuals

1255
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
such as Peter Mortlock and Brian Tamaki,

1256
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
who are these crazy nutjobs.

1257
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
God, I could, I guess, briefly sum up what those people are like.

1258
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Peter Mortlock is one of those people who thinks that

1259
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
COVID restrictions are just like what they did to the Jews

1260
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
in Nazi Germany.

1261
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's identical.

1262
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
He's one of those people.

1263
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Right, right.

1264
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And he's like a mega-church pastor or something?

1265
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah, he is.

1266
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
My sister used to rent from his son.

1267
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
They're one of those prosperity gospel types,

1268
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
which is like, oh, you know,

1269
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I'm so rich because God gives me money, sort of people.

1270
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yes.

1271
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
You just have to have faith and you'll be rich like me.

1272
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
It's like the, yes, it's like the evangelical Christian equivalent

1273
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
of the secret, where like...

1274
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah, it's so fucking hateful.

1275
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
...only instead of fate and the universe, it's God.

1276
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And it's like God rewards goodness with wealth.

1277
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So that means that if you're rich,

1278
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
that means it's because you're a good person and God wanted you to be.

1279
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And if you're poor, it just means you just have to be a better

1280
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
and more godly person.

1281
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Maybe then God will give you money.

1282
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Like that's literally it.

1283
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1284
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You're so right.

1285
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You're so right.

1286
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I am so right.

1287
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I always am.

1288
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I always am.

1289
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah, so...

1290
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
My sister used to rent from his son and apparently like 70% of a year

1291
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
they were out on luxury vacations around the world.

1292
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
They had their like $80,000 car parked outside her tiny little shed

1293
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
she lived in that they were charging like $450 a week

1294
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
for her to live there when she was a single mother.

1295
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You know, that real Christian charity.

1296
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It was fucking...

1297
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Sure.

1298
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It was a shitty house.

1299
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
We can't live on Christian charity.

1300
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
It doesn't pay the bills.

1301
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So that's like Peter Mortlock.

1302
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Brian Tamaki is like...

1303
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
He's the leader of Destiny Church and he's like...

1304
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
He's almost like a cult leader.

1305
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Oh my God, he has a church now?

1306
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Well, he's had a church.

1307
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
It's called Destiny Church.

1308
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
He runs it on Twitch.

1309
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It's what church he leads.

1310
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
He's like this nut job.

1311
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
He put out a bunch of DVDs about how gay people are Satan at one point.

1312
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
DVDs?

1313
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
DVDs.

1314
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Nowadays he's going on about all these conspiracy theories about the COVID.

1315
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It's not real.

1316
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's made up by the aliens or some shit.

1317
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I don't know.

1318
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
He's a crazy man.

1319
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,500
So those are some of the colorful characters who are involved in this lawsuit against the

1320
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:13,300
New Zealand government because how dare of a government say that, oh, you know, if you're

1321
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:18,460
going to be standing in front of a congregation, you should be vaccinated or maybe not stand

1322
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,460
in front of them.

1323
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,840
And that's the only rule.

1324
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,900
And that's a rule they have for all jobs.

1325
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,800
It's not a rule they made especially for the church.

1326
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,000
It's a rule they have everywhere.

1327
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,100
I don't know why they can't just sit in another room with a webcam projecting their face on

1328
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,000
a big screen with a speaker.

1329
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,900
That would solve the problem.

1330
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,500
I don't know why they can't do that.

1331
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
They just kick him feet around.

1332
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
What cams are Satan?

1333
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,500
Yeah.

1334
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,000
The justification is one separation of church and state and two.

1335
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,400
Jesus said, Jesus said we have a right to congregate however we want.

1336
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,200
We have a God given right to spread disease.

1337
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,200
This is apartheid.

1338
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,900
I've seen some of the legal documents.

1339
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,900
It's stupid.

1340
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:08,400
If Jesus were alive today, he would go around.

1341
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,800
He wouldn't be laying his hands on people and curing their coronavirus.

1342
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:18,400
He would be laying his hands on them and pulling their mask off and being like, fuck the state.

1343
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,400
Breathe free, my child.

1344
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:26,400
It's dumb.

1345
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:32,400
The reason the most fucked up thing is one of the lawyers representing them is my mom

1346
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,400
and I can't condone this.

1347
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,400
I do not agree with her.

1348
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,400
A lawyer representing whose mom?

1349
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,400
My mother is representing these churches legally.

1350
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,400
My mother is helping them through the government and I think this is fucked up and my mom should stop.

1351
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,400
Also, this isn't public knowledge.

1352
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,400
I'm not leaking documents.

1353
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,400
For all I know, I could be telling fanciful lies.

1354
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,400
Did she take the case?

1355
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,400
Did she take the case?

1356
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,400
Yes, I'm going to do this.

1357
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,400
My mother believes in it.

1358
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,400
That sucks.

1359
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,400
No, bummer, dude.

1360
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,400
It's just...

1361
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,400
It's frustrating.

1362
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,400
At Thanksgiving, this is not as bad, but at Thanksgiving, I tried to explain...

1363
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
Did I say this before?

1364
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:31,400
I tried to explain to my mom why I think that means testing is bad

1365
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:39,400
and why I think it's good that the COVID relief checks,

1366
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,400
why I think it's good that everybody got them

1367
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,400
and how I think that universal programs are better

1368
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,400
and means testing creates weird incentive structures, et cetera, et cetera.

1369
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,400
And it just didn't get through to her at all.

1370
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,400
She just was like,

1371
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:03,400
Okay, but I just think that if you have more money, you shouldn't get the checks.

1372
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,400
And I'm like, okay.

1373
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,400
Thanks for listening.

1374
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,400
Cool.

1375
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,400
So it's okay.

1376
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,400
My mom sucks, dude.

1377
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,400
Don't worry about it.

1378
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:21,400
Well, it's a shame because my mom used to be, in my opinion, pretty cool.

1379
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,400
When I was growing up, my parents...

1380
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,400
I still consider myself a Christian, I guess,

1381
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:32,400
but my parents were much more intellectual than your typical Christian parents.

1382
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,400
They were like, yeah, Harry Potter's fine.

1383
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,400
Yeah, just hang out at the university.

1384
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:42,400
They were very much more on looking at...

1385
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,400
How do I explain this in brief terms?

1386
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:53,400
Just taking an academic approach to the Bible and all that shit

1387
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,400
and looking at the historical context of certain things

1388
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,400
and looking at the original Hebrew meanings of words

1389
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,400
and how modern-day Christianity has twisted things in stupid ways

1390
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,400
and how hell doesn't actually exist.

1391
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,400
Heaven's not even a thing

1392
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,400
and all these misconceptions that everyone has

1393
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,400
and trying to get to the roots of it,

1394
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,400
which I think is way more interesting than modern Christianity,

1395
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,400
especially modern American Christianity,

1396
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,400
which is fucking dog shit.

1397
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,400
And I don't know.

1398
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,400
I feel like my mom's been talking to some weird people for the last few years

1399
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,400
and she's slipping and it's not good.

1400
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:43,400
I understand.

1401
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,400
It's too bad though.

1402
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:51,400
So that's an ongoing situation.

1403
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,400
Yeah, it'll probably be public in like...

1404
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,400
It's an ongoing legal battle

1405
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,400
that I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens.

1406
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,400
I have leaked government secrets on the PCP.

1407
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,400
Yes.

1408
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
Epic.

1409
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Come and get us, government.

1410
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,400
I had thought you were going to talk more about the black cat OC person.

1411
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
I thought that's what it was about.

1412
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,400
No, it was a different drama every day for a while.

1413
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,400
Not much else has happened with that.

1414
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,400
My friends just gone off Twitter because they can't handle it.

1415
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,400
They're just stressed out and the other artist,

1416
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,400
I haven't heard anything in a while.

1417
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,400
It's just kind of gone quiet.

1418
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,400
Who's gone off Twitter?

1419
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,400
My friend who created the character has gone off Twitter.

1420
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,400
What was her name?

1421
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,400
Her name is Twi-Pi, Miss Twi-Pi Twins.

1422
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:51,400
I can link her Twitter page for the viewers.

1423
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,400
Yeah, shit's...

1424
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,400
When you're not getting anything out of the internet,

1425
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,400
just log off.

1426
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,400
Just close the screen.

1427
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,400
How can you get bullied on the internet when you can just close your eyes

1428
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
and not look at the screen?

1429
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,400
Yeah.

1430
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,400
Simple.

1431
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Exactly.

1432
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,400
That's what I was trying to say earlier.

1433
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:24,400
But what happened with this person?

1434
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,400
It was explained on a previous episode, but basically...

1435
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,400
I haven't listened to that one yet.

1436
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,400
Yes, damn.

1437
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
It was last week.

1438
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,400
No, two weeks ago.

1439
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,400
Miss Twi-Pi made a character and there was this other person,

1440
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,400
another artist who was larger than she was,

1441
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,400
had a larger following, loved her OC,

1442
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,400
drew it as fan art.

1443
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,400
And then slowly or suddenly, I can't remember,

1444
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,400
decided that they're going to make their own OC,

1445
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
which looks exactly the same,

1446
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,400
and then just call it their own character

1447
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,400
Twi-Pi's character is gay, I think.

1448
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
And then this new guy...

1449
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,400
No, they made her straight.

1450
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,400
They made her straight.

1451
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,400
My version is identical to yours, but they're straight.

1452
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,400
Yeah, and they've been a real bitch about it.

1453
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,400
And like a real asshole.

1454
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,400
Oh, my God.

1455
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,400
Funny shit.

1456
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,400
They spent like a year, like the better part of a year

1457
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,400
trying to resolve it in private.

1458
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,400
And the bigger artist was like,

1459
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,400
oh, yeah, you know, I'll tweak the design.

1460
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,400
I'll do a thing to show like the differences.

1461
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,400
I'll do this and that.

1462
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,400
And then he just wouldn't get back to her

1463
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,400
and was mucking around and eventually just stopped

1464
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,400
responding to her messages.

1465
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,400
And then when we went public about it,

1466
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,400
he was trying to like cover it up

1467
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,400
and hide people's comments.

1468
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,400
And then my friend filed a DMCA

1469
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,400
and then he played the victim

1470
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,400
and called my friend dumb.

1471
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,400
Oh, my God.

1472
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,400
And it was all very stupid.

1473
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,400
Flashbacks. Yeah.

1474
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,400
I've been through that.

1475
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,400
In the end, it just gave up.

1476
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,400
Like a...

1477
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,400
Pretty much where we're at.

1478
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,400
It seems like he's not remorseful at all

1479
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,400
and doesn't plan on changing his way.

1480
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,400
No, they will never do.

1481
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,400
A few years ago, I also made a character.

1482
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,400
It was just a character for illustrations,

1483
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,400
not even for comics or anything.

1484
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,400
A few years ago, I also just, you know,

1485
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,400
my friend had a character and I thought,

1486
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,400
great, and I owned them.

1487
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,400
So I made a character that was the same

1488
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,400
and that bitch never let me

1489
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,400
hear the end of it.

1490
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,400
Sorry.

1491
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,400
I wasn't even Twitter, but it happened

1492
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,400
over Instagram.

1493
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,400
And yeah, same situation.

1494
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,400
Like a huge artist

1495
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,400
asked me

1496
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,400
if he could draw a fan art.

1497
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,400
I said yes.

1498
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,400
And then he

1499
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,400
stole the character, basically. That's the end.

1500
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,400
I wanted to fight, but

1501
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,400
same thing.

1502
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,400
Same thing way too animation.

1503
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,400
I just decided to just

1504
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,400
fuck off. Whatever.

1505
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,400
See, you and Twilight have a fatal

1506
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,400
error. You made a fatal error.

1507
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,400
And that is that you are good

1508
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,400
at drawing nice character designs.

1509
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,400
What you should do instead

1510
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,400
is what I do.

1511
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,400
Really stupid shitty cartoons

1512
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,400
that nobody wants to copy.

1513
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,400
And then you can

1514
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,400
make so much merch

1515
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,400
and nobody will even steal it because

1516
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,400
it's like, oh, I don't care. That doesn't look good.

1517
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,400
It's perfect.

1518
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,400
Well, that's how

1519
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,400
the NFTs

1520
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,400
protect themselves from getting right-click

1521
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,400
just because they look like shit and nobody wants them.

1522
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,400
Did you see fucking

1523
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,400
John Lennon's son

1524
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,400
was like chilling some fucking

1525
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,400
some skull NFTs?

1526
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,400
Oh, was that actually him? Fuck.

1527
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,400
Yeah, it was John Lennon and Yoko Ono's fucking son.

1528
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,400
Sean Lennon

1529
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,400
or something. Shilling the skulls.

1530
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,400
Jeez.

1531
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,400
What a fucking bitch.

1532
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,400
Yeah, it was something like

1533
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,400
all those monkeys or whatever

1534
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,400
and lines, they look ugly, but

1535
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,400
these skulls are really gonna blow your mind.

1536
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,400
Why my skulls?

1537
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,400
They look okay, but

1538
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,400
only slightly

1539
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,400
less embarrassing.

1540
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,400
But they're still NFTs with a supremely

1541
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,400
embarrassing by virtue of that.

1542
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,400
To their credit, they did look better than

1543
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,400
the board apes.

1544
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,400
I'll give credit where it's due, I guess.

1545
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,400
If you want to be Papyrus or Shadman

1546
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,400
or something, you can buy

1547
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,400
an avatar,

1548
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,400
a skull avatar on the blockchain.

1549
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,400
But fucking Julian Lennon wouldn't have done that.

1550
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,400
Who's that?

1551
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,400
The first kid.

1552
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
Or wait.

1553
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,400
Sean was with Yoko and Julian was with

1554
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,400
the other

1555
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,400
one.

1556
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,400
They don't know much about the Beatles.

1557
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,400
I know they made music at some point.

1558
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,400
Child.

1559
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,400
Yeah, I think so.

1560
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,400
I think that's true.

1561
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,400
So this is

1562
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,400
internet nowadays, huh?

1563
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,400
Yeah, I did see that

1564
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,400
and I was like, oh god, this is weird.

1565
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,400
Because it's like,

1566
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,400
you always think, oh, what would it be

1567
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,400
if people from the history had Twitter

1568
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,400
accounts? How annoying or

1569
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,400
how would I find out how terrible they are?

1570
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,400
And I don't know much about Sean Lennon.

1571
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,400
How could we cancel them?

1572
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,400
But it's like

1573
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,400
an avenue to see

1574
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
the worst possible take a person can make

1575
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,400
public, viewable.

1576
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,400
And it's there.

1577
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,400
It's Lennon doing it.

1578
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,400
Oh god, which was the

1579
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,400
which is the Monty Python guy

1580
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,400
who? Eric Keitel

1581
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,400
who you know is many.

1582
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,400
John Cleese.

1583
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,400
Yeah, John Cleese.

1584
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,400
Did you see John Cleese's like woke

1585
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,400
joke tweets?

1586
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,400
Yeah, those didn't make sense.

1587
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,400
It was like so embarrassing.

1588
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,400
I'm curious.

1589
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,400
He made a tweet that was like,

1590
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,400
I mean, it was supposed to be ironic, but

1591
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,400
a woke joke.

1592
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,400
And the joke is like

1593
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,400
two, three guys walk into

1594
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,400
a bar.

1595
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,400
One of them says like, I decry racism

1596
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,400
in all its forms and the other two

1597
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,400
agree.

1598
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,400
And it's supposed to be like, haha, it's not funny

1599
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,400
because all they said was

1600
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,400
I don't like racism.

1601
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,400
And it's like, yeah,

1602
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,400
it's not a funny joke, John.

1603
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,400
It's also like not

1604
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,400
observational. Do people do that?

1605
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,400
I really don't know where he gets that from.

1606
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,400
Like the idea that

1607
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,400
people who are

1608
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,400
woke or whatever

1609
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,400
tell jokes that don't have

1610
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,400
punchlines or something.

1611
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,400
I don't want to read too much into it, but

1612
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,400
the corollary

1613
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,400
to a joke like that is that is like

1614
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,400
the obverse of it is, ah, yes, a joke

1615
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,400
that isn't

1616
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,400
a joke that is

1617
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,400
self-consciously anti-racist

1618
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,400
is not funny because without

1619
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,400
racism, how could we have humor?

1620
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,400
We've got a little bit.

1621
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,400
That's totally not what he means by that

1622
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,400
because that would be insane.

1623
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,400
I don't think so. It's just a dumb,

1624
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,400
it's just dumb. It's annoying.

1625
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,400
And you know, he's old.

1626
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,400
He made old movies that are really funny.

1627
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,400
He basically is

1628
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,400
a guy from history

1629
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,400
in who's tweeting.

1630
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,400
And it sucks.

1631
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,400
Yeah.

1632
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,400
But it's

1633
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
a bummer.

1634
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Yeah, I don't know.

1635
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,400
No thanks to that.

1636
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,400
Sort of tangentially

1637
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,400
related.

1638
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,400
I guess it's like

1639
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,400
stupid to have thought of the BBC

1640
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,400
as like a good organization when I was younger.

1641
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,400
But that was the impression I got was

1642
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,400
like they know what they're

1643
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,400
they're not like those

1644
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,400
American Fox News people

1645
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,400
that the Simpsons make fun of.

1646
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,400
This is better than that.

1647
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,400
Not racist. Of course it is.

1648
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400
But

1649
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,400
recently

1650
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,400
you may have heard of

1651
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,400
the transphobic article

1652
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,400
I think it went, we are being pressured

1653
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,400
into sex by some trans women

1654
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,400
and it's about

1655
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,400
a few

1656
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,400
bloggers

1657
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,400
saying that

1658
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,400
trans women,

1659
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,400
I'm a lesbian and trans women

1660
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,400
are forcing themselves on me

1661
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,400
and it's not right.

1662
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,400
And that's the entire article. There's no

1663
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,400
trans person representation in the article.

1664
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,400
I have been following

1665
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,400
Sean's videos about it.

1666
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,400
Sean has made a video outraged about it

1667
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,400
as an encouraged people.

1668
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,400
Two videos.

1669
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,400
And I have gone along with those videos.

1670
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,400
I've left my own complaints

1671
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,400
to the BBC. The first one

1672
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,400
he covered in his second video

1673
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,400
which is copy pasted to a lot of

1674
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,400
people. A lot of what was

1675
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,400
in the thing he said was

1676
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,400
given to me

1677
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,400
which didn't address anything I said.

1678
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,400
So I sent a second complaint

1679
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,400
and I did get a response.

1680
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,400
I will read a bit of it now. Hang on.

1681
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,400
Just need to grab it.

1682
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,400
But it was similar. I love the BBC.

1683
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,400
I want to hear

1684
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,400
from them.

1685
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,400
I want to know what they think.

1686
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,400
Thank you for getting in touch again about our article.

1687
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,400
We're being pressured into sex by some trans women.

1688
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,400
What a silly title.

1689
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,400
There was a part in it where it was

1690
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,400
clear. What I said to them

1691
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,400
in my second complaint was

1692
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,400
you are

1693
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,400
just being transphobic.

1694
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,400
And the response

1695
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,400
they're giving me

1696
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,400
is

1697
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,400
in so many words.

1698
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,400
There's too many words.

1699
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,400
I'll summarize.

1700
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,400
They basically say that

1701
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,400
yes,

1702
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,400
we understand that this is not representative

1703
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,400
of the entire argument.

1704
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,400
But,

1705
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,400
we have done other articles

1706
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,400
and this is part of a series of articles

1707
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,400
like

1708
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,400
discussing

1709
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,400
like transgender

1710
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,400
culture and stuff

1711
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,400
and things that people have.

1712
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,400
So really

1713
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,400
we understand that

1714
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,400
this article is mostly

1715
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,400
like conjecture and has no

1716
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,400
studies. But we made sure to mention

1717
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,400
that the studies are not accurate and we

1718
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,400
said a sentence that is basically

1719
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,400
there's not much data to go on.

1720
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,400
But the entire rest of the article

1721
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,400
and the title imply

1722
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,400
that there is something to go on.

1723
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,400
And it's blatantly obvious

1724
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,400
that this particular

1725
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,400
article

1726
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,400
is like

1727
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,400
we've decided

1728
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,400
they don't seem to understand

1729
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,400
or they're trying to

1730
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,400
not mention the obvious fact

1731
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,400
that to make an article on a

1732
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,400
topic that has no studies

1733
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,400
to back it up, that has no

1734
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,400
significant data

1735
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,400
to make a claim

1736
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,400
the decision to publish

1737
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,400
that in the state

1738
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,400
is like

1739
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,400
clearly the intent is for people

1740
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,400
it's not neutral

1741
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,400
it's not neutral to publish

1742
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,400
some one person said

1743
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,400
that Jews are

1744
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,400
terrible

1745
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,400
that happens.

1746
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,400
A literal fact, a person says

1747
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,400
Jews are terrible. So we've decided

1748
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,400
and no Jews

1749
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,400
that we asked for comment

1750
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,400
just decided to say anything about it.

1751
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,400
So we're just gonna publish it.

1752
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,400
It's technically journalism

1753
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,400
to find a thing that somebody has

1754
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,400
said and say this person has said it

1755
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,400
there's no evidence that Jews are bad

1756
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,400
people but this guy said it and we're gonna

1757
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,400
put that as the title of this article

1758
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,400
and we're going to assume no responsibility

1759
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,400
for anything that happens

1760
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,400
and it's so clear

1761
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,400
that somebody in the BBC in charge

1762
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
of this article is very steadfastly

1763
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,400
transphobic and I've called

1764
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,400
them out in my complaint that

1765
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,400
by allowing this to stay up

1766
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,400
you are just

1767
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,400
infecting the rest of the BBC

1768
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,400
with a transphobic

1769
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,400
layer.

1770
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,400
If you allow transphobia

1771
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,400
to be

1772
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
defended and published

1773
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,400
then there's no part of the

1774
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,400
BBC that isn't fucked.

1775
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,400
So fuck the entire BBC

1776
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,400
you piece of shit. I didn't say it

1777
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,400
like that. I said it as

1778
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,400
Britishly as I could to make them upset.

1779
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,400
I said it very

1780
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,400
politely and directly and

1781
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,400
currently.

1782
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,400
Did you say your wonkers?

1783
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,400
No, Britishly

1784
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,400
complaining is like

1785
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,400
kind of a meme

1786
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,400
because whenever a British

1787
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,400
I don't know if this is the same anywhere else

1788
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,400
maybe it is. But we get all haughty

1789
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,400
and like upper class

1790
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,400
writing. We try and use the big vocabulary

1791
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,400
and we're very direct

1792
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,400
we're very

1793
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,400
like pointed

1794
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,400
and angry but not

1795
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,400
where we're swearing. We be very

1796
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,400
very clear

1797
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,400
and polite and they can't do anything about

1798
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,400
that.

1799
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,400
So I made it so that

1800
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,400
they have to respond and

1801
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,400
I expect nothing to happen. I expect this

1802
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,400
to be like a confirmation for me at least

1803
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,400
that the BBC just has

1804
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,400
a transphobe in a position of power

1805
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,400
that wants this to be the message

1806
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,400
they're sending.

1807
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,400
An illusion

1808
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,400
of neutrality but mostly

1809
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,400
just people, they understand

1810
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,400
that people read headlines and just assume

1811
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,400
they don't go into the article and find

1812
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,400
the sentence that says, this article is bullshit

1813
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,400
by the way. We've said that and that means

1814
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,400
that it's okay to publish.

1815
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Nobody reads that bit.

1816
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,400
Right.

1817
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,400
So, yeah.

1818
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,400
Fuck them.

1819
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,400
BBC can eat a dick.

1820
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,400
I would say the BBC is really

1821
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,400
shit in the bed.

1822
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,400
They're really shit in the bed on this one.

1823
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,400
It's bad.

1824
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,400
I did not write a letter

1825
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,400
but

1826
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,400
I guess I could have even though I'm not British.

1827
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,400
Oh yeah, here's the sentence

1828
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,400
they said, we used the word

1829
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,400
some in the article

1830
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,400
since that clearly does not mean most

1831
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,400
nor all.

1832
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,400
Others quoted in the article said, there is currently

1833
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,400
little data and we don't have figures.

1834
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,400
So,

1835
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,400
they assume that will be enough for me to be like,

1836
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,400
oh okay, you said it.

1837
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,400
You did say that.

1838
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,400
See how that reads to most people

1839
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,400
who are dumb is,

1840
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,400
oh, we don't have data so there must be even more

1841
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,400
trans people doing this.

1842
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,400
I can't wait for even more evidence

1843
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,400
to come out about it.

1844
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,400
It's incalculably high are the statistics.

1845
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,400
You can't even express

1846
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,400
the ratio.

1847
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,400
Yeah.

1848
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,400
Yeah.

1849
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,400
Hmm.

1850
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,400
Boo.

1851
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,400
When you call them out they're like, oh well,

1852
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,400
actually there's not a lot of evidence so can you really say

1853
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,400
I'm wrong? It's like...

1854
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,400
That's...

1855
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,400
That's...

1856
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,400
Someone...

1857
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,400
Someone...

1858
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,400
Sometimes I see a thing on Twitter

1859
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,400
where someone will

1860
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,400
say something about

1861
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,400
like, I don't know,

1862
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,400
history or foreign policy

1863
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,400
or politics or something

1864
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,400
and it'll be like

1865
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,400
I don't know.

1866
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,400
Okay, like the mainstream media, right?

1867
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,400
Like,

1868
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,400
fucking Rachel Maddow will say

1869
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,400
you know,

1870
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,400
COVID has killed, you know,

1871
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,400
800,000 people

1872
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,400
or whatever in America.

1873
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,400
And then some idiot on Twitter

1874
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,400
with an American flag

1875
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,400
in their bio

1876
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,400
will be like...

1877
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,400
The mainstream media lies.

1878
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,400
Like, the mainstream media lies

1879
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,400
and therefore,

1880
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,400
so I don't believe, I think the number's lower.

1881
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,400
And it's like,

1882
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,400
alright,

1883
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,400
maybe the mainstream media does lie,

1884
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,400
but like,

1885
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,400
you're still basing your claim

1886
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,400
off of what they're saying.

1887
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,400
Like, if your reaction to their

1888
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,400
like, oh no, this many people died

1889
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,400
or it's not even about that,

1890
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,400
just anything. Anything that the mainstream media says

1891
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,400
and then you're like, oh,

1892
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,400
the mainstream media said it

1893
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,400
so I believe the opposite.

1894
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,400
It's like, okay, well,

1895
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,400
I don't know, isn't it just as bad?

1896
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,400
Isn't it just as nonsensical?

1897
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,400
If there's someone that you think you can't

1898
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,400
trust for you to be like, okay,

1899
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,400
whatever you say,

1900
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,400
I'm just gonna believe the opposite.

1901
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,400
Like, it's just as irrational to be like,

1902
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,400
whatever you say must be false.

1903
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,400
I must believe the opposite of whatever it is.

1904
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,400
Right? Because...

1905
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,400
I don't know.

1906
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,400
It's an attitude that I see a lot.

1907
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,400
People just assume

1908
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,400
the opposite position because they don't like

1909
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,400
what someone is saying, but really

1910
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,400
if you don't trust someone's word

1911
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,400
you should just take nothing from it.

1912
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,400
You should just be like, well,

1913
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,400
we can't make any statements

1914
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,400
about this fact,

1915
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,400
this subject, because

1916
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,400
the person speaking on it has no credibility.

1917
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,400
So there's just nothing to be gained

1918
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,400
from this

1919
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,400
thing that's being said.

1920
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,400
I think it's probably some kind of a fallacy

1921
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,400
but I don't know what fallacy it is

1922
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,400
but it annoys me.

1923
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,400
Yes.

1924
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,400
I don't know. It reminded me

1925
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,400
of that, I guess.

1926
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,400
There's also the words

1927
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,400
used to describe a thing

1928
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,400
can very greatly influence the people's reaction.

1929
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,400
If you say

1930
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,400
a certain number of deaths

1931
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,400
or killings

1932
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,400
or murders,

1933
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,400
if you use language

1934
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,400
to lessen the blow

1935
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,400
but still tell the truth

1936
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,400
tell the truth enough

1937
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,400
so that you're not actually lying

1938
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,400
but make it seem like...

1939
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,400
Like a police-involved shooting.

1940
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,400
Yeah, something like that.

1941
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,400
It's like

1942
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,400
yucky.

1943
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,400
Gross.

1944
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,400
I'm looking at the thing again.

1945
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,400
There's like a few bits.

1946
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,400
We believe that seeking the view

1947
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,400
of the LGBT alliance was a legitimate

1948
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,400
line of inquiry.

1949
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,400
Ah, yes.

1950
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,400
The wording.

1951
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,400
In assessing

1952
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,400
if the article breached our standards

1953
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,400
of harm, honour, harm, or and offence

1954
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,400
we believe the use of language was proportionate.

1955
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,400
Fair warning was given

1956
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,400
to a strong language contained in the article.

1957
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,400
Yeah, sure.

1958
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,400
Just say transphobic stuff

1959
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,400
and say... You were just triggered.

1960
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,400
You were just triggered, snowflake.

1961
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,400
What do you want a participation trophy?

1962
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,400
You fucking millennial.

1963
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,400
Ah!

1964
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,400
That's it.

1965
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,400
They're acting like you're offended

1966
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,400
because they said a rude word or something.

1967
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,400
Yeah, the first

1968
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,400
response I got was like

1969
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,400
didn't address

1970
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,400
the offence stuff, like the transphobia

1971
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,400
or the implications of

1972
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,400
doing this without asking a trans person

1973
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,400
on their position.

1974
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,400
They're treating it like

1975
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,400
very clearly like

1976
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,400
there's only two sides to this.

1977
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,400
Whether you tolerate trans people

1978
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,400
and we're here to get a wide range

1979
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,400
between those two points.

1980
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,400
Nothing else on the other side.

1981
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,400
Right, we're here to ask for compromise

1982
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,400
between these two ideological

1983
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,400
extremist positions

1984
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,400
of tolerance

1985
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,400
or not.

1986
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,400
Whether you merely think trans people are

1987
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,400
they don't deserve to die

1988
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,400
or whether you do.

1989
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,400
Nothing beyond that.

1990
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,400
We're gonna thread the needle and find the nuance

1991
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,400
in this situation.

1992
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,400
That's so fucked.

1993
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,400
They say

1994
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,400
if I'm not dissatisfied

1995
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,400
and I'm not, I have to go through a different thing

1996
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,400
within 20 working days

1997
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,400
so I have to do more

1998
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,400
complaining and I will.

1999
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,400
I will complain

2000
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,400
until I'm blue, pink

2001
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,400
and white in the face.

2002
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,400
Oh, I see what you're saying.

2003
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,400
That's good. That's funny.

2004
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,400
Oh, yeah, I see it.

2005
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,400
I'm laughing.

2006
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,400
Sorry.

2007
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,400
Well, does anyone have

2008
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,400
any topics to raise

2009
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,400
at this point

2010
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,400
or should we go

2011
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,400
on to voicemails?

2012
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,400
I mean, we've been going for an hour and a half, I think.

2013
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,400
I don't think I have much else.

2014
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,400
Let me think.

2015
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,400
I didn't have that much of my list this week.

2016
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,400
I didn't have that much of my resources with my brain

2017
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,400
because I feel like stuff happened

2018
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,400
but maybe it was just Christmas

2019
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,400
stress and I already talked about that.

2020
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,400
All I did this week

2021
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,400
was

2022
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,400
Phantom's Revenge

2023
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,400
and it just makes me upset

2024
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,400
so I don't want to talk about it.

2025
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,400
Revenge doesn't pay

2026
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,400
then.

2027
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,400
No, it won't.

2028
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,400
Well, all it is.

2029
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,400
The next episode we record

2030
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,400
will be Christmas Eve

2031
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,400
it'll come out.

2032
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,400
Oh, really?

2033
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,400
This one we're recording now

2034
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,400
will come out on the 17th and then the next one

2035
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,400
24th.

2036
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,400
We recorded our Christmas special

2037
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,400
for the drawcast

2038
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,400
and since we release on Saturday

2039
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,400
it'll come out on Christmas

2040
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,400
so that's funny.

2041
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,400
What a good day.

2042
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,400
Well, that'll be a treat

2043
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,400
in your stocking

2044
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,400
and your little YouTube subscriber

2045
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,400
subcount, subfeed stocking

2046
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,400
a little gift

2047
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,400
for you.

2048
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,400
I am...

2049
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,400
I want to get

2050
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,400
so many things done

2051
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,400
in the next week

2052
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,400
so that I can relax,

2053
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,400
enjoy Christmas week

2054
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,400
from the 20th to the 23rd

2055
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,400
and then to the end of the year maybe

2056
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,400
just sort of winding down

2057
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,400
because I feel like by being stressed

2058
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,400
and having all this stuff to do

2059
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,400
it would suck so much

2060
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,400
if it turned January 1st

2061
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,400
I need to

2062
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,400
get some of this out of here

2063
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,400
open a valve.

2064
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,400
I feel the same.

2065
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,400
I really want to

2066
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,400
at least to have the beta done

2067
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,400
if not by the 19th

2068
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,400
which is what I really want

2069
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,400
then at least by Christmas

2070
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,400
or at least by New Year

2071
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,400
I really want it to be over

2072
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,400
or not over but I really want

2073
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,400
to feel like

2074
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,400
I completed something.

2075
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,400
I feel like I'm able to

2076
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,400
relax and then

2077
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,400
I want to get back into doing some video game streams

2078
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,400
because those are fun.

2079
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,400
I like doing that at the end of the

2080
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,400
New Year's Eve

2081
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,400
streaming and then that part

2082
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,400
in the stream where oh shit

2083
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,400
fireworks, New Year's, happy new year

2084
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,400
and then we go outside and we look at the fireworks

2085
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,400
and we come back in and we continue playing.

2086
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,400
I've done that for the last few years

2087
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,400
I really enjoy that even if

2088
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,400
I don't know if anyone watches

2089
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,400
it's not New Year's for Americans yet

2090
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,400
when I'm doing that

2091
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,400
but it's fun.

2092
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,400
I want to have that experience again

2093
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,400
I want to have just chilling out

2094
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,400
playing video games

2095
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,400
I remember

2096
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,400
video games.

2097
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,400
I want to play Phantom's Revenge on Christmas

2098
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,400
I want to play Phantom's Revenge live on stream

2099
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,400
That's what Crack said

2100
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,400
he wants Phantom's Revenge

2101
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,400
in his stocking and I'm like

2102
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,400
I hope I can get it

2103
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,400
I hope I can deliver that

2104
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,400
that would be so good.

2105
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,400
You don't want to let Crack down

2106
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,400
he's going to cry.

2107
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,400
Absolutely.

2108
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,400
Also

2109
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,400
I have another

2110
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,400
thing that I want to announce

2111
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,400
on New Year's

2112
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,400
my other secret project I feel like

2113
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,400
I'm going to be able to announce that on New Year's

2114
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,400
and

2115
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,400
I would like to

2116
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,400
announce that the Phantom's Revenge beta is done

2117
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,400
and then have like a little time

2118
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,400
in between that

2119
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,400
to push that a little bit

2120
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,400
talk about it

2121
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,400
and then New Year's be like

2122
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,400
oh yeah and

2123
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,400
the secret project is also available

2124
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,400
and then there will be a little time between that

2125
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,400
and okay

2126
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,400
now

2127
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,400
the actual final build of Phantom's Revenge is done

2128
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,400
and you can play it and it's

2129
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,400
available to everyone instead of just patrons

2130
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,400
and it's all playtested and stuff

2131
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,400
Yeah

2132
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,400
I don't know where

2133
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,400
I hope so

2134
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,400
I'm trying so hard

2135
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,400
two days ago

2136
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,400
I worked all day

2137
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,400
and I was on an incredible roll

2138
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,400
I got on a huge roll

2139
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,400
of working on the game and adding stuff

2140
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,400
and like yes yes yes

2141
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,400
progress progress and then yesterday

2142
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,400
I wake up and I'm like

2143
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,400
upset

2144
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,400
and I'm like on edge

2145
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,400
I couldn't get on the same roll again

2146
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,400
the whole day I felt like I was just

2147
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,400
banging my head against it and I was like no

2148
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,400
why can't I get that back

2149
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,400
why couldn't I have just continued

2150
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,400
from yesterday

2151
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,400
why

2152
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,400
I don't know

2153
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,400
I don't know the reason why

2154
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,400
but I hope

2155
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,400
yeah

2156
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,400
we're all gonna

2157
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,400
make announcements

2158
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,400
by the end of the year I guess

2159
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,400
I'm gonna announce what I'm gonna be doing

2160
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,400
next year because I'm not gonna be drawing

2161
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,400
comics anymore I'm gonna change

2162
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,400
directions I'm gonna explore new horizons

2163
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,400
oh my god

2164
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,400
do you wanna talk about that

2165
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,400
or is it a secret

2166
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,400
I guess it's not

2167
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,400
that much of a secret but I'm gonna be

2168
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,400
gonna do the big announcement on Twitter

2169
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,400
but I'm gonna move on to animation

2170
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,400
from now on

2171
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,400
yes

2172
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,400
yep

2173
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,400
I have a lot of plans

2174
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,400
for animated

2175
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,400
shorts for the next year

2176
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,400
that I wanna do

2177
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,400
so that's what I'm gonna do

2178
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,400
I guess

2179
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,400
I wanna have

2180
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,400
millions of comics

2181
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,400
but like playing them back at super fast speed

2182
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,400
yeah but

2183
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,400
I wanna have like something to show

2184
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,400
when I do the announcement by the end of December

2185
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,400
and I'm actually also working on

2186
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,400
a secret project that I can't talk about it

2187
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,400
oh my god so many secrets

2188
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,400
yeah so many secret projects

2189
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,400
but this one is not

2190
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,400
mine is like a mission

2191
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,400
and you're all gonna see it like

2192
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,400
super super soonish

2197
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,400
it's gonna be cool

2198
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,400
also

2199
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,400
I hope

2200
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,400
I get back to work

2201
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,400
editing videos

2202
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,400

something I forgot to say

2213
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,400
anything I said in this podcast

2214
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,400
it's just my own personal opinion

2215
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,400
my own personal take

2216
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,400
listener please

2217
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,400
I'm not speaking

2218
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,400
anything Kaiju said

2219
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,400
anything Kaiju said

2220
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,400
you should assume

2221
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,400
the exact opposite is true

2222
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,400
you should assume the exact opposite is true

2223
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,400
everything I've said is the opinion of god

2224
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,400
that should be taken

2225
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,400
utmost seriousness

2226
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,400
you don't want to

2227
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,400
disappoint god do you

2228
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,400
well

2229
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,400
um you know

2230
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,400
wait something did happen I got

2231
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,400
I think this week I got my first ever covid test

2232
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,400
I had never been covid tested before

2233
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,400
is the worst

2234
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,400
yeah it was pretty bad

2235
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,400
it was pretty uncomfortable

2236
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,400
it was

2237
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,400
it was not quite as bad as I thought it

2238
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,400
was gonna be but it was pretty bad

2239
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,400
okay what

2240
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,400
is it like different from the little kits you get

2241
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,400
I don't know I've never done the kit

2242
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,400
oh okay

2243
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,400
I've done that a couple times where you get

2244
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,400
like a swab you stick it up your nose

2245
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,400
and it goes really far and then you put that

2246
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,400
in a little tube

2247
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,400
yeah

2248
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,400
is that what it's called

2249
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,400
I had never gotten one before

2250
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,400
with like a little fluff on the end

2251
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,400
and it goes further than you could ever

2252
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,400
pick your nose with a finger and it's like

2253
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,400
oh my god I'm gonna hit my brain

2254
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,400
no

2255
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,400
it's very weird

2256
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,400
it was pretty far in there

2257
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,400
it didn't feel as far as

2258
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,400
like the diagram made it seem like it

2259
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,400
was so I was a little relieved

2260
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,400
honestly I thought it might have been even

2261
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,400
worse

2262
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,400
but

2263
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,400
yeah I went to

2264
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,400
the Boston Medical

2265
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,400
Center

2266
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,400
did I talk about this last

2267
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,400
week? I don't think so

2268
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,400
okay I don't think so either

2269
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,400
I think this was this week I went to Boston Medical Center

2270
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,400
and I had to

2271
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,400
wait in line and they told me like

2272
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,400
no you got to come back

2273
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,400
in like several hours you got to leave

2274
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,400
and come back because we got to go to lunch

2275
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,400
and like we're full up

2276
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,400
it took me like half the day

2277
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,400
to wait in line

2278
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,400
to get COVID tested

2279
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,400
because I had like my tonsils were hurting

2280
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,400
and I didn't even think I had COVID I thought

2281
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,400
I had strep throat

2282
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,400
but when I went for a strep test

2283
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,400
they made me get a COVID test too

2284
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,400
and

2285
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,400
I got the results of the COVID test

2286
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,400
like a day later and they said no

2287
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,400
COVID negative and I'm like okay cool

2288
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,400
and then I got the results of the strep test

2289
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,400
and they were like

2290
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,400
the results were confusing

2291
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,400
because it said like

2292
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,400
we did detect

2293
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,400
a small amount

2294
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,400
of some strep bacteria

2295
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,400
but the strep back

2296
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,400
I looked it up and the strep bacteria is like

2297
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,400
I guess the bacteria exists

2298
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,400
in your mouth

2299
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,400
anyway

2300
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,400
so like I don't know if it

2301
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,400
I genuinely don't know if the result

2302
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,400
meant yes you do have

2303
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,400
strep like an infection or like no you're normal

2304
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,400
and I don't know what to do about it either way

2305
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,400
Did they not say it was like

2306
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,400
a larger than normal amount of strep bacteria?

2307
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,400
It said

2308
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,400
like streptococcus g-strain

2309
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,400
parentheses few

2310
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,400
like it had few of them

2311
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,400
so I

2312
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,400
guess that means I had strep throat but like

2313
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,400
I feel better

2314
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,400
my throat is still a little bit sore

2315
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,400
but it feels mostly better

2316
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,400
I've had like a little bit of a stuffy nose

2317
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,400
which I don't know if strep throat is even supposed to do that

2318
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,400
I don't know if maybe I caught something else

2319
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,400
like a flute like a cold or something

2320
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,400
or if strep just does that

2321
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,400
or if maybe it's nothing

2322
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,400
and I'm stupid I don't know

2323
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,400
so I don't even know

2324
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,400
what the point of any of that was

2325
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,400
it was just a waste of time

2326
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,400
and put me behind

2327
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,400
on my game just like everything else

2328
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,400
in life

2329
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,400
that exists to do

2330
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,400
what a

2331
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,400
what a disaster

2332
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,400
what a nightmare

2333
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,400
I hate everything

2334
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,400
that is not phantom's revenge

2335
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,400
but I also hate phantom's revenge

2336
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,400
you're so full of hate

2337
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,400
I am so full of hate

2338
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,400
that's why I got twitter suspended

2339
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,400
you gotta remember love Ben

2340
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,400
I gotta remember love

2341
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,400
do you want to talk about that video

2342
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,400
and how stupid it is

2343
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,400
and how like annoying

2344
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,400
I don't really have anything to say

2345
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,400
it's just like whatever

2346
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,400
all I know is what I read in your chat

2347
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,400
and I haven't watched it

2348
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,400
I just

2349
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,400
I did listen to the video

2350
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,400
my take away from it was like

2351
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,400
oh my god this is like such

2352
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,400
navel gazing like

2353
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,400
I literally can't talk about anything but themself

2354
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,400
this person is having like

2355
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,400
mind blowing revelations

2356
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,400
at the age of like 30

2357
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,400
that like a child should understand

2358
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,400
and then I look down in the comments

2359
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,400
and there's like a few hundred comments that are like

2360
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,400
they're all like oh my god

2361
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,400
such character development

2362
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,400
this is such a mature take

2363
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,400
like you've grown so much like I'm so impressed

2364
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,400
by like the maturity on display here

2365
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,400
that's like the fact that

2366
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,400
you changed your opinion in some

2367
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,400
insignificant way about shit that doesn't matter

2368
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,400
and doesn't even mean anything at the end of the day

2369
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,400
like oh this video has me in tears

2370
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,400
and it just reinforced what I already know

2371
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,400
just reinforced what I already know

2372
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,400
which is that like

2373
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,400
Yig heads are the stupidest people

2374
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,400
in the entire world

2375
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,400
there's the stupidest

2376
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,400
the most easily manipulated

2377
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,400
most easily impressed

2378
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,400
morons that exist and if you think

2379
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,400
that if you like

2380
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,400
if you watch it there is something wrong with you

2381
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,400
in the head and I think

2382
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,400
you are just like an imbecile

2383
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,400
and you should seek help

2384
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,400
oh it's a new fucking trick

2385
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,400
tricksy video

2386
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,400
it was

2387
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,400
it was just sort of like

2388
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,400
a bunch of

2389
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,400
semi-connected

2390
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,400
thoughts about something or other

2391
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,400
it was hard to follow and I feel like the conclusions

2392
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,400
were so

2393
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,400
like normal

2394
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,400
like basic that I didn't really know

2395
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,400
when she was making them

2396
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,400
yeah

2397
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,400
yeah I genuinely couldn't tell you

2398
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,400
like what like the point

2399
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,400
is supposed to be

2400
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,400
but boy those commenters were really

2401
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,400
impressed with it

2402
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,400
they really got a lot out of it

2403
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,400
all of a sudden

2404
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,400
I think I also

2405
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,400
had enough with tricksy

2406
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,400
but long before

2407
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,400
she wasn't that infamous

2408
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,400
podcast

2409
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,400
the thing is

2410
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,400
there were some guys

2411
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,400
there were some guys

2412
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,400
I forgot the name of the podcast

2413
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,400
where she went like

2414
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,400
full traitor

2415
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,400
who are these podcasts

2416
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,400
before that

2417
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,400
I was done with her way before that

2418
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,400
a couple of days before that

2419
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,400
it was this thing

2420
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,400
that there are some guys

2421
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,400
on YouTube that are

2422
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,400
creating this

2423
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,400
archive

2424
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,400
and they put that video

2425
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,400
where Digibro

2426
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,400
talked about me

2427
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,400
but with my old

2428
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,400
username that I want comment here

2429
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,400
because I don't want to

2430
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,400
and it was a rant about

2431
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,400
me and it was pretty cool at the time

2432
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,400
yes

2433
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,400
it was

2434
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,400
someone requested it

2435
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,400
at the time it was very helpful but not the point

2436
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,400
the point is that I changed my

2437
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,400
name for several reasons

2438
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,400
and one of those reasons

2439
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,400
is because I've been harassed

2440
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,400
on the internet

2441
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,400
and it's not cool

2442
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,400
so some people found

2443
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,400
that video

2444
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,400
the video that this archive re-uploaded

2445
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,400
and they

2446
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,400
for instance they found me

2447
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,400
again and they started harassing me again

2448
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,400
so I

2449
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,400
tried for several weeks to

2450
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,400
get in touch with these people

2451
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,400
I got in touch with

2452
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,400
other

2453
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,400
Digibro archives that I didn't know

2454
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,400
they even exist

2455
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,400
and nobody knows

2456
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,400
who owns that channel

2457
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,400
so my only hope and chance was

2458
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,400
to actually talk to Trixie

2459
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,400
and ask her like

2460
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,400
do you know these people

2461
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,400
can you do something about it

2462
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,400
please help me because this is

2463
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,400
harassment and I want

2464
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,400
to avoid I just want this video to be

2465
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,400
unlisted that's all I want

2466
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,400
I put a comment

2467
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,400
also in the video and stuff

2468
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,400
and ask Trixie for help and of course

2469
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,400
she never replied so I was like

2470
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,400
you know what, fuck off

2471
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,400
Trixie is too good

2472
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,400
Trixie is too good to answer messages

2473
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,400
fuck off I was like

2474
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,400
done with her

2475
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,400
isn't it Tarbuk

2476
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,400
isn't it Tarbuk transom that runs that channel

2477
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,400
I don't know

2478
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,400
there's multiple archives

2479
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,400
I talked with some

2480
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,400
some people

2481
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,400
some other Digibro archives

2482
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,400
the owners of the archives

2483
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,400
and nobody seems to know that specific channel

2484
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,400
who runs it

2485
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,400
so I just gave up and the video is still there

2486
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,400
but

2487
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,400
yep

2488
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,400
it sucks

2489
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,400
well

2490
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,400
I don't know

2491
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,400
maybe it's not Tarbuk

2492
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,400
I don't know

2493
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,400
he was the guy who was in charge

2494
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,400
he was sort of the head guy in terms of

2495
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,400
collecting all the old videos

2496
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,400
I don't know if he actually runs the channel though

2497
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,400
what's the name of the guy

2498
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,400
well

2499
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,400
Tarbuk transom

2500
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,400
I

2501
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,400
he's in my server

2502
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,400
I mean

2503
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,400
he runs the

2504
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,400
Digi Archive Discord

2505
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,400
I talked with him

2506
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,400
Tarbuk trans

2507
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,400
I talked with him

2508
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,400
long ago

2509
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,400
he doesn't have any idea who runs that channel

2510
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,400
which sucks

2511
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,400
I see

2512
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,400
but yeah

2513
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,400
I don't know then

2514
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,400
I don't know

2515
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,400
just the

2516
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,400
disconnect from reality

2517
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,400
of like

2518
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,400
people

2519
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,400
who would watch that new video

2520
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,400
and be like wow

2521
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,400
this is so

2522
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,400
important

2523
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,400
I've learned something from this

2524
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,400
as like Trixie

2525
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,400
says like I realized recently

2526
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,400
that like

2527
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,400
people make easy content on youtube

2528
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,400
people make low effort content on youtube

2529
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,400
not because they want to make art that's bad

2530
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,400
but just because

2531
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,400
it's easier and it makes them more money

2532
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,400
it's like wow

2533
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,400
really you figured that out did you

2534
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,400
that's great

2535
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,400
I'm proud of you

2536
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,400
it's almost so like

2537
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,400
how could you not know that already

2538
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,400
that I thought that was building to a different point

2539
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,400
but it wasn't

2540
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,400
but she does know she said it before

2541
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,400
she said all that shit before

2542
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,400
no Digi bro said it before

2543
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,400
but Digi bro was just a character

2544
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,400
she was playing

2545
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,400
that was just a character you idiot

2546
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,400
you fell for it

2547
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,400
how could you think

2548
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,400
you were a real person

2549
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,400
I couldn't possibly

2550
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,400
think that

2551
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,400
how dare you accuse me of that

2552
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,400
I would never

2553
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,400
when I said that before

2554
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,400
you were supposed to assume

2555
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,400
that I meant the opposite

2556
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,400
actually

2557
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,400
okay

2558
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,400
okay that's enough

2559
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,400
enough

2560
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,400
anything else before we go to voicemails

2561
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,400
should we go to voicemail

2562
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,400
what

2563
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,400
what

2564
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,400
alright well let's do one

2565
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,400
first voicemail of the day

2566
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,400
is called

2567
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,400
okay

2568
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,400
first voicemail of the day

2569
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,400
oblivion

2570
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,400
oh sorry

2571
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,400
I saw your message and it looked blank

2572
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,400
and I was like why did you post a blank

2573
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,400
now I see

2574
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,400
you posted a snail

2575
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,400
very good

2576
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,400
first voicemail I'm posting it here

2577
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,400
is called sad piece

2578
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,400
alright

2579
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,400
if we're ready

2580
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,400
in three two one

2581
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,400
go

2582
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,400
hey Ben

2583
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,400
it's a weekly reminder

2584
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,400
to catch up on one piece

2585
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,400
so you can be on the podcast

2586
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,400
awww

2587
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,400
awww

2588
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,400
jeez

2589
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,400
you took too long Ben

2590
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,400
I did take too long

2591
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,400
I thought it would be around forever

2592
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,400
this is what happens

2593
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,400
when you don't appreciate what you've got

2594
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,400
it slips through your fingers

2595
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,400
pay of paradise and put up a parking lot

2596
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,400
pay of paradise and put up a pcp

2597
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,400
uh

2598
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,400
yeah

2599
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,400
and put up a podcast

2600
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,400
no take down the podcast

2601
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,400
pay of podcast put up a pcp

2602
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,400
basically

2603
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,400
I know that was a

2604
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,400
sorry sorry

2605
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,400
no no I just finished

2606
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,400
I know that was a joke

2607
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,400
but like it actually made me a little sad

2608
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,400
I gotta move on

2609
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,400
I don't want to think about it

2610
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,400
next one is called

2611
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,400
what is your opinion

2612
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,400
oh lol

2613
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,400
oh sorry the next one is not a voicemail

2614
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,400
it's just a question don't listen to this voicemail

2615
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,400
it doesn't count

2616
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,400
the actual it's just a text question

2617
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:38,400
what's your opinion on Trixie's videos

2618
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,400
pre-yig and post-yig

2619
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,400
okay

2620
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,400
um well we talked about that

2621
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,400
a moment ago

2622
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,400
post-yig

2623
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,400
dog shit

2624
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,400
the work of like a delusional narcissist

2625
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,400
pre-yig

2626
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,400
I would say it's similar like everything that has happened

2627
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,400
since has made me reconsider

2628
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,400
all the past videos and I now realize

2629
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,400
like wait actually it's kind of always

2630
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,400
been the case that Trixie like

2631
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,400
doesn't understand what she's talking about

2632
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,400
half the time

2633
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,400
isn't like able to say anything

2634
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,400
that isn't like directly about herself

2635
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,400
just

2636
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,400
is kind of stupid

2637
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,400
and kind of always was actually

2638
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,400
my favorite

2639
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,400
Digi Bro content was

2640
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,400
Digi Bros. the Let's Play

2641
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,400
series with Victor

2642
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,400
unironically

2643
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,400
my favorite I had gone back and listened

2644
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,400
to that a few times

2645
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,400
I'm glad that child's still up

2646
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,400
because Victor owns it now

2647
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,400
I genuinely think that the real

2648
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,400
talent like Trixie

2649
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,400
thinks her talents are such

2650
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,400
and such but her actual talent

2651
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,400
was always only ever

2652
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,400
to like make

2653
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,400
to make like losers and like weirdos

2654
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,400
like think that she is like

2655
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,400
them

2656
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,400
that's what did it for her

2657
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,400
more than like

2658
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,400
her ability to like

2659
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,400
make compelling points or like

2660
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,400
articulate something

2661
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,400
something

2662
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,400
impactful or whatever

2663
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,400
it's like the

2664
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,400
I don't know

2665
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,400
just terrible

2666
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,400
there's like nuggets of good video

2667
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,400
scattered around but I couldn't remember

2668
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,400
yeah sure

2669
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,400
which ones? I remember the good ones

2670
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,400
do you remember Love?

2671
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,400
do you remember Love? oh no I don't remember that

2672
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,400
you forgot Love?

2673
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,400
what is it?

2674
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,400
where's Urban Dictionary?

2675
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,400
I don't know

2676
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:36,400
we don't have Nate to help us

2677
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,400
you don't have Nate to look it up

2678
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,400
on Urban Dictionary

2679
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,400
Nate's always a hero with the link

2680
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,400
remember Nate?

2681
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:46,400
I don't

2682
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,400
we have forgotten Nate

2683
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,400
we have forgotten

2684
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,400
we have forgotten Nate

2685
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,400
the next

2686
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,400
question is another text question

2687
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,400
it's not the audio

2688
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,400
the PCP Corner Guy

2689
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,400
we rebranded

2690
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,400
the PCP died and we rebranded it

2691
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,400
and now we do Tombstones

2692
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,400
and that's what happened to the PCP Corner Guy

2693
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,400
I guess he's probably also dead

2694
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,400
he's also probably buried somewhere

2695
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,400
he died again

2696
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,400
I guess he died

2697
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,400
I guess he's dead

2698
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,400
that's the canon answer

2699
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,400
okay next one and this is the audio

2700
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,400
one is called Do It

2701
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,400
so let's give this a listen

2702
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,400
go

2703
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,400
I was thinking the exact same thing this week

2704
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,400
I was looking at the logo it's like why don't we just change it to be PCP

2705
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,400
it's stupid

2706
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,400
nobody calls it TPC

2707
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,400
that's true

2708
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,400
it's hard

2709
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,400
it's hard

2710
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,400
it would take me like an hour

2711
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,400
it would take me like an hour to change the logo

2712
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,400
no you're wrong

2713
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,400
you're an idiot

2714
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,400
because I would have to find the font

2715
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,400
and I don't know what font it is

2716
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,400
I would have to recreate it by hand

2717
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,400
which would be annoying

2718
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,400
just copy the P

2719
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,400
just copy the P

2720
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,400
do different font, different CD

2721
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,400
I guess I could kind of just copy the P

2722
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,400
and that would take most of the work out of it

2723
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,400
yeah I guess I could just do that

2724
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,400
no but like because

2725
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,400
there's no high res

2726
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,400
okay I would have to find the high res version

2727
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,400
of it I think there is one in the

2728
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,400
Google Drive

2729
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,400
the high res version has like the

2730
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,400
just cut off

2731
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,400
it's always been an annoyance

2732
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,400
you just give me $15 to vector it

2733
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,400
and then you'll have infinite resolution

2734
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,400
no

2735
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,400
they'll never get my $15

2736
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,400
you're gonna give me $15 when you make more

2737
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,400
than me on Patreon

2738
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,400
oh shit

2739
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,400
that'll be $15 over 15 months Ben

2740
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,400
okay well I'll take what I can get

2741
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,400
I guess

2742
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,400
okay next voicemail is called

2743
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,400
it's called why do boomers

2744
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,400
and there it is

2745
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,400
okay why do boomers

2746
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,400
3, 2, 1, go

2747
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,400
why are boomers

2748
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,400
so obsessed with gas prices to determine

2749
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,400
whether or not a politician is good

2750
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,400
because boomers love cars

2751
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,400
and

2752
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,400
they're self centered

2753
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,400
I understood

2754
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,400
boomers are the real

2755
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,400
it's just a very obvious

2756
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,400
I listened to gas and I was really confused

2757
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,400
what

2758
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,400
do you not call it gas

2759
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,400
it was cars or gas

2760
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,400
there's petrol and gasoline

2761
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,400
which I think are exactly the same thing

2762
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,400
oh yeah yeah nice

2763
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,400
gas

2764
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,400
my parents were always like

2765
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,400
gas prices are just a very obvious

2766
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,400
it actually fluctuates

2767
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,400
and you can see it very clearly

2768
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,400
every day when you drive

2769
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,400
so it's just really in your face

2770
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,400
oh gas prices are up

2771
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,400
I notice that all the time

2772
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,400
so I guess politics are bad now

2773
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,400
because the gas is more expensive

2774
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,400
it's just a very obvious

2775
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,400
it's just a very obvious thing

2776
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,400
it's a very obvious indicator of something

2777
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,400
god damn gas prices are so high

2778
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,400
we need to go bomb some more middle eastern countries

2779
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,400
to get that cheap gas

2780
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,400
I guess so

2781
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,400
although

2782
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,400
although we don't actually

2783
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,400
import that much gas

2784
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,400
we get it from oil rigs

2785
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,400
or whatever

2786
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,400
well maybe the UK is different

2787
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,400
but in America we mostly

2788
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,400
create our

2789
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,400
oil domestically

2790
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,400
the thing about gas

2791
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,400
from Saudi Arabia and the Middle East

2792
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,400
is mostly about maintaining

2793
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,400
control in the region

2794
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,400
controlling the supply to our enemies

2795
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,400
like Russia and stuff

2796
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,400
it's not about acquiring the oil

2797
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,400
for ourselves so much

2798
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,400
if you control the

2799
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,400
oil's patreon page

2800
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,400
then you get to

2801
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,400
cut a bit off the top

2802
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,400
every time there's a transaction

2803
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,400
if you make more oil

2804
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,400
than your enemy

2805
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,400
then you have to give them oil

2806
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,400
on patreon

2807
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,400
imagine if Russia had a patreon page

2808
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,400
I'll donate one drop

2809
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,400
I'll pledge one drop of oil per month

2810
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,400
imagine that

2811
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,400
countries having patreons and then if you pledge

2812
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,400
a certain amount you get citizenship

2813
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,400
if you pledge a certain amount

2814
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,400
you'll be Putin's best friend

2815
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,400
I get called to give you a zoom call

2816
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,400
every few months I get a call from

2817
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,400
some fucking police fundraiser

2818
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,400
or another

2819
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,400
yesterday I got a call from something called

2820
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,400
the Trollmans fund

2821
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,400
which I'm sure is a police thing

2822
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,400
and I always hang up on them

2823
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,400
I think it might be the same guy

2824
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,400
under a bunch of different aliases

2825
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,400
maybe they just all sound the same

2826
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,400
next the voicemail

2827
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,400
is called

2828
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,400
sorry for sending two voicemails

2829
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,400
in a row

2830
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,400
okay

2831
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,400
three two one go

2832
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,400
hey Ben you should sing more often

2833
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,400
you have a nice singing voice

2834
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,400
thanks

2835
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,400
go ahead Ben

2836
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,400
show us your stuff

2837
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,400
you should try it

2838
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,400
I like singing

2839
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,400
and I think I'm okay at it

2840
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,400
I don't get much

2841
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,400
opportunity to do it

2842
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,400
like it doesn't come up

2843
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,400
that much in like

2844
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,400
stuff that I do

2845
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,400
I don't know

2846
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,400
sorry

2847
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,400
I wouldn't mind doing it more

2848
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,400
sing

2849
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,400

2850
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,400
no I won't

2851
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,400
I won't do it off the cuff I refuse

2852
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:50,400
I refuse

2853
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,400
next voicemail is called fried vocalist

2854
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,400
three two one go

2855
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,400
it's time

2856
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,400
to get

2857
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,400
organized

2858
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,400
yes

2859
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,400
you know why

2860
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,400
because I say

2861
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,400
so

2862
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:16,400
I don't agree

2863
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,400
when I say so

2864
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,400
and maybe some things are

2865
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,400
that simple

2866
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,400
yeah get organized

2867
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,400
clean your room it's good for you

2868
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,400
I guess

2869
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,400
I mentioned last week

2870
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,400
I have a giant pile of boxes in the corner of my room

2871
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,400
my room is like too big

2872
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,400
my room is like a little bit too big

2873
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,400
and I don't have like enough furniture

2874
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,400
to fill it with

2875
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,400
so one corner of my room is just a pile

2876
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,400
of boxes just because something's got to take

2877
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,400
up that space

2878
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,400
I don't know fuck it

2879
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,400
next voicemail is called

2880
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,400

but like

2891
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,400
maybe people need to hate more

2892
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,400
I don't know

2893
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,400

01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,400
coping and seething and molding

2898
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,400
are not the same thing as hating

2899
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,400
being a hater

2900
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,400
is being like a naysayer

2901
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:34,400
like a party

2902
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,400
like being like oh

2903
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:38,400
yes

2904
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,400
that thing sucks

2905
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,400
that thing's stupid

2906
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,400
you can hate without molding

2907
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,400
you can be like a casual hater who's just like

2908
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,400
that's dumb I don't like that

2909
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,400
fucking cowboy bebop netflix

2910
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,400

2913
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,400
some people I think there's

2914
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,400
some things

2915
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,400
that more people should be haters about

2916
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,400
and I am proud

2917
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,400
and I proudly hate on those things

2918
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,400
um and that's my

2919
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,400
official I think it is

2920
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,400
I think it's good to

2921
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,400
like to throw shit

2922
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,400

01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,400
and uh he's clearly got my back

2954
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,400
sometimes

2955
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,400
uh

2956
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,400
that's sweet that's sweet

2957
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:26,400
I'm glad he thinks so

2958
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,400
because I think that's generally true

2959
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,400
I won't you know

2960
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,400
I won't I won't uh

2961
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,400
you know

2962
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,400
you know did you see the thing the thing in the news about like

2963
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,400
Chris Cuomo

2964
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,400
getting uh

2965
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,400
fired from NBC or whatever

2966
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,400
you know what I'm talking about nope

2967
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,400
okay

2968
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,400
well oh sum up

2969
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,400
the governor shit I think

2970
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,400
I think he was the governor of New York

2971
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,400
or he might have been the mayor of New York City

2972
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,400
I always confuse those two

2973
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,400
but one of those two was this guy Andrew Cuomo

2974
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:00,400
and he was

2975
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:02,400
really popular for a minute there during

2976
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,400
covid the libs were

2977
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,400
really loving Andrew Cuomo

2978
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,400
but then like he did a bunch of

2979
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,400
shit he like lied about a bunch of figures he like

2980
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:12,400
got a lot of people killed

2981
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,400
due to like fucking around behind

2982
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,400
the scenes with with like the data

2983
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,400
and stuff he acted on bad data

2984
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,400
he he obscured figures to

2985
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,400
make himself look better make the state

2986
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,400
look better a lot of people

2987
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:26,400
died uh but that

2988
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,400
was fine nobody cared about that but then

2989
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:30,400
there was like a sexual harassment scandal

2990
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,400
because he like made he like

2991
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,400
made women feel uncomfortable and like

2992
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,400
was behaving inappropriately

2993
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,400
and that was a big

2994
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,400
thing that caused a big scandal and I think

2995
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,400
got him like impeached or something

2996
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:44,400
and his brother Chris Cuomo

2997
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,400
is like

2998
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,400
one of the head like anchors

2999
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:50,400
for a major news network I think it's NBC

3000
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,400
I forget

3001
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,400
but apparently Chris Cuomo

3002
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,400
was basically

3003
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,400
like

3004
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,400
giving Andrew like privileged information

3005
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,400
he was he was basically colluding

3006
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,400
with Andrew to like

3007
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,400
help him get off these charges of like

3008
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,400
sexual harassment which is obviously

3009
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,400
inappropriate behavior

3010
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,400
for you know a national

3011
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,400
news anchor and the governor

3012
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:16,400
of like a state or mayor

3013
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,400
of a major city or whatever

3014
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,400
so in this

3015
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:22,400
shit came out and they they they fired

3016
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,400
Chris Cuomo over it

3017
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:26,400
and a bunch of other

3018
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:28,400
journals were like if my brother

3019
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,400
did something illegal

3020
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,400
you know I'd have his back right

3021
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,400
like I'd have my brother's back

3022
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,400
no matter what and it's like you know that's

3023
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,400
that's nepotism that's collusion that's

3024
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,400
illegal you're literally just admitting to being

3025
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,400
corrupt is what you're saying there

3026
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,400
so

3027
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,400
so I wouldn't have Nate's I wouldn't have

3028
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,400
Nate's back if he did anything like Andrew

3029
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:50,400
Cuomo I wouldn't

3030
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,400
I wouldn't say it's not

3031
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,400
it's not an unconditional back having right

3032
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,400
there are things you could do that I

3033
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:58,400
would be like I can't have your back about this

3034
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:00,400
definitely but in general it's true I

3035
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,400
yeah but in general it's true

3036
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,400
I do have Nate's back and I'm glad

3037
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:06,400
that he knows that

3038
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:08,400
that reminds me of my brother

3039
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,400
who

3040
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,400
I mentioned this a few years ago also was

3041
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,400
involved in a sexual harassment

3042
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,400
not sexual harassment he was being sued by Sony

3043
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,400
because

3044
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,400
I guess I could tell this quickly this is a

3045
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,400
fucking crazy thing that happened a few years ago

3046
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,400
my younger

3047
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:26,400
brother wanted access to

3048
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:28,400
the PlayStation 4

3049
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,400
like development kit or something

3050
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,400
it's like some proprietary

3051
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:34,400
software but you have to

3052
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:36,400
that game companies can license to make

3053
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,400
PlayStation 4 games or maybe it was PSP or something

3054
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:40,400
but

3055
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,400
he was just a guy he didn't have access to

3056
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,400
it and he wanted it so he

3057
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,400
and my little brother is

3058
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,400
autistic and he's like not very good at

3059
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,400
like

3060
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,400
communicating I guess

3061
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,400
but somehow he managed to create

3062
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,400
a fake how old is he

3063
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,400
he was like 16 17 or something

3064
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:00,400
he managed

3065
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:02,400
to create a fake identity

3066
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,400
and a fake company and get it officially

3067
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,400
registered with the New Zealand government

3068
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:08,400
and a fake location

3069
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,400
like if you look

3070
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,400
it up if you look up the coordinates

3071
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:14,400
on the map it's just an empty field where he

3072
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,400
claimed his his game companies office

3073
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,400
was he got the company officially registered

3074
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,400
so that he could like

3075
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,400
you know go to go to Sony

3076
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,400
and ask for the PlayStation 4 like

3077
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:26,400
dev kit

3078
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,400
and they gave it to him

3079
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:30,400
and then he just leaked it

3080
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:32,400
and

3081
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,400
they caught him immediately

3082
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,400
that sounds like something you could sue over

3083
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:38,400
it's very dangerous for him

3084
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,400
they caught him immediately because

3085
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,400
when they give the kit to someone they like

3086
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,400
they embed your information in there so that they can

3087
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,400
track it and they caught him

3088
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,400
immediately because he was too young

3089
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:50,400
they tried to sue my whole family and I'm like

3090
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,400
oh my god

3091
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:54,400
I don't have your back but also my family

3092
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,400
can't afford to deal with this so

3093
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:58,400
I hope

3094
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,400
I can't defend him

3095
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:02,400
but

3096
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,400
I'm glad it ended up getting resolved

3097
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:06,400
without

3098
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,400
a whole bunch of money being lost

3099
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,400
for my family

3100
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,400
so I mean wait

3101
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:14,400
did that

3102
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:16,400
resolve itself? it did get resolved

3103
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,400
again my mom's a lawyer

3104
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,400
which helps so

3105
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,400
she was able to be like look

3106
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,400
he's a minor like they were trying to argue

3107
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,400
that like he's narrowed

3108
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,400
literally narrowed a virgin and a minor

3109
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:30,400
he's a neurodivergent minor who

3110
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,400
they were trying to argue well

3111
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,400
it's clearly negligence the parents

3112
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,400
you should have known this was going on

3113
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:38,400
for me knowing what my brother's like

3114
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,400
he's like a little

3115
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,400
little goblin troll in his room

3116
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,400
he doesn't like communicate much

3117
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,400
it's very hard to know what he's getting up to

3118
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,400
of course and if you try to

3119
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,400
peak your nose on his business

3120
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,400
he gets very agitated

3121
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,400
and lashes out so it's

3122
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,400
not smart to like do that

3123
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:58,400
you have to give him space

3124
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,400
so they were able to get it settled

3125
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:02,400
on those grounds but sony really wanted to

3126
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,400
sue my family over that

3127
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,400
jesus that's kind of scary

3128
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,400
wait one sec I need another

3129
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,400
I need another sparkling water

3130
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,400
I've got the small bottles they don't last

3131
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,400
they don't last long enough

3132
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,400
oh jesus oh god it's gone

3133
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,400
everywhere

3134
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:22,400
I'm gonna pee

3135
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,400
okay

3136
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:26,400
okay I'm back just kidding

3137
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,400
didn't go everywhere

3138
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,400
ah fuck although it might

3139
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:32,400
it fell out of the

3140
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,400
I just remembered another thing

3141
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,400
it fell out of the fridge so it might go ever when I open it

3142
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,400
let's

3143
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,400
no no it's fine okay few

3144
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,400
anyway what did you remember

3145
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:44,400
what's up I just remembered

3146
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,400
the other time

3147
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,400
my mom sued the New Zealand government

3148
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:50,400
and won

3149
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,400
I'm just remembering all these things

3150
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,400
well what

3151
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,400
well in 2008

3152
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:00,400
my mom was

3153
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,400
the PA

3154
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,400
for sanitarium the New Zealand branch

3155
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:06,400
of sanitarium which is like a big health food company

3156
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,400
anyone living in Australia or New Zealand will be

3157
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,400
familiar with them they make up and go

3158
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:14,400
that's like a very unappetizing name

3159
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,400
for a food company

3160
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:18,400
well the word sanitarium is

3161
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,400
unappetizing to me because

3162
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,400
that's all I knew them for

3163
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,400
I didn't know what that word had another meaning

3164
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,400
well in any case my mom was in a car accident

3165
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,400
she was just parked

3166
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,400
and another car slammed into her

3167
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,400
and like it fucked up her neck really badly

3168
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:34,400
and she lost her job

3169
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:36,400
and so she had to go on like a you know

3170
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,400
I thought you were gonna say she lost her jaw

3171
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,400
like she was like

3172
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,400
like Roger Ebert like no jaw

3173
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,400
okay

3174
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:46,400
no she got a slip of disc in her neck

3175
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,400
she had to go on like a disability

3176
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,400
that's awful

3177
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,400
she had to go on a disability for people

3178
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:54,400
who've been in accidents

3179
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,400
and it never like properly healed

3180
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,400
she was just an awful pain

3181
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,400
for like 5, 6, 7 years

3182
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:02,400
like the pain still hasn't gone away

3183
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,400
since 2008 it's never completely gone

3184
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,400
and for the first like 3 years

3185
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,400
she was like

3186
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:10,400
on so many like pain killers

3187
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,400
that like you're not supposed to take them

3188
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,400
for like long periods of time

3189
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,400
to like be taken at that dosage

3190
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:18,400
for a lot so

3191
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,400
like the pain killers were building up in the system

3192
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,400
and like fucking up things even more

3193
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:24,400
she had a surgery that didn't work out

3194
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:26,400
and like 3 years into this

3195
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,400
she has an appointment with her

3196
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:30,400
I think it's called ACC

3197
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,400
is like the government

3198
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,400
organization that handles like this benefit

3199
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,400
she had an appointment

3200
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,400
you know one of her regularly scheduled appointments

3201
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,400
with the doctor to see how she was doing

3202
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:42,400
and they just

3203
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,400
were like oh hey this appointment

3204
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,400
we're going to see a different doctor

3205
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,400
not your usual one

3206
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,400
we're sending you our special doctor

3207
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:52,400
and it has to be on this date and if you don't show up on this date

3208
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:54,400
at this time you're losing your benefit

3209
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:56,400
and they'd never been that stringent before

3210
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,400
it was like whoa what the fuck

3211
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:00,400
so she goes into this new

3212
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:02,400
office with a new guy

3213
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,400
the second she walks in the guy's like

3214
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,400
oh hey we're here to talk about your degenerative condition

3215
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,400
which is translation for

3216
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,400
what?

3217
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,400
I mean that's not the car accident

3218
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,400
you're just old

3219
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:16,400
my mom was like early 30's

3220
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,400
at this point

3221
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,400
and so

3222
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,400
they tried to like his point

3223
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,400
without even looking at the scans

3224
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,400
he didn't look at anything

3225
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,400
he was just like a government appointed doctor

3226
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:30,400
who just said oh yeah you're getting old

3227
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,400
and the car accident had nothing to do with it

3228
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,400
and I haven't looked at your records

3229
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,400
I'm just saying this you're off the benefit

3230
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,400
basically just lying

3231
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,400
like this is his job

3232
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:42,400
is to just like come up with bullshit reasons

3233
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:44,400
to kick people off the benefit

3234
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,400
and he's done this to a whole bunch of people

3235
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,400
who've like sued him in the past

3236
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,400
and it is bullshit

3237
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,400
and my mom

3238
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,400
sounds like a racket

3239
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:56,400
so my mom sued him and the government over it

3240
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,400
and eventually won

3241
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:00,400
but because all of the

3242
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,400
it took years for the lawsuit to like

3243
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,400
actually go through by the time it actually

3244
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:06,400
like succeeded

3245
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,400
so she gave her like all three years

3246
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,400
worth of overdue payments at once

3247
02:08:10,400 --> 02:08:12,400
and for that year

3248
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,400
it pushed her over a certain income bracket

3249
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,400
and like most of it got taxed away anyway

3250
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,400
so

3251
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,400
fucking hell

3252
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,400
no come on

3253
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:24,400
but like progressive income brackets though

3254
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,400
like can't

3255
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:28,400
I feel like in a situation like this

3256
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,400
when it's money of a government owes you

3257
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:32,400
like maybe that should like be exempt

3258
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,400
shouldn't be taxable

3259
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:36,400
for like someone who has a disability

3260
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,400
I

3261
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,400
I was on

3262
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,400
I was on pandemic unemployment

3263
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,400
benefits

3264
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:46,400
for last year and some of this year

3265
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,400
and I was a bit dismayed

3266
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:50,400
and confused to learn that like

3267
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,400
yeah that's taxable like you have to pay taxes

3268
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:54,400
on that for some reason

3269
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:56,400
like okay

3270
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,400
well

3271
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,400
why don't you just give me less then

3272
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,400
if you're just gonna tax me for it but okay whatever

3273
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,400
guys whatever you want to do

3274
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,400
yeah

3275
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,400
oh well yeah I see

3276
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,400
well

3277
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,400
slipped slip disc in the neck sounds pretty fucking bad

3278
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:14,400
yeah I live in fear of a slip

3279
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,400
disc anywhere I mean

3280
02:09:16,400 --> 02:09:18,400
and the neck sounds like basically the worst place

3281
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:20,400
you can get it

3282
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:22,400
I would imagine that probably the lower

3283
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:24,400
on the spine it is the less

3284
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,400
bad it is

3285
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,400
I had a slipped disc in my playstation

3286
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:30,400
it was awful

3287
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,400
yeah

3288
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,400
you gotta grip it

3289
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,400
you gotta put the pad on

3290
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,400
or something

3291
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,400
you gotta clean that disc

3292
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:42,400
okay so the next voicemail

3293
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,400
is BGE Monthly Cast Clip 2

3294
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:46,400
and how much do you want to bet that

3295
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:48,400
this one just like is the exact opposite

3296
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,400
it's like

3297
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,400
after the last one it's like but

3298
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,400
he sucks and I hate Ben

3299
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:56,400
actually how much do you want to bet

3300
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:58,400
that it's like cancelling out the first one

3301
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:00,400
I don't know

3302
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,400
alright well let's see

3303
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:04,400
oh maybe

3304
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:06,400
I just feel like

3305
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:08,400
the fact that this voicemailer left

3306
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:10,400
two voicemails

3307
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,400
makes me think that probably one is

3308
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:14,400
like a direct response to the other

3309
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,400
but I don't know we'll see

3310
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,400
3

3311
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,400
there it is

3312
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,400
3, 2, 1, go

3313
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,400
I'm a dictator

3314
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:26,400
I literally do things for the greater good

3315
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,400
I kill a couple people

3316
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,400
who would have undermined my regime

3317
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,400
for the greater good and everyone's ultimately happy

3318
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,400
but also I raped a bitch

3319
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,400
I felt like raping this girl this one time

3320
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,400
is that fine

3321
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:40,400
is that fine

3322
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,400
I'm sorry what did I say

3323
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,400
I said I couldn't defend you if you pulled some Cuomo shit

3324
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:46,400
frankly

3325
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,400
this is beyond Cuomo level

3326
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:50,400
I'm sorry Nate

3327
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,400
you're on your own

3328
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,400
I can't have your back

3329
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:56,400
the voicemailer knew what our conversation would be

3330
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,400
they predicted everything

3331
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:02,400
damn I can't believe Nate really

3332
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:04,400
I can't believe he really is

3333
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,400
doing all that stuff

3334
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:08,400
I can't believe that

3335
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:10,400
Nate said that

3336
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,400
and since Nate isn't part of the mainstream

3337
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,400
media I have to take everything he says

3338
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:16,400
exactly at face value

3339
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,400
tragic Terran family's

3340
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,400
apart

3341
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,400
okay

3342
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:26,400
next

3343
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,400
okay there was a comment

3344
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:30,400
and I left a mean response to this comment

3345
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,400
I was very mean to this guy

3346
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,400
but I feel like it was warranted

3347
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,400
there was a comment that was like

3348
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:38,400
on the last episode they said

3349
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,400
you guys have to stop with the unironic Nate hate

3350
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:42,400
pretending like he's a literal monster

3351
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:44,400
yeah I saw that as well

3352
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:46,400
I don't even remember what

3353
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,400
I don't remember what we said

3354
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,400
I don't remember what we said that was that bad

3355
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,400
I think maybe we

3356
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:54,400
made fun of him for

3357
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,400
not making enough videos or something

3358
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,400
or something about being

3359
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,400
like disappointed about the

3360
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,400
podcast ending

3361
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,400
I don't know

3362
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:06,400
I felt like he was taking whatever it was was too serious

3363
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,400
it's not that serious

3364
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,400
anyway

3365
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,400
next voicemail

3366
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,400
next voicemail is

3367
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,400
it's called once again on my pokemon

3368
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,400

02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,400

hatterine

3389
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,400
she has big boobs

3390
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,400
it's canon

3391
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:06,400
oh hatterine is good

3392
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:08,400
I have two like

3393
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:10,400
pseudo canon teams

3394
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:12,400
I have my team in the minecraft server

3395
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,400
which is

3396
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:16,400
swine, vulcarona

3397
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,400
crowbat

3398
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,400
I'm forgetting

3399
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:22,400
yes yes

3400
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,400
and he's poisoned

3401
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:26,400
just like

3402
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,400
the vaccines

3403
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:32,400
he's 5G

3404
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,400
he's 5G

3405
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:38,400
oh fuck what else

3406
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,400
I'm drawing a blank

3407
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:42,400
I'm so stupid

3408
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:44,400
whatever go watch the streams

3409
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:46,400
okay and then there's my cop killer

3410
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:48,400
my cop killer team

3411
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:50,400
which is what I used in the rfck battle against

3412
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:52,400
the rowdy fucker

3413
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,400
and also what is in my NPC

3414
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,400
cop killer version which is also in the server

3415
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:58,400
that one had another team

3416
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,400
and that one

3417
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,400
I think crowbat was on there was definitely a corvanite

3418
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:04,400
I really like corvanite

3419
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,400
a bulk up corvanite is one of my favorite

3420
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,400
mons

3421
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:10,400
so that one's pretty good

3422
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,400
mammoth swine, corvanite

3423
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:14,400
I don't know

3424
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,400
just do whatever you think is good

3425
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,400
pokemon that I would have

3426
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:24,400
are like

3427
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:26,400
usually cute

3428
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,400
and or edgy

3429
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:30,400
I don't have any specifics

3430
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:32,400
except maybe duskull

3431
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,400
I love duskull

3432
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,400
which is the cute

3433
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:38,400
spooky one

3434
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,400
and I like water pokemon

3435
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:42,400
and

3436
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,400
sometimes a big pokemon

3437
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:48,400
I don't know there's lots of pokemon that are good

3438
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:50,400
I could think of many like teams

3439
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:56,400
I mostly like edgy pokemon

3440
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,400
but I really really like

3441
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:00,400
ulteria and mega ulteria

3442
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:02,400
that's like one of my favorites

3443
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:04,400
it's not edgy

3444
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:06,400
it's just epic

3445
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:08,400
it's like

3446
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:10,400
epic wistful

3447
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,400
different type

3448
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,400
epic wistful

3449
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,400
I remember using a combo

3450
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:18,400
that I don't remember now

3451
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,400
but it was between ombreon

3452
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,400
and gardavor

3453
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:24,400
it was mega gardavor probably

3454
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,400
gardavor, gardavor

3455
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:28,400
but I really like

3456
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:30,400
I really like ombreon

3457
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:32,400
and shackle, shackle is awesome

3458
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,400
there should be a goregeist

3459
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,400
as well because that's punk

3460
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:38,400
that's a pumpkin

3461
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,400
yeah, true

3462
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:44,400
you can't have a shackle

3463
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:46,400
and an ombreon on the same team

3464
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,400
you don't need tools

3465
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:50,400
I just like shackle

3466
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,400
shackle in general

3467
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,400
it's my favorite

3468
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:58,400
there's plenty of pokemon

3469
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,400
that I really like but you can't use

3470
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:02,400
there's a poke

3471
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,400
shackle is like he's kind of good

3472
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,400
but he's kind of mostly bad

3473
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,400
but it's really funny to actually win

3474
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:10,400
a battle with shackle

3475
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:12,400
yeah

3476
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,400
oh wait, wait, wait

3477
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:16,400
I've got like three, no four

3478
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:18,400
so duskull, sharpido

3479
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,400
goregeist and spheal

3480
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,400
those are four

3481
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:24,400
I'm not sure about the other two

3482
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:26,400
so cool

3483
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:28,400
yeah, he's edgy

3484
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:30,400
but he's also kind of a ball

3485
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:32,400
I like spherical pokemon

3486
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:38,400
he is so short

3487
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:40,400
sharpido is such a little stump

3488
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:42,400
there is a pokemon that is a punk

3489
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:46,400
that's goregeist

3490
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:48,400
except her like pumpkin

3491
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:50,400
is her thick belly

3492
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:52,400
pumpkaboo and goregeist

3493
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:54,400
that's the line

3494
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:56,400
that's the unevolved form of goregeist

3495
02:16:56,400 --> 02:16:58,400
oh

3496
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:00,400
yeah

3497
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:02,400
I see it

3498
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:04,400
I have not played the gen that goregeist is from

3499
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:06,400
I've just seen her and I'm like oh yeah

3500
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:08,400
is he from gen

3501
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:10,400
five

3502
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,400
six

3503
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:14,400
I think it might be gen six

3504
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:16,400
I also used a lot of mimikyu

3505
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,400
back then

3506
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:20,400
mimikyu is really cool

3507
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:22,400
mimikyu is good

3508
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:24,400
oh shit, wait, there's another one

3509
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:26,400
what's the sun and moon pokemon

3510
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,400
lilligant

3511
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:30,400
lilligant

3512
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:32,400
has the big

3513
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:34,400
wait, no, lilligant is older than that

3514
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:36,400
oh, okay, well whatever

3515
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:38,400
no, no, no, I'm thinking of bolossum

3516
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:40,400
it's not bolossum

3517
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,400
lilligant has the big poofy legs

3518
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,400
which I really like

3519
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:48,400
was lilligant new in sun and moon?

3520
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:50,400
that's where I first saw her

3521
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:52,400
I played gen three and then skipped straight to sun and moon

3522
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:54,400
I don't know anything in between

3523
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:56,400
how's that plan

3524
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:58,400
pokemon

3525
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:00,400
with huge legs

3526
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:02,400
yeah, with a dress

3527
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:04,400
no, I think you're thinking of

3528
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,400
sarena

3529
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:08,400
sarena is like the purple one

3530
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:10,400
that looks like a

3531
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:12,400
you know what

3532
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:14,400
I have a from

3533
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:16,400
gen four on awards

3534
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:18,400
I have this problem that I

3535
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:20,400
begin watching the anime

3536
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:22,400
Japanese

3537
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:24,400
so I have this mix of

3538
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:26,400
American names and Japanese

3539
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:28,400
names of pokemon

3540
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:30,400
it's really, really confusing

3541
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:32,400
starting from gen four

3542
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:34,400
it's like Jesus Christ

3543
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:36,400
I usually name like

3544
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,400
I'm not familiar with the Japanese name sadly

3545
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:40,400
it's really confusing, I hate it

3546
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:42,400
I'm trying to think what

3547
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:44,400
mangosteen

3548
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:46,400
the fruit that sarena

3549
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:48,400
line is based on is a mangosteen

3550
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:50,400
I just thought of

3551
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:52,400
like a variant of muck

3552
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:54,400
that was like made of magma

3553
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:56,400
but that doesn't exist

3554
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:58,400
it's actually a dark cloud enemy

3555
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:00,400
oh, I remember that

3556
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,400
it was on a draw cast

3557
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:06,400
where we did pokemon

3558
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:08,400
combos

3559
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:10,400
no, pokemon of different typing

3560
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:12,400
this is supposed to be lilligant but fighting type

3561
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:14,400
no, it's specifically

3562
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:16,400
fighting ground

3563
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:18,400
every second she is fighting the ground

3564
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,400
it's awesome

3565
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:22,400
it's unsettling

3566
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:24,400
I can't believe I'm looking at it

3567
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,400
again

3568
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:30,400
wow, well thank you for

3569
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:32,400
sharing that

3570
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:34,400
it's incredible

3571
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:36,400
the next

3572
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:38,400
the next voicemail

3573
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:40,400
is called

3574
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:42,400
uh

3575
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:46,400
wait

3576
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:48,400
the next one is called

3577
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:50,400
the mentioned link

3578
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:52,400
and it includes a link but we'll listen to

3579
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:54,400
the voicemail first

3580
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:56,400
one sec, it's loading

3581
02:19:56,400 --> 02:19:58,400
come on, post please

3582
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:00,400
there we go, okay

3583
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:02,400
3, 2, 1, go

3584
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:04,400
yo ben, give everyone the link

3585
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:06,400
that I put in the title

3586
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:08,400
this is a game called Undertale 2

3587
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:10,400
and it looks like it's just going to be

3588
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:12,400
a little meme, like a dumb little meme game

3589
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:14,400
but if you try it out

3590
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:16,400
you'll honestly be shocked by how good it is

3591
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:18,400
I was

3592
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:20,400
if you like stuff like Undertale

3593
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:22,400
obviously, The Simpsons

3594
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,400
Toho, Tails gets trolled

3595
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:26,400
weird RPG maker games

3596
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:28,400
like Hilux and Space Funeral

3597
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:30,400
and fishing minigames

3598
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:32,400
you'll love this game

3599
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:34,400
I could go on and on

3600
02:20:34,400 --> 02:20:36,400
about what I like about it but

3601
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:38,400
just give that page a look, see if you like it

3602
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:40,400
try it out, you won't be disappointed

3603
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:42,400
from

3604
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:44,400
I was already going to recommend this

3605
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:46,400
but it became even more relevant

3606
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:48,400
when you talked about

3607
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:50,400
your concerns for the copyrighted material

3608
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:52,400
in your own game

3609
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:54,400
this game has way more copyright infringement

3610
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,400
than you could ever hope to achieve

3611
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:58,400
so I don't think you need to worry about that

3612
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:00,400
yeah but it's on itch though

3613
02:21:00,400 --> 02:21:02,400
this guy makes other games, they're all on itch

3614
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:04,400
it's not a problem

3615
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:06,400
so yeah, people at home

3616
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:08,400
Google Undertale 2, Revenge of the Robots

3617
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:10,400
it's the first link

3618
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:12,400
you gotta try it

3619
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:14,400
this does look awesome

3620
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:16,400
not to mention the artwork is

3621
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:18,400
extremely epic with a hint of gay

3622
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:20,400
I love it

3623
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:22,400
this does look awesome

3624
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:24,400
this does look awesome

3625
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:26,400
yeah

3626
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,400
this is on itch

3627
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:30,400
where I was not worried about

3628
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:32,400
copyright stuff being a problem

3629
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:34,400
on itch, I was worried about it being a problem

3630
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:36,400
on Steam, which it probably

3631
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:38,400
still would be

3632
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:40,400
but

3633
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:42,400
yeah

3634
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:44,400
I will probably

3635
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:46,400
play this, this looks

3636
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:48,400
really good actually

3637
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:52,400
you guys see him this shit

3638
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:54,400
I'm looking at it

3639
02:21:54,400 --> 02:21:56,400
you guys see him this shit

3640
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:58,400
I went to the page and the animations

3641
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:00,400
maybe we should checkles for hackles

3642
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:02,400
maybe we could do that

3643
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:04,400
maybe we could checkles for hackles

3644
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:06,400
Kazy's been telling me

3645
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:08,400
to play Undertale 2

3646
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:10,400
the other one

3647
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:12,400
Delta Rune 2

3648
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:14,400
for a chapter 2

3649
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:16,400
and I keep saying yeah I'll do it

3650
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:18,400
maybe I want to do this instead

3651
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:24,400
yeah say it's Delta Rune 2

3652
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:26,400
and just put this up

3653
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:28,400
Delta Rune 2

3654
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:30,400
is old news

3655
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:32,400
Undertale 2 is the new

3656
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:34,400
Delta Rune is the new hotness

3657
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:38,400
whatever

3658
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:40,400
okay next

3659
02:22:40,400 --> 02:22:42,400
voicemail

3660
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:44,400
is

3661
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:46,400
shit

3662
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:48,400
here this is the link and it is called

3663
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:52,400
it's called Penny Packer

3664
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:54,400
3 2 1

3665
02:22:54,400 --> 02:22:56,400
go

3666
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:58,400
hey I sent a voicemail

3667
02:22:58,400 --> 02:23:00,400
last time and I misgendered Hippo

3668
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:02,400
since I haven't listened to the podcast

3669
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:04,400
in years I forgot about his metamorphosis

3670
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:06,400
you did it again

3671
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:08,400
you fucking bitch

3672
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:10,400
I also maintained that Ben is pretty gay

3673
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:12,400
but you know at least

3674
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:14,400
he's not as cringe as Nate is these days

3675
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:16,400
who desperately tries to sound smart

3676
02:23:16,400 --> 02:23:18,400
but he just comes off as a doofus instead

3677
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:20,400
but you know

3678
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:22,400
at least Hippo deserves to be called a she

3679
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:24,400
she's trying at least

3680
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:26,400
okay if we're talking about whatever

3681
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:28,400
a bitch did you fell into

3682
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:30,400
or whatever gay shit he calls himself these days

3683
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:32,400
bro no fuck off

3684
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:34,400
I know it's just crazy

3685
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,400
and I don't want to respect his pronoun

3686
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:38,400
since he's just addicted to Adderall at least dick

3687
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:40,400
no fuck you

3688
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:42,400
his gang is pretty cringe as well

3689
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:44,400
yeah that's about it

3690
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:46,400
the gang is cringe but this voicemail is very cringe

3691
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,400
alright I don't remember

3692
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:50,400
when they misgendered me in another voicemail

3693
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:52,400
but fuck you

3694
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:54,400
that's not how

3695
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:56,400
that's not how trans works

3696
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:58,400
you don't get to decide

3697
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:00,400
when and if

3698
02:24:00,400 --> 02:24:02,400
you want to respect a person's identity

3699
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,400
I think

3700
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:06,400
that trans people

3701
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:08,400
are valid but I don't think

3702
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:10,400
chris chan counts because

3703
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:12,400
chris doesn't

3704
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:14,400
wear makeup

3705
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:16,400
and also did a crime

3706
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:18,400
and that means that

3707
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,400
they're a boy now

3708
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:22,400
oh

3709
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:24,400
shut the fuck up

3710
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:26,400
that was irritating

3711
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,400
such a terrible voicemail

3712
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:30,400
I would think you would know better

3713
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:32,400
I would think you would know better

3714
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:34,400
I've said

3715
02:24:34,400 --> 02:24:36,400
I've explained why this is wrong

3716
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:38,400
I would

3717
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,400
oh no just the ones I like

3718
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,400
just the ones that I like

3719
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:44,400
just the ones that I like count

3720
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:46,400
if I don't like you it doesn't count

3721
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,400
you're one of the good ones

3722
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:50,400
I'd rather you just not be bigoted

3723
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:52,400
actually it'll be better

3724
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:54,400
guys from the voicemails you have the option

3725
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:56,400
to shut up

3726
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:58,400
don't say anything but you

3727
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,400
fucking morons

3728
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:02,400
what the hell was that

3729
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:04,400
what the hell was that

3730
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:06,400
I'm going to kiss my trans husband

3731
02:25:06,400 --> 02:25:08,400
on the cheek just to spite you

3732
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:10,400
also the go fund me is still going on

3733
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:12,400
I'm gonna link that

3734
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:14,400
the annoying thing is that I feel like

3735
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:16,400
they think of themselves as

3736
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:18,400
like trans accepting

3737
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:20,400
but clearly they don't

3738
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,400
they're not really

3739
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:24,400
thinking about it correctly

3740
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:26,400
that is the annoying part

3741
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:28,400
it's the

3742
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:30,400
the idea that

3743
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:32,400
respecting a trans person

3744
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:34,400
means just coddling them

3745
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:36,400
or like giving them

3746
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:38,400
if they're trying hard

3747
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:40,400
then you throw them a bone

3748
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:42,400
and you gender them correctly

3749
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:44,400
but other than that

3750
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:46,400
they don't really like

3751
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:48,400
like it's

3752
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:50,400
it speaks to like

3753
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:52,400
a general

3754
02:25:52,400 --> 02:25:54,400
like not

3755
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:56,400
what's the way to phrase it

3756
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:58,400
not agreeing with the terms

3757
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:00,400
but just doing it because it's a nice thing

3758
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:02,400
to do not because it's like correct

3759
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:06,400
the implicit assumption

3760
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:08,400
the implicit assumption there is that

3761
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:10,400
the implicit assumption there

3762
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:12,400
is that you

3763
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:14,400
the other person

3764
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:16,400
you get to choose

3765
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:18,400
you get to pick it for another person

3766
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:20,400
and oh if you

3767
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:22,400
and if someone like

3768
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:24,400
if they please you

3769
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:26,400
if you decide okay this person is cool

3770
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:28,400
I'll do them the favor

3771
02:26:28,400 --> 02:26:30,400
I'll do them the favor

3772
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:32,400
I'll respect their pronouns

3773
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,400
because I like them

3774
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:36,400
but if I don't like them for whatever reason

3775
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:38,400
obviously then I'm not gonna do it

3776
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:40,400
they don't deserve it

3777
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:42,400
they don't deserve to get that from me

3778
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:44,400
because I

3779
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:46,400
am the chooser

3780
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:48,400
I get to decide if they deserve it or not

3781
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:50,400
and I'm gonna choose not to give it to them

3782
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:52,400
because they haven't earned it

3783
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:54,400
you gotta work for it, you gotta earn it

3784
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:56,400
it's terrible, it's awful

3785
02:26:56,400 --> 02:26:58,400
it makes me really mad

3786
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:00,400
fuck you

3787
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:02,400
fuck you penny packer

3788
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:04,400
get fucked

3789
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:06,400
next voicemail

3790
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,400
is called

3791
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:10,400
my accidental meeting with ben saint

3792
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:12,400
at mice

3793
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:14,400
uh

3794
02:27:14,400 --> 02:27:16,400
this must be about

3795
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:18,400
because if you remember I went to

3796
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,400
I tabled at

3797
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:22,400
it was not a proper mice

3798
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:24,400
which is the massachusetts independent comics expo

3799
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:26,400
they didn't have a normal mice this year

3800
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:28,400
they had a mini mice

3801
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:30,400
that was an outdoor thing

3802
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:32,400
uh

3803
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:34,400
and it was smaller than usual

3804
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:36,400
but I was there one of the two days

3805
02:27:36,400 --> 02:27:38,400
so let's hear

3806
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:40,400
it, okay, 3, 2, 1, go

3807
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:08,400
hahahaha

3808
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:34,400
hahahaha

3809
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:38,400
no

3810
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:46,400
well that last part is completely wrong

3811
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:48,400
ben saint would never part with bitcoin

3812
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:50,400
I would never

3813
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:52,400
I would never sodle

3814
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:54,400
uh the

3815
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,400
no, you should know from last

3816
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:58,400
episode that I converted all my bitcoin

3817
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:00,400
to ethereum so that I can pay the gas prices

3818
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:02,400
to get my usdt and usdc out

3819
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,400
duh

3820
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:06,400
but what about your usdc

3821
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,400
no, you don't gotta check

3822
02:29:08,400 --> 02:29:10,400
wait, I gotta check gas prices

3823
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:12,400
no

3824
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:14,400
ethereum gas price

3825
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:16,400
are we up

3826
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:18,400
wait, okay, ethereum average gas price

3827
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:20,400
are we up or are we down

3828
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:22,400
oh, we're down, we're down to only 78

3829
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:24,400
hey, that's the lowest it's been

3830
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:26,400
since october

3831
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:28,400
that usdt is

3832
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:30,400
ah, it's gonna be so good

3833
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:32,400
wait, okay, we gotta check the price of bitcoin

3834
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:34,400
no

3835
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:36,400
we gotta check the price of bitcoin

3836
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:38,400
nah, shut up, nah, we do

3837
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:40,400
the people expected

3838
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:42,400
they come to us for financial advice

3839
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:44,400
no, well, they shouldn't

3840
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:48,400
I encourage that behavior

3841
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:50,400
bitcoin is, oh, no, it went up

3842
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:52,400
no, it went up a bit, it's over 50

3843
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:54,400
oh, no, it's over 50

3844
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:58,400
bros, what do we do?

3845
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:00,400
it's over 50

3846
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:02,400
what are you gonna do, cry about it?

3847
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:04,400
lie down and run

3848
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:06,400
I'm gonna livestream tears

3849
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:08,400
I'm gonna get a bucket

3850
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:10,400
and they're gonna have the camera webcam on the bucket

3851
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:12,400
and see how many tears fall

3852
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:16,400
a lot

3853
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:18,400
well, bummer

3854
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:20,400
I was hoping it wouldn't go back up over 50

3855
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:22,400
but it did

3856
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:24,400
oh well

3857
02:30:24,400 --> 02:30:26,400
next voicemail

3858
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:28,400
is called

3859
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:30,400
wisdom potato

3860
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:32,400
sorry, I'm finding it here

3861
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:34,400
there and everywhere

3862
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:36,400
okay, wisdom

3863
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:38,400
wisdom potato

3864
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:40,400
3, 2, 1, go

3865
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:42,400
I hate the procrastinator's podcast

3866
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:44,400
I fucking hate it

3867
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:46,400
I can't get through a single point without

3868
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:48,400
literally every single host

3869
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:50,400
constantly, like vultures

3870
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:52,400
try and jump on me

3871
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:54,400
and cannibalize my point

3872
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:56,400
to the point where it's unrecognizable

3873
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:58,400
Gladys, I didn't know

3874
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:00,400
you were on the procrastinator's podcast

3875
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:02,400
I'm very sorry for trampling

3876
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,400
all over your potato point

3877
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:06,400
um

3878
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:10,400
whatever

3879
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:12,400
next one is called

3880
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:14,400
join the F-A-G

3881
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:16,400
parentheses

3882
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:18,400
stomp out the red pill

3883
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:20,400
what is this?

3884
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,400
okay, okay

3885
02:31:22,400 --> 02:31:24,400
let's go

3886
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:26,400
3, 2, 1, go

3887
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:28,400
hey PCP, thank you so much

3888
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:30,400
for all of these episodes, tons of

3889
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:32,400
entertainment, keep them coming

3890
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:34,400
um, you know, you've already given so much

3891
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:36,400
but I'm just asking one more thing

3892
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:38,400
um, you know, I understand

3893
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:40,400
that this is a, you know, it went from the

3894
02:31:40,400 --> 02:31:42,400
most red pill podcast on the planet

3895
02:31:42,400 --> 02:31:44,400
to now probably the most blue pill podcast

3896
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:46,400
on the planet, and I need your help

3897
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:48,400
if you couldn't tell by my voice

3898
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,400
I am a high schooler

3899
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:52,400
probably one of the last high school HPCP

3900
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:54,400
fans left, but that's neither here nor there

3901
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:56,400
what happened is

3902
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:58,400
the turning point USA

3903
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:00,400
alt-right group

3904
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:02,400
they're definitely redpilled as fuck

3905
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:04,400
and they're putting up posters

3906
02:32:04,400 --> 02:32:06,400
all over my school because they started

3907
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:08,400
their own fucking club

3908
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:10,400
and it is angering

3909
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:12,400
so what I've been doing is I've been working on

3910
02:32:12,400 --> 02:32:14,400
my own grassroots opposition

3911
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:16,400
um, to them

3912
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:18,400
and what I request from you guys

3913
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:20,400
is um, we have an Instagram account

3914
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:22,400
it's at fagpenrid

3915
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:24,400
F-A-G-E-N-N-R-I-D-G-E

3916
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:26,400
it's the fellowship of atheist gamers

3917
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:28,400
and we're trying to

3918
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:30,400
at least overtake them

3919
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:32,400
and followers, we're at like

3920
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:34,400
20 I think right now and they have

3921
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:36,400
like 124 so it's not going to be

3922
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:38,400
hard, but I think once we get

3923
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:40,400
to that level I'm going to be able to

3924
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:42,400
you know, I'm going to have a lot more firepower

3925
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:44,400
you know, um, right, like I have

3926
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:46,400
there's already a lot of infographics up there

3927
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:48,400
they're just kind of parodies of the posters that they already have

3928
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:50,400
hanging up, um, you know, I don't want to

3929
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:52,400
toot my own horn, but I think they're pretty good

3930
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:54,400
anyways, um, thanks for

3931
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:56,400
your time

3932
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:58,400
um, okay, funny cause

3933
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:00,400
a bit of an edgy name, but

3934
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:02,400
it's not so bad I guess

3935
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:04,400
a bit of an edgy name

3936
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:06,400
fuck turning point, they're cringe

3937
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:08,400
I mean, yeah, fuck turning point

3938
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:10,400
I think Munchie told me that like

3939
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:12,400
at his school they're also like

3940
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:14,400
turning point just kind of like shows up

3941
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:16,400
oh no, and just kind of

3942
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:18,400
they don't really like advertise it

3943
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:20,400
they sort of like

3944
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:22,400
will show up under like the guise of something else

3945
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:24,400
but then like when you go and like talk to them

3946
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:26,400
they'll be like, hey have you heard about turning point USA

3947
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:28,400
uh, have you heard about

3948
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:30,400
that the Democrats

3949
02:33:30,400 --> 02:33:32,400
you know, I'm looking at this

3950
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:34,400
Instagram, I don't know if

3951
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:36,400
the

3952
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:38,400
the F slur angle

3953
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:40,400
is going to be that useful

3954
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:42,400
I feel like

3955
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:44,400
like progressive types would be

3956
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:46,400
pushed away, they're not going to be pulled

3957
02:33:46,400 --> 02:33:48,400
to turning point like

3958
02:33:48,400 --> 02:33:50,400
who are you, who are you

3959
02:33:50,400 --> 02:33:52,400
trying to get a reach with this

3960
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:54,400
as a

3961
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:56,400
as a dunk

3962
02:33:56,400 --> 02:33:58,400
like as a dunk against

3963
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:00,400
turning point

3964
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:02,400
because you know, it's F-A-G-G-O-T

3965
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:04,400
a fellow Atheist

3966
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:06,400
gamer's grassroots opposition to

3967
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:08,400
turning point, I guess it's kind of funny

3968
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:10,400
I do think it's a bit

3969
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:12,400
is it a play on turning point, does turning point

3970
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:14,400
have a similar acronym

3971
02:34:16,400 --> 02:34:18,400
uh, no

3972
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:20,400
you should have taken

3973
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:22,400
parody

3974
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:24,400
it's not like a parody of turning point

3975
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:26,400
it's funny, but like it's kind of like pointless

3976
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:28,400
in why it's like that

3977
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:30,400
pointless even

3978
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:32,400
hmm

3979
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:34,400
turning point less

3980
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:36,400
okay, who was President Ronald Reagan

3981
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:38,400
President Ronald

3982
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:40,400
Ronald Redpilled Reagan was the 40th president

3983
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:42,400
of the United States of America

3984
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:44,400
uh, and the 16th

3985
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:46,400
overall

3986
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,400
Republican president, his most important act for the country

3987
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:50,400
was his president for his work as an actor

3988
02:34:50,400 --> 02:34:52,400
bedtime for Bonzo is, without a doubt

3989
02:34:52,400 --> 02:34:54,400
the best and arguably most genre-defining

3990
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:56,400
monkey movie of the 20th century

3991
02:34:56,400 --> 02:34:58,400
with a 5.4 out of 10 on IMDB

3992
02:34:58,400 --> 02:35:00,400
it takes the peak of presidential cinema

3993
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:02,400
but enough about monkeys, let's talk about

3994
02:35:02,400 --> 02:35:04,400
those monkeys

3995
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:06,400
from those African countries

3996
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:08,400
damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes

3997
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:10,400
yep, he said that

3998
02:35:10,400 --> 02:35:12,400
should have known better to trust Richard Nixon

3999
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:14,400
in a private conversation, amazing right

4000
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:16,400
who would have thought that an 80s era conservative

4001
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:18,400
was racist

4002
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:20,400
I thought I would talk about Reagan

4003
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:22,400
well I guess

4004
02:35:22,400 --> 02:35:24,400
he's saying that Nixon like

4005
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:26,400
leaked the con-

4006
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:28,400
maybe Nixon wrote it down

4007
02:35:28,400 --> 02:35:30,400
and like that's how they know

4008
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:32,400
Nixon had their seats for that beef

4009
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:34,400
I think so, yeah

4010
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:36,400
that sounds right

4011
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:38,400
what I know turning point for

4012
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:40,400
is the

4013
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:42,400
fucking women's conference they did

4014
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:44,400
which I saw a live stream

4015
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:46,400
when Vosh like reviewed it

4016
02:35:46,400 --> 02:35:48,400
and these people

4017
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:50,400
are actually insane

4018
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:52,400
for the first like hour

4019
02:35:52,400 --> 02:35:54,400
actually no, if it was an hour or not

4020
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:56,400
you mean turning point?

4021
02:35:56,400 --> 02:35:58,400
yeah, returning point women's conference

4022
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:00,400
for the first hour I have this conservative woman up on stage

4023
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:02,400
who's like, oh my god, cute servitives

4024
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:04,400
you're so cool, we're gonna go out there

4025
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:06,400
we're gonna be girl bosses

4026
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:08,400
we're gonna get jobs and be business women

4027
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:10,400
and it's gonna be so cool

4028
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:12,400
and then Charlie Kirk goes on stage

4029
02:36:12,400 --> 02:36:14,400
looks at all the women and says

4030
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:16,400
yeah, if you pursue a career

4031
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:18,400
you're not gonna be happy

4032
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:20,400
you need to stay in the home and not have a job

4033
02:36:20,400 --> 02:36:22,400
you're worthless and you will never be a man

4034
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,400
and you can never be on the same foot as a man

4035
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:26,400
and you suck and then all the women

4036
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:28,400
cream their pants

4037
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:30,400
it was funny

4038
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:32,400
that's what they wanted, the first one is there to set them up

4039
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:34,400
to set the pins up so Charlie could

4040
02:36:34,400 --> 02:36:36,400
just bowl them over and knock them all down

4041
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:38,400
be like, yes

4042
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:40,400
it was a

4043
02:36:40,400 --> 02:36:42,400
a false flag

4044
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:44,400
it was a

4045
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:46,400
a red herring

4046
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:48,400
I think I support F.A.G

4047
02:36:48,400 --> 02:36:50,400
they're definitely

4048
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:52,400
they're definitely better than the alternative

4049
02:36:52,400 --> 02:36:54,400
I like what they're doing

4050
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:56,400
I support it, I support the name

4051
02:36:56,400 --> 02:36:58,400
I'm in a gay relationship, I can say it

4052
02:36:58,400 --> 02:37:00,400
it's a great idea

4053
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:02,400
I think I would encourage people to

4054
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:04,400
I think it would be pretty funny

4055
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:06,400
if the fellowship of atheists gamers

4056
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:08,400
were to defeat turning point

4057
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:10,400
USA

4058
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:12,400
at Penridge High School

4059
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:14,400
I think I would call that a W

4060
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:16,400
oh, okay

4061
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:18,400
they say the F.A.G

4062
02:37:18,400 --> 02:37:20,400
is

4063
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:22,400
a parody of

4064
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:24,400
Penridge

4065
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:26,400
turning point USA and F.C.A

4066
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:28,400
which is the fellowship of Christian athletes

4067
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:30,400
so I guess that's what

4068
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:32,400
they're going to do

4069
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:34,400
wait

4070
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:36,400
I think I'm on board

4071
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:38,400
yeah, if I used Instagram

4072
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:40,400
I would give a follow

4073
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:42,400
if only, if only I could use Instagram

4074
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:44,400
I do

4075
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:46,400
actually, I do have an old

4076
02:37:46,400 --> 02:37:48,400
Instagram that I have not logged into in years

4077
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:50,400
so I don't know, maybe later

4078
02:37:50,400 --> 02:37:52,400
I'll try and hop on and see if I still remember

4079
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:54,400
my password

4080
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:56,400
Instagram

4081
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:58,400
at F.A.G Penridge

4082
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:00,400
with two ends

4083
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:02,400
give them a like

4084
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:04,400
give them a boost

4085
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:06,400
I support it

4086
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:08,400
next voicemail

4087
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:10,400
is called

4088
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:12,400
x8

4089
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:14,400
here we go

4090
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:16,400
x8

4091
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:18,400
in three, two, one

4092
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:20,400
go

4093
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:22,400
he is

4094
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:24,400
coming

4095
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:28,400
Santa Claus

4096
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:30,400
Santa Claus

4097
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:32,400
to town

4098
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:34,400
is x

4099
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:36,400
is x8 like

4100
02:38:36,400 --> 02:38:38,400
an edgier version of

4101
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:40,400
Nate

4102
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:42,400
is it like the nobody

4103
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:44,400
is it like Nate's nobody

4104
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:46,400
oh shit, it is

4105
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:48,400
it's gotta be

4106
02:38:48,400 --> 02:38:50,400
maybe

4107
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:52,400
I can't think of what else to think

4108
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:54,400
like they all have an X in their name

4109
02:38:54,400 --> 02:38:56,400
like Luxus and Zaynart

4110
02:38:56,400 --> 02:38:58,400
so Zate is the name

4111
02:38:58,400 --> 02:39:00,400
yeah

4112
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:02,400
maybe

4113
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:04,400
what would Nate's

4114
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:06,400
nobody, would it be like

4115
02:39:06,400 --> 02:39:08,400
Texan

4116
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:10,400
Exant

4117
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:12,400
I think Exant is pretty good

4118
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:14,400
Texan

4119
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:16,400
yeah

4120
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:18,400
Texan

4121
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:20,400
Tenza

4122
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:22,400
Zenat, I don't know, I'm just typing random shit

4123
02:39:22,400 --> 02:39:24,400
Zenat

4124
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:26,400
is probably closest to what it could be

4125
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:28,400
I don't know the name of the convention

4126
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:30,400
I don't like that one

4127
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:32,400
because it has the nat

4128
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:34,400
it's not different enough

4129
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,400
you're right

4130
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:38,400
you're so right

4131
02:39:38,400 --> 02:39:40,400
one of those other ones I said was probably pretty good

4132
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:42,400
I'm so right

4133
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:44,400
next voicemail

4134
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:46,400
is called

4135
02:39:46,400 --> 02:39:48,400
let me find it

4136
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:50,400
a message about one piece being political

4137
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:52,400
oh no

4138
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:54,400
oh yeah

4139
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:56,400
here we go

4140
02:39:56,400 --> 02:39:58,400
3, 2, 1

4141
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:00,400
this is from Berserk Chip

4142
02:40:00,400 --> 02:40:02,400
3, 2, 1, go

4143
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:04,400
so I'm out of the loop

4144
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:06,400
I'm behind a couple episodes

4145
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:08,400
it's been busy

4146
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:10,400
so I don't know what the deal is with calling one piece political

4147
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:12,400
I don't know if we're trolling conservatives or something

4148
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:14,400
but

4149
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:16,400
you said at one point

4150
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:18,400
the show is clearly political

4151
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:20,400
because the world government

4152
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:22,400
are the bad guys

4153
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:24,400
Ben

4154
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:26,400
it's a show about pirates

4155
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:28,400
of course

4156
02:40:28,400 --> 02:40:30,400
law enforcement and government bodies

4157
02:40:30,400 --> 02:40:32,400
are gonna pose an antagonistic force

4158
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:34,400
when it's a show about pirates

4159
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:36,400
it's like saying the show Dexter is anti-cop

4160
02:40:36,400 --> 02:40:38,400
because the cops get in his way sometimes

4161
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:40,400
when he's trying to serial kill people

4162
02:40:40,400 --> 02:40:42,400
I'm cringing

4163
02:40:42,400 --> 02:40:44,400
now I'm not saying one piece isn't political

4164
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:46,400
but like if you're gonna say that

4165
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:48,400
if that's the meme

4166
02:40:48,400 --> 02:40:50,400
you gotta have a better argument

4167
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:52,400
like

4168
02:40:52,400 --> 02:40:54,400
one piece is political because

4169
02:40:54,400 --> 02:40:56,400
Luffy only ever cares about himself

4170
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:58,400
and his tightly knit family

4171
02:40:58,400 --> 02:41:00,400
and that's like a staunchly conservative mindset

4172
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:02,400
if you're gonna say it's political

4173
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:04,400
I would go with something closer to that

4174
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:06,400
anyway

4175
02:41:06,400 --> 02:41:08,400
I love you and I was

4176
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:10,400
dumb

4177
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,400
this is really dumb

4178
02:41:12,400 --> 02:41:14,400
you're right

4179
02:41:14,400 --> 02:41:16,400
that obviously

4180
02:41:16,400 --> 02:41:18,400
it's a story about outlaws

4181
02:41:18,400 --> 02:41:20,400
the government is the antagonists

4182
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:22,400
to our protagonist

4183
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:24,400
yes obviously that's true

4184
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:26,400
but like

4185
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:28,400
think about how the world government is

4186
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:30,400
portrayed

4187
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:32,400
do you think

4188
02:41:32,400 --> 02:41:34,400
do they seem good

4189
02:41:34,400 --> 02:41:36,400
are they portrayed as though they're doing

4190
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:38,400
what's right and they just happen to be

4191
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:40,400
at odds with the protagonist

4192
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:42,400
no

4193
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:44,400
they're evil and it's because they have all this

4194
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:46,400
systemic power that they abuse

4195
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:48,400
it's so obvious

4196
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:50,400
it's so obviously about

4197
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:52,400
the government is bad, the police are bad

4198
02:41:52,400 --> 02:41:54,400
here are the ways that they're bad

4199
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:56,400
and that's reflected in

4200
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:58,400
one piece, it's obviously true

4201
02:41:58,400 --> 02:42:00,400
give me a fucking break

4202
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:02,400
the thing with like

4203
02:42:02,400 --> 02:42:04,400
cops and robbers

4204
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:06,400
the show chooses to show the robbers

4205
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:08,400
the pirates in a good light

4206
02:42:08,400 --> 02:42:10,400
and to show them the protagonist

4207
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:12,400
the main character

4208
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:14,400
good-hearted monkey Luffy

4209
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:16,400
as like a pirate

4210
02:42:16,400 --> 02:42:18,400
clearly implying

4211
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:20,400
then a political message

4212
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:22,400
that not all people determine

4213
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:24,400
like Daned as criminals

4214
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:26,400
are bad and the world government

4215
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:28,400
is the one who decides who is a criminal who isn't

4216
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:30,400
all Luffy wants to do is explore the ocean

4217
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:32,400
he's not like actually a bad person

4218
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:34,400
it's not like

4219
02:42:34,400 --> 02:42:36,400
you make a show

4220
02:42:36,400 --> 02:42:38,400
and it's about this

4221
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:40,400
raper and he loves raping

4222
02:42:40,400 --> 02:42:42,400
you wouldn't show him as like the protagonist

4223
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:44,400
as a good character

4224
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:46,400
and then the police are

4225
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:48,400
like

4226
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:50,400
choosing who

4227
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:52,400
is the good guy

4228
02:42:52,400 --> 02:42:54,400
is itself like a political statement

4229
02:42:54,400 --> 02:42:56,400
are you saying that rape man

4230
02:42:56,400 --> 02:42:58,400
my favorite anime is political?

4231
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:02,400
it's very reductive

4232
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:04,400
it's very reductive to be like

4233
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:06,400
the show's about a pirate

4234
02:43:06,400 --> 02:43:08,400
so of course the bad

4235
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:10,400
the police are the good guys

4236
02:43:10,400 --> 02:43:12,400
or are they

4237
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:14,400
like there's no

4238
02:43:14,400 --> 02:43:16,400
nuance in that read

4239
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:18,400
it doesn't take into account

4240
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:20,400
what a pirate is

4241
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:22,400
a lot of people don't know what it means

4242
02:43:22,400 --> 02:43:24,400
for something to be political

4243
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:26,400
I think a lot of right-wingers

4244
02:43:26,400 --> 02:43:28,400
or otherwise

4245
02:43:28,400 --> 02:43:30,400
centrists would assume

4246
02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:32,400
that thing being called

4247
02:43:32,400 --> 02:43:34,400
political means

4248
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:36,400
it's like

4249
02:43:36,400 --> 02:43:38,400
a character similar to how

4250
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:40,400
drug PSAs happened in cartoons

4251
02:43:40,400 --> 02:43:42,400
in the 80s where the main character

4252
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:44,400
of a popular TV show would

4253
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:46,400
turn to the camera and say

4254
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:48,400
hey kids, stay in school, don't do drugs

4255
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:50,400
political messaging from your government

4256
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:52,400
the America

4257
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:54,400
that's not what being political means

4258
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:56,400
being political is just having

4259
02:43:56,400 --> 02:43:58,400
an opinion on the way anything works

4260
02:43:58,400 --> 02:44:00,400
to be honest

4261
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:02,400
I'll be honest

4262
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:04,400
you could definitely take

4263
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:06,400
a right-wing or libertarian message

4264
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:08,400
away from one piece if you wanted

4265
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:10,400
there's a really easy argument there

4266
02:44:10,400 --> 02:44:12,400
to be like

4267
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:14,400
the government is incompetent

4268
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:16,400
we need to reduce the size of government

4269
02:44:16,400 --> 02:44:18,400
everybody

4270
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:20,400
we need to form tightly knit

4271
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:22,400
clans and look out for our own

4272
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:24,400
and that's what Luffy does

4273
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:26,400
with the straw hats

4274
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:28,400
he gets a clan together

4275
02:44:28,400 --> 02:44:30,400
and they look out for their own

4276
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:32,400
and they live in this world

4277
02:44:32,400 --> 02:44:34,400
of the strongest

4278
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:36,400
whatever

4279
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:38,400
they live in a meritocracy

4280
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:40,400
they have to prove themselves

4281
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:42,400
in the marketplace of ideas

4282
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:44,400
that is the grand line

4283
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:46,400
and the competition for who will find

4284
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:48,400
Raftel or whatever

4285
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:50,400
you could totally make that argument

4286
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:52,400
example of

4287
02:44:52,400 --> 02:44:54,400
an anime that has

4288
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:56,400
an outlaw as the

4289
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:58,400
protagonist and law enforcement

4290
02:44:58,400 --> 02:45:00,400
as the antagonist

4291
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:02,400
that I would say probably is apolitical

4292
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:04,400
and that one

4293
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:06,400
the main character is a thief

4294
02:45:06,400 --> 02:45:08,400
and his opponent is

4295
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:10,400
Inspector Zenigata

4296
02:45:10,400 --> 02:45:12,400
but like

4297
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:14,400
neither one of them is portrayed as particularly

4298
02:45:14,400 --> 02:45:16,400
good and Lupin

4299
02:45:16,400 --> 02:45:18,400
he's pretty amoral but he's just doing

4300
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:20,400
what he wants but he's likable

4301
02:45:20,400 --> 02:45:22,400
whereas Zenigata

4302
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:24,400
is not really representative of

4303
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:26,400
law enforcement as a whole

4304
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:28,400
he's just one bumbling idiot

4305
02:45:28,400 --> 02:45:30,400
who is kind of acting on his own

4306
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:32,400
right?

4307
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:34,400
that doesn't really say anything about

4308
02:45:34,400 --> 02:45:36,400
the role of the police

4309
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:38,400
or the government in society

4310
02:45:38,400 --> 02:45:40,400
one piece definitely does

4311
02:45:40,400 --> 02:45:42,400
way more than the other

4312
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:44,400
I mean the Tenryubito

4313
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:46,400
literally living at the top of the world

4314
02:45:46,400 --> 02:45:48,400
breathing different air

4315
02:45:48,400 --> 02:45:50,400
the Tenryubito and the Goro say

4316
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:52,400
and they're completely protected

4317
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:54,400
from all of the bad things they do

4318
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:56,400
by the world government who they basically own

4319
02:45:56,400 --> 02:45:58,400
it's so clear that there's

4320
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,400
there's

4321
02:46:00,400 --> 02:46:02,400
class inequality in one piece

4322
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:04,400
in the world of one piece there's inequality

4323
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:06,400
there are bad people

4324
02:46:06,400 --> 02:46:08,400
and good people

4325
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:10,400
it's super obvious that systemic inequality

4326
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:12,400
is such a huge fucking

4327
02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:14,400
theme in one piece I don't understand

4328
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:16,400
how you can fancy

4329
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:18,400
the whole fishman arc

4330
02:46:18,400 --> 02:46:20,400
the whole fucking fishman arc is about it

4331
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:22,400
everyone can see that and they'll be like

4332
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:24,400
that's a thing in one piece

4333
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:26,400
some people don't understand

4334
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:28,400
that's political for some reason

4335
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:30,400
I don't know what they're imagining

4336
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:32,400
exactly political meaning

4337
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:34,400
maybe they're just getting caught up

4338
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:36,400
in like twitter argument things

4339
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:38,400
they assume

4340
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:40,400
I don't know

4341
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:42,400
political means when a character says

4342
02:46:42,400 --> 02:46:44,400
trans rights out loud or

4343
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:46,400
something super explicit

4344
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:48,400
that guy

4345
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:50,400
who started that argument on twitter

4346
02:46:50,400 --> 02:46:52,400
I think his name was like

4347
02:46:52,400 --> 02:46:54,400
black D gamer

4348
02:46:54,400 --> 02:46:56,400
what was his name

4349
02:46:56,400 --> 02:46:58,400
his take was like

4350
02:46:58,400 --> 02:47:00,400
he would say stuff like yeah

4351
02:47:00,400 --> 02:47:02,400
like there is racism

4352
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:04,400
yeah there is racism against

4353
02:47:04,400 --> 02:47:06,400
fishman in one piece

4354
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:08,400
but like it's not about that

4355
02:47:08,400 --> 02:47:10,400
and it doesn't like say anything about it

4356
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:12,400
it's just background

4357
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:14,400
it's just background texture

4358
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:16,400
for the story to happen

4359
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:18,400
against

4360
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:20,400
it doesn't say anything

4361
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:22,400
it doesn't even say that it's bad

4362
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:24,400
none of the characters react in any way

4363
02:47:24,400 --> 02:47:26,400
to the fact that slavery is there

4364
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:28,400
they don't even get sad

4365
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:30,400
they're all just like well I guess

4366
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:32,400
we'll just have a fight with someone

4367
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:34,400
not about that

4368
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:36,400
but just in front of it

4369
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:38,400
adjacent to it

4370
02:47:38,400 --> 02:47:40,400
I don't know

4371
02:47:40,400 --> 02:47:42,400
I don't

4372
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:44,400
have any political interpretation of one piece

4373
02:47:44,400 --> 02:47:46,400
but there's also nowadays

4374
02:47:46,400 --> 02:47:48,400
this conflict

4375
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:50,400
between the young pirates

4376
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:52,400
these old fashion pirates

4377
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:54,400
which is basically

4378
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:56,400
a reality of

4379
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:58,400
Japanese politics nowadays

4380
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:00,400
like it's time to

4381
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:02,400
the young ones

4382
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:04,400
to step up and the lizards

4383
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:06,400
to just go sleep

4384
02:48:06,400 --> 02:48:08,400
because Japan is still

4385
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:10,400
ruled by a lot of old

4386
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:12,400
fashion rules and politics

4387
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:14,400
that they don't work

4388
02:48:14,400 --> 02:48:16,400
they don't work

4389
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:18,400
Shin Godzilla

4390
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:20,400
that movie

4391
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:22,400
it's all about that

4392
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:24,400
this is the only message of that movie

4393
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:26,400
so you could also

4394
02:48:26,400 --> 02:48:28,400
it's about big lizard go boom

4395
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:30,400
if you look at

4396
02:48:30,400 --> 02:48:32,400
the arc of

4397
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:34,400
Wano itself

4398
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:36,400
Wano being the Japan allegory

4399
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:38,400
because it's the Japanese island in the world of one piece

4400
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:40,400
there's so many parallels

4401
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:42,400
to historical events

4402
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:44,400
relating to Japan being closed off

4403
02:48:44,400 --> 02:48:46,400
from the rest of the world

4404
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:48,400
which is why

4405
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:50,400
they were

4406
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:52,400
held back technologically

4407
02:48:52,400 --> 02:48:54,400
they don't have guns in Wano

4408
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:56,400
they don't have like

4409
02:48:56,400 --> 02:48:58,400
dendin mushes and stuff

4410
02:48:58,400 --> 02:49:00,400
and the world government

4411
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:02,400
sort of an allegory for America and western civilization

4412
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:04,400
is like trying to get in

4413
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:06,400
they're trying to open the country

4414
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:08,400
there's like so many like

4415
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:10,400
things in one piece

4416
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:12,400
that seem just like

4417
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:14,400
cool plot points in world building

4418
02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:16,400
I don't expect people to

4419
02:49:16,400 --> 02:49:18,400
understand the political

4420
02:49:18,400 --> 02:49:20,400
messaging of

4421
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:22,400
it's clearly all there

4422
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:24,400
to say with confidence

4423
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:26,400
that there's nothing political about anything in one piece

4424
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:28,400
is so weird

4425
02:49:28,400 --> 02:49:30,400
the people that I was arguing with

4426
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:32,400
who get mad if you suggest that there's any

4427
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:34,400
meaning to it at all

4428
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:36,400
are like

4429
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:38,400
they think that when you say

4430
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:40,400
there's a political message

4431
02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:42,400
or there's a political meaning to it

4432
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:44,400
you're saying that like

4433
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:46,400
you're saying that

4434
02:49:46,400 --> 02:49:48,400
that's all it is

4435
02:49:48,400 --> 02:49:50,400
and there and like

4436
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:52,400
in their mind that makes it like

4437
02:49:52,400 --> 02:49:54,400
that's like to call it

4438
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:56,400
like not a real story

4439
02:49:56,400 --> 02:49:58,400
or something you're devaluing it

4440
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:00,400
by saying that

4441
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:02,400
when literally all I think

4442
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:04,400
is just that like

4443
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:06,400
the things that happened in the story

4444
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:08,400
and the choices that Oda made in how he constructed it

4445
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:10,400
say something

4446
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:12,400
and illustrate

4447
02:50:12,400 --> 02:50:14,400
some ideas

4448
02:50:14,400 --> 02:50:16,400
that's literally it

4449
02:50:16,400 --> 02:50:18,400
but I don't know some people

4450
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:20,400
are upset

4451
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:22,400
I mean I know that like

4452
02:50:22,400 --> 02:50:24,400
there's like

4453
02:50:24,400 --> 02:50:26,400
there are

4454
02:50:26,400 --> 02:50:28,400
YouTubers who will talk and complain

4455
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:30,400
about like woke things

4456
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:32,400
in other cartoons

4457
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:34,400
or media where it's like

4458
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:36,400
they're pushing the transgender that oh

4459
02:50:36,400 --> 02:50:38,400
there's a gay wedding in Steven Universe

4460
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:40,400
is like some aspect of like

4461
02:50:40,400 --> 02:50:42,400
it's political

4462
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:44,400
quote unquote is to be

4463
02:50:44,400 --> 02:50:46,400
doing something

4464
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:48,400
that's like

4465
02:50:48,400 --> 02:50:50,400
when there's a gay wedding that's political

4466
02:50:50,400 --> 02:50:52,400
but when like you know

4467
02:50:52,400 --> 02:50:54,400
a class of people that exist at the top

4468
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:56,400
of society you know oppress

4469
02:50:56,400 --> 02:50:58,400
everyone underneath them

4470
02:50:58,400 --> 02:51:00,400
in order to you know maintain

4471
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:02,400
the social hierarchy that's not political

4472
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:04,400
that's just like that's just texture

4473
02:51:04,400 --> 02:51:06,400
I think like

4474
02:51:06,400 --> 02:51:08,400
I don't know exactly what these people believe

4475
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:10,400
but I get a sense

4476
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:12,400
there's at least some

4477
02:51:12,400 --> 02:51:14,400
people who see videos like that

4478
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:16,400
think of the word political

4479
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:18,400
meaning progressive

4480
02:51:18,400 --> 02:51:20,400
and then when they say one piece is political

4481
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:22,400
they think well I don't believe

4482
02:51:22,400 --> 02:51:24,400
in this

4483
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:26,400
this woke agenda so it's not political

4484
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:28,400
actually and they just shut down

4485
02:51:28,400 --> 02:51:30,400
things are only political if they're being

4486
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:32,400
done for the culture war

4487
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:34,400
when Rebecca Sugar had a gay wedding

4488
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,400
in her show she didn't do it because

4489
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:38,400
she like liked the idea

4490
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:40,400
or because she just wanted it to happen

4491
02:51:40,400 --> 02:51:42,400
or one of those characters to be together

4492
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:44,400
she did it to put a middle finger

4493
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:46,400
to the conservatives to be like

4494
02:51:46,400 --> 02:51:48,400
haha I'm brainwashing your kids that's why she did it

4495
02:51:48,400 --> 02:51:50,400
that's how they see things

4496
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:52,400
I mean true and good for them

4497
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:54,400
good for Rebecca

4498
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:00,400
oh god

4499
02:52:00,400 --> 02:52:02,400
I guess a right

4500
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:04,400
wing person would probably look at

4501
02:52:04,400 --> 02:52:06,400
the Tenryubito

4502
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:08,400
and I don't know I'm just guessing here but my

4503
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:10,400
assumption is they would assume that what

4504
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:12,400
the Tenryubito

4505
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:14,400
the real world analog of the Tenryubito

4506
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:16,400
would be like the billionaire

4507
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:18,400
pedophile elites

4508
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:20,400
that are like

4509
02:52:20,400 --> 02:52:22,400
which is like

4510
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:24,400
I guess you could maybe

4511
02:52:24,400 --> 02:52:26,400
make that parallel but like it doesn't make as much

4512
02:52:26,400 --> 02:52:28,400
sense because the Tenryubito

4513
02:52:28,400 --> 02:52:30,400
is a

4514
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:32,400
common thing it's not like

4515
02:52:32,400 --> 02:52:34,400
it's not like a

4516
02:52:34,400 --> 02:52:36,400
you know buy your way in

4517
02:52:36,400 --> 02:52:38,400
you know

4518
02:52:38,400 --> 02:52:40,400
so it doesn't make as much sense to me but I guess

4519
02:52:40,400 --> 02:52:42,400
maybe you could

4520
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:44,400
try and claim something like that

4521
02:52:44,400 --> 02:52:46,400
everybody loves one piece because the idea

4522
02:52:46,400 --> 02:52:48,400
of being the little man

4523
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:50,400
I would respect that more than just be like

4524
02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:52,400
no it doesn't mean anything

4525
02:52:52,400 --> 02:52:54,400
no no it's an adventure story it's for kids it doesn't mean anything

4526
02:52:54,400 --> 02:52:56,400
there's no ideas

4527
02:52:56,400 --> 02:52:58,400
there are no ideas in this story

4528
02:52:58,400 --> 02:53:00,400
you just think about like

4529
02:53:00,400 --> 02:53:02,400
when Luffy punches a guy who told

4530
02:53:02,400 --> 02:53:04,400
it like haha I treat my

4531
02:53:04,400 --> 02:53:06,400
subordinates bad and I'm an asshole

4532
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:08,400
and then Luffy punches him it's like yeah I

4533
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:10,400
feel so good that that guy got beat

4534
02:53:10,400 --> 02:53:12,400
I love Luffy because

4535
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:14,400
he cares about his Nakama and it's like

4536
02:53:14,400 --> 02:53:16,400
so there's no meaning to any of that

4537
02:53:16,400 --> 02:53:18,400
you know you think there's nothing there

4538
02:53:18,400 --> 02:53:20,400
of course there's something there everybody knows

4539
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:22,400
there's something there that's why one piece is so

4540
02:53:22,400 --> 02:53:24,400
popular everybody loves

4541
02:53:24,400 --> 02:53:26,400
being you know rooting for the guy

4542
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:28,400
oppressed by

4543
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:30,400
you know ah my boss

4544
02:53:30,400 --> 02:53:32,400
the fucking government ah big thing

4545
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:34,400
that is like hard to

4546
02:53:34,400 --> 02:53:36,400
comprehend that is controlling my life

4547
02:53:36,400 --> 02:53:38,400
I want freedom I want

4548
02:53:38,400 --> 02:53:40,400
me to be the one who punches people

4549
02:53:40,400 --> 02:53:42,400
everyone loves that everyone knows what

4550
02:53:42,400 --> 02:53:44,400
that feels like and that's why one piece is so

4551
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:46,400
successful and it's just

4552
02:53:46,400 --> 02:53:48,400
it's just sad

4553
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:50,400
to see that like I feel it makes me really mad

4554
02:53:50,400 --> 02:53:52,400
makes me really upset

4555
02:53:52,400 --> 02:53:54,400
people who get upset and argue about this stuff

4556
02:53:54,400 --> 02:53:56,400
really a lot of common ground there anyway

4557
02:53:56,400 --> 02:53:58,400
they're just not thinking about it right

4558
02:53:58,400 --> 02:54:00,400
and it's it's

4559
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:02,400
upsetting a little bit

4560
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:04,400
for sure for sure

4561
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:06,400
um alright so that okay

4562
02:54:06,400 --> 02:54:08,400
then there's another one it's called an addendum

4563
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:10,400
to the message about one piece

4564
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:12,400
the beat I know

4565
02:54:12,400 --> 02:54:14,400
I know I know

4566
02:54:14,400 --> 02:54:16,400
sorry

4567
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:18,400
but it's shorter it's shorter

4568
02:54:18,400 --> 02:54:20,400
there you go

4569
02:54:20,400 --> 02:54:22,400
okay three two

4570
02:54:22,400 --> 02:54:24,400
one let's jam

4571
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:26,400
um okay so I

4572
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:28,400
wrote the script for that voicemail

4573
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:30,400
that I just sent about the one piece thing

4574
02:54:30,400 --> 02:54:32,400
and then I sent it

4575
02:54:32,400 --> 02:54:34,400
and then like five minutes later I was like

4576
02:54:34,400 --> 02:54:36,400
oh shit that kind of makes me sound like a conservative

4577
02:54:36,400 --> 02:54:38,400
so just to work clear I'm not a conservative

4578
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:40,400
I don't like conservatives

4579
02:54:40,400 --> 02:54:42,400
they're mean to me in the YouTube comment section

4580
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:44,400
I don't like them I just couldn't think of a liberal

4581
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:46,400
way to say that one piece is

4582
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:48,400
political if

4583
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:50,400
I'll keep thinking about it

4584
02:54:50,400 --> 02:54:52,400
maybe I'll find it for you

4585
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:54,400
then I promise I'll try

4586
02:54:54,400 --> 02:54:56,400
you mean isn't you mean isn't political

4587
02:54:56,400 --> 02:54:58,400
right

4588
02:54:58,400 --> 02:55:00,400
this guy they were saying

4589
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:02,400
can't even keep his story straight

4590
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:04,400
I don't even

4591
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:06,400
what's even the point

4592
02:55:06,400 --> 02:55:08,400
I whatever

4593
02:55:08,400 --> 02:55:10,400
noted you are whatever

4594
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:12,400
chip you're fucking

4595
02:55:12,400 --> 02:55:14,400
dead I see

4596
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:16,400
if I see you out on the grand line

4597
02:55:16,400 --> 02:55:18,400
I'm fucking I'm fucking pillaging you

4598
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:20,400
I'm reading you

4599
02:55:20,400 --> 02:55:22,400
something like Luffy just

4600
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:24,400
cares about himself or his crew

4601
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:26,400
that's it

4602
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:28,400
have you ever read

4603
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:30,400
one piece have you actually read

4604
02:55:30,400 --> 02:55:32,400
one piece have you read

4605
02:55:32,400 --> 02:55:34,400
alabasta or skypea

4606
02:55:34,400 --> 02:55:36,400
Luffy feels very strongly

4607
02:55:36,400 --> 02:55:38,400
for helping

4608
02:55:38,400 --> 02:55:40,400
people who are nice

4609
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:42,400
and who he thinks

4610
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:44,400
deserve to be helped

4611
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:46,400
yeah

4612
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:48,400
I think so

4613
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:50,400
it's very simple

4614
02:55:50,400 --> 02:55:52,400
he acts selfishly

4615
02:55:52,400 --> 02:55:54,400
he acts selfish sometimes

4616
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:56,400
well he acts selfish but it's like

4617
02:55:56,400 --> 02:55:58,400
for things that are not really that important

4618
02:55:58,400 --> 02:56:00,400
when somebody is getting hurt

4619
02:56:00,400 --> 02:56:02,400
like he doesn't just sit back and let it happen

4620
02:56:02,400 --> 02:56:04,400
he doesn't like that

4621
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:06,400
he's the first one to act

4622
02:56:08,400 --> 02:56:10,400
okay so next voicemail

4623
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:12,400
is called job offer

4624
02:56:12,400 --> 02:56:14,400

4628
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:22,400

02:56:28,400 --> 02:56:30,400
but you were looking through voice gel and voice grill

4633
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:32,400
and you were saying that somebody should be taking

4634
02:56:32,400 --> 02:56:34,400
keeping track of that shit

4635
02:56:34,400 --> 02:56:36,400

4668
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:42,400

up to date

4682
02:58:08,400 --> 02:58:10,400

to release someone else

03:01:08,400 --> 03:01:10,400
one shalt not

4758
03:01:10,400 --> 03:01:12,400
wastes one seed in solitude

4759
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:14,400
thereby condemning masturbation

4760
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:16,400
as a mortal sin

4761
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:18,400
but

4762
03:01:18,400 --> 03:01:20,400
what if i jerked off and came

4763
03:01:20,400 --> 03:01:22,400
live on stream in front of mother mary

4764
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:24,400
in the whole world

4765
03:01:24,400 --> 03:01:26,400
that's not a way

4766
03:01:36,400 --> 03:01:38,400
man i guess there's only one way to find out

4767
03:01:38,400 --> 03:01:40,400
we'll never know

4768
03:01:40,400 --> 03:01:42,400
is to do it and then die at some point

4769
03:01:42,400 --> 03:01:44,400

4770
03:01:46,400 --> 03:01:48,400

03:02:00,400 --> 03:02:02,400
stole something from

4777
03:02:02,400 --> 03:02:04,400
hobby lobby the other day

4778
03:02:04,400 --> 03:02:06,400

03:02:08,400 --> 03:02:10,400
hope you're proud of me too dad

4781
03:02:10,400 --> 03:02:12,400

4782
03:02:12,400 --> 03:02:14,400
i totally absolutely just don't get caught

4783
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:16,400

4786
03:02:20,400 --> 03:02:22,400
and if there are cops there

4787
03:02:22,400 --> 03:02:24,400

4788
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:26,400
go quietly

4789
03:02:26,400 --> 03:02:28,400
they'll kill you

4790
03:02:28,400 --> 03:02:30,400
the pcp supporting acts of terrorism once again

4791
03:02:30,400 --> 03:02:32,400
acts of terrorism

4792
03:02:32,400 --> 03:02:34,400
stealing something

4793
03:02:34,400 --> 03:02:36,400
exactly

4794
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:38,400
these liberals are going crazy

4795
03:02:38,400 --> 03:02:40,400
that fucking guy

4796
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:42,400
this was maybe a couple weeks ago on twitter but there was shoplifting discourse

4797
03:02:42,400 --> 03:02:44,400
and someone was like

4798
03:02:44,400 --> 03:02:46,400
shoplifting is

4799
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:48,400
he called it looting

4800
03:02:48,400 --> 03:02:50,400
but what he was actually talking about was shoplifting

4801
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:52,400
but he implied that

4802
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:54,400
people shoplifting

4803
03:02:54,400 --> 03:02:56,400
from stores

4804
03:02:56,400 --> 03:02:58,400
carries the risk of they coming with guns

4805
03:02:58,400 --> 03:03:00,400
and they're gonna hold you up at gunpoint

4806
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:02,400
hold up the cashiers

4807
03:03:02,400 --> 03:03:04,400
and hold up the store employees

4808
03:03:04,400 --> 03:03:06,400
and it's like

4809
03:03:06,400 --> 03:03:08,400
no

4810
03:03:08,400 --> 03:03:10,400
that's armed robbery

4811
03:03:10,400 --> 03:03:12,400
that's a different crime

4812
03:03:12,400 --> 03:03:14,400
than the one you're describing an epidemic of

4813
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:16,400
you fuck

4814
03:03:16,400 --> 03:03:18,400
but some people are just like

4815
03:03:18,400 --> 03:03:20,400
all crime is the same

4816
03:03:20,400 --> 03:03:22,400
any form of theft carries

4817
03:03:22,400 --> 03:03:24,400
with it the threat that the thief will

4818
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:26,400
put the object

4819
03:03:26,400 --> 03:03:28,400
in a big bag with a money sign on it

4820
03:03:28,400 --> 03:03:30,400
and then pull out guns and knives and swords

4821
03:03:30,400 --> 03:03:32,400
and threaten you with them

4822
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:34,400
this is just what criminals do

4823
03:03:34,400 --> 03:03:36,400
it's all

4824
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:38,400
more ass in my mind

4825
03:03:38,400 --> 03:03:40,400
I can't distinguish between anything

4826
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:44,400
that's what happened

4827
03:03:44,400 --> 03:03:46,400
that's how it would be on the internet sometimes

4828
03:03:46,400 --> 03:03:48,400
hey that was the last voicemail

4829
03:03:48,400 --> 03:03:50,400

4830
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:52,400

4831
03:03:52,400 --> 03:03:54,400

4832
03:03:54,400 --> 03:03:56,400
no oh fuck

4833
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:58,400

4834
03:03:58,400 --> 03:04:00,400
feel proud of yourself

4835
03:04:00,400 --> 03:04:02,400
what would improve your self esteem

4836
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:08,400

03:04:10,400 --> 03:04:12,400
