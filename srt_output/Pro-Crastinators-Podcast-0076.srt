1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,400
Don't call me a rat, buddy!

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,200
I'm not your buddy, friend.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,600
He's not your friend, guy.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,200
I'm not your guy, buddy.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,800
He's not your buddy, friend.

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,500
I'm not your friend!

8
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello!

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,200
Everybody, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,200
The only show on the internet about friends.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,900
I am the best guy ever, and we're joined today by Mumkey Jones.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,500
Oh, look at Donkey Go!

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,800
That's funny.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,300
We've got Ben Saint here.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:43,600
Yeah, the PCP, the only show produced by friends, for friends, and only for friends.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,000
If you're not our friend, get out of here.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,800
If you're not on the Patreon, you're literally a worthless friend.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Oh, wait, Mumkey's calling you out.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,000
Mumkey's calling you out, listener.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,700
That's true.

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,300
We've also got the DeVoo with us.

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey, everybody.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,300
I saw those pictures you posted on Facebook of you guys hanging out.

24
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,400
I guess I didn't get the invite, I guess.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,900
Oh, no.

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,300
Oh, shit.

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,800
DeVoo wasn't supposed to know.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,500
And at her glorious return, it's going to be a real frenesance, everybody.

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,300
Lethal Aurora Mage is back with us.

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,900
Holy shit, here I am, guys.

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,100
We're just delighted to have you with us once again.

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,400
Yeah, I'm happy to return.

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,800
Beautiful.

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
So let's do the thing that we're doing and let's clarify what the PCP is real quick.

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,200
It's a YouTube podcast where a bunch of friends from the internet,

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,600
who all are content creators, get together and just talk about a bunch of bullshit.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Any clarifications?

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,800
It's also a pyramid scheme, as of very recently.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,200
A hashtag PCP Pyramid Scheme, everybody.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,300
All right, well, today's topic, everybody, is friends.

41
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,300
Worthless friends, specifically.

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,100
Those worthless fucking pieces of shit.

43
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,600
Okay, we'll get into the exact definition.

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,500
But first, okay, so there's no worthless friends on Urban Dictionary, if you can believe that.

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,200
But let's just see what a friend is and we'll go from there.

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,300
Nobody knows about friendship better than the people of Urban Dictionary.

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,400
That's very true.

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,100
Okay, here we go.

49
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,400
Here's the top definition for friends.

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,300
People who are aware of how retarded you are and still managed to be seen in public with you.

51
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,900
People who make you laugh till you pee your pants.

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,300
People who cry for you once your special items disappear

53
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,200
when you don't have enough money to get an ice cream they chip in

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,400
knows all your internet passwords who would never make you cry just to be mean.

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
I think I have a lot of friends that would fit this perfectly.

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,200
What a terrible definition.

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,600
If not making me cry just to be mean, it qualifies you as a friend.

58
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Then I think I have an awful lot of friends.

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,100
That's true.

60
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,400
Does anybody actually trust their friends with their internet password?

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,900
That's like a recipe for disaster.

62
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,500
You know what I remember when I think about that?

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,300
You know that scene at the beginning of Full Metal Jacket

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,300
where the Sergeant guy calls out a private fat body or whatever his name was, Gomer Pyle.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,300
He's like, there's nothing in this world I hate more than an unlocked footlocker.

66
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,800
If it wasn't for worthless pieces of shit like you, there'd be no thievery in this world.

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,000
He's making the larger point there that sometimes it's best not to trust everybody

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,600
because everybody's better off that way.

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,300
So I'm totally with you.

70
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,400
You shouldn't share all your personal details

71
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,100
even with your closest friends because people don't want to know that shit

72
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,700
and it causes temptation.

73
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,900
You can fuck you over in the long term.

74
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,700
Well, the problem is they do want to know it

75
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,200
so that they can fuck me over by posting I'm gay lol on Facebook.

76
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,900
So that's why you don't want to give them the password.

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,800
Was that any different from a usual Facebook post for Monkey?

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,700
Like, I don't even...

79
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,200
It's been posted so many times they wouldn't know if I got hacked or not.

80
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,300
You guys use Facebook?

81
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,500
You're such normies.

82
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,400
My Facebook actually got hacked this morning

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
and my college friends were messaging me being like,

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,800
dude, thanks for notifying me about that 90% off sale of sunglasses.

85
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,700
But please keep that to your...

86
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,600
And how ironic is it that it's sunglasses?

87
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,700
Knowing that it's me.

88
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,800
Fucking perfect.

89
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
But in any case...

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
So, okay, we're talking about worthless freks.

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,400
Nate, don't pretend you're not taking a little handout under the table

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,400
from some unscrupulous foreign bootleg sunglasses corporation.

93
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,900
They supply you and that's how you get your fix.

94
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,000
They keep me in the green with these sunglasses.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Keep me out of the red.

96
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,200
Okay, so let's...

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I think we all probably got a different idea of what a worthless friend really is.

98
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,700
I'm sure it'll be around the same...

99
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,600
Same general theme, but...

100
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
So who's had some experience with a friend who turned out to just be of no value

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,500
to you or anyone else on this earth?

102
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,100
Oh, buddy.

103
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,000
I've got a wacky cavalcade of lovable characters to introduce you all to today.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
I have two.

105
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,100
Ooh.

106
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,400
Two.

107
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,300
Well, I think...

108
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,700
I think since Mage is a lady and she's also back after a long summer,

109
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,000
I think we should let her go first.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,500
No.

111
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,600
Agreed.

112
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,300
Don't.

113
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,600
Okay, never mind.

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, let's get somebody else to give one and then we'll maybe go back.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,200
Well, we've all heard the tale of Momke's great friend in high school

116
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,500
who fucked his girlfriend and also slashed his sister.

117
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,300
So that's pretty worthless friend, somebody who betrays your trust like that.

118
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,200
Well, hang on, hang on.

119
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,900
There is a right way to fuck your friend's girlfriend and to fuck your friend's sister.

120
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm just saying, you know, context matters in these situations, but okay.

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,600
Sure.

122
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,200
Yeah, context the fucking his own sister and...

123
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Yeah, of course.

124
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,500
Yeah, great story.

125
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,600
I think I've read that anime before.

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,900
But I mean, the thing is though with me is I think my greatest weakness is that I might be too forgiving

127
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:39,700
because despite how worthless and terrible these friends are and all the bad things they've done to me,

128
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,100
like they don't even fucking say sorry, but I'm just like,

129
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,900
Yeah, well, I guess live and let live, you know.

130
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,200
I think there's a difference between boys and girls is that girls like really hold grudges long term

131
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,700
and the guys are just like, uh, fuck it.

132
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's go drink a beer.

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,600
So hold on.

134
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
So your biggest flaw is that you're too forgiving.

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I think I read about that on like page 17 of Humblebrag Compendium 2018.

136
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh, that's not a brag.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,500
Is being forgiving something to brag about, DeVoo?

138
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
In Jesus fucking did it.

139
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,800
It's a sign of weakness.

140
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
It's like quite literally mess-ionic.

141
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,900
In today's, in today's feminized society, I suppose it is a virtue.

142
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,600
I suppose it is.

143
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,700
I think being too forgiving is a sign of weakness.

144
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,400
I think it's a, it's a humble deficit, not a humble brag because it only leads to more pain.

145
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,500
Like, oh, I guess I'll let you walk all over me and treat me like shit all the time.

146
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
But the thing is, I don't have any other fucking friends.

147
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
So what am I supposed to do about it?

148
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,900
I have no choice but to forgive them for all these terrible things they've done.

149
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,500
But, uh, you know, that's just the one example.

150
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll get into one so you guys haven't heard before later on.

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Okay, uh, mage, can you give us one of your two?

152
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay, but I'm leaving the last one for last because this is super long.

153
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Okay, okay.

154
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,100
So like, um, there was this guy, we go way back.

155
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,800
I think I met him when I was eight at first and like, we have a quite a history, but

156
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
like to summarize it, like at first he was like absolutely terrible.

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,300
Disgusting.

158
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,500
To summarize it, he raped me.

159
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,700
He was, he was, he was the, he was the brother of my best friend.

160
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,200
So we, he had to be there, I guess, but whenever we went to hang out.

161
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Was he an older, an older guy?

162
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, by one year.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
So he was, yeah.

164
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,200
So he's around.

165
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,500
So, so at first, like we really disliked him, but then like, uh, started to really

166
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,400
get along with him that at one point he became the best friend rather than my best

167
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,500
friend, that'll come up later in the second story, by the way, um, or should do

168
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,900
if I don't forget foreshadowing.

169
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,400
But yeah, so, and then, uh, we were like really, really good friends and stuff.

170
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,700
And he went to, um, study in America for a year as, uh, not an exchange program,

171
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,300
but like he won the privilege of studying in America for a year and was really cool.

172
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,900
And we, um, kept in touch and he actually sent me a manga, like the death note first

173
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,000
volume manga for Christmas as well, because he knew I was really into death note at

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,500
that time.

175
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,000
So it was like, it was wonderful.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,800
We were good friends, but then he, he returned and when he returned, he was, he

177
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,100
kind of got set back a year in school because in America, they were learning a

178
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,900
different curriculum than we were learning.

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,600
Sure.

180
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:06,900
Sure.

181
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,500
So he ended up in my class and I was like, we can sit together during the classes

182
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,200
we are going to have together and like we can hang out and stuff.

183
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,400
It'll be like great.

184
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,500
But then he never did.

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,000
And then he kind of started shunning me and it's just like he, he got like too

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,300
cool for me or something.

187
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,900
Like because, because I think the thing is like he was always sort of, he had that

188
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,200
American, he had that, he was, he was an American.

189
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,900
No, the, my theory is because he was always sort of like the nerd in his previous

190
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,300
class.

191
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,100
He didn't really have much friends, but, um, then he came back and he was like,

192
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,300
he started getting along with the other people a lot.

193
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,400
And it was like, we were teens at that point.

194
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,300
I think 16 or 17 and you know, everyone kept hanging out and drinking and stuff.

195
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,800
And I'm not about that.

196
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,400
And like we were, we went to like the super special class called like the

197
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,100
baccalaureate program.

198
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,100
So like all the smart kids quote unquote went there.

199
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,500
Right.

200
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
And I got in there because I was very good at English.

201
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,100
That's the only reason I got in there.

202
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,000
Um, I suck at everything else other than English class.

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,400
So, you know, I wasn't the most popular kid, especially since I was like into

204
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,100
anime and stuff.

205
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,500
So I was like the weird kid.

206
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,200
So I, I was not popular.

207
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,600
So I think he sort of like traded me off for popularity.

208
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,500
And I was like, you know, I, he's been a loser kind of his whole life.

209
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm going to let him have this one.

210
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,400
So, you know, mage, that's a, that's an excellent point.

211
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,500
I also want to add to the point that it is a big propagandized myth that nerds

212
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,800
are like actually good people or nice people like the shitest meme of all.

213
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
I hate it so much.

214
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,500
Every time you see like the scrappy loser kids, honestly, it's like, it's like an

215
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,900
it, the, the, like all the kids who were like the outcast were like the best

216
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,400
people and everyone else was literally an evil monster.

217
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,700
All the bullies were like fucking, you know, evil freaks, but the loser kids

218
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,200
only hang out with each other because they can't do any better.

219
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
That's why they hang out.

220
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,700
And the second you give them a drop of something beyond that, they'll

221
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
seize it and they'll betray you at every turn.

222
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,800
You can't trust a nerd as far as you can throw, particularly with the whole

223
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,400
like, oh, he's going to be better to a girl stereotype.

224
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,700
It's like, there is going to be a, they're taking the beta path to get the

225
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,100
pus.

226
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,400
Right, right.

227
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
That's what they're doing.

228
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,900
You're going to, you're going to be able to perceive a above average

229
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,900
level of giving a shit because of the desperation.

230
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,000
If they get it, the desperation goes away and then they haven't had the

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,700
experience of trial and error and how to treat a woman gentlemanly that a

232
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,300
fucking Chad would have by it.

233
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,900
And I know this game cause I played it for many, many years.

234
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,600
That was my ankle in life.

235
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,700
Oh, I need to go back.

236
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,300
I'm not shitting on them at all.

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,900
They're smart.

238
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,800
They're, they know what they're doing.

239
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,200
You know what it makes me think of?

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,800
It makes me think of Griffith from Berserk and how, and how

241
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,000
he was, you know, he was, well, you know, I won't not, no need to go into the

242
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,400
details, but you know, once, once he, once he got like, once he had all the

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,400
power and once he, once he could do whatever he wanted with no consequences,

244
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,800
he showed his true colors and you know, what's interesting about that, Berserk

245
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,600
really is the story of a friendship and how like, yeah, like, I guess even the

246
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,400
whole thing with Charlotte and like, when he was pursuing, you know, marrying

247
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,400
the princess and becoming king and getting his kingdom and all that, he

248
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,800
never really like, betrayed guts in any serious way until he, you know, like the

249
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,400
eclipse happened.

250
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,200
And like, obviously that's, you know, that pretty much sums up his feelings

251
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,600
right there.

252
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,500
Like these people were his tools, but Berserk, he was nice to them and treated

253
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,000
them well because he needed them.

254
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,100
That's right.

255
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,600
That's right.

256
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,200
And it's a complicated thing, but yes, it is very interesting.

257
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I think that Griffith did show himself at the very least, not a true friend to

258
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,400
those individuals.

259
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,600
No kidding.

260
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes, that's my, uh, that's, that's my deep, that's my deep analysis of that

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
situation.

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,300
Yes.

263
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm just like, those guys are okay.

264
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,600
Those people, if they were, if they were like hot 10 out of 10s, you know,

265
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,400
they'd be banging cosplay sluts that wouldn't be hanging out and making this

266
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,600
commercial for Sakura con, like a bunch of bullshit.

267
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,700
That's their angle, man.

268
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,300
That's their angle in life to hang around Vic Minyana, make these terrible

269
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,300
commercials and go to soccer God every year.

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
My one, the one ambition.

271
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,900
Um, okay.

272
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,100
Let's, let's move on to another one.

273
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,500
Ben, do you have a story for us?

274
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,100
Um, worthless friend of yours.

275
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
I remember one that involves you actually.

276
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,100
Wait, give me a hint because I'm thinking of one.

277
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,300
I just, I remember a vague story about when you used to ride the bus with a

278
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,800
kid and he, you seem to be really have fun with him.

279
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,500
But then when the other people were around, he would, he would be mean.

280
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,200
He'd be mean.

281
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,900
He proved that he didn't actually like you.

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,800
I, you know, I actually don't remember that story.

283
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
I think you might be thinking of someone else.

284
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,300
No, the, the guy, okay.

285
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,400
So I have a guy, he, I don't think he's not worthless.

286
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,700
Like I actually like him in a lot of ways and like I'd still consider him a

287
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,800
friend, but he did prove to be troublesome.

288
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,700
Like not just to me, but to other people.

289
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,600
This was like God, like maybe a year and a half ago before I moved in with

290
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,300
Digi, I was living, I was living in this place in Medford, which is near

291
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,800
Boston.

292
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
It was called Monkey House.

293
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,200
And Monk, yeah, we call it Monk.

294
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,400
We were, we were this, yeah, we were this, we were six, six little Monkeys

295
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,900
living in a house and jumping on the bed.

296
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,500
We, we, it won't tell off and call the doctor and the doctor said, no more

297
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:29,900
Monkeys.

298
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,700
Oh yeah, I've been there.

299
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,100
Actually, I think, I think like to, like the first day at Monkey House, we all

300
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,800
like jumped on a bed together, you know, to seal a rhyme, teach you nothing.

301
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,100
Oh God, we didn't, yeah, we really didn't think that went through, did we?

302
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,000
But, uh,

303
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,300
You could have bonked your head on the floor, dude.

304
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,200
So, so Monkey House was a collaborative effort.

305
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,100
Basically, there was, we knew, we knew this guy.

306
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll just say his name.

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
His name, his name is, uh,

308
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,000
Say his first name.

309
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,800
Vic Mannyana.

310
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,700
I'll hide his name.

311
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,600
Let's say his name's Carl.

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,700
Um, so Carl, uh, like he had, he was friends with me and another guy locally.

313
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,900
And then he had a couple of other friends from like these internet forums that

314
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,600
they hung out on and talked about and like it came to pass.

315
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,200
Well, see when I first knew Carl, I thought he was like a real ironic

316
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,100
hipster kind of guy and he'd make all these funny like, ha ha.

317
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,500
Um, um, you know, sure, I'm suspicious of the Jews.

318
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,000
Ha ha.

319
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,900
You know, not, not necessarily criticizing Middle Eastern genocide or anything.

320
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,700
I'm just saying maybe there are good reasons for it, stuff like that.

321
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I thought it was a joke.

322
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,600
It turned out not really, not entirely.

323
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,100
And a bunch of, so a bunch of the, these other guys that he brought in and literally

324
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,000
the experience I had with Paul, I really thought he had the exact same arc.

325
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,700
I feel like Paul was like genetically engineered out of like one of his hair,

326
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,600
lots of hair that created pull out of that guy.

327
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,700
I don't, I don't mean to, I don't mean to diminish this guy or like throw

328
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,000
his, all of everything he thinks under a blanket statement and like make sweeping

329
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,700
generalizations because I talked to him a lot and he had a lot of knowledge and

330
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,700
he had a lot of really complicated opinions that were not just simply, oh,

331
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,900
I hate Muslims or whatever.

332
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,600
But you know, he was a little, him and his friends prove to be, if not alt right,

333
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,500
maybe kind of alt right adjacent.

334
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,200
So, so that was troubling.

335
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,500
So alt tab right.

336
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,200
Yeah.

337
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Um, but I got something bad to tell you, bed.

338
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Well, so bad news, but that wasn't, but that wasn't really the problem.

339
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,400
The problem was that like to get all these guys together, like he basically

340
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,300
just said like, I have a house, I have a bunch of people moving in.

341
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
Do you want to split the rent?

342
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,100
And I was like, sure.

343
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,700
And I moved in.

344
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,600
But like after we'd been there for months, it came out and I hadn't realized

345
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,400
this, that Carl had like, Carl had really like fucked the other guys over

346
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,100
because he had told them that the house was there and we had it and we had like

347
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,800
made the down payment only for them to like fly here from across the country

348
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,300
and arrive to find that the payment had not been made and that he needed more

349
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,700
money from them immediately on the spot.

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Like, yeah, to pay the down payment on the place to pay first month's rent

351
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
or else there'd be no place that they could live.

352
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,000
So they basically had no choice but to lend him money right then and there

353
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,600
or they'd be homeless, uh, which they did.

354
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,000
And then for months, he kept telling them like, oh, I'm going to pay you back.

355
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,900
I'm going to pay you back.

356
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,000
But he didn't work like his, his dad owned a little print shop and his dad

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,900
would have let him work in the shop to make money anytime he wanted.

358
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
But he frequently didn't.

359
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,500
He would just kind of sit around, say he was doing things when he wasn't.

360
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,200
Um, he would, the final.

361
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,500
Oh, I remember this guy now.

362
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,900
The final fucking straw came when we were like, Carl, this month we cannot

363
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,800
be laid on rent again because we'll be kicked out.

364
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,900
Like, do we'll just, just, just level with us.

365
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900
Will you have it?

366
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,900
Yes.

367
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,900
Like days before Carl.

368
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,100
Okay.

369
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,600
We're serious.

370
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,000
Like we really need it on the day.

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,700
Just, just be straight with us.

372
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,500
We're not going to be mad.

373
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,500
Are you going to have the money on time?

374
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,500
Yes.

375
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,300
And of course the day comes and goes and no, he doesn't have it.

376
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,600
And we're all like, shit, we've got to cover his part.

377
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,400
So we fucking me and some of the other guys went up and who grabbed

378
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,800
all his stuff and gathered it together and put it in the living room.

379
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,700
And he came home that day.

380
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,300
And, and, um, one, this other guy, Matt was like, Carl, Carl walks in

381
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
the door and Matt's just like, Carl, welcome home.

382
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,700
Now get the fuck out of here.

383
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,800
And we just turned him around and sent him away.

384
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,500
Um, and it was sad, um, but he richly deserved it.

385
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
I think that is sad.

386
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,100
I think that's the exact kind of worthless friend story I was hoping to hear.

387
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
That's exactly right.

388
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,300
He, um, yeah, he, he, he, he dragged his feet about paying those guys back.

389
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,600
I think that later he eventually did.

390
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Um, I don't know how, but I think benevolent of him.

391
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah.

392
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,400
I think it came like after much conversation with everyone involved.

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,300
My theory was that he was hoping to just get himself in so much debt

394
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,700
and like fuck him, his own situation to such an extent that it would be

395
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,300
so hopeless that some like rich guy that they knew on these forums

396
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,200
that they hung out with would just like throw him a bone and be like,

397
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,700
here, I'll cover your debts for you.

398
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Um, but it didn't happen.

399
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Interesting strategy.

400
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,300
Yeah.

401
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,800
Um, but it didn't happen.

402
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
You forgot to be a hot girl portion of that.

403
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,300
Yeah.

404
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,300
You were like, yeah, I think this guy had gotten, I think the guy had like

405
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,600
had like spotted him before.

406
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,300
Like I think he'd this was, yeah.

407
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,700
Carl is the kind of guy who kind of gets by on pity a lot of the time

408
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,700
and will like spin a sad story to get people to like give him stuff

409
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,300
and to like forgive transgressions and forgive deaths and things.

410
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,600
That's just no way to run your life.

411
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,100
You know, it's just no way to run your life.

412
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,100
My question is, why does he have to actually go into debt?

413
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,700
Why can't he just tell the guy online?

414
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,500
Hey, I'm in debt.

415
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,600
Get the, give me the money.

416
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,500
You know, um, I don't know.

417
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,400
Maybe he probably just fucking lie.

418
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
It's the internet.

419
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,800
But I guess I don't think he's lying.

420
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,900
Well, maybe I'm thinking maybe because the other guys would be able

421
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,000
to corroborate the story.

422
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,400
Like, yeah, Carl owes me all this money and he can't pay it back.

423
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,200
So more importantly, his conscious mind will be able to corroborate the story.

424
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,900
Like, you know, there's a big difference between like people who lie

425
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,200
and they know they're lying versus the guy that you're describing then.

426
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
If you know what I mean, like it seems like a person who lies to

427
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,600
themselves enough that they can sufficiently mental gymnast their way

428
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,100
up to the top of the trapeze, but they can't ascend outside of the entire

429
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,100
fucking circus into the heavens just on mental gymnastics alone.

430
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,900
They just, they just can't break that glass ceiling to get beyond to the,

431
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,000
to the freedom above.

432
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,800
I, I want to say that like this guy never fucked me personally over

433
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,300
like that.

434
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,100
So I don't have any like personal beef with him and like I do like him

435
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,900
and think he's pretty fun to hang out with and he's, he's, he's not worth

436
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,800
always are.

437
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Yeah, but he really did, but he really did, he really did fuck these guys

438
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,000
over in the, under the guise of friendship and it really sucked.

439
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,000
No one, no one is truly worthless, but, but we're here to make sweeping

440
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,200
generalizations about people's character that we know.

441
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,300
So it's understood.

442
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,000
It's understood.

443
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:09,900
Yeah.

444
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
So yeah, that's, that's the tale of Carl.

445
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I have a short one actually.

446
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
I realized I actually have two stories.

447
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,400
Okay.

448
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,900
So I actually, I actually don't have any that are actually my friends.

449
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,800
I just have two ones that I experienced adjacently through someone else.

450
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,000
Right.

451
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
I have no tolerance for shitty people.

452
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,200
I, I like for me, the definition of liking someone is that they like me.

453
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,900
Uh, that's not, you can't just get me to like you by liking me, but that's

454
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,600
like 80% of it to be completely honest.

455
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,300
Like if you like me, then you're probably the kind of person I want to

456
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,900
hang out with.

457
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,700
If you don't like me, if you don't value me, I don't value you for the most

458
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,800
part, but you like me to do.

459
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,700
How do you explain that?

460
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,500
Hello.

461
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,600
Well, got him.

462
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,100
Oh, I like you to do.

463
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,200
Yeah.

464
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,100
Let's fuck.

465
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,300
So anyway, okay.

466
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,200
So what would you want?

467
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,400
So this one is from childhood, right?

468
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,200
This is my brother.

469
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
You know, my brother's a more sociable person.

470
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,500
He's a, he's very much that, um, he's, he's sort of a, uh, chivalrous, uh, outdoorsman

471
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
kind of guy or at least he was.

472
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,100
Now the Dora tipper of the highest.

473
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,600
No, well, no, he's never, he used to be into like, you know, tennis and BB guns.

474
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,900
Like the entire bird population of our yard was eliminated within us, within a

475
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,800
summer, which is great.

476
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,000
There was no more poop anywhere.

477
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,700
And now he's into like fucking actually now he's into ballet, which is really

478
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,500
cool because he's the only guy sick.

479
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,100
He's the only guy.

480
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,000
So was I when I was a kid?

481
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,400
Yeah.

482
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,600
Yeah.

483
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
He's just having guns to ballet.

484
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,200
It seems like two completely.

485
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,300
Yeah.

486
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,100
You watch, you watch a little anime called princess to hell.

487
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,600
Hell yeah.

488
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,300
You do the pendulum.

489
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,700
The pendulum always swings in the other direction.

490
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

491
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,700
Well, it's like the fucking heterosexualist thing you could ever do because

492
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,500
he just goes around grabbing the shit out of girls and touching them.

493
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,000
And that's right.

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,300
He's like, yeah, it's pretty cool.

495
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
He even got like, so actually he's doing ballet class.

496
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,200
He's like in the class.

497
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,000
It's like this fucking like don't it's like this fucking Christian thing though,

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
which makes it a lot less dope.

499
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,400
No, but you know, I don't know how he's because like he got into it because our

500
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,100
youngest sister has been into dance since she was like four.

501
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,600
And I guess my brother was just like, I guess I'll try it too.

502
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,400
And now that he's the only guy, let alone like a six foot really strong guy.

503
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,500
He got sent like to a trip to Israel because they were going to do some like

504
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,600
performances there for like a whole month.

505
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,600
And they're like, well, we need someone to pick them up for the whole picky upie

506
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,500
parts of the ballet.

507
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,900
So he got to go to Israel for it.

508
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,400
And he gave me, he came back with a freaking wallet with a really badly done

509
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,000
rendition of the Pink Floyd album with the light coming out of the other side

510
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,800
as the rainbow.

511
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,600
It's really shittling.

512
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,300
Yeah, Dark Side of the Moon.

513
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,100
Yeah, Dark Side of the Moon.

514
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,900
Now it's my wallet.

515
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,500
Anyway, that's the kind of man this is, right?

516
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,500
So he's the kind of man who will trust you even if I don't know if it's

517
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
necessarily worth it.

518
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,900
So we were kids and he was like 11.

519
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
My brother's name is Aaron.

520
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,600
This kid's name, I think his name was Josh.

521
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,300
I don't remember.

522
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,800
And he was just a kind of like charming attractive manipulator kind of guy who

523
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,900
would just keep fucking you over and keep lying to you, you know, the stakes

524
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,800
weren't that high because we're all 11 here.

525
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,800
But you know, you know how it is.

526
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,400
And the thing that was, yeah, his whole upbringing is, you know, single mom fucking

527
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,700
will do drugs, someone gets shot or whatever.

528
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,100
We didn't live in a great neighborhood.

529
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,900
We lived a few streets away from where, you know, there was like literally a tree

530
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,600
growing into someone's wall and they never fixed it for some reason.

531
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,900
That part of neighborhood is where Josh was from.

532
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,700
And the thing that was really notable to me, I remember specifically

533
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,800
he fucked over my brother seven times.

534
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,000
I specifically counted the number of times he lied to him and like Aaron, how

535
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,300
long are you going to keep trusting him?

536
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,000
But the most notable thing Aaron's Aaron's got to forgive him until he fucks

537
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,100
him over 70 times, seven times.

538
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,700
Yeah.

539
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,500
Yeah.

540
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,800
And like, and the weirdest thing is that Josh had so many mannerisms that reminded

541
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,900
me not to get political, but reminded me of Bill Clinton like astonishingly.

542
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,900
He had like the same smile, the same demeanor, despite being like,

543
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,400
he fucked a lot of secretaries.

544
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,800
Probably has by now.

545
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,900
He's Sonic the Hedgehog.

546
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,900
Oh, he's probably, oh, he's probably a snap and get a pussy kind of guy at this

547
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,800
point, I imagine.

548
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,200
Right.

549
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,400
Okay.

550
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I believe he went to Julia.

551
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,800
He looks down.

552
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
He just looks down his penis.

553
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,400
He snaps.

554
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,100
He's got a pussy.

555
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,400
Oh, yeah.

556
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
He's really excellent.

557
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,200
He's like, you know, really charming and attractive and skinny and like got that

558
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
like boyish charm.

559
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
Is his wife un-electable?

560
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,100
Yes.

561
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,300
So yeah.

562
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,500
Well, that doesn't sound like Bill Clinton at all.

563
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,300
It was just a really interesting thing to me at the time because I was probably

564
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,500
like 13 or 14 or whatever, you know, and like, so I kind of like knew what Bill

565
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,600
Clinton was, you know, I'm not that fucking young.

566
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,300
And yeah, I guess that's really all there is to say about that.

567
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,800
So.

568
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,200
So wait, what were the seven ways that he's fucked?

569
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
I don't remember.

570
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,400
It was all a bunch of dumb, you know, preteen bullshit, but it wasn't anything

571
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
too big, just like, I actually don't remember at all.

572
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,700
So I'm not even trying.

573
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,200
Okay.

574
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,700
All right.

575
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,400
We throw this man out of the bus.

576
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,200
Fuck that guy.

577
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,400
I condemn him to death.

578
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,900
Oh, I remembered one short one as well.

579
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, actually, but before you say it, I just want to say that, you know, Josh, I never

580
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,200
thought that it'd be so simple, but I found a way.

581
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,100
I found a way.

582
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,200
Oh, there it is.

583
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,600
It's going to take you time to realize.

584
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,200
But if you realize that actually I found out over your shoulder, you're not real

585
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,900
find out.

586
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,100
I'm always picking you up when you're down.

587
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,900
I was, I was really glad to see your brother.

588
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,800
I was really happy.

589
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,300
Your brother, Aaron Drake, Davoo finally made up with Josh recently.

590
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,000
That's my last name.

591
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
The is my first name.

592
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,800
It is.

593
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,900
It is for this joke.

594
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,600
Baby boy.

595
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,100
Okay.

596
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,500
I'm sorry.

597
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:22,700
All right.

598
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,800
Mage, what do you got for us?

599
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,700
Yeah, it'll be just quick, much like the nerd in the last story.

600
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,600
I don't dislike her at the current state.

601
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,400
It just so happens the way it happened.

602
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Like she, um, we met also when I was very little, even younger than eight.

603
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,700
I think it was a five or six.

604
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,100
Um, and we, we were friends for almost a decade, I think.

605
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,700
And, um, she, maybe the last, uh, she, she kind of was a bit of a liar, but

606
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,200
she didn't do it on, I'd like to see on purpose, but like, I mean, you know,

607
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,400
when you're lying, but it's like, you know, little kids being little kids and

608
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,900
she just wanted to impress.

609
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,500
So she would sometimes make up lies.

610
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,400
And so I can't really hold it against her.

611
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,900
But the thing about her though, um, she would sometimes make really stupid

612
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,000
decisions in her life.

613
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,800
And every time she would come to me and be like, Hey, I want to do this thing

614
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,100
or Hey, I'm going to do this thing.

615
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,600
I would be like, no, that sounds like a bad idea.

616
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,900
You're going to regret this.

617
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,500
And she never listened to me and she got in trouble and then she would come

618
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,300
back to me and be like, I should have listened to you and it would repeat

619
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,900
for many, many years for many, many occasions.

620
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,100
She never listened to me despite, you know, admitting that post fact she

621
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,900
had, she should have listened to me.

622
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,300
The very last thing she didn't listen to me.

623
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,900
A new girl sort of moved in into the neighborhood.

624
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,200
We were sort of neighbors in the same neighborhood.

625
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,100
And I could tell she was trouble.

626
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,400
She was the kind of like, you know, preppy long haired, uh, a bit of a

627
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,000
skanky sort of girl.

628
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,400
And my kind of girl.

629
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,700
I think the words right out of my fucking mouth.

630
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,700
14 at the time.

631
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,500
I Oh, that's really my kind of girl.

632
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Oh, we go.

633
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,100
Skanky 13 year old.

634
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,100
Can I move to what Lithuania?

635
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,200
Where the fuck do you live?

636
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,900
But basically she moved in and she, she was very much like a drama whore.

637
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,100
I think like we've never dealt with the sort of person, but I knew she was

638
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,000
troubled in the moment.

639
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,300
I met her.

640
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,800
I did give her a chance, but just from interacting with her, I knew that,

641
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,900
you know, she's going to lead people down the wrong path.

642
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,300
And, um, my friend sort of got friends with her and I was like, don't

643
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,600
become good friends with her.

644
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,700
She's like, you know, stay cautious, please be mindful because, you

645
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,100
know, she's probably going to get you into like alcohol and smoking and

646
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,900
maybe even drugs.

647
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,600
Who knows?

648
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,500
Like I knew, I knew she was going to be like that because we were living in

649
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,700
a not the best neighborhood.

650
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,200
Let me tell you, uh, a lot, lots of drug people.

651
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,100
Like surprisingly, I kept hearing stories about people using drugs and

652
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,900
like other stuff, like all these spooky stories in our neighborhood.

653
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,800
And I never met any person that actually did that.

654
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,600
I was like, where are these stories come from?

655
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,700
Cause they, cause they, cause they knew that you were beaten up boys with

656
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,400
your Dragon Ball Z moves and they knew to stay away from them.

657
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,900
Did I tell you that story?

658
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,400
Uh, should I not have said that?

659
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,200
Was that told?

660
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
No, I'm just, I'm just surprised.

661
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I was beating the people with Dragon Ball Z moves.

662
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,300
Yeah.

663
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,900
Okay.

664
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,700
Are we talking like spirit bomb or like, or like, punch or punching?

665
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,100
We punched each other and it was, it was, that's how we played.

666
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,500
Like when I was little, our games was like, we would punch each other

667
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,700
until it would hurt and that was fun.

668
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,900
But we were playing Dragon Ball Z.

669
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
So it was okay.

670
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,900
So is this, is this person, someone who never really became a close friend,

671
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,500
but was like a fake friend or was just a friend of low caliber?

672
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,600
She was like quite a close friend to her.

673
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I was her best.

674
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,800
And sometimes on some occasions, even the only friend she had.

675
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:01,800
Okay.

676
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,300
So we were really, really close friends.

677
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,800
And yeah, I told her not to get close to her because I knew she

678
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,600
was going to be trouble.

679
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,000
And the same like the nerd guy, you know, she exchanged me for that girl

680
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,500
and we never talked again.

681
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,400
Just kind of like, trade it up.

682
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,600
Yeah.

683
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,300
Trade it up.

684
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,400
Can't, can't say I heard stories about her and not very good ones

685
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,700
about how she, when like she, she, she, the thing is though, like,

686
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,100
I don't want to like, you know, stereotype or whatever, but this is

687
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,000
a story that was quite common in, in Lithuania at that time, considering

688
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,500
the time we lived in, like a lot of broken families and stuff like that.

689
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,900
She, she, she came from a very poor and a broken family and her chances

690
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,700
of like, you know, getting a good life were pretty low in comparison.

691
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,400
And, but everything changed upon the election of Donald Trump.

692
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,500
But yeah, but yeah, she, and yeah, so like, I really, I really wanted

693
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,800
to try and, you know, leave her on, on, on the good path and just, just

694
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,600
like to, to give her a chance to like, not, not fall down.

695
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,200
This is the same rabbit hole her mom fell down as it seemed the history

696
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,500
repeated herself with her.

697
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,200
So I'm sad.

698
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,500
I did, I did the basic, you know, if she doesn't want to be your fault made.

699
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,700
Yeah.

700
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,100
She didn't want to be my friend anymore and she wanted to hang up with

701
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,000
the skanky girl.

702
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,800
So, you know, yeah, for me, it's like, if there's any person

703
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,100
who I'm getting into some sort of affiliation with and I recognize

704
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,600
some major problem and the only, the only way I'm going to have

705
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,600
a long-term affiliation with them is if that problem is rectified or

706
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,500
addressed, this individual has the social equivalent of a five second

707
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,000
span to prove that they are self-aware, self-deprecating about

708
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,300
that issue and are willing on some level to deal with that problem.

709
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,200
And if they do not demonstrate that self-awareness, that, that courage

710
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,000
of the self to challenge themselves, then I'm like, all right, bye.

711
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,800
You know, like I have a very short, very short patience for people

712
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,300
who are not willing to address themselves and a pretty long patience

713
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,300
for people who are like people who will like regularly with absolute

714
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,200
genuineness say sorry and they don't do the same thing a second time.

715
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,100
Like they're really showing a, a, a statistical improvement chart,

716
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,400
you know.

717
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,600
Oh, I just remembered this friend also got me into some pretty deep

718
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,200
shit, but that's a story for another podcast, I guess.

719
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,100
Oh, okay.

720
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,900
If you say so.

721
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,200
Yeah.

722
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,400
For those of you who cast.

723
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,700
I have a story.

724
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,200
This one is actually about, it's about me being a shitty friend.

725
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,900
It's about me being the worthless friend.

726
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,100
The plot twist.

727
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,500
Wait, is that going to be the subject?

728
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,300
Cause I mean, I, that kind of needs its own episode with just me for

729
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
about seven hours.

730
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,900
I mean, well, that's fine.

731
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,800
I, I really only have this one story because I really don't have

732
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,200
any experience of a friend, uh, proving to be shitty or worthless.

733
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,900
I've got some that are like minor things.

734
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,700
Like they just started being boring.

735
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,100
So I didn't.

736
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,500
Hey, I'm sure you've got some minor things.

737
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,200
Hell yeah, Nate.

738
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,500
High taste boys.

739
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,800
We got, we're very fucking selective.

740
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,600
That's how, that's how it should be done.

741
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,000
I discard what is worthless to me, which is everyone I've ever known.

742
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, basically.

743
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,800
And you all will be too in time.

744
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,200
I look forward to it immensely.

745
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,300
But let me tell you about the time where I was a terrible friend.

746
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,800
Um, so, yeah, this is basically worthless, I suppose.

747
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,400
So, um, a friend of mine got married two years ago.

748
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,200
And maybe I've told the story before, but I don't think I have on here.

749
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,000
So two years ago, a friend of mine got married.

750
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,200
So I fly back to Massachusetts for the wedding.

751
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,300
I haven't been there in a while.

752
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,400
And, uh, so I'm at the wedding.

753
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,100
It's a good time.

754
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,800
All my old friends are there from school.

755
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,300
It's, it's absolutely fantastic.

756
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:47,600
Um, and I, uh, my, my one friend brings a date and this date is like,

757
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
I've seen her several times before when we've been hanging out.

758
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,100
They'd known each other for a while and she, uh, was clearly friend zoning

759
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,000
this guy really hard, really hard.

760
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,700
And, uh, she, man, she just turned it on for me, man.

761
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,300
What can I say?

762
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,100
She just turned on all the signals, uh, the, the, the touch and the extended

763
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,500
eye contact, laughing at jokes that I was not even attempting to make.

764
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
And what could I do?

765
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,600
Uh, you know, what can a man do in this kind of situation?

766
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,900
So, uh, the extent of it was we, we kissed at the wedding for a while.

767
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Uh, yeah, I, I, I, and I don't want to glorify this.

768
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,200
This was a very bad thing I was doing.

769
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,100
I was simply, this is an excuse, but I had not gotten late in quite a while.

770
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,800
So I was just like, finally, finally an opportunity presents 22 years.

771
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,300
Here we go.

772
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
No, no, uh, more recent than that.

773
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,800
But anyway, um, yeah.

774
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,800
So what can I say, man?

775
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,600
I just, I just made out with my friend's date.

776
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,000
Uh, they had, like they were not dating.

777
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,800
I was, I was in my drunken way.

778
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,100
I was like asking her like, so are you guys like an item?

779
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,800
Like, is this okay?

780
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,600
What are we doing right now?

781
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,200
She was like, oh yeah, it's fine.

782
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,100
Don't worry about it.

783
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't worry about it.

784
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,100
Little did I know, uh, this was, I mean, certainly not in his mind.

785
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,900
You know, I just, my judgment was way fucked up.

786
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,600
I totally was a bad person, uh, regret it deeply.

787
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,900
I don't think you did anything wrong.

788
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,600
I mean, that woman is her own being.

789
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,000
If she's not into that guy and she's into you, like, why would you, like, he'd

790
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,900
be fucking you over if you weren't allowed to make out with that hot shit?

791
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,300
You know what?

792
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,000
I am perfectly willing to say that from a, from a basically like moral

793
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,700
standpoint, like no, no contract has really been violated in this situation,

794
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:23,700
but simply from the perspective of like being 100, as cool as possible to

795
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,500
your friend, this was not 100% cool to my friend, you know?

796
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,700
So on, on that scale, you know, since we're talking about friendship specifically,

797
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,500
this is not the best way to maintain a friendship, you know?

798
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,800
No, probably not.

799
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,600
Probably a pretty poor way to do that.

800
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,200
Exactly, exactly.

801
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,600
And, uh, I regret it deeply.

802
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,300
If you're listening to this friend, I apologize sincerely.

803
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,300
I regret it all the time.

804
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,100
He's, he's definitely not listening, but in any case, I am very sorry.

805
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,600
I will not do it again.

806
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,500
I've learned my lesson.

807
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,400
That's it.

808
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,500
That's, that's, that's all I got.

809
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:53,800
Really?

810
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,200
That's all I got.

811
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,400
Well, I'm going to have to one up all of you because I've got the most worthless

812
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,700
friend of all time and you guys are going to, your jobs are going to drop.

813
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,500
Hope you guys are ready.

814
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,400
Hope you're all sitting down because this story is going to

815
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,900
revolutionize the PCB podcast as we know it.

816
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,800
Fuck yeah.

817
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,200
Not too long ago, I had a decently good friend of mine and we decided, you know

818
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,900
what, we're going to start a podcast together.

819
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,700
That'd be real good.

820
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,300
And, uh, you know, let's try to do this consistently.

821
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,800
Let's, let's work together.

822
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,500
No.

823
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,600
And, uh, you know, we decided the podcast would be reviewing each Naruto panel

824
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,400
one at a time.

825
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Oh, that's a good idea.

826
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,200
That's a good idea for a show.

827
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,900
We thought it was a good one.

828
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,500
We thought it was a good one.

829
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,300
Yeah.

830
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
So we did the first one.

831
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,700
It's a huge shit, probably the most popular channel on video on that channel

832
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,800
at the time, but then the friend just like disappeared.

833
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,100
She like disappeared like to some fucking Middle Eastern, uh, European

834
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,800
country with like no microphone.

835
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,300
And I didn't hear from her for like three or four months.

836
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,900
Like what the fuck goes on a vacation without a microphone.

837
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,300
Hang it.

838
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,500
She left you hanging like that.

839
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,900
What the fuck worthless.

840
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,400
I say how dare she horrible.

841
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,900
I'd be pretty.

842
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,000
I'll never know what happens on our toe page too.

843
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,500
Now.

844
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,100
Max revive the Nauru casket.

845
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,700
You're, you're attacking the wrong source here because like the ultimate

846
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,500
problem is the lack of abundant fucking microphones in all the places.

847
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
Like I'm all about.

848
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm all about UBB universal basic blue yeti and like everyone should be

849
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,700
entitled to one at all times or else like life cannot function.

850
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,300
We end up with all these fucking, you know, fan dubs and review collaborations

851
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,600
or even interviews with some celebrity who's currently at his house that

852
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
always has half shit audio.

853
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,000
This is a big issue that needs to be saved for the everyone is shit.

854
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,800
But if Bernie, if Bernie had just pushed the UBB platform during the

855
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,100
primary, God damn it, everything would have been different.

856
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,400
Fucking Hillary was going with that snowball mic and everybody ate that

857
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,100
shit up.

858
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, I know, right?

859
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,900
Oh, I used to have a snowball mic and I would take it along for journeys,

860
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,500
but I would get stopped every single time at the airport because of it.

861
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,100
So because of these minor moments of inconvenience, that is worth, uh,

862
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,900
it's worth ruining your, your lucrative.

863
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,300
No, the microphone broke.

864
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,500
So I got a new one, but this one is an XLR and it plugs into, um,

865
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,300
what's it called those mixer thingies audio mixing?

866
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah.

867
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,500
So like I can't take the microphone, the microstand, the mixie thingie

868
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,500
and all the wires all with me with just one little bag thingie where I have

869
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,600
to make excuses.

870
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah.

871
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
I mean, this seems irrelevant.

872
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,800
I wasn't talking about you.

873
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,400
I don't know why you're bringing up your way.

874
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,900
We're talking about microphones and I mentioned my microphone problems.

875
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,500
Fair enough.

876
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,100
Unrelated microphone.

877
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,800
I should make it like a public thing.

878
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,900
Maybe, maybe this other mystery person suffered from the same problem.

879
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,900
We should, we should, we should have, we should, we should extend her the

880
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,300
benefit of the doubt wherever she is.

881
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,000
I don't know, Ben.

882
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm ready to bury her into the fucking prison.

883
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,100
Yeah.

884
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
I'm ready to throw away the key.

885
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,900
You know, Nate, when I needed a microphone help, you sent me like an

886
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,700
Amazon wish list of all the things to get.

887
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,600
Like you should publish that shit publicly.

888
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,800
I was just saying that.

889
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,900
I was just about to say that.

890
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,100
Yeah.

891
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,000
Like we should make that public the like the PCP standard good audio set.

892
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's like probably like 500 bucks total or something.

893
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,700
Can't anybody get on Amazon and like do an affiliate program thing.

894
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,300
So if people buy things that we link them to, we get some of the money.

895
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,000
You have to have like a partnership with Amazon in order to do that first or

896
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,500
something.

897
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,200
So like you'd have to like talk to those guys.

898
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,300
I think, pretty sure.

899
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,900
Listeners.

900
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,600
My audio set is about 200.

901
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:40,800
It's a $99 SM58, sure SM58, which is like the AK-47 of microphones.

902
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,100
It's the most famous one.

903
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,000
Then they have an M audio M track, which is $100.

904
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,600
There might be better ones, but it's really simple.

905
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,000
Doesn't have that much extraneous shit.

906
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,800
I don't use.

907
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,100
So if you find my audio quality perfectly fine, then do that.

908
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,200
Mike, you're being really shit friends by derelling this podcast about shit

909
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,000
friends right now.

910
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,300
Wait.

911
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:58,600
Okay.

912
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
Mage, if you want to finish, go ahead and finish your plate.

913
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,600
I'm sorry.

914
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,300
No, I just said my microphone was like 20 bucks.

915
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,500
So if you like this, Ben and I, Ben and I made world famous channel,

916
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,500
YouTube channel, TBAP we using $130 microphone for like years and Ben still

917
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,000
use it on the PCP for a long time and might be using it right now.

918
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,600
Are you still using that?

919
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,100
Mike, Ben?

920
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,900
No, I'm using a blue yeti right now.

921
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,000
Although I still have that one lying around somewhere.

922
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,200
Yeah.

923
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,500
Yeah.

924
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,300
Use champion.

925
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,000
It's a champion.

926
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,200
Yeah.

927
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,400
The thing is like 99% of audience members don't even notice like slight differences

928
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,500
in audio quality.

929
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,200
See, that's true.

930
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,900
The thing is using that using that piece of shit microphone.

931
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,700
I never noticed a problem because I was listening to it.

932
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,300
This was back when I had my laptop.

933
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,700
I was listening to the podcast on my laptop speakers through laptop headphones

934
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,100
and it was only when Digi told pulled me aside and was like,

935
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,800
Ben, this has to stop.

936
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,600
And I was like, what are you talking about?

937
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,000
Dude, it's fine.

938
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,900
And then he brought me up to his fucking room and played it to me on legit

939
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,000
speakers and suddenly I was like, oh my God, I sound so much tinier than everyone else.

940
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,600
Like the difference is palpable and like, what have I done?

941
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,300
What have I done?

942
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,800
I was a real shit friend of the podcast back in those days.

943
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,500
It's true.

944
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,000
It's very true.

945
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,700
The people need to be educated on audio quality so that they'll buy our

946
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,800
fucking affiliate like microphones or something.

947
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,300
Yeah.

948
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
But I did.

949
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,300
Why don't you save yourself a week and do it?

950
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,900
Why am I genius weekly on fucking microphone shit?

951
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,100
Like that'd be easiest shit.

952
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,700
Not a terrible idea.

953
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,800
Not I remember I put like into one of my, I think it's like that last day of me

954
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,600
and Mavva, I like just for a second.

955
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,500
I was like, this is why I have to like take all this time to fix the audio

956
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,500
because like, and then I cut to this is what I sound like from the camera

957
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,100
microphone and it's just like an ear raping like, you know, camera mic.

958
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,000
I didn't even edit.

959
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,800
It just sounds like that.

960
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,400
But that'd be fun.

961
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,000
That's not a bad idea.

962
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,900
It would be like super helpful, especially if you showed how to connect

963
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,000
everything because I spent about three hours trying to figure it out.

964
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,200
I could put together the Amazon wish list and make it a whole big thing.

965
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,600
That's not a bad idea.

966
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,200
There you go.

967
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,100
Very interesting.

968
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,700
Very interesting.

969
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,600
Okay.

970
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,900
Back on the friendship thing.

971
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,400
Yeah.

972
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,500
Anyone else have a story?

973
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,300
I mean, I have a bigger story actually.

974
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,700
That's like someone who is my friend, but like just it didn't end up being like

975
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,800
quite worth it enough where it's like, it's someone who gives very little

976
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,100
and takes more, you know, it's like someone who is very emotionally

977
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,200
like in need of people, but he's already like, the reason why I didn't feel bad

978
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,200
about going into a, oh, sorry, it's been two weeks since I responded to your

979
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,400
message mode with him is because he has other friends.

980
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
So it's like, he doesn't need me necessarily, you know, it's just

981
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,700
and even if he did have friends, does that mean he's entitled to your time?

982
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,700
And it's just ultimately it's because he's like gone to college for like different

983
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,900
art mediums and yet his art medium ability is like, like his drawing ability

984
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,700
is I'd say at least in half order of magnitude worse than me.

985
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,100
And it's like, if you went to college and you're worse than me, then I don't

986
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,000
and you're like four years older than me.

987
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,600
Then it's like, uh, you're just, I don't know how many.

988
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,900
I'm pretty sure most of the PCP have the same standard of me of like,

989
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,500
if the main thing that I connect with you over is art, but you are a really

990
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,900
bad artist, then you're not that valuable as a person.

991
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,400
It's, you know, Davoo, I got to admit it.

992
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,000
Now's a good time to launch into a portion of what I want to discuss with

993
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,900
this, and that is the idea that like you owe your friends something that

994
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,900
your friends are like owed you your time or your energy in some way.

995
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
I completely reject that idea.

996
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,300
And I think friends are only valuable to me in the sense that they

997
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,900
continue to be actually valuable to me and are a worthwhile usage of my

998
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,800
time in some way.

999
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,600
And the second that someone isn't, they can still call him your friend.

1000
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,500
You can have a history or whatever, but there's no point in staying involved

1001
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,700
with their lives or wasting your energy and time on maintaining that kind

1002
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,400
of relationship.

1003
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,400
Yeah, it's all about whether or not it's worth it or not.

1004
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,700
Yeah, like, yeah, and like, there's no reason to like let an old friend

1005
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,200
like completely die out from your life.

1006
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Like I've got friends from back home that I have almost nothing in common

1007
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,400
with at this point, but occasionally I might message them and just be like,

1008
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:05,900
yo, what's up?

1009
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,100
Because those people have something of value.

1010
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,900
They have my histories in them and my old relationships and there's no

1011
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,800
reason to discard them.

1012
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,100
But like if I have a shitty friend who I barely knew from back in high

1013
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,200
school who messages me as has happened and it's like, yo, dude, what's

1014
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,600
going on?

1015
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,100
Let's catch up.

1016
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,500
I'm like, don't ever speak to me again.

1017
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,300
You have nothing of value to offer me.

1018
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:24,700
Stop.

1019
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,700
You are, you are, this is an act of violence.

1020
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,300
You're perpetuating against me by wasting my time.

1021
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,100
You are stealing my time from me by sending you this message and I

1022
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,900
raping me, forcing me to read it.

1023
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Never do this again.

1024
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,900
That's violence.

1025
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,500
That's violence.

1026
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
I'm gonna go your fucking safe.

1027
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,100
Your Nate space.

1028
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:39,600
Yes.

1029
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,400
That's right.

1030
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,100
I need to go to my Nate space.

1031
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,900
Is it just like anime posters and a Hillary Clinton cut out and that's the

1032
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:57,300
Nate space and power bars and like cans of beans in a just like

1033
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,500
cans of beans.

1034
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:06,500
Do you know how fucking safe spaces on campus like official ones are like

1035
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,900
they're filled like videos with like puppies and flowers and like coloring

1036
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,300
books and shit.

1037
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:10,400
Yeah.

1038
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,100
Mine is just like a streaming girl and log in on like 10 TVs across.

1039
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,400
You've got your Hillary cutouts.

1040
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,000
You've got your copies of what happened lining a shelf.

1041
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,900
Everything you need, everything you need to mentally re-energize yourself.

1042
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,300
Trigger you even more.

1043
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,600
Wouldn't you rather read it takes a village?

1044
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,200
No, it's a brilliant alt reality story from the mind of a genius author.

1045
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:30,700
Hillary Clinton.

1046
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,500
Someone else comes into your Nate space and they grab your girl and gone

1047
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,700
coloring book and you're like hey, but they grabbed the orange marker for

1048
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,700
Oh my God.

1049
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,400
We have to delete all orange crayons cannot be allowed.

1050
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,800
Send them all to the gulags.

1051
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,300
They can't be allowed anymore.

1052
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,700
Oh my God.

1053
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,700
What a what a journey we've just taken.

1054
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,000
We need to decide what everybody's safe space would look like.

1055
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,000
I agree.

1056
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,400
That should be its own episode.

1057
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,800
I mean, Ben's safe space is just your local dumpster up behind you.

1058
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,000
You know, just hop in.

1059
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,500
Let's do this for a bonus episode someday.

1060
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,100
Let's not ruin it.

1061
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,800
That's a good idea.

1062
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,600
That's a good idea.

1063
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,000
Okay.

1064
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,000
We'll get all nine of us in there at the same time and just fucking go him.

1065
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,000
Okay.

1066
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But to finish my point from before, he was just when I think about friends,

1067
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I honestly, maybe this is a bad sign, but I think about it the same way that

1068
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,800
Griffith articulates it in his speech.

1069
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,800
It just before he did anything bad or, you know, really bad.

1070
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,600
He didn't write about some things.

1071
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,100
Griffith was definitely right about some things, which is why there's such a

1072
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,000
hot debate about him to this day and his speech that guts over here is about

1073
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,500
like how his friends are the ones that keep up with him.

1074
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,800
You know, they're his peers.

1075
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,300
They're not the people who just like, you know, I mean, he frames us like like

1076
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,700
not even parasites, but like his loyal soldiers are not his friends.

1077
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,600
His friends are the people with with their own ambition and their own drive

1078
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,900
in life because because like this is the thing.

1079
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,700
Nobody wants to talk about followers in this world really do drain the energy

1080
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,300
of the leaders that guide them through this world.

1081
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,700
Like like employ everyone.

1082
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,100
The fucking Democrats, for example, just want to like frame workers as like

1083
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:09,100
these these virtuous like, you know, plebeian citizens of this great world

1084
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,500
that offer so much value to their leaders, but without those leaders,

1085
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,300
those people wouldn't have fucking jobs and wouldn't have fucking shit.

1086
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,600
And the whole economy is floated up by these, you know, people at the top

1087
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,300
orchestrating it to be so and a rising tide lifts all boats.

1088
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,100
I know I'm speaking in some generalities here, but I really do think about

1089
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,900
about like friendships that way.

1090
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,900
And if someone is not worth my time spent on you, it's no insult to you.

1091
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,700
I just don't want to waste my time, which is why I fucking get messages on discord.

1092
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,200
People in my fan chat and shit.

1093
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,100
Stop wasting my time.

1094
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,500
I don't give a fuck about you.

1095
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,300
Tweet at me or something that at least wastes less of my time.

1096
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,700
But there you go.

1097
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,400
Here's a story about why your friends are not.

1098
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,300
Yeah, it's about not owing friends things.

1099
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,100
And it's also about why working with your friends is not always a great idea.

1100
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,400
See, it's not always.

1101
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,900
Don't you mean not ever?

1102
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,000
Holy shit.

1103
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,800
Well, it's up there.

1104
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,400
I mean, me and Nate work together on T-Bap and that ended up working out fine.

1105
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:06,900
So it can work.

1106
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,300
It was a struggle, but you did work out.

1107
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,400
You both proved to be true people, not friends.

1108
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,600
You proved to be actual artists in the East.

1109
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,900
I'm prepared to frame us as the rare few.

1110
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,200
I'm prepared to do that, to be that virtuous.

1111
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,400
Well, let me tell you about something, a disappointing tale from my life.

1112
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,400
I have a friend, I still have this friend.

1113
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:36,800
And like years ago, this guy, he, well, he wanted to make video games.

1114
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,100
And we were really into, we were really into roguelikes.

1115
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,100
Who is that you?

1116
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,700
Um, we were, we were really into roguelikes at the time.

1117
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:49,300
And like he said, like I'm going to make like a simple roguelike game.

1118
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,700
And I was like, you know, okay, like you're serious.

1119
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,000
This is a guy who's serious about like computer science and computers and video

1120
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,700
gaming and stuff.

1121
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,900
And like, I believe in this guy.

1122
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,700
I believe that he's going to follow through on this.

1123
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,200
So I agreed to help and I did a bunch of work.

1124
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,100
I did a bunch of work on this project.

1125
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:12,400
I made like a ton of like really nice sprites and I made like this sick animated

1126
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,700
intro screen for it.

1127
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,200
Oh, damn.

1128
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,500
I remember like on the plane to Poland, I was like on the plane.

1129
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,700
I had my laptop open and I was drawing monster sprites and I was really proud of

1130
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,500
a lot of them.

1131
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,400
I was drawing like floor tiles and stuff.

1132
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,200
I was really putting the energy in to like make the floor.

1133
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,600
I remember I was drawing vine floor tiles and I had to draw them in such a way

1134
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,300
that they could connect and be continuous.

1135
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,100
Like if you were walking on like a viney jungle.

1136
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh, yeah, I've gotten.

1137
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,600
Oh, I love.

1138
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1139
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,600
Fuck.

1140
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,300
So long story short, the game never happened.

1141
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,300
And so yeah, he didn't.

1142
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:54,300
He didn't make the thing and like I don't hold it against the guy.

1143
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,000
Like I don't.

1144
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,300
He's not a worthless friend.

1145
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,500
I don't hate him or anything for it.

1146
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:02,200
But looking back, I'm like, I kind of wish that I had done less for a friend at

1147
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,900
that point because he hadn't like proved.

1148
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,300
He hadn't like proved that he was willing to follow through on it in order to make

1149
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,800
my investment.

1150
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Oh, I feel like if being if being a over promising, under delivering in their art

1151
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,900
was a deal breaker for friendship, I would have no friends.

1152
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,900
Yeah.

1153
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,700
Yeah, it's something that everybody does like something that everybody does

1154
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,100
and you like you shouldn't.

1155
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,900
Well, I would say it doesn't make them a bad person or a bad friend.

1156
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,200
Like it just you have to you have to be responsible.

1157
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, you have to take the responsibility of being like I'm not I'm not going to

1158
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,400
commit to this thing.

1159
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,100
Yeah, I can I can smell the not that serious coming from people a mile away.

1160
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,500
There's always ulterior motives.

1161
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,600
There's very few people who want to do art just for art like when my brother

1162
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,600
does projects with me, it's because he wants to do something with me, which is

1163
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,700
also a motivation for me as well.

1164
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:57,600
But it's like at some point or another, the art becomes we work in separate

1165
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
different little sections.

1166
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,300
We're not like locking arms 24 seven.

1167
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,900
And when he realizes that it's like he loses interest.

1168
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,800
And it's like, all right, you know, it's you know, it's fascinating about this

1169
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,200
to me. I really feel like I mean, we probably all have this story, but I

1170
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,800
have taken the journey from that guy to the guy I am now.

1171
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,900
And a lot of it really was not to give myself too much credit was just like

1172
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,100
figuring out what it is that I actually want to do and what makes me happy to

1173
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,900
be working on because, you know, I've talked about this before, like I went

1174
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,600
to school for programming and like I got a minor in sort of the game design

1175
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,100
equivalent at my school and you know, that's complete.

1176
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,900
I have my degree in it and I was in the like the game development club that

1177
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,100
I helped start at that school.

1178
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,300
You know, my other guy really was the champion.

1179
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,900
But I was like the secretary or treasure or something and like we would

1180
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,800
get together.

1181
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,300
We had a team of people who were like willing to do it.

1182
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,400
And I was like the project leader on the we did a game jam.

1183
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,200
We made like a demo that it was my idea and it was it was good, but it

1184
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:51,800
didn't get finished.

1185
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,200
So like afterward at the the game development, I'm sorry, in the game

1186
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,200
club, like I pitch like, Hey guys, let's remake this game as an app like as a

1187
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,800
mobile game because I think it really works for it and would be really

1188
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,300
great and has a lot of, you know, just would work with that, which I think

1189
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:05,600
it would.

1190
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,200
It was game called monochrome.

1191
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
It's called monochrome.

1192
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,700
I remember still get it in some places.

1193
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,300
Yeah, I had a version on my phone for a while.

1194
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,300
So me and a team like we're working on it and developing on it, but the

1195
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,200
problem was like, ultimately, the problem was I had like a team of people

1196
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,700
who really were willing to put in time to like make it happen.

1197
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:27,100
And we got pretty far along, but at the end of it, like I just wasn't

1198
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,500
willing to invest the time to like finally finish the thing and get it done.

1199
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,300
You know, we needed to develop like a ton of levels.

1200
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,000
We need to do a lot of UI work and stuff.

1201
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,300
And I just really didn't have the the conviction to like lead this this

1202
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,000
team to finish it.

1203
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,600
You know, a lot of it would be me personally programming and stuff.

1204
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,800
Um, and so it just, it never got completely finished, which I deeply

1205
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,500
regret to this day because I think it was a real winner.

1206
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:47,600
Yeah.

1207
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,000
I mean, I used to be that kind of guy.

1208
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,700
It's just that it's just that I, I, I wasn't like on board with that.

1209
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,900
Like, uh, one of the reasons that I even was interested in doing videos in

1210
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,600
the first place is because the turnaround between deciding to make a video.

1211
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,100
I mean, it's ironic that for me, I started making videos that took

1212
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,100
me six months to make.

1213
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,700
Cause like my, my first thing that I like about it is that a game can take

1214
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,900
like years to finish, even like an indie game.

1215
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,400
The first game I really made took like a full year to be finished developing.

1216
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,700
And, um, like a video can take like a day if it's fast or like a month, you

1217
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,800
know, for, for one that takes more work and shit.

1218
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,900
And, uh, yeah, like now looking back at myself there, like when I was, when I

1219
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,700
was in this mode, man, I used to like be terrified of myself like, oh my God,

1220
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,600
I'm so worthless.

1221
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,200
I'm never going to have the conviction to like actually get the things done in

1222
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,500
my life that I want to do.

1223
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,800
And now that I sit here where I am having accomplished the things I have

1224
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,800
and you know, with a long way to go, I just like, I finally did it.

1225
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,900
I finally figured it the fuck out and to waste your time working with friends

1226
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,900
who are, who are like me as I used to be is not only hurting yourself and

1227
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,300
your own time, but is hurting them because it does not help to just give

1228
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,600
these people more things.

1229
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,500
They have to work for it and figure out themselves, what motivates them and

1230
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,800
possibly more importantly, what avenues they are interested in pursuing.

1231
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,000
Cause the personal drive factor is so essential, at least in my experience

1232
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,100
to actually motivating you to do the fucking work and accomplish the things

1233
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,000
you want to accomplish.

1234
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:12,400
Yeah.

1235
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,500
I was like, there you go.

1236
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,400
And that I was just, I think I was almost always doing some stupid

1237
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,200
shitty art thing.

1238
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,600
I was just flip flopping constantly and never getting anything done.

1239
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,400
I always, yeah, exactly what you said.

1240
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,100
And then it was just simply a matter of being forced to work a regular job

1241
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,100
that like just, I'm sure I've described this a million times across different

1242
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,300
podcasts, but there was just some sort of snowball at the top of my head

1243
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,200
that needed to be pushed and then it was rolled.

1244
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,500
And now I've been great ever since.

1245
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,500
I like, I started making a video game very quickly realized I didn't

1246
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,400
know what I was doing, but I was like, no, no, I am going to finish this.

1247
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,000
I ended up only finishing one half of it.

1248
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,300
Like the first half of the game is fully playable.

1249
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,700
Glitchy as fuck, not very good.

1250
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,200
You barely see what you're doing, but I just pushed through every day.

1251
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,300
I had no fun for it, very little passion for it.

1252
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,800
I just kept doing it and now I'm fucking reliable and it's great.

1253
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,500
And then the whole, no, recently I squared away the whole actually

1254
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,000
trying to be good aspect of art, which I think I might be doing.

1255
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,300
So, and you know what's essential to this whole process, self-betterment

1256
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,500
and the desire to improve your own station, which is why I want to

1257
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,300
say to all our antifa listeners out there, and I know they're the vast majority.

1258
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,400
Communism guys is not going to work.

1259
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,900
It's not going to fucking work.

1260
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,700
People have to motivate themselves by their own betterment.

1261
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,100
You can't work for a collective good.

1262
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,000
It just doesn't fucking work.

1263
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,900
Someone should make a video about communism, you know, that's if only

1264
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,900
some hero would step forward and it should be like the parody of a really

1265
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,600
old, like 15 year old show on Nickelodeon.

1266
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600
That'd be really funny, you know, because it's like, I just don't think that

1267
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,800
would work. I just don't think that would be called the truth about communism by

1268
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,000
Stefan Malinu. Yeah, that'd be good.

1269
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,200
I'd watch that. Let's pray for that.

1270
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,400
Let's pray for that.

1271
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,200
So fucking I'm satisfied with that.

1272
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,800
Should we hear mage's big old story now, her finale?

1273
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,900
I'm ready for it.

1274
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,000
Oh, I got the lube ready.

1275
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,700
Don't commit violence against mage like that, monkey.

1276
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,300
That's very not acceptable.

1277
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,600
Hey, when I play Yu-Gi-Oh, my favorite card is mage power.

1278
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,500
Great.

1279
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,300
Nerd.

1280
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,300
I wish I knew Yu-Gi-Oh enough to laugh more at that.

1281
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:17,500
Okay.

1282
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,200
For every spell and trap card, you gain 500 attack points.

1283
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:21,400
Okay.

1284
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh my God.

1285
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,800
That's pretty good.

1286
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,800
Mage being here makes us all strong.

1287
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,100
Sounds like a real top tier threat in the OU meta game.

1288
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,600
It fucking is.

1289
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,000
That card should have flaming a sprite.

1290
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
If you like that card would be banned if it isn't already.

1291
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,300
No, it's not banned.

1292
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:40,800
Really?

1293
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,700
Isn't literally every card in Yu-Gi-Oh banned?

1294
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,400
No.

1295
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,000
Around that area.

1296
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,800
Like quite popular cards that were banned.

1297
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,200
You don't remember the names.

1298
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,300
Reborn the monster was banned because it was too good.

1299
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,700
Yeah, and like the Karebo thing knockoff with three eyes.

1300
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,000
I think that was banned as well.

1301
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,900
What's it face?

1302
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,100
I forgot.

1303
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,400
Three-eyed Karebo?

1304
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,800
As much as I love to go into Yu-Gi-Oh card lore.

1305
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,400
Yeah.

1306
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,900
Let's hear your story about your shitty friend.

1307
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,800
I'm really eager for it.

1308
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,400
Yu-Gi-Oh is all about friends.

1309
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:12,700
Okay.

1310
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah.

1311
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,200
So just first disclaimer.

1312
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,900
We had some good times with this person.

1313
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,900
She wasn't awful to me all the time.

1314
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,800
Otherwise we wouldn't have been friends for like literally a decade.

1315
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,300
And I do mean at least decade.

1316
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,100
We met when I think I was five or so and our friendship ended

1317
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,000
around 16 so more than a decade.

1318
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,700
And I still have sort of nightmares with her.

1319
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,000
Well, I wouldn't say nightmares, but bad dreams about her.

1320
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,400
Okay.

1321
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,400
Just arguing with her screaming at each other is just like

1322
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,900
she's affected me quite a lot.

1323
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,200
I mean, when you know a person for at least 10 years,

1324
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,400
they're not going to leave your subconscious anytime soon.

1325
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,100
You know?

1326
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,500
Sure.

1327
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:49,900
Sure.

1328
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,100
Okay.

1329
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:55,000
So like she was always such a very petty and stubborn person

1330
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,500
and she would be like the only friend I would have such big fights with

1331
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,400
that we would, you know, it's kind of like this discontinue our friendship

1332
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,300
and we're like, oh, we're not friends anymore.

1333
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,800
And then like he would take like a week later for one of us to apologize

1334
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,600
and become friends again, mostly because like we lived in the same neighborhood.

1335
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:21,100
So like it was kind of hard to play with our friends and not be there together.

1336
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,500
So it was just easier on us to be friends again.

1337
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,900
I think and for the most part.

1338
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,900
Sounds like a healthy basis for a relationship.

1339
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,100
We have to be friends.

1340
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:32,300
And for the most part, we, you know, we didn't have fun.

1341
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,300
And then we ended up going into the same class as well.

1342
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,000
And that's where we meant our best friend.

1343
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Like she was best friend to both of us, the one with the brother

1344
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,100
that I mentioned in the first story.

1345
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:49,800
And yeah, it's and it was just this free for the longest of times until,

1346
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,200
you know, the whole thing happened.

1347
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,300
And just to sort of like the things she would deal with the way,

1348
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:01,900
the how petty she got, there was this one argument we had that was never resolved.

1349
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,500
I might have told this to a few people.

1350
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm not sure.

1351
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,400
But okay.

1352
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:12,600
So like back in the day before internet was a thing or at least we didn't have it there.

1353
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,800
I saw it came out, I think by Jennifer Lopez, like Jenny from the block.

1354
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,600
Okay, keep, keep in mind, like English, not, not her first language.

1355
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,300
And the fact that I spoke English at that age was a miracle in itself.

1356
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,900
And my friend also could speak English, but not as well as me.

1357
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,800
So we argued about the lyrics of the song.

1358
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,400
And let me, let me tell you how stupid.

1359
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,500
Relatable.

1360
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:36,700
Okay.

1361
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,600
So like the lyrics were like Jenny from the block.

1362
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,900
And that's what I claimed.

1363
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,500
You know, she was saying Jenny from the block and she insisted that she said

1364
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,800
Jenny from the back as in back from, you know, the past, that sort of term.

1365
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,700
And I was like, that does not make sense.

1366
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,000
She means Jenny from the block.

1367
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,200
But the thing is, I don't think in the opinion we have the term for block or at

1368
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,400
least it's, it wasn't a word us little kids at that age would know.

1369
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,100
And I tried to explain to her what block meant, but she would have none of it.

1370
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,600
And we, we got in such a big fight over it.

1371
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,300
We ended our friendship.

1372
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,600
I wouldn't have friendship over something like that.

1373
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,400
And then like the thing is she ended it because she would have none of it.

1374
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:23,000
And despite everything, this like the only way, the only way we could become friends

1375
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,900
again, if we both agreed that one time she sang Jenny from the block and the

1376
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,600
other time she said Jenny from the back, that's how she sang the song.

1377
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,800
We had to, I knew it was wrong, but that's the only way we had to keep peace.

1378
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,400
And even like years later, when we did have internet and I looked up the lyrics

1379
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,400
and I showed it to her and I was like, Hey, remember this argument we had?

1380
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,000
And she still was like, Oh, well, you know, that's on the internet.

1381
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,900
You don't, you can't trust everything that's on the internet.

1382
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,600
Are you telling me someone would just go on the internet and tell lies?

1383
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,900
I don't fucking believe it.

1384
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,600
And it's like she had none of it.

1385
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,600
And we never resolved this issue.

1386
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,100
She did not want to be wrong.

1387
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:03,500
I think like the way our three, three, um, the three must be tears of us.

1388
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,900
The way our friendship worked was like, she was sort of like, you know,

1389
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,600
the baddest homeboy leader sort of character.

1390
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,100
And that was a bit of a like the comic relief, I guess.

1391
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,000
And, you know, leaders don't take shit from the comic relief, you know?

1392
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,400
Of course.

1393
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,200
And she, she, she would not let me be right.

1394
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,900
She never wanted me to be right.

1395
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,800
She kept putting me down.

1396
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,300
She was always right.

1397
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,100
She knew best.

1398
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:34,100
She also mistreated me in ways that I only really recently realized that holy shit.

1399
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:39,300
She kind of really treated mistreated me because like we were both like art people.

1400
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,300
We, we draw a lot dare.

1401
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,100
I say it was a slightly better than her.

1402
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,300
I don't want to use my own horn.

1403
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,600
I am serious though.

1404
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,300
You know, she had talent of her own, but I think I was just slightly a little,

1405
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,300
a few steps ahead of her.

1406
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,700
Like also when talking in English as well.

1407
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,700
So like, I think one time I sort of said, oh, hey, you know, you didn't draw the nose.

1408
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,300
Are you going to put in or is that going to be your style, you know, without the nose?

1409
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,100
And it was like, oh, you know, that's how I draw it.

1410
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,000
She told me.

1411
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,600
And then ever since then, she never really showed me her drawings.

1412
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,700
She would show it to every other friend, not me.

1413
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,100
She would never let me touch her things.

1414
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:29,600
Like I couldn't touch her pencil, pencil case, backpack, anything of hers.

1415
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,100
She would let other people just touch and borrow sometimes even without asking.

1416
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,500
I had to specifically ask him.

1417
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,800
Sometimes she wouldn't even let me.

1418
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,600
This really reminds me of the situation in Clockwork Orange,

1419
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,100
where the droogs start to challenge the leader of the droogs.

1420
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,600
You know, what's his name?

1421
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,000
And he cannot, she cannot stand for this.

1422
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
You have to be crushed.

1423
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,200
You have to be crushed to remain subservient.

1424
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,400
That kind of pettiness is something that sounds in line with myself.

1425
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,100
Like, yeah, I would probably do that.

1426
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,000
I call that strong leadership, my dude.

1427
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,800
That's what I'm impressed.

1428
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,200
I'm on her.

1429
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,900
I'm letting you know I'm on her side right now.

1430
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,100
She's a powerful leader.

1431
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:09,300
But I mean, so now I lost my, but yeah, she was very petty.

1432
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,700
Um, she would also like take things very personally.

1433
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,400
Whenever like, I would do something.

1434
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,700
I was, I was, I was a tall clumsy child, by the way.

1435
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,800
Sometimes things would drop from my hands and sometimes I would give her a

1436
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,900
flat foot just because when we were three, we can all walk in a line.

1437
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,300
I had to go, you know, I would fall behind them.

1438
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,400
I would follow and sometimes my, my big steps would be too big.

1439
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,000
And if they, you know, slow down, I would end up giving her a flat foot, not out of,

1440
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,500
not on purpose, but she would, I think she assumed it was out of malice or

1441
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,000
something because, because I think the way she thought, you know, like, because

1442
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
she had some sort of prejudice against me and she wished ill upon me.

1443
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,700
She thought I was reciprocating.

1444
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:57,000
I think that's the word, the ill will, but the thing is I was like stupidly

1445
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,200
clueless about her ill will at that age.

1446
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,000
I, I didn't realize she was mistreating me.

1447
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,200
I was like, oh, we're, we're all friends and okay, she has a short temper.

1448
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,400
That's fine.

1449
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,500
You know, I'll just try not to cross her path or whatever.

1450
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,300
But then we got done with this, this summary because it segues really well

1451
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,000
into what the main one I want to get to.

1452
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,900
So yeah, it's cool.

1453
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:18,500
Okay.

1454
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:18,800
Yeah.

1455
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,100
Also, so fast forward until we're teens.

1456
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,400
So I got a little rebellious.

1457
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,800
I didn't take her shit anymore so much and I would like, you know, have my own

1458
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,300
opinion and I would speak, uh, that didn't go well.

1459
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:38,100
And, um, yeah, we, our, our fights would get more frequent and, uh, our common

1460
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,900
friend, the best friend, she kind of had to tolerate being in between us

1461
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:45,500
because we, we both like hanging out with her and we refused to let the other

1462
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,900
one have her in a way.

1463
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:54,100
Um, and, uh, like at some point, um, my, the best friend, she sort of realized

1464
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:57,500
that, you know, the other one, she was being a bit toxic and she was like, you

1465
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,100
know, we should maybe stop hanging out with her so much because, you know,

1466
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,000
she's, uh, a bad influence on me.

1467
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,700
I was surprised how self aware my friend was and was like, yeah, I think, you

1468
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:12,800
know, it would be kind of for the best in a way if, if we just, you know, just

1469
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,000
kind of, you know, stopped because she, she was this other friend who finally

1470
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:24,000
said something and, and initiated the after all the after not really like

1471
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,500
let me, let me finish the story.

1472
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,000
That's how she, she, we were planning things, but the thing is though, um,

1473
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,600
around the, uh, the time, oh, hold on.

1474
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,600
One thing, one other petty thing she did at this time when we were around 16.

1475
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,100
Okay.

1476
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,500
Let, let me, okay.

1477
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,600
Just let, let me tell you, like, so I got a locker.

1478
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,000
I got a locker for free.

1479
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,500
Otherwise you have to pay for lockers, but I got a locker for free because I

1480
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,100
was a really poor child and they give like really poor children used lockers.

1481
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,400
And so I got one and was like, you know, oh, cool, a locker.

1482
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,600
And, um, my friend, she didn't get a locker because, you know, she wasn't

1483
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,800
poor enough, I guess.

1484
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,700
Um, but I was like, you know, this locker is big for two people.

1485
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,900
I could share it with you and, you know, she, and I let her share my locker

1486
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,800
with me for free.

1487
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,700
And, um, okay.

1488
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,800
So like, I was doing a really nice thing.

1489
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,400
I think, you know, because we could like put our coats in there and we could go

1490
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,700
home together and stuff like that.

1491
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:19,000
It was, you know, would speed things up rather than going to the, you know,

1492
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,300
public place where you put coats in and whatever.

1493
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,300
Anywho.

1494
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:26,600
So, um, we also went to this after school activity, like art club.

1495
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,600
It didn't teach you art.

1496
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,400
You just like kind of hang out there and be friends and you do artsy things.

1497
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,700
And the teacher was really cool.

1498
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,300
And we each like got our own desks.

1499
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,600
Um, and the desks were like really old desks, um, that we're probably going to

1500
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,000
be like thrown out if they weren't reused.

1501
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,100
And like we could just like have fun with those desks.

1502
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,700
We could paint all over those decks, whatever we wanted.

1503
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,800
And that was really cool.

1504
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,200
Mine was a very edgy red and black one.

1505
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,800
Oh, a little Nazi propaganda on there.

1506
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:58,800
No, no, there was no white nose.

1507
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,400
The colors of the Nazi flag.

1508
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,100
Well, I just fucked it up.

1509
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,300
As you can see, clearly I'm not, I wasn't tearing you down.

1510
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,600
I was holding her up for knowing it.

1511
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:08,800
Oh yeah.

1512
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,300
You're right.

1513
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,400
Yeah.

1514
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:10,700
Yeah.

1515
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:15,700
So, um, the thing she did, I, and I know it was her because no one else

1516
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,700
disliked me that much at the time.

1517
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:24,000
I would think, uh, and, um, I couldn't hang out at the after school activities

1518
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,100
so much at that time.

1519
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,200
Um, it was the time I went to the, like the international

1520
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
vocabulary program again.

1521
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,700
So, you know, it's tell lots of homework, whatnot.

1522
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:38,700
Um, so like I would often come back to like trash on my left on my desk,

1523
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:42,800
usually like from snacks or like, uh, like an empty cup from like, um,

1524
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,800
those, uh, machines that you get, like coffee or hot chocolate.

1525
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,100
Right.

1526
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,400
And I knew it was her because I would sometimes see her by these,

1527
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,000
uh, these, these specific items that would be left on my table.

1528
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,700
So one time I decided to just take all of those things and put it

1529
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:02,200
on her desk and see how she would react because it's her trash.

1530
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,100
Um, technically I'm not doing a very bad thing here.

1531
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,400
I'm just returning the trash where it belongs.

1532
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,200
Um, then the next.

1533
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,400
You're committing the worst sin imaginable major, performing

1534
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,200
disrespect against your leader.

1535
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,400
We'll see how that goes.

1536
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,700
And then, then the next day after that, I found my desk dragged

1537
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:24,300
all the way out of the class into like the hallway and almost outside

1538
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:27,900
of the whole school and it was like, this was also in the basement.

1539
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,500
So thankfully no one like really saw it other than me, but it was like,

1540
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,000
yeah, the comfort it was her because she knew where she left her trash.

1541
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,400
So she knew who left the trash on her desk.

1542
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,300
So yeah, it was her and like, so.

1543
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,600
I sort of like went on non-speaking terms with her and I told her a common

1544
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,500
friend, could you tell her please that, you know, if she doesn't knock

1545
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,400
this shit off, you know, I would prefer to get like the key.

1546
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,500
You'll fuck her up, you'll fuck her up, right?

1547
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,000
I would prefer to get the key to the locker bag because I'm not going

1548
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,800
to share a locker with person I don't consider my friend.

1549
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,200
And yeah, she just sort of like threw the key at me and I guess

1550
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,000
I got the key back and we didn't share the locker anymore.

1551
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,200
Um, it was also like the whole plan about, you know, not being friends

1552
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,100
with her anymore that kind of fell through because I went to the baccalaureate

1553
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,900
class while those two got stuck together in the same class because

1554
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,400
their last names were literally one letter apart.

1555
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,600
So of course they were going to be stuck in the same class unlike me.

1556
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,400
So, you know, they kind of ended up being closer friends than before.

1557
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,600
And that was around the time I became best friends with the brother

1558
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,100
rather than her because she started becoming a bit of a bitch because

1559
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:43,700
of the influence, the very thing she noticed that was going to happen

1560
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,000
to her and she let it happen.

1561
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,400
I was like, gee, thanks.

1562
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:47,700
Yeah, man.

1563
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,900
You can you can judge a lot about a person from the kind of people

1564
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:50,800
they hang out with.

1565
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:51,500
It's true.

1566
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,000
Yeah.

1567
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,200
That's why you're all scumbags because I'm in here.

1568
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:56,800
It's true.

1569
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,500
It's true.

1570
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,300
She was awful.

1571
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,900
I think also I have a suspicion that I'm being like paranoid.

1572
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,600
I guess like we also started our very first comic together.

1573
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,200
My idea, by the way, initially, but she jumped on the on the ship.

1574
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,600
Did she quit after the first issue?

1575
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,700
That must have really hurt.

1576
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,300
No, no, no.

1577
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:13,900
Like we both.

1578
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,500
Oh, no.

1579
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,500
Let's not drag that up again.

1580
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,900
Let's open those old wounds.

1581
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,700
And it was like, you know, we both had our own comic that we worked on,

1582
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,800
but it was the same idea, which was my idea.

1583
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,500
It was a Dragon Ball C fan comic with our self-inserts.

1584
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:31,900
Wait a minute.

1585
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,800
We were the perfect foundation for our relationship.

1586
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,000
We were eight and like I just remembered.

1587
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,800
Yeah, I just remembered.

1588
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,600
I have a similar story about someone else who isn't mage who we were doing.

1589
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,500
We were doing that.

1590
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,600
We were doing that pony comic.

1591
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,800
We were doing that.

1592
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:55,100
We were doing shelf deprecation about Phantom and Aurora and it never happened.

1593
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,800
Oh, interesting, interesting.

1594
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,500
Okay.

1595
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:03,800
Let me make another one for the gulags, I guess, whoever this person is.

1596
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,600
She's betrayed two of us.

1597
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,200
Who knows how long until she gets to the rest.

1598
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:10,700
Okay.

1599
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,600
But yeah, so we were both working on our own, our own adventure comics,

1600
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,500
with our very first comics and we showed it to the guys in our neighborhood

1601
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,800
and we're like, oh, that's so cool.

1602
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,600
And we like to both of them equally.

1603
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,000
And I was really proud of that and I wish I still have it.

1604
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,100
Like I even like made it into like I put paper and I sewed it together

1605
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,600
and to make little comic pages.

1606
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,600
I didn't just take like a, you know, a notebook and join it.

1607
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,100
Like most of my other comics.

1608
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,600
I really worked hard on this.

1609
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,900
It was like, my magnum opus at my eight year old.

1610
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And like I was really happy with it.

1611
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,300
I even colored it.

1612
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,300
I colored it.

1613
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:51,900
It's like that's something I didn't do since and out of all my comics of all

1614
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:56,100
the two boxes full of comics that I had started and never finished.

1615
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,700
And that was, that was the one I think I did sort of finish, but it left on a

1616
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,500
cliffhanger.

1617
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:05,300
And so like that one comic was the only one that went missing.

1618
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:10,900
And I have a feeling that she was the reason why because like the actual

1619
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:15,300
like Omega or the alpha version of the comic itself, like just disappeared.

1620
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,400
Yeah, I jacked.

1621
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:16,800
Yeah.

1622
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,600
Oh, no.

1623
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:18,800
Yeah.

1624
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,400
The thing is though, I did lend my comics to my friends a lot to read them

1625
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,900
and, you know, let them see what they think and stuff.

1626
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,300
And all the comics would return to me and I knew, I knew who, you know,

1627
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:34,700
who would get their hands on who and you, you know, who to ask her to return

1628
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:34,900
them.

1629
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:39,500
But like that one comic, it just, just, I don't remember lending it to anyone

1630
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,900
and it just disappeared, but she was the only one of the few friends that

1631
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,200
had access to the comics as easily as she did.

1632
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,800
So I have a feeling she might have had a hand in it.

1633
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,700
I mean, I could be just, you know, seeing Malice where there wasn't,

1634
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:56,400
it could have just gotten lost and it just so happened to be that one

1635
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,500
comic that we started to sort of together.

1636
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,400
Um, they say you should never assume Malice where mere incompetence

1637
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,300
would explain, uh, what, uh, yeah.

1638
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,200
Okay.

1639
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,100
I'm talking nevermind.

1640
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,200
I'm just, I know, I know the saying and I do try to live by that

1641
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,100
saying personally right, right now.

1642
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:18,700
But it's just like how petty and malicious she was.

1643
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,300
I wouldn't put past her to do that to me.

1644
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:26,700
Um, so yeah, and we just, and she went off to college, I think she

1645
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,500
went to the first off to college at 16 years old and I stayed in

1646
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,300
school for two more years to finish.

1647
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,500
Um, never saw her again up until like a few years ago back when I

1648
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:40,200
was returning to Lafiania and I saw her and I was like, you know,

1649
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,700
it's been like, I don't know, like five years.

1650
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,100
It's more than five years since we last actually saw each other

1651
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,900
in smoke and I was like, you know, I don't want to be friends

1652
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,200
with her anymore, especially how, you know, we treated each other.

1653
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,900
But I sort of want to, you know, just ended on a common old be like,

1654
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,500
Hey, yeah, that was, you know, we were stupid kids.

1655
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,800
That was silly.

1656
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,300
Haha.

1657
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,100
We're, we're on good sort of terms and leave it on good terms.

1658
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:09,100
And I saw her and I was so ready to be like, hi, you know, it's been a while.

1659
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,100
But then she looked up at me and she gave me the stinkiest high.

1660
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,400
After all these years, after all these years, yeah, like, I was like, dude,

1661
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,600
it's been over a half a decade and you're still like holding this

1662
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,400
They had more malice for you than you'd for them.

1663
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,000
Hashtag confirmed.

1664
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:30,600
Yeah.

1665
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,600
And just like, I didn't, I ended up not saying hello to her

1666
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,300
because I was like, well, if you're going to glare at me and just

1667
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,600
seeing me after so many years, I'm not, I'm not going to even

1668
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,400
bother anymore.

1669
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,300
If that's the kind of person you want to be, he's fine.

1670
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,700
So mage, is it possible in this situation where you made this eye

1671
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,200
contact that she was, that was her normal, you know, you know, a lot

1672
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,000
of women have resting bitch face when they're in public just so that

1673
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,100
people, so that, you know, people approach them and like talk to them.

1674
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,500
It changed.

1675
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:56,900
Okay.

1676
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,300
Okay.

1677
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:57,800
Yeah.

1678
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:58,900
I see.

1679
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,400
I see.

1680
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,200
Well,

1681
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,400
very run to the prison.

1682
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,200
Another one for the gulag.

1683
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:03,700
There you go.

1684
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,300
They're all.

1685
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,000
Hey, I'm kind of, I'm kind of eager.

1686
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I'm kind of eager to get to questions.

1687
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,400
Yo, I got my biggest one yet though.

1688
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,900
I'm saving one the whole fucking time.

1689
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:13,300
Okay.

1690
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:13,400
Yeah.

1691
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:13,700
Okay.

1692
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,200
I'm only times people are going to undercut the questions before I

1693
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,700
get to my main thesis.

1694
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,700
You just got to, you just got to get to it.

1695
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,200
Right.

1696
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,200
You guys stick it in there.

1697
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:21,700
Right.

1698
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:26,000
I see a trend in mages stories, a childhood friends, like elementary

1699
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
school friendships that go on one decade too long.

1700
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,300
And I, my thesis, my theory on this obviously is that when you get to

1701
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,200
know someone as a kid, you know, kids get along pretty well.

1702
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,900
It's, you know, as Louis CK has said before, it's typically because

1703
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,700
you're the same size there for your friends.

1704
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,700
If you get attached, you get emotionally invested in one another

1705
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,800
and you feel obligated, you're just, you're connected now.

1706
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,800
You know, if it ends up getting broken apart at some point, it's going

1707
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,700
to be painful.

1708
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,500
So you stick around and as you age, your actual like characteristics

1709
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,000
start to emerge in more like meaningful ways.

1710
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,800
Like you start becoming people and that's when conflicts happen.

1711
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,300
And so yeah, like a five, like you're five years old and you become

1712
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,700
a friend and you stay there friend, you're going to end up with a

1713
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:09,500
friendship that nine times out of 10 wouldn't have gotten started in

1714
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,900
your adolescence, but it's now in your adolescence.

1715
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,800
And like, it's not like being siblings where because you have

1716
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,900
genetic similarities, you have a lot to be united over and relate

1717
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,900
with and like living together.

1718
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
You have to get along.

1719
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,200
You have to reconcile.

1720
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,200
But when it's just a friend, someone who you can like get pissed

1721
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,200
off at for 20 minutes, go home and then like think about how pissed

1722
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,000
off you are proud of them.

1723
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,400
And like, there's no like need to rectify the situation.

1724
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,300
Then things can get shitty.

1725
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,800
And like, this is what happened with my girlfriend's friend who it

1726
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,900
was like a friend of like, I think 13 years and just recently sort

1727
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:47,800
of like came to this annoying fight that had to end the friendship.

1728
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,300
Right.

1729
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,100
And they had been fighting since before I met my girlfriend because

1730
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,000
like, they just get mad at each other over over random shit.

1731
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,400
And like, it was very obvious to me.

1732
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,900
This friendship would not have gotten started if they had met each

1733
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,500
other today.

1734
01:15:59,500 --> 01:15:59,900
Right.

1735
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,800
It's just because they knew each other since they were kids.

1736
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,300
Yeah.

1737
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:02,900
I know what you mean.

1738
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,300
This is on the part of this girl.

1739
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:08,200
Uh, I'm not going to name her, but like, they like give a hint.

1740
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,700
There's a certain Dr.

1741
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,100
Seuss character whose name ends with I am.

1742
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,600
So not going to like anything specific, but so.

1743
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,700
Oh, the laurel.

1744
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,200
So this girl, um, she would definitely would fit into a very

1745
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,300
specific, uh, instance of worthless friend.

1746
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,400
And like, she definitely is bitchy and annoying, but it's definitely

1747
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:34,200
not a, um, an unprovocated act of social violence on her part

1748
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:38,700
because Nikki, my girlfriend is someone who will like be confrontational

1749
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,700
if she feels that there's a problem with something.

1750
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,700
And sometimes I'm like, you could be less confrontational, but

1751
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,200
whatever.

1752
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:47,800
And I am someone who can be just a dick, you know, and it was our

1753
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,600
relationship, me and Nikki being a unit that basically set, uh, a

1754
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,700
ticking time bomb on their friendship, right?

1755
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,700
Because Nikki just kind of started falling away from her friends

1756
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,200
in general by spending so much time and calls with me.

1757
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,200
And so you can see how that goes, right?

1758
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:08,800
So, you know, and, and so, uh, the I am girl here is, uh, is, uh,

1759
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,500
was, was the most incensed about it from what I can gather.

1760
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,600
And eventually Nikki moved away from Oregon to come live with me instead.

1761
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,200
So yeah, she basically leaves her friends in the dust by and large.

1762
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,600
So you can see that, that issue.

1763
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,800
And I did visit Nikki's hometown for like a couple of days and I

1764
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,800
was hanging out with all of her friends because she really wanted

1765
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,100
to introduce me to all of them.

1766
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:33,000
And it's like, like, okay, you know, but obviously I don't make good

1767
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
first or millions of impressions on people by and large.

1768
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,800
So a lot of them were weirded out and wondering why she was into me.

1769
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,300
You know, whatever.

1770
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,400
Um, she literally Nikki could literally grabbed my phone at one

1771
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,300
point and just started adding some of her friends without introducing

1772
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,200
them to who I am.

1773
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,400
And I'm like, uh, okay.

1774
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,400
So yeah, you can see how this is sort of a powder keg to piss people off.

1775
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:53,800
Right.

1776
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:57,400
So I don't want to be too accusatory here, but basically, um, we were

1777
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,500
in the car, me and Nikki sitting in the back and this, you know, the girl

1778
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,300
in question, I'll call her acorn head because that's where her hairstyle

1779
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,800
reminds me of sick.

1780
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,500
She's driving.

1781
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,600
I don't even think she was driving, but I think it was her car.

1782
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,900
It was her CD, right?

1783
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:14,500
Or she was playing like, yeah, it was her CD and, uh, drive by by train

1784
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,000
was on the CD and I was just like muttering about how, oh, yeah.

1785
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,200
I remember watching like a, I was just muttering to Nikki like, oh, yeah.

1786
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,400
I remember watching a video by Todd in the shadows about how like the song

1787
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,000
has like some of the worst lyrics possible.

1788
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,300
Like if you really analyze it, lol.

1789
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,000
And then like she put on this like rock cover of somebody I used to know

1790
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
and I just muttered to Nikki like, Oh yeah.

1791
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,800
You know, man, when this song is sort of isolated from its interesting

1792
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,200
instrumentality, the lyrics are pretty, you know, average.

1793
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:42,000
And so this was phrased to Nikki in the form of a Facebook chat message

1794
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,900
as your boyfriend is belittling my musical tastes.

1795
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:50,600
And I was like, I had this like this, this disconnect moment of, oh, right.

1796
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:56,300
Not everyone is on the internet constantly talking opinions all the time.

1797
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,100
I like had to really brain search to remember what the fuck I said

1798
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,800
because I consider myself to, if I'm not on the internet,

1799
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,700
reading random strangers, especially friends of someone important to me,

1800
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,500
I'm going to keep myself pretty tight-lipped.

1801
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,100
And indeed, I did just subconsciously.

1802
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:15,200
She also put on a mixed tape of like early 2000s Disney pop songs.

1803
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:19,600
And I didn't say shit because I never really thought about this as a policy

1804
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,400
until I until I until I was faced with this issue with Acornhead.

1805
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:29,100
But that that I was the result of this situation that I can fuck.

1806
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:29,600
Okay, fine.

1807
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,900
I'll we'll talk about musical taste insulting policies in another episode.

1808
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,700
The point is, she was like, what the fuck is wrong with your boyfriend?

1809
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:35,900
Right?

1810
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:40,400
Because she was like blowing off Nikki like through texts and Nikki was like,

1811
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,100
I'm so mad at Acornhead.

1812
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,000
I want to like tell her to f off and like Nikki, calm down.

1813
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,000
Let's just say, hey, you know, you're here.

1814
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,300
You're there for her, right?

1815
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,400
And just just be nice.

1816
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,000
And she wants to tell her to f off.

1817
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,700
That's some pretty strong language right there.

1818
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,200
Yeah, I don't know why I censored that anyway.

1819
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:00,000
So, um, so she just was like, hey, what's up?

1820
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,100
You know, I don't know what's going on, but you know, let me know.

1821
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,800
And then Acornhead was all like, oh, your boyfriend's such a dick.

1822
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,700
You know, he always corrects people.

1823
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,800
And I was like, wait, what?

1824
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,900
And so apparently an instance of me correcting people is one of her friends

1825
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:15,200
was like, I was playing this game on my phone and it was like one of those

1826
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,300
things where like the camera was like out and it was like at an angle.

1827
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,900
And I'm like, isometric.

1828
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,400
And she was like, well, well, like it was like things were at an angle

1829
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,900
and I'm like, isometric.

1830
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,500
That was apparently really offensive.

1831
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,400
You know, like I was trying to throttle my dickishness so hard,

1832
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,000
but it's still enough of a came through.

1833
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,900
Well, you know, a lot of that is just if they have a certain impression

1834
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,000
of you already, you know, like it's a straw that breaks the game.

1835
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:42,300
I already fucking represent like a tension, a new tension with their friends.

1836
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,100
So I get it, right?

1837
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:43,500
Exactly.

1838
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,300
Um, but so yeah, you guys ever see that episode of Big Bang Theory

1839
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,100
when Sheldon goes to the dinner party?

1840
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,300
Unrelated question.

1841
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:49,900
Just asking.

1842
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,800
But yeah, so like their friendship was over for like a couple of weeks,

1843
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:57,800
even though like I went back to, you know, back to my zone and Nikki was left,

1844
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,400
you know, IRL friends with Acornhead and everyone else.

1845
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,100
And so I was like, well, how are you going to like not be friends with someone

1846
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,300
when you're in a densely connected web of friendship?

1847
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,200
But cut to a few months later, now Nikki lives with me.

1848
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,400
So now it's all online friends with her, right?

1849
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,400
And what happens?

1850
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,400
Oh man, we do something that really offends or really disappoints Acornhead.

1851
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,600
So Nikki says we're going to get a hamster because like me and David

1852
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,900
are going to live up in this room.

1853
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,600
We're going to get a hamster and it's going to be so cool.

1854
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,100
Who's David?

1855
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,000
Yeah, I know, right?

1856
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Who the fuck is David?

1857
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,300
I actually hear my real name more often than a username once now.

1858
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,200
David's the hamster obviously.

1859
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,700
Right, it's the hamster.

1860
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,200
David the hamster.

1861
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,700
So, so fucking, she even had the idea like I'm going to name the hamster Donut.

1862
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:44,100
That's specifically what I'm going to call it.

1863
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,300
She had like, she basically had visualized exactly what this hamster

1864
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,600
is going to be before we even had it.

1865
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,700
And Acornhead was like great hamster idea.

1866
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,900
All you got to do is we like once you get a job, you save up some money.

1867
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,400
You buy all that hamster equipment.

1868
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,900
You buy yourself a hamster and Nikki was like, yeah, Acornhead.

1869
01:21:58,900 --> 01:21:59,900
I'm totally going to do that.

1870
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,500
But then, you know, Nikki's laying around like before I think, yeah,

1871
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,700
she was about to get a job actually.

1872
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,000
It was just like a couple of weeks before she got called in, I think.

1873
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,200
Um, she was about to get a job.

1874
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,100
Uh, but like a few weeks before that, whoops, I'm fucked it up a bit.

1875
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,200
It's a few weeks before.

1876
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:15,500
Right.

1877
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,500
Oh my God.

1878
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,700
We're going back weeks.

1879
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:19,500
Sorry, it's no big deal.

1880
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,400
It was just seriously.

1881
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,900
It was just one little clarification, right?

1882
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:22,500
Okay.

1883
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,800
She fucking, she was like, I want to get the hamster stuff now.

1884
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,800
I'm like, okay, fine.

1885
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:31,200
So I spent like a fair bit of money to get like a hamster cage and all the stuff.

1886
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,200
And Nikki said, hey, she take my money.

1887
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,300
So she said, Hey, Acornhead.

1888
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,700
I got all this hamster equipment, snap a picture.

1889
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:43,000
And Acornhead was like, Oh, dot, dot, dot.

1890
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,700
And Nikki is like, what's going on?

1891
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,000
Huh?

1892
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,600
What's up?

1893
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,500
And she's like, Oh, nothing.

1894
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,400
I'm like, what?

1895
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,200
And she's like, are you mad at me?

1896
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,600
Acorn's like, no, not mad.

1897
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,600
Just dot, dot, dot.

1898
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,500
Disappointed.

1899
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,400
Turns out, of course, the classic believe that she got dramatic ellipses

1900
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,800
that your boyfriend is getting you a hamster before you got a job.

1901
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,500
Right.

1902
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,400
Oh man.

1903
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,100
Your boyfriend is like spoiling you in the humanity.

1904
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:08,600
Right.

1905
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,800
Sounds like sounds like she's in need of a hamster.

1906
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:11,400
Right.

1907
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,000
Dude, now that we got the hamster hamsters are great.

1908
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,400
I finally realized that there is a pet that is great because you know,

1909
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,000
even cats are kind of, you know, they're not zero maintenance.

1910
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,800
Hamsters are basically zero maintenance.

1911
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,900
It's just like watching my every day.

1912
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,900
Now every day is Hamtaro time.

1913
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:25,700
And it's wonderful.

1914
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,600
Hell yeah.

1915
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,500
Finally, I have an animal I really like.

1916
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,100
Tomorrow will be great too.

1917
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,400
Hell yeah, Ben.

1918
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:31,600
Hell yeah.

1919
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,700
So it was definitely worth it.

1920
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,300
But like Acorn had this frame.

1921
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:38,200
This is like, Acorn had this framing this as like me like spoiling Nikki,

1922
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,600
you know, like giving her too much stuff and like, you know,

1923
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,200
again, Nikki wouldn't like let it go.

1924
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,700
She'd be like, Hey, no, you shouldn't.

1925
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:49,100
But, but Acorn had to be just like so offended that her life advice wasn't being

1926
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:49,400
taken.

1927
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,400
So here's where we get to the worthless part of the friendship here.

1928
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:56,900
Is that Acorn had is was so like, it's just a couple of years older,

1929
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:57,400
right?

1930
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,400
And she sees herself as very mature and like independent and was just

1931
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:06,500
in sense that Nikki was not quote listening to her life advice by virtue

1932
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,600
of not just following all of it, you know, and, and she was just like,

1933
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:14,700
and I even told Acorn had like, I gave her my own message like, Hey,

1934
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,800
I mean, I decided to give Nikki the hamster because it would be a

1935
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,600
responsibility.

1936
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,200
Like, you know, she has to like feed it every day and she just needs

1937
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,900
something to do while she looks for a job.

1938
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:25,300
She's really bored, really depressed, waiting for a job to show up.

1939
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,200
I'm giving her some more stuff to do, right?

1940
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,500
And what she did was the classic internet technique of like pretending

1941
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,600
to agree with that point so that they can then proceed to like completely

1942
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,200
contradict you.

1943
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,800
She was like, Oh, I totally get that.

1944
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:36,600
But just wait.

1945
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,500
She said, just wait until five years from now when she's still not doing

1946
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,900
anything with her life and see if you still want to be with her.

1947
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,100
And I was like, Jesus.

1948
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,600
That's I see where she's going with that.

1949
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,100
Sounds pretty zero to 60.

1950
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,000
Yeah, yeah.

1951
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,100
This person's got an agenda.

1952
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,800
Yeah, I fucking know, right?

1953
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,800
And so Nikki was so mad and then like, you know, like she was just browsing

1954
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,300
Facebook a few days later and she saw a comic that reminded her of Acornhead

1955
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,700
where it was like some it was like a little Facebook, you know, comic

1956
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:08,300
strip thing of like, you know, certain guys went this out of a relationship

1957
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,800
and like all the responses were like, oh, yeah, fuck those guys and fuck

1958
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,700
those relationships.

1959
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,700
Nikki was like, all these goddamn people telling me how to have my

1960
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:18,000
relationship, you know, like, yeah.

1961
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,800
And so she so she posted a reply to that thing saying, or you could just,

1962
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,100
you know, let people have their own fucking relationships and live

1963
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,200
their own goddamn lives by their own terms.

1964
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:33,000
The problem is that she did not like, like nest the actual original image

1965
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,800
because it was also like a fetish thing.

1966
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,100
So she didn't want that to be on her post.

1967
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,200
So she just out of context responded to something that wasn't there,

1968
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,100
which was like the weirdest shit ever.

1969
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,000
But it made Acornhead think it was directed completely at her because,

1970
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,600
you know, she knows that there you go.

1971
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,200
So Acornhead, this is fascinating.

1972
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,200
This is like the tale of the snarky Facebook post.

1973
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,700
Like the origin story.

1974
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,200
This is like, uh, uh, yeah, Facebook post redemption.

1975
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:57,400
Yeah.

1976
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,000
So like he was all like, yeah, that that Facebook post wasn't directed

1977
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,500
at her.

1978
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,400
It wasn't about her.

1979
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,800
Although emotionally it was about her, you know, but it wasn't directed

1980
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,200
at her.

1981
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:10,500
She didn't at message Acornhead, you know, at acornhead.twitter.com.

1982
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,400
She did not message her, but Acornhead was like incensed about it and

1983
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,600
wasn't talking to Nikki for a couple of days.

1984
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,600
And she was like, why is she like blowing me off?

1985
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,600
And she was like getting mad.

1986
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,400
Like, I'm going to say F you Acornhead.

1987
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,500
And I was like, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki calm down.

1988
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,900
Just be there for her.

1989
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:28,200
Just send her a message saying what's up.

1990
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:28,800
Right.

1991
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,200
And she was like, okay, fine.

1992
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,000
So she wrote a message hit send message could not be sent.

1993
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,300
Oh shit.

1994
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,900
So after about 30 attempts to call her because I don't know.

1995
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,600
Maybe Nikki is a little bit clingy.

1996
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:45,200
Uh, she finds out through the grapevine that she has been Facebook

1997
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,600
blocked by Acornhead Esquire.

1998
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:51,000
The worst sin you can commit in today's age.

1999
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,800
What a fucking shit.

2000
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,000
Okay.

2001
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:53,200
Yeah.

2002
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:59,200
So, so now Nikki kind of goes like, no, cause Nikki has this sort of

2003
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:04,100
this really difficult relationship of not being able to not respect Acornhead

2004
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:08,000
for being, you know, an older girl who's gotten more accomplishments

2005
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,900
and done more things with her life and acts like a know it all and

2006
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,800
therefore like attain some authority.

2007
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,300
You know, someone who Nikki has looked up to for a long period of time.

2008
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,100
So it's hard to like reconcile the fact that she's actually kind of a bitch dick.

2009
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,200
So it's, you know, kind of tears her up.

2010
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:22,700
You're right.

2011
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,600
And it was just like, eventually Acornhead responded with, yeah, fuck you

2012
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,000
and your stupid messages.

2013
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,500
Um, you're not, you're a terrible friend.

2014
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,200
Um, I'm not going to be your friend anymore.

2015
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,500
I don't want to see any more of you.

2016
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,900
Oh, you're dumb.

2017
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:39,400
And I thought it was pretty interesting to see, uh, to see Acornhead after

2018
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,600
all of her like posturing of like how mature she is, like taking

2019
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,300
her ball and going home, just the amount of spite that was like spread

2020
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:49,300
onto me indirectly through Nikki is palpable in my soul.

2021
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:50,500
This is a very recent thing.

2022
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,200
That's why I'm going in through too many like unnecessary details

2023
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,200
is because it's hard and I haven't had as much time to filter it out.

2024
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:01,500
But, uh, but, uh, yeah, and, and eventually like her last message to

2025
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,400
Nikki was, yeah, you know, um, you think you can live without me,

2026
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,400
but when it all comes crashing down, you'll be sorry.

2027
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,500
And I'm like, Jesus.

2028
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,100
And, uh, yeah, that was that.

2029
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,900
So that was a friend, you know, when you talk specifically

2030
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:18,700
about worthlessness, it's a friend who felt that they were more

2031
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:22,200
worthful than they are and couldn't deal with the fact that they're

2032
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,500
fucking life advice and you know, this whole like hamster thing

2033
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,600
was at the tip of the iceberg.

2034
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,400
Sounds like someone who's willing to, who's willing to write

2035
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,400
you off completely when you don't need them.

2036
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,200
And like, like if you, if you're no longer dependent on them.

2037
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,500
Yeah, exactly.

2038
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,000
Exactly.

2039
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,600
It was, it was very, yeah, it was pretty manipulative and controlling

2040
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,400
in that kind of way.

2041
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,600
And she was just, yeah, she was just getting herself into this,

2042
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:45,600
the cycle of like acting more immature because she wasn't being

2043
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,500
treated like the adult in the room, you know, and, uh, we see.

2044
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:48,800
Yeah.

2045
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,200
There's a lot of ways that you can be a worthless friend and a

2046
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,700
lot of ways you can approach this from.

2047
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,700
So, uh, yeah, that's interesting here for that perspective.

2048
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:56,300
All right.

2049
01:28:56,300 --> 01:29:00,300
Well, we encourage you all to go out and try and experiment with

2050
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:03,600
your own ways of being a worthless friend and let us know how it goes.

2051
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:04,700
All right.

2052
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:05,200
What's up, mate?

2053
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:05,700
Yeah.

2054
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,900
Just quickly while I was talking, I remember like the friend from my

2055
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:13,700
last, uh, story, she, um, told her family, like, like, uh, she was

2056
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:17,100
really good friends with her, like, um, cousins and stuff.

2057
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:21,200
Uh, she, she told her cousins about me and during like one time while

2058
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,200
we were friends, like we, you know, we had the on and off thing.

2059
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,000
Uh, while we were friends, like her cousin came to visit and like in

2060
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,500
the middle of like the neighborhood, I was just walking home.

2061
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:33,300
The cousin just kind of like pointed to me and shouted across

2062
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:40,500
the neighborhood, like, you can't like my cousin says, like, you're,

2063
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,300
you're a terrible person.

2064
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,400
And I was stunned.

2065
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,400
I was stunned.

2066
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,300
I was like, I never, I never talked to you.

2067
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,600
You don't know anything about me.

2068
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,100
She must have said really terrible things about me for you to go out

2069
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,300
of your way to bully me in public like that.

2070
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,100
And she was older as well.

2071
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,500
She, we weren't like, we weren't like, and like the same age.

2072
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,700
She was much older than me.

2073
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,900
She was like, did you say sorry?

2074
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:03,200
Yeah.

2075
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,700
She was, did you say you cunt in Lithuanian in Lithuania?

2076
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,700
She said something of equivalent.

2077
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:12,200
Uh, I don't remember the exact words, but I knew it was like a swear word.

2078
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,000
It was like approximately say something like that in major major.

2079
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,800
Can't believe you remember the English translation better than what

2080
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,000
was actually said in your native tongue.

2081
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,700
She's living in the first things first, like Lithuanians don't

2082
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:29,900
have swear words all their swear words that we use our Polish or Russian

2083
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:30,900
or even English.

2084
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:31,500
Oh, cool.

2085
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,000
Yeah.

2086
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,800
So we don't, we don't have swear just in our, that's, that's what I like.

2087
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,300
A good clean language.

2088
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,700
If we wanted to insult people, we would use animal words like, you

2089
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:44,500
know, pig, uh, kurwa, rooster.

2090
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:45,900
That, that's Polish.

2091
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,000
And that's a swear word.

2092
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,400
I know, I know.

2093
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,200
That was fascinating.

2094
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,700
I heard kurwa all the time.

2095
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:57,100
Kurwa was the only, was like, was like, was the most, was the big thing over

2096
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:57,400
there.

2097
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,600
Um, I'm medical never, never at me.

2098
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,800
Um, never from me because I'm a good boy.

2099
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,200
Of course.

2100
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,000
You didn't do nothing.

2101
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:05,800
Never.

2102
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:10,400
But yeah, just like my point is like, she should talk so badly about me to

2103
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:15,600
her like close relatives where I, while we were friends, I never should

2104
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,300
talked about her behind her back.

2105
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:21,200
Like only time I would complain about her to our common friend who knew

2106
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:21,900
how she was.

2107
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:26,200
I wouldn't like, you know, poison new people to her like by, by, you know,

2108
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:27,500
just, you know,

2109
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,900
that was like, that was such a shocker.

2110
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:30,800
And I just remembered it.

2111
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,400
And like, there was also other ways how she mistreated me, but like this

2112
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,900
podcast is a long enough for me to tell all the stories.

2113
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,400
But yeah, she was, she was terrible.

2114
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,700
Hey, what can you do, man?

2115
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,800
Uh, sounds like she really was after control.

2116
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,800
Friends are scary.

2117
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,300
They can become enemies.

2118
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,100
It's, it's true.

2119
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:47,900
It's a role in life.

2120
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,400
I like how like every, never have friends.

2121
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,500
Everybody has a message.

2122
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:51,800
Yeah.

2123
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,600
All the friends I had, like in real life, just sort of like pissed off from my

2124
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,900
life all at the same time.

2125
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:02,600
When I was 16, 17, so they all left and you were the common element here.

2126
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:03,400
Wonder if there's a.

2127
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:05,800
Come on.

2128
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,500
I don't know.

2129
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:08,600
Fuck you.

2130
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:15,100
I like, I like to believe I was meant for greater things.

2131
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,500
Interesting.

2132
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,000
Interesting.

2133
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,300
That's what all sociopaths say.

2134
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:18,800
Okay.

2135
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:24,300
So this is the part of the show where we take questions from fans at home

2136
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:28,100
on Twitter and on the private PCP discord for patrons only.

2137
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:28,600
Hooray.

2138
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,000
That's right.

2139
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:29,500
That's right.

2140
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,500
And if you patron, uh, you're more likely to get your question seen because we

2141
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,500
got a whole bunch of Twitter ones.

2142
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,700
It's a more exclusive club.

2143
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,800
And for the first time ever, the entire, the entire PCP patron lounge came

2144
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,600
together with one big question that they want us to debate.

2145
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:44,700
Oh, God.

2146
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,900
They've been having a debate about this all day and they wanted to get our

2147
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:48,600
take on it.

2148
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:52,500
What's the best kind of chocolate, dark chocolate, normal chocolate?

2149
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,000
Oh, I have a very specific answer.

2150
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,900
I like how it's called normal chocolate, not milk chocolate.

2151
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:57,700
Well, sure.

2152
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:58,200
That's true.

2153
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,500
Of course it's not dark chocolate.

2154
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,600
Of course it's dark.

2155
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,200
Milk.

2156
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,900
Does anyone not think it's dark chocolate?

2157
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,200
It's not dark chocolate.

2158
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,400
It's dark chocolate.

2159
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,100
It's dark chocolate.

2160
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,500
Milk chocolate.

2161
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:08,300
No.

2162
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:08,500
Okay.

2163
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,600
So look, hang on.

2164
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:09,800
Okay.

2165
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,200
So, uh, who, how many people in favor of dark chocolate?

2166
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:12,600
I.

2167
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,300
I.

2168
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:14,500
What?

2169
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,000
Only two?

2170
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,100
Is it genetic?

2171
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,200
Is it a genetic disposition that we shared?

2172
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,200
Who's, who's, who's for milk chocolate now?

2173
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,100
Uh, I like white chocolate.

2174
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:23,800
What?

2175
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,200
And a white, what about DeVue?

2176
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:25,900
And what does DeVue say?

2177
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,800
Are we limited only to dark white and milk?

2178
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:28,300
No.

2179
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,200
No, you got another.

2180
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:29,900
You can suggest it.

2181
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:30,100
Yeah.

2182
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:30,800
That was the question.

2183
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,600
The kind that you get that are chocolate chips out of the bag that are meant for baking.

2184
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:35,800
Those for some reason.

2185
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,400
So baking.

2186
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,500
That's not, that's not milk chocolate.

2187
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:39,400
No, that's not sweet.

2188
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,100
And it's dark chocolate.

2189
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:40,500
Dude, I can't.

2190
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,100
Are they sweetened?

2191
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:41,600
Are they sweetened?

2192
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,700
I don't know what to fucking tell you.

2193
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,500
You can buy any kind of fucking Hershey's.

2194
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:49,400
It's not going to taste quite like, uh, chocolate chips that you get out of a bag that are meant for cooking.

2195
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,800
It's like, it's like this weird civilization where like everyone is doing the wrong thing

2196
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,600
and I'm the main character who like looked to the side of the shelf and like found this other different path.

2197
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:04,000
It leaves the secret society where there's the fucking completely way superior in every fucking way chocolate that people put in chocolate chips.

2198
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,100
No, you don't need to buy it in chip form.

2199
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,000
You can get it just normal.

2200
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,600
Well, DeVue is making the case that it's not the same.

2201
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,300
The taste is like like a Hershey's part.

2202
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,500
Hershey's favorite flavor is a shape.

2203
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,300
I'm going to tell you what, it's, it's dark.

2204
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:18,000
It's semi, it's semi sweet and it's dark chocolate.

2205
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,500
I'm sure.

2206
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:24,100
You erased all memories of chocolate from me and you blindfolded me and had me eat a regular Hershey's bar.

2207
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:28,100
I would be like, hmm, kind of tastes like I'm eating like a candle or something.

2208
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:36,900
It kind of like, it almost tastes like some sort of like weird, like maybe chocolate that was like inside a can that was like sitting there for two weeks mixed with like a red candle or something.

2209
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,500
Maybe some bugs flew into it.

2210
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:42,700
That's what I think when I eat like Hershey's bars or Hershey's kisses, every kind of Hershey's thing.

2211
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:46,000
But even Hershey's, the same exact fucking brand.

2212
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:59,300
If you just buy the bags of chocolate chips that I'd see in my mom's jelly cupboard, I open it up, pour that into like just a little cup and just eat those like a snack while I'm 14 and don't have to worry about getting a fat belly of beer belly yet.

2213
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,900
That was the only kind of chocolate that was really worth having.

2214
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:06,900
And I'm just like, why, why, why is the world not like understanding this weird mistake we've all made?

2215
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:09,000
We've all made this collective mistake.

2216
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,300
Fair enough.

2217
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:15,100
If we can pick random shit as our favorite chocolate, then peanut M&M's are the best chocolate ever made.

2218
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:19,600
Okay, now we're just poisoning the well here, bringing in these candy coated shit.

2219
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,100
What is the word?

2220
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,100
You let the food do it, you fuck!

2221
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:24,500
He's talking about a specific type of pure chocolate.

2222
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,000
So much!

2223
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,500
No, but the peanut M&M's got damn it.

2224
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:32,400
The question is, the question is white milk, the question is white milk or dark.

2225
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,300
Well, in white milk or dark, dark all the way.

2226
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:39,200
Like I would rather like fucking eat like a celery stick than any kind of dark, any kind of chocolate other than dark.

2227
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:43,700
People who prefer dark chocolate are also like wearing a fedora and like smoking a pipe.

2228
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:51,700
Well, I'm literally doing one of those things right now and I'm gonna do the other later today.

2229
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:57,200
Like I've been dark chocolate fans also like watch Rick and Morty every week and like do a podcast about it.

2230
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:57,700
Disgust.

2231
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:58,700
Rick and Morty?

2232
01:35:58,700 --> 01:35:59,700
You're not wrong.

2233
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:04,700
My, I'll always have a place in my heart for cookies and cream Hershey bars.

2234
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,700
Yeah, one of my chocolate.

2235
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:07,700
That's not white chocolate.

2236
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,700
I know that's not pure white chocolate.

2237
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:10,700
That's a meme candy bar.

2238
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,700
It's not, it's not in the running gear.

2239
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,700
It doesn't taste good.

2240
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:20,700
My mom will occasionally get this like hot pepper like dark chocolate, which just has like spiciness to it, which is kind of good.

2241
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:22,700
But I gotta go with dark chocolate.

2242
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,700
The answer is clear.

2243
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:24,700
The consensus here is dark chocolate.

2244
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:25,700
No.

2245
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:26,700
There you go.

2246
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:27,700
I disagree.

2247
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:28,700
Facts are facts.

2248
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:29,700
You disagree with the consensus.

2249
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:30,700
This is math mage.

2250
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,700
In general, I like fake chocolate like Atkins chocolate more than real chocolate.

2251
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:36,700
Like even more than like fucking chocolate chip chocolate.

2252
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:39,700
Because it doesn't make me feel like I just ate a bunch of sugar because I didn't.

2253
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:42,700
It's a faker, but it's actually actually like a taste better.

2254
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:43,700
That's why I like diet soda.

2255
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:48,700
Like it might be just psychosomatic, but I just feel better about myself after drinking a diet soda.

2256
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,700
I recently got super into zero water.

2257
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:53,700
It's all the taste of fucking soda without feeling like I just, I'm about to fucking pass out, right?

2258
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:55,700
But yeah, like fake chocolate.

2259
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:56,700
I even like the taste.

2260
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:57,700
It's not just the feeling afterwards.

2261
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:02,700
It's got this like powdery texture to it that is just so much more even and smooth.

2262
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,700
Then like, cause like chocolate chips.

2263
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:09,700
Yes, they have an amazing taste, but they're so fucking intense that they kind of command my attention and I become numb to it.

2264
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:10,700
You know?

2265
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:17,700
So like, cause like, like chocolate chip cookies, for instance, I would say are not actually enjoyable to eat in the long run because they're so good.

2266
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,700
What the fuck are you talking about?

2267
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,700
How is there so no one ever let me finish my fucking sentence?

2268
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:25,700
They always boo me before I can completely beat it.

2269
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,700
Yeah, there's so many people here who boo.

2270
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:37,700
When you eat one, you like, it's like so good that like now that you're done eating it, life sucks now.

2271
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:43,700
So the only logical conclusion is to never stop eating them, which will become a thing you can never eat.

2272
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:46,700
God damn it, are you stop gaslighting us on the definition of good brother fucker?

2273
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:54,700
Are you actually here to argue that because the chocolate chip cookies are so good that it's so sad to stop eating them?

2274
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:56,700
That it's not worth eating them in the first place, man.

2275
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,700
But he loves eating dark chocolate, so it must taste like shit.

2276
01:37:58,700 --> 01:37:59,700
I don't know what to fucking tell you.

2277
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:05,700
There are things I think taste even better than chocolate chip cookies, but they're just a certain kind of good that aren't the same problem.

2278
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,700
I guess Davoo's making like the heroin arguments.

2279
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:08,700
Like is heroin good?

2280
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:14,700
I mean, kind of, it's kind of good, but when your whole life is wrecked because you've reached to by a peak of euphoria.

2281
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:15,700
I don't know, hold on.

2282
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:16,700
It's not just simply the level.

2283
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,700
It's not a fucking DBZ power level here.

2284
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,700
It's more of a complicated thing, right?

2285
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:22,700
Because like for example, like-

2286
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:24,700
My P-brain can understand this.

2287
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,700
Yes, yes, fucking tortilla chips.

2288
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,700
I have the same issue with them.

2289
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,700
Because it's all about the fucking salt.

2290
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:33,700
The beginning of every tortilla chip is great.

2291
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,700
The end of every tortilla chip is all right.

2292
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:39,700
And so the only way to continue the feedback loop is to keep doing more chips, right?

2293
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,700
It's a clear science.

2294
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:44,700
Like potato chips even fucking advertise themselves, can't put them down.

2295
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:49,700
Like that's kind of like weird abusive marketing right there, abusive products.

2296
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,700
It's that skinner box.

2297
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:52,700
Right, yeah.

2298
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,700
Every time you get the fucking shiny thing.

2299
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:58,700
Like obviously with chips, the logic in science is very clear.

2300
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:03,700
It's salt and then the salt gets absorbed and now you're dealing with a bunch of tasteless darts.

2301
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:06,700
I don't know how the science works with chocolate chip cookies.

2302
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:09,700
I don't understand why, but I can have something like say brownies with ice cream,

2303
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:13,700
which I think I would write above chocolate chip cookies as in terms of taste.

2304
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:14,700
But I feel more satisfied about that.

2305
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:15,700
Please stop, I'm so hungry.

2306
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,700
Okay, well you know what?

2307
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:17,700
You know what?

2308
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,700
I'd say dark chocolate chip cookies are better anyway.

2309
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:20,700
So the question is settled.

2310
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,700
Actually guys, I just realized I made a mistake.

2311
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:26,700
The question actually said dark people, milk people.

2312
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:30,700
Oh no, we've been racist this whole time.

2313
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,700
What are the milk people?

2314
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,700
Wait, is that like gay people?

2315
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:35,700
Like the guy named the milk people?

2316
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:36,700
It's the carthine.

2317
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,700
It's the carthine are the milk people.

2318
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,700
Wouldn't a milk person be a woman?

2319
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,700
Oh shit, you're right.

2320
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:43,700
They're the cows of people.

2321
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,700
You're not wrong.

2322
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:49,700
I guess I'm going to maintain my same answer from before,

2323
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:50,700
which is that my favorite of the kinds,

2324
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:52,700
the really small ones, you get in a bag.

2325
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:58,700
Davoo sent me to have some jungle fever over here.

2326
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:59,700
Yeah, I guess we do.

2327
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:00,700
Yes, we do.

2328
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:03,700
Should we move on to the next question?

2329
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,700
I've got it right here lined up.

2330
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:07,700
Okay, all right, there you go.

2331
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,700
All right, here we go.

2332
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:12,700
New question at Faye88son says or asks,

2333
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,700
are you with or with not?

2334
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:16,700
This is how they say it.

2335
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:19,700
Are you with or with not designer babies?

2336
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,700
Designer babies.

2337
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:21,700
What does that mean?

2338
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:22,700
What do you think, everybody?

2339
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:25,700
So a designer baby is the idea of being able to genetically

2340
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:27,700
engineer the type of baby you want,

2341
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:28,700
and then you just, you know.

2342
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:29,700
I think I've got to be against,

2343
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:33,700
because lately I've been thinking about dog breeds

2344
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,700
and about how fucked up it is that we've like fucked up

2345
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,700
dogs so much with genetic engineering

2346
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:39,700
and like turned them into mutants.

2347
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,700
And I'm pretty sure it would be a bad idea

2348
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,700
to start down that route with humans as well.

2349
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:45,700
Well, Ben, let me just play devil's advocate

2350
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:46,700
on the obvious points here,

2351
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:48,700
but like wouldn't it be great though, Ben,

2352
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:50,700
if we just engineered everyone to like

2353
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,700
not have any chance of cancer and like have, you know,

2354
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:56,700
I don't know, be tall and strong and muscly.

2355
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:58,700
You know what, I was thinking,

2356
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:01,700
I was thinking designer as in like purely aesthetic.

2357
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:03,700
If we're talking about like disease resistance,

2358
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:04,700
then I'm going to say.

2359
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:07,700
Yeah, but like having a foreign amendment against aesthetics

2360
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:10,700
is just, here's like talking about ideology, sure,

2361
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,700
but let's go one layer down towards a little bit

2362
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:16,700
more of practicality as to like what platforms,

2363
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:19,700
no matter how noble, cannot possibly win.

2364
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:22,700
Here's the thing, like because when Ben said it would be

2365
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,700
difficult to go to start down that direction,

2366
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,700
keyword I want to emphasize is start.

2367
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:29,700
Similarly to like say cyber augmentation

2368
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,700
and how some people say that it's kind of a stupid argument

2369
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:33,700
because we already augment ourselves with things

2370
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:35,700
that we wear or like put on our wrists.

2371
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:37,700
It's like the same thing.

2372
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:40,700
You are already putting into consideration

2373
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:43,700
the design of your children if you make any decisions

2374
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:45,700
about who you're going to mate with

2375
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,700
based on what you want your children to be.

2376
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,700
And if you choose to not drink alcohol during pregnancy,

2377
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:51,700
you are making an effect.

2378
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,700
It's just a very simple one.

2379
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:54,700
It's a very simple, obvious, not complicated,

2380
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:58,700
not morally gray yet series of decisions that you are making.

2381
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:02,700
And if the decisions become really complicated,

2382
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,700
every fucking forum argument is just going to go back down

2383
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:08,700
to like, well, you already weren't drinking alcohol.

2384
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:11,700
So like the people who are against this are hypocritical.

2385
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:13,700
And I just don't think people are going to be able to like,

2386
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,700
yeah, people, the people who are going to stand against it

2387
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:16,700
just aren't going to be able to win.

2388
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:18,700
Probably because all the people who are for it

2389
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,700
are going to be like a lot stronger than them

2390
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:21,700
and just kick their ass.

2391
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:25,700
I agree, Davoo, that the, to say it's just bad on its face

2392
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:28,700
is overly simplistic for a lot of reasons.

2393
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:31,700
But like, I see that the biggest concern that I would have

2394
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:34,700
is through the, like how good is the actual process?

2395
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,700
Like are we saying in this example that we magically

2396
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:38,700
have the ability to just, you know,

2397
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,700
wizardly control whatever kind of way we want our kids

2398
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:43,700
to come out and there won't be any side effects?

2399
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,700
I'm thinking like that the real issue will be

2400
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:48,700
the actual like tangible effects of monkeying around

2401
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:51,700
with like a zygote's DNA and like trying to control it.

2402
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:54,700
But yeah, I'm sorry, that's your word.

2403
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:55,700
I know that's your people's word.

2404
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,700
You fucker.

2405
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,700
First PewDiePie and now you.

2406
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:00,700
How can't you do this to me?

2407
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:04,700
What I did want to say was that, so Star Trek,

2408
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:07,700
totally sidestepped this question in what I would consider

2409
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,700
a fairly cowardly way and it's that,

2410
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:11,700
so the way that Star Trek addressed the question

2411
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:14,700
of genetic engineering is, so even in the original Star Trek,

2412
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:17,700
everyone knows Khan, you know, the famous Khan guy.

2413
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:20,700
So he is a genetically engineered like super Ubermensch

2414
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:24,700
and that's like, and it just made him like think that

2415
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,700
like, okay, I am superior to everyone.

2416
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,700
So I have carte blanche to just like rule the human race.

2417
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:30,700
And there were a lot of guys like him and you know,

2418
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:31,700
it caused a lot of bad things to happen

2419
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,700
because he had that mentality.

2420
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:36,700
But like, and so basically, and in Deep Space Nine,

2421
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:38,700
there is another character who's also genetically enhanced,

2422
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:40,700
but basically the whole thing is like, he's okay.

2423
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:41,700
He happened to turn out okay.

2424
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:43,700
But there's a bunch of other genetically enhanced people

2425
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:46,700
who like got kind of fucked up during the process,

2426
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,700
which I think is interesting and probably more realistic

2427
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:51,700
to what will happen because, but the reason they got fucked up

2428
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:55,700
is because the practice has been completely outlawed

2429
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:58,700
to genetically engineered children throughout the galaxy.

2430
01:43:58,700 --> 01:43:59,700
Exactly.

2431
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,700
And so like these people were fucked up because like,

2432
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:04,700
they had like back room geneticists, like are the ones,

2433
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,700
like it's really similar to like a back room abortion

2434
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:08,700
that like can fuck up the mom and stuff.

2435
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:09,700
Like that's the idea here.

2436
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:11,700
And so like, of course in that process,

2437
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:12,700
things get messed up.

2438
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:13,700
A much better conceit would simply be that like,

2439
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:15,700
well, we try, but it turns out we can't make people

2440
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:16,700
that much better than we already can

2441
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:18,700
because DNA is more complicated than we thought,

2442
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:20,700
you know, like fucking, you know.

2443
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:21,700
Yes.

2444
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:22,700
They're trying to avoid the question of like,

2445
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,700
okay, but what if we really do just start making every baby

2446
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:28,700
like pretty much perfect as a campaign?

2447
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:29,700
You see the Ubermensch.

2448
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,700
They're not answering that question.

2449
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:31,700
They're still getting fucking,

2450
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,700
I'm actually like editing a fucking Hunter, Hunter thing.

2451
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,700
I'm watching the Merrim versus Netero fight right now.

2452
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:36,700
That fucking Ubermensch.

2453
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,700
Well, that didn't work out too well for him.

2454
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:41,700
But it probably would have worked out okay.

2455
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:42,700
I mean, okay.

2456
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:44,700
So like he was not a bad person.

2457
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:46,700
He just had a big ego because everyone, you know,

2458
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,700
fed it a lot and he had to kind of sort through it.

2459
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:50,700
But like he did develop human emotions

2460
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:51,700
and an appreciation for life.

2461
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:54,700
He probably wouldn't have lost if he was like more than

2462
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:57,700
like 15 days old and had like more life experience.

2463
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:58,700
Yeah.

2464
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,700
Like the only reason he lost is because the, you know,

2465
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:03,700
people assumed he was going to be a huge problem for the world,

2466
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,700
which he may or may not have eventually been.

2467
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,700
You know, the ants did kill a lot of people,

2468
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,700
but you know, he didn't really have control of that

2469
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:10,700
from the start.

2470
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,700
He was brought into this system.

2471
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,700
So he himself, you know, maybe he would have fixed things

2472
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:17,700
and like, you know, they basically just assassinated him

2473
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:19,700
without finding out what he would eventually become.

2474
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:22,700
He was only like a couple days or like a couple months old

2475
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:23,700
at that point, you know?

2476
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:24,700
Yeah.

2477
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:26,700
God, I love this fucking discussion we just had like 20,

2478
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:29,700
like 2% of people are gonna be like, yeah, that's good points.

2479
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,700
20% of people would be like, you fucking spoilers.

2480
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:34,700
And then the other people are like, they're fucking talking about it.

2481
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:35,700
That's okay.

2482
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,700
We don't need to get into that anymore.

2483
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:39,700
So does anyone have like a strong stance against it

2484
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:42,700
on any kind of moral level or is it all practical?

2485
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,700
No.

2486
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:45,700
Yeah.

2487
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:48,700
Human life is there to be toyed with in my mind.

2488
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:49,700
Okay.

2489
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,700
I see a good question here, pretty heady one.

2490
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:53,700
It's on the Twitter?

2491
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:54,700
Yeah, it's on Twitter.

2492
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:55,700
Okay.

2493
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:58,700
PoraSailingGod asks, what does humanity deserve more?

2494
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:01,700
Alien friendship by solving global warming for us

2495
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:04,700
or punishing us with death for causing it?

2496
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:05,700
Oh, wow.

2497
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:06,700
Well, okay.

2498
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:10,700
By killing us because we caused global warming that only hurts us?

2499
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:11,700
What's...

2500
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:15,700
I think what she's asking is, does humanity deserve to be,

2501
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:18,700
should aliens step in and help us solve the issue

2502
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,700
or should they destroy us?

2503
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:23,700
Because we've caused this issue and we're too dangerous.

2504
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:26,700
I think the destroy thing is a silly point.

2505
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:28,700
I would not be on board with that.

2506
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:31,700
I would be surprised if I personally was ever a huge fan of a sci-fi thing

2507
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:35,700
where aliens did anything other than not give a single shit.

2508
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:39,700
You guys are still relying on the atmosphere of the rock you grew out of?

2509
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,700
Plebs?

2510
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:41,700
Yeah.

2511
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:42,700
Why would they even give a shit?

2512
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:43,700
They're interdimensional travels.

2513
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:46,700
I hope people realize the moment that we have faster than light travel,

2514
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:50,700
fucking no one's gonna care about climates of planets.

2515
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:52,700
Well, you know, we'll need to fix it.

2516
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,700
Still gotta live on them.

2517
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:54,700
Yeah, you gotta...

2518
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,700
Sorry, you could live in a ship, I guess, but whatever.

2519
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:58,700
People do better on planets.

2520
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,700
Yeah, no.

2521
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,700
I mean, I wouldn't really...

2522
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:02,700
I mean, it'd be nice if the aliens fixed it

2523
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,700
and then just like gave us the answers to these questions,

2524
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:07,700
but I think humans will sort it out eventually.

2525
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:10,700
I think we deserve the benefit of the doubt.

2526
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:11,700
I agree.

2527
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:12,700
What's her face from horror, he said?

2528
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:14,700
Yeah, I could influence the weather,

2529
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:17,700
but if you influence it just slightly in an artificial way,

2530
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,700
it will basically cause apocalypse for hundreds of years.

2531
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,700
Wait, Haruhi said that?

2532
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:23,700
Oh, right.

2533
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:24,700
The alien girl from it.

2534
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:25,700
Oh, Yui.

2535
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:26,700
No, not Yui.

2536
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:28,700
Yuki, that's right.

2537
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:32,700
Okay, the question of like, should we be wiped out for it?

2538
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:35,700
I feel like that attitude is coming from this like,

2539
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:39,700
because we have committed this sin against the planets.

2540
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:41,700
Guys, the planet is a fucking rock.

2541
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:42,700
It's not alive.

2542
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:43,700
It has no personhood.

2543
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:44,700
It is not like...

2544
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:48,700
It is not deserving of moral concern outside of...

2545
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:49,700
It is a habitat for...

2546
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,700
And I don't even care about animals.

2547
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:53,700
My standard of caring about something is

2548
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,700
if it has like an intelligence that is worth preserving.

2549
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:57,700
Some animals might qualify for that,

2550
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:58,700
and definitely humans do.

2551
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:01,700
But like, I don't feel bad for the fucking planets

2552
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:03,700
or like wiping out bacteria.

2553
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,700
Every day you're fucking alive.

2554
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:06,700
You are murdering bacteria in your fucking gut.

2555
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:08,700
That's no different from like,

2556
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:09,700
burning down a fucking rainforest

2557
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:11,700
and just like letting all the trees die.

2558
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:13,700
All I care about is our environment.

2559
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:14,700
That's all I care about.

2560
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,700
Yeah, for our own sake.

2561
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:18,700
Yeah, I mean, not to like pile on and be too much of a dick,

2562
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,700
but hearing that question,

2563
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:21,700
it reminds you of like my parents and their friends being like,

2564
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:24,700
do you think that like America deserves to be destroyed by Satan

2565
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:26,700
for all of its sins at this point?

2566
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:27,700
I'm just like...

2567
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:28,700
Okay.

2568
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:29,700
Gotcha.

2569
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:30,700
Oh, is this it done?

2570
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:33,700
I mean, yes, but, you know...

2571
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:36,700
All right.

2572
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:38,700
How about this one?

2573
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:39,700
Jade Murrow asks,

2574
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:42,700
how much do you value being a jack of all trades

2575
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:44,700
versus specializing in one craft?

2576
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:46,700
Immensely.

2577
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:48,700
So, because I feel that the two,

2578
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:51,700
that the one field I have proven successful in videos

2579
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,700
would not have been able to be,

2580
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:56,700
if not for having a very specific mixture of skills.

2581
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:58,700
Let me finish the question.

2582
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,700
She goes on to say,

2583
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,700
I mean, most crafts take more than one skill to do.

2584
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:03,700
Right, yeah, exactly.

2585
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:05,700
But like, it's all about the very specific mixture.

2586
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:07,700
Like, you can have people with like,

2587
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:09,700
mediocre to pretty good skills in certain things,

2588
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:12,700
but if combined just right, they make something great.

2589
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:14,700
And I would consider James Rolfe to be kind of in that camp.

2590
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,700
Like, he's pretty good at writing,

2591
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:17,700
he's pretty good at directing,

2592
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:18,700
he's pretty good at editing,

2593
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:19,700
he's pretty good at analysis,

2594
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,700
and he's pretty good at filmmaking.

2595
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:24,700
I think he's kind of like a mediocre to decent filmmaker,

2596
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:26,700
but he would just happen to have the idea

2597
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:30,700
to combine filmmaking and narrative with video game review

2598
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:32,700
and created an all new like genre

2599
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,700
that like revolutionized everything

2600
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:36,700
and happens to still do it better than most people.

2601
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,700
So it's like, you know.

2602
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,700
The single most important invention of the last hundred years

2603
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,700
was the induction of the video game nerd.

2604
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:43,700
Yeah. The angry video game nerd.

2605
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:44,700
Yeah, yeah, oh, absolutely.

2606
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:46,700
The greatest creation of the last hundred years,

2607
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:47,700
I would say, of course.

2608
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:49,700
You know, we're like, you know, Andrew Hussey

2609
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:52,700
taking pretty good art skills, great writing skills,

2610
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:53,700
great work ethic skills,

2611
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:57,700
and creating something that's spec'd perfectly to his abilities

2612
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:59,700
and he made something amazing with it, right?

2613
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:01,700
So, yeah, like to do videos,

2614
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:03,700
to do videos like all around well,

2615
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:05,700
you got to be pretty good at analysis,

2616
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:06,700
you got to like understand writing,

2617
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:08,700
you got to understand like visual flow,

2618
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:10,700
you got to understand how to talk at least decently,

2619
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:13,700
you got to have the privilege to afford all the equipment,

2620
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:16,700
and yeah, you got to have like a thin array

2621
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:18,700
of like a little bit of skills in many different fields

2622
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:20,700
and if you don't have all of them, you're fucked.

2623
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:21,700
That's true, that's true.

2624
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,700
Yeah, this question,

2625
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:26,700
this question highlights to me why it's important

2626
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:30,700
not to like spend time like practicing to do a thing

2627
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:31,700
by doing other things

2628
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,700
and why the best practice for a thing is just to do it

2629
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:37,700
because like, yeah, whether it's videos or comics

2630
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:38,700
or anything you're wanting to do,

2631
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:42,700
like yeah, it takes a set of skills to do a task well

2632
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:45,700
and the only way you're going to like practice all of them

2633
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:47,700
in the proportions that you need to know them

2634
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,700
to get good at the particular thing

2635
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,700
is to do that thing

2636
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:53,700
because anything else is going to be imbalanced, you know?

2637
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:55,700
Like if you're trying to draw a comic

2638
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:57,700
and you just do like figure drawing,

2639
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:59,700
like maybe you'll get good at drawing figures,

2640
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,700
but like drawing comics, it involves more than that.

2641
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:03,700
It's all about framing, about dialogue and pacing.

2642
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,700
Like you're never going to be the best artist

2643
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:08,700
because there's a thousand best artists.

2644
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:10,700
So like if you want to be the best of something,

2645
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:12,700
come up with an all new combination

2646
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,700
that no one's even heard of.

2647
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,700
So I would say the best thing to do is specialize.

2648
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:20,700
Well, hey, is anyone?

2649
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:22,700
I can hear it, I can hear it.

2650
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:24,700
Okay, Davoo, cut out.

2651
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:27,700
The best thing that you should specialize in one thing

2652
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:30,700
and you should be, and thereby become good

2653
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:32,700
at all the things needed to do that one thing.

2654
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:35,700
But yeah, I think overall,

2655
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:37,700
like specializing in one thing is the most important

2656
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:40,700
because like you're only,

2657
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,700
that's what makes you stand out.

2658
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,700
You know, they say like do one thing and be the best at it.

2659
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:46,700
If you're doing all kinds of different things,

2660
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,700
you will never be the best at any of them.

2661
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:50,700
And being the best is what it takes, you know?

2662
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:53,700
Being the best at what you specifically are doing

2663
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:56,700
is what it takes to, you know, stand out.

2664
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:58,700
Agreed, agreed.

2665
01:51:58,700 --> 01:52:00,700
If you're doing, if you're mediocre

2666
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:02,700
at a bunch of different things, it's normal in case.

2667
01:52:02,700 --> 01:52:04,700
And when you say the best of a thing,

2668
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:05,700
a thing doesn't mean a whole medium.

2669
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:06,700
It can mean a whole genre.

2670
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:08,700
It can mean a very specific thing, you know?

2671
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:10,700
Like if you are, if you have the same amount

2672
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:12,700
of writing skills as a bunch of other people,

2673
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:17,700
but you happen to know a whole lot about fucking hepatitis B,

2674
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:21,700
then you could make the biggest, best hepatitis B novella series

2675
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:23,700
that anyone, that all the preteens

2676
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:25,700
are gonna go crazy for, right?

2677
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:27,700
That's exactly what I mean.

2678
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:29,700
Being the best at specifically the thing you're doing,

2679
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:31,700
like even if it's like something real narrow.

2680
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:34,700
You go on the internet, like here's my hepatitis B fucking OC.

2681
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:35,700
Do not steal.

2682
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:36,700
It's hepatitis B DC5.

2683
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:39,700
Yeah, and you know, like the small but dedicated

2684
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:42,700
hepatitis B fan base will go wild for it.

2685
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:43,700
And that's what you want.

2686
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:45,700
And your mascot, the hepatitis B,

2687
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:47,700
Buzz Buzz will, you know, be on the internet

2688
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:48,700
and take it by storm.

2689
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:49,700
It'll be great.

2690
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:50,700
Yeah.

2691
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:52,700
You'll be like, oh man, you sure are lame.

2692
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:54,700
What are you, a hepatitis C fan?

2693
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:57,700
Well, we're better than those people.

2694
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:59,700
Hey, here's a question that's totally relevant

2695
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:02,700
to our podcast here from the Twitter at

2696
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:05,700
M-I Cool Man, or Me Cool Man, says,

2697
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:08,700
how do I make cool internet friends like you guys?

2698
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:10,700
And the great thing I like about this

2699
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:13,700
is it's not a question of like, how do I become your friend?

2700
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,700
This man is looking to cultivate his own circle

2701
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:16,700
of internet friends.

2702
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,700
And I have advice for that.

2703
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:20,700
I would say the best thing to do is just

2704
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:23,700
find a community and get engaged with it

2705
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:26,700
and identify the people who, you know,

2706
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,700
are investing their own energy

2707
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:30,700
and providing value to that group

2708
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:33,700
and, you know, contribute to it in whatever way you can,

2709
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:36,700
be it like a content creator or otherwise.

2710
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:38,700
And identify the people who are worth your time.

2711
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:39,700
Hang out with them.

2712
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:40,700
Just talk with them.

2713
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:42,700
It's inevitable that you get to know them

2714
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,700
because you're both there investing your time

2715
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:45,700
in the thing that you're doing.

2716
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:46,700
And yeah.

2717
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,700
The PCP, the procrastinators,

2718
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:51,700
could not have been formed in any other environment

2719
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:53,700
but broneism.

2720
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:56,700
The MLP fandom like specifically facilitated

2721
01:53:56,700 --> 01:54:00,700
a sort of like, you know, hypothetical social structure

2722
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:03,700
of like people running around like sort of an ecosystem

2723
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:06,700
and there was this one little, one little like area

2724
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,700
where a very specific type of cream

2725
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:10,700
rose to a very specific type of top

2726
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,700
where it was the brone analysis scene

2727
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:15,700
where it was like there's just enough autism

2728
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:17,700
flying around, just enough creativity

2729
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:19,700
and just enough people who are lazy

2730
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:22,700
to create this giant like, this giant field of people

2731
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:25,700
who are idiots and bad, but like there was just enough

2732
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:27,700
people who were actually good

2733
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:30,700
that they were definitely going to find one another

2734
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:33,700
and hit it off really well through this highly relatable

2735
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:35,700
place that they're both in.

2736
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:36,700
Yeah, agreed.

2737
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:38,700
Yeah, that's the only way that the PCP could have been formed.

2738
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:40,700
Like everything with like the kind of art that we do

2739
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:42,700
all sort of being synchronized.

2740
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:44,700
We were sort of all on the same page for a period.

2741
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:46,700
I mean, I wasn't in it at the time, but I was following it

2742
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:49,700
during the pony era and doing some pony stuff myself.

2743
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:51,700
Like we sort of all got synchronized.

2744
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:53,700
We all sort of like understood one another and sort of like,

2745
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,700
yeah, we started similar projects in similar ways

2746
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:59,700
for similar reasons and all imbued in ourselves

2747
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:02,700
the extremely categorical elitism

2748
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:04,700
over like the people around us because that was

2749
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,700
what the brone analysis community was

2750
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:09,700
where there was this just giant swath of people

2751
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:11,700
who were utter shit to make you feel better

2752
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:12,700
and superior about yourself.

2753
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:14,700
And that's the attitude that we still have basically.

2754
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:17,700
It's such a stigma against feeling superior to people.

2755
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:19,700
But when you look at the landscape and you see that

2756
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:21,700
you really just are superior.

2757
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:24,700
Well, if that's not the right time to feel superior when it is.

2758
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:25,700
Oh yeah, believe me.

2759
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:27,700
If you're doing an art specifically something that you're like

2760
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:29,700
it's like a new project, something you've never done before

2761
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,700
and you might be really insecure about it.

2762
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:32,700
You don't know if you're going to do good.

2763
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:35,700
You know, obviously you need to like look up to those people

2764
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:37,700
who have done it better than you're ever going to do

2765
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,700
as like inspiration and like motivation

2766
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:42,700
and like showing what you have to do to be successful.

2767
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:44,700
But when you're actually in the trenches working on it

2768
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,700
chipping away at the project, it's perfectly fine

2769
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:49,700
to spend 90% of your time like dwelling over and over again

2770
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:52,700
about all the people who are worse than you'll ever be.

2771
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:54,700
To tell yourself no matter how much you fuck it up

2772
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:56,700
you're not going to be as bad as them.

2773
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:00,700
It's a beautiful thing.

2774
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:02,700
I see another question I want to answer.

2775
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:03,700
Sure.

2776
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:06,700
From at underscore swagdude underscore

2777
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:09,700
favorite black fictional character.

2778
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:11,700
And I just was excited to see this question

2779
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:13,700
because I definitely have an answer

2780
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:17,700
and it is the guy with the afro in chromarty high.

2781
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:19,700
Oh, he's like...

2782
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:20,700
I guess he's black.

2783
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:22,700
He's totally black.

2784
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:26,700
I mean, there's a lot of indicators but he's not like that dark skin.

2785
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,700
You know, he's really not.

2786
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:29,700
He's just fucking looking at him.

2787
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:31,700
He's definitely a black guy.

2788
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,700
That's definitely what they're going for.

2789
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:35,700
Well, yeah, exactly.

2790
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,700
And he's great and the fact that he's great

2791
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,700
doesn't have anything to do with him being black

2792
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:41,700
but he happens to be.

2793
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:43,700
And I fucking love chromarty high

2794
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:47,700
and he is my favorite dude from that show.

2795
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:50,700
I might be forgetting someone else right now

2796
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,700
but the one that I really think of is princess tiata

2797
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:53,700
from princess and the frog.

2798
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,700
I legitimately love that character.

2799
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:58,700
I think she's fantastic and she's also hot as hell.

2800
01:56:58,700 --> 01:56:59,700
So there you go.

2801
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:01,700
My favorite is Nino.

2802
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:07,700
I think the best black character is

2803
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:09,700
Bobobo Bobobo from this anime

2804
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:11,700
called...

2805
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:19,700
If Bobobo is black, then this guy from

2806
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,700
Chromarty High is definitely...

2807
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:23,700
Because they basically look like the same...

2808
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:25,700
Bobobo has a giant blonde afro.

2809
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:27,700
This guy's got a giant regular afro.

2810
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:29,700
If he has an afro, he's fucking black.

2811
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,700
What is Nino talking about?

2812
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:33,700
I cannot believe you have not seen Chromarty High.

2813
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:34,700
You should absolutely watch it.

2814
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:36,700
It's one of my favorite shows of all time.

2815
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:38,700
Okay.

2816
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:40,700
What about you, Mage?

2817
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:42,700
I was thinking...

2818
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:45,700
I haven't watched much of videos lately.

2819
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:46,700
Uh-oh.

2820
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:47,700
Uh-oh.

2821
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:48,700
We've got...

2822
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:50,700
No, no, wait.

2823
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:52,700
Is it Jamal from black.com?

2824
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:54,700
No.

2825
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:57,700
I never finished, but I should probably get on that.

2826
01:57:57,700 --> 01:57:59,700
What's it called again?

2827
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:01,700
The show...

2828
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:03,700
Young Justice. There we go.

2829
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:05,700
Aqualad or whatever.

2830
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:07,700
Yeah, he was cool. I like that.

2831
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:08,700
Wait, he can swim?

2832
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:09,700
I never liked him.

2833
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:11,700
He was shitty and not cool.

2834
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:13,700
I'm sorry, I don't mean to undercut your choice.

2835
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:17,700
Okay, other questions?

2836
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:19,700
No, no more fucking questions.

2837
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:21,700
I don't pay two hours.

2838
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:22,700
Fair enough.

2839
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:23,700
I want more.

2840
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:24,700
Now we're done.

2841
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:26,700
We don't get paid more if we make the episode longer.

2842
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:27,700
Davoo?

2843
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:28,700
Davoo?

2844
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:31,700
If you want more, talk less during the episode.

2845
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,700
Okay, so thanks for listening, everybody.

2846
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:36,700
Remember, send us more questions.

01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:37,700
Hashtag AskPCP.

2848
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:39,700
Those are the questions that we just answered on the Twitter.

2849
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:40,700
Or become a patron.

2850
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:42,700
Ask questions there.

2851
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:43,700
We're there all the time.

2852
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:44,700
All the PCB guys hang out there.

2853
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:48,700
And if you're a $5 patron, you get access to all the bonus PCP episodes.

2854
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:50,700
We have got six already done, I think.

2855
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:52,700
And we've already got the next one recorded.

2856
01:58:52,700 --> 01:58:55,700
It'll be out in like a day after this comes out, I think.

2857
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:56,700
So it'll be right around the corner.

2858
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:57,700
Which one was that one?

2859
01:58:57,700 --> 01:58:58,700
What's the new bonus?

2860
01:58:58,700 --> 01:58:59,700
Shit, what was it?

2861
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:01,700
Oh, it's our one on ASMR.

2862
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:03,700
We go deep on ASMR, everybody.

2863
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:07,700
I really want everyone to experience that one.

2864
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:10,700
Your bones will experience their fucking reverberations

2865
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:13,700
of the deep tingles you experienced from that episode.

2866
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:15,700
It's gonna be fucking intense.

2867
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:16,700
And hey, there's merch as well.

2875

Bye!

2876
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:35,700
