00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,560
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,920
We are back again to talk about cool things that we like because we have the ability to

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
do so.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,280
I am the best guy ever, and I'm joined today by Hippocrit.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,040
Yes, I got alcohol today.

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Good job.

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,920
We've got Lethal Aurora Mage.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,880
I did not get any water, I'm sad.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Seen Agua.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
I think that was Italian.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,640
Anyway, Mumkey Jones.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,160
I already have to pee.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,560
I still need a bigger hard drive for my PS4.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,960
That's my most pressing concern right now.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,440
We all had liquid things, and you had a PS4 thing, you broke it.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,640
It's turning my brain to liquid distress, knowing I only have 80 gigs left on my hard

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
drive.

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,440
It's a problem.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,560
So our topic for today is, as it's the end of the year, we're going to talk about all

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,200
the celebrities who died in Toy Shots.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
No, we're not doing that.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
We're not doing that.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
They deserved it.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
They deserved it.

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,280
Those alt-right fucks.

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,000
No, we're going to talk about what we're looking forward to in 2017, and our goals.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm thinking about specific goals.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,220
I got plans for 2017.

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,320
I'm going to make that year my bitch, and it's going to be good.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,000
But before we get into that, just one little piece of news from the 2016 year I would like

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,040
to announce that we have officially brought into the fold of the procrastinators, Monkey

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,160
Jones is now an official PCP TPC guy round of applause.

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Yay!

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
I did it.

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
I was autistic enough.

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Yeah, you did.

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Just barely.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Yo.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Just barely.

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,560
I hope one day I can reach the levels of autism that the rest of you aspire to.

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,640
Well, you've got a couple of children's cartoons to make your way through before you get to

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
that point.

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
That's true.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,840
So who's got some resolutions that they want to shoot out?

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Not fucking resolutions.

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm talking about goals.

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Resolutions are for the queers.

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
That's true.

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm talking about action plans.

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
You know?

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Action drafts.

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
That's what I'm all about.

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Action draft.

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
He's my coach.

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
He's my life coach, actually.

56
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Well.

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
And he's keeping me on track.

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
I have a couple plans.

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
A couple different plans.

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Sure.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Let's hear them.

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Obviously, there's Radcon, which is going to be fun, and there's going to be-

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
One week, baby.

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
One week.

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Oh, shit.

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Yeah.

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Oh, fuck.

68
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,040
I should probably tell somebody that I'm leaving this day.

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
That's true.

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Me, too.

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Nobody knows.

72
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Well, yeah, there's Radcon.

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Nobody knows what it's like to go to Radcon.

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Okay, I'm sorry.

75
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Except for all of us.

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Except for us.

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Except for us.

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
I think you're all antagonizing me.

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Oh, no.

80
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Paige, we love you.

82
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
You got so much help, Paige.

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
You're not going either.

84
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
We'll have Radcon.

85
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Oh, true.

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
London at some point.

87
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Yeah.

88
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Oh, man.

89
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,440
If we could get another Kickstarter thing going on, to fly us out to London like the

90
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,240
K-On! Girls, and we can go on a fucking tour, how fucking ill would that be?

91
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
That would be so cool.

92
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I mean, did you-

93
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
I feel like you could probably pull it off.

94
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
He made this happen, which is beyond what I expected.

95
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Yeah, man.

96
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Clearly, his fans are as gullible as they are rich.

97
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Yeah, fuck you guys.

98
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Okay, anyway.

99
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm sorry, Gib.

100
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Let's hear your shit.

101
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,440
But for personal stuff, I have-

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,440
I made a tweet that I wanted to get a bunch of things started.

103
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,140
I want to start, you know, I don't expect to finish all these things, but I expect to

104
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:03,440
at least manage to start writing a novel, developing a game, making an album, and something

105
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
else, making a comic.

106
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
I don't know.

107
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Please tell me it's a rock opera.

108
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
I want to start all those things, and that is-

109
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Okay.

110
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,440
That is my overall goal is to begin them all.

111
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,940
What were you saying, Momkey?

112
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,140
I said, please tell me it's a rock opera that you want to make.

113
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,140
It is probably going to be a rock album, because that's the music I like.

114
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,140
There could be an opera in that.

115
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,140
Rock opera is the best genre.

116
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,140
Comedy rock's good, too.

117
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:35,140
Because I can't really do serious singing, so that'll be-

118
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,140
We're just living in a generation immersed in irony all the time.

119
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,140
I can't be serious anymore.

120
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,140
It's real hard.

121
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,140
It's real bad.

122
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,140
We've lost the ability to be sincere.

123
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,140
That's our coping mechanism for the bullshit that we have to put up with.

124
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,140
None of it's real.

125
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,140
None of it matters.

126
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,140
Let's just-

127
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,140
We're all going to die someday.

128
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Yeah, we're all going to die.

129
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,140
They used to go out and kill their enemies, but our only resource now is to just sink

130
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
into irony and just-

131
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,140
Our only resource now is memes.

132
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,140
Yeah, that's what we've got left.

133
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,140
These are the weapons our fathers gifted to us.

134
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,140
The only thing we're killing is our future as a goddamn millennia.

135
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
Oh, such depression.

136
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
Here we come, 2017.

137
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,140
Such edgy depressness.

138
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Hey, Bo, do you have any goals for your YouTube channel?

139
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,140
Yes, I want to get to a point while I'm thinking of doing all these other things.

140
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
I want to-

141
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Obviously, I want to finish the Rayman video, and I want to do Ratchet and Clank 2 review.

142
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:44,140
But I have a goal that I don't know whether I'll actually get there by the end of 2016,

143
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,140
but I'll be working towards it the whole year, is just making it so that I always have a

144
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,140
video coming up the next week.

145
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,140
So whether it's a miniscule review or a big review or a GRPJ, I want something to be coming

146
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:02,140
out the week, you know, before, you know, just scheduled a bunch of shit so that I never

147
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,140
have to be like, oh shit, I got to make something in two days or else I'm fucked.

148
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Backlog dream goal, that's it.

149
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:18,140
Now, do you see that as- I mean, I don't mean to be critical about it.

150
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,140
Do you see that as like a dream goal, or is this something that you have a plan to achieve?

151
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,140
Well, I say it's a dream goal, but it is a plan.

152
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,140
I'm going to work towards doing that.

153
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
That's why I say it's a plan for the next year.

154
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,140
My dream goal is to be rich and have no problems at all.

155
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,140
But, you know, I can't do that next year.

156
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,140
That'll be like 2019.

157
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,140
Well, that's- 2019 is really weird to say.

158
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,140
I don't like it.

159
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
2019?

160
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,140
Just think a few years ago, 2017 was weird to say.

161
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,140
I don't know, 2017 sort of rolls over.

162
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,140
2019 sounds like you're counting down.

163
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,140
It was going to be fun to say 2020 though.

164
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,140
Yes, I'll be looking forward to that.

165
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,140
Oh man, everyone's going to be seeing real clearly that.

166
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
No, I knew somebody would say that.

167
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,140
I made a tweet about how everybody is going to be saying,

168
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,140
I have 2020 vision or some sort of joke like that.

169
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Oh yeah, that's the one.

170
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:15,140
I've got 2020 vision for when we get that fucking racist massages

171
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
Trump out of office, if you know what I'm saying.

172
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,140
But like, no, the joke was like,

173
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,140
people every single day in 2020 will be saying,

174
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,140
like if someone asks them,

175
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,140
hey, when do we do the thing or what's happening tomorrow?

176
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,140
They say, gee, guys, I don't have 2020 vision.

177
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,140
They ask me if what's happening right now?

178
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,140
Gee, it's stupid and it's going to happen.

179
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,140
I'm probably going to have to get glasses in the next couple of weeks.

180
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,140
I need to get my eyes checked, so I can't wait for that to happen.

181
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,140
And then I'm just like, no, I don't have 2020 vision.

182
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Look at my fucking face.

183
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
Fuck you.

184
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,140
Get that joke out of here.

185
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,140
It's racist.

186
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,140
You know, I need new glasses too.

187
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,140
Ever since Radcon won, actually at Radcon,

188
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,140
I like dropped my glasses that I wear occasionally

189
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,140
and I broke like a half of them.

190
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,140
And then sometime later, the other half broke.

191
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,140
So now I've just, I've been wearing taped glasses on both side.

192
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,140
I'm wearing them right now.

193
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,140
They just, they look like a fucking idiot.

194
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,140
And also, you guys probably don't know this.

195
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,140
I only learned this as I was experiencing it.

196
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,140
If you wear glasses, they probably have little rubber things

197
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
on the parts that go up over your ear.

198
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,140
If those fell off, as they have on both sides of my head now,

199
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,140
like there's nothing to hold the glasses kind of to your head.

200
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,140
And every time you move, they fly off your fucking face.

201
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
I'm wearing the most ghetto glasses of all time.

202
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,140
Okay, I don't need to get into a whole big thing about my glasses.

203
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,140
I need new ones.

204
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,140
My glasses.

205
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Give, I had one more question about your plan.

206
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,140
And it was that I noticed that you said you wanted to start those various projects.

207
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,140
I was wondering if you had any kind of timeframe for when you were going to finish them.

208
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,140
Because I really don't enjoy having multiple projects running at once.

209
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,140
And what if that would be a challenge?

210
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:58,140
Starting them, you know what they say, like, it's easy to talk about,

211
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,140
you know, talk a big game, but never do anything.

212
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,140
If I have the projects begun, I can always say,

213
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:09,140
well, I tried, you know, and I want to have at least like a first draft

214
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
of a terrible story by the end of the year.

215
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,140
You know, nothing that I could put out,

216
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,140
maybe like half the story done.

217
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,140
You know, just get up to like DigiBro level writing

218
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,140
and you'll be pretty, you know, that's not acceptable,

219
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
but it's getting there, you're getting there.

220
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,140
Yeah.

221
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,140
And for the comic, I don't know, maybe draw a couple pages.

222
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,140
I don't really expect to do the comic, actually.

223
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,140
Comics are hard.

224
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
Oh, yes.

225
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,140
I was thinking that'd be like the one you're most likely to do.

226
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,140
Yeah, how hard could it be if Ben Seed does it?

227
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,140
Well, if I made the art deliberately not very intensive,

228
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,140
I guess I could do a comic.

229
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,140
It's just that drawing a square and then putting something in it

230
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
is always really annoying to me.

231
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,140
I don't know how big to draw the square.

232
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,140
I don't know what shape it should be.

233
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,140
So I would rather just draw everything in the same size square,

234
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,140
but then that doesn't look good on a page.

235
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,140
It's like, how do you, how do you do it?

236
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
I should just do a home stock.

237
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
This is my life hack to you for when I was doing comics.

238
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,140
You draw all the art and then you put it in panels afterwards.

239
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,140
That's interesting.

240
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,140
That's how I did all my comic pages like back in the day.

241
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
What program did you use to draw?

242
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
Um.

243
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
MS Paint.

244
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
That's the best program.

245
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,140
I used to draw it on it all the time and that's no joke.

246
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
But before I had internet.

247
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,140
That's how you get pro.

248
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
That's true.

249
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,140
But seriously, what program did you use?

250
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Um, I was using Art Rage and Manga Studio.

251
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
I kind of jumped back and forth between both.

252
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,140
Art Rage.

253
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,140
I know it's so cringy, but it's good.

254
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
It's awesome.

255
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
I'm not cringing.

256
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,140
I'm loving it.

257
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,140
I want to get that shit.

258
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Gib, did you have any other shit to say about your plans?

259
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,140
Or can we move on to someone who's actually interesting?

260
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,140
Whoa!

261
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,140
Got him!

262
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,140
We're all just going to talk about it.

263
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,140
We're just going to grind through all this shit and get all that stuff done.

264
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,140
We're just going to sit here jerking it all through 2017.

265
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,140
That'd be good.

266
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
I hope so.

267
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,140
I mean, let's get to my goals.

268
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Jerking it.

269
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
That's my plan.

270
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,140
It's not even a goal.

271
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,140
I accomplished that with flying colors throughout 2016.

272
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
Yeah.

273
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Yeah.

274
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,140
Just one color, though.

275
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,140
Just one flying color.

276
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,140
All the colors of the rainbow at once.

277
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,140
Oh, no.

278
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,140
I mean, with me, there's a little bit of red in there as well, you know, so it's, uh...

279
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,140
I'm sorry, Mage.

280
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,140
Help.

281
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,140
Why are you sorry?

282
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
I'll be your doctor.

283
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
Why are you sorry to me specifically?

284
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
I don't know.

285
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,140
Because he's a fucking beside who thinks you're a weak woman.

286
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
What are you saying?

287
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,140
You're saying you're a weak woman, Tom.

288
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,140
You're a bad person.

289
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,140
I mean, yeah, I am a bad person.

290
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
It's fine.

291
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Oh, no.

292
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,140
Tom is a good person.

293
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Oh, God.

294
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,140
We're off the fucking rails.

295
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
What's...

296
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,140
Gabe, I'm sorry.

297
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,140
Were you done?

298
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Was there anything else?

299
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,140
If I was going to say something, I forgot it, so forget it.

300
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
Okay.

301
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
You can bring it up later anyway.

302
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,140
Gabe, I think your resolution should be to tell Nate and myself when we cut you off

303
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,140
to just shut the fuck up when we do the show.

304
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,140
That's a good goal.

305
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,140
That is a good goal.

306
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,140
That is a good goal.

307
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
Shut up, Nate.

308
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Thank you.

309
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
You asshole.

310
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,140
There we go.

311
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,140
There we go.

312
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,140
Oh, it's only 2016.

313
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,140
It doesn't count.

314
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,140
That's true.

315
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,140
You can't do it yet.

316
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
You can't do it yet.

317
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
Just get in practice.

318
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,140
It's fine.

319
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
How about you, Tom?

320
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
What are your goals for 2017?

321
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,140
I have a few, I guess.

322
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,580
So I want to start writing my book.

323
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,140
I've already started writing some stuff for it.

324
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,140
Good.

325
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:41,140
I'm hopefully going to put the first part out in the next three or four days, I think.

326
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,140
Wow.

327
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
All right.

328
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,140
How long is it going to be?

329
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
Well, it's combined.

330
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,140
I think it's just under 20,000 words because there's a prologue and then the first part.

331
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,140
It's pretty fucking good.

332
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,140
I dropped both of those at the same time.

333
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,140
And then I want to do another part every two months.

334
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,140
So like six releases throughout next year, that's kind of the goal for that.

335
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,140
That's how Moby Dick was written.

336
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Oh, really?

337
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,140
Yeah, it was like every fucking month he would release another 5,000 words or whatever the

338
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,140
hell.

339
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Same shit with...

340
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,140
It was a little different, but fucking Christmas, fucking Charles Dickens, whatever the fuck.

341
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
Christmas story.

342
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,140
Christmas Carol?

343
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,140
No, not like...

344
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Yeah, damn.

345
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
A Christmas Carol, yeah.

346
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
He was paid by the word.

347
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
What a champ.

348
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,140
He is a champ.

349
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
I'm sorry.

350
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
So what else?

351
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
That's exciting.

352
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
I'm looking forward to that.

353
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,640
Yeah, so that'll hopefully start in a few days.

354
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,640
I'm going to update the website to go with it.

355
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,640
I'm going to try and get more healthy, because my eating habits this year have been atrocious.

356
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Like, there's a very normie goal, but I mean...

357
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
What's wrong with that?

358
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Have you been not eating or just eating?

359
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I mean, I'm so poor.

360
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,640
It's like, I could try and buy good food, but you know, Doritos are five for five dollars

361
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
right now, so that's just my life.

362
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Play a bag of rice, dog.

363
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Big ol' bag of rice.

364
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Yeah, I've actually started doing intermittent fasting.

365
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Why didn't you go full weave and make rice balls?

366
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
I mean, I could.

367
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Jelly filled doughnuts.

368
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Yeah.

369
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
I mean, I got...

370
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,640
I'm just going to eat nothing but jelly doughnuts all next year.

371
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Dude, why are you doing intermittent fasting?

372
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
You're already a skinny boy.

373
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
What's the deal?

374
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Well, it's because usually I have this bad habit of I'll eat like one or two meals,

375
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,640
and then like right before bed, I'll just engorge on more stuff because I'm bored.

376
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
So I'm kind of like trying to force myself not to do that,

377
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
because that's like the worst time to eat stuff.

378
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
And it's definitely like...

379
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Hey, you know, I actually...

380
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I was reading about that.

381
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
It's that there's...

382
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,640
Let's just say at best there's inconclusive evidence that eating right before sleeping

383
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,640
actually contributes to, you know, like fat gain or anything.

384
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I feel like...

385
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I'm just saying...

386
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,640
My personal experience and looking at my scale tells me that there's definitely some sort

387
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,640
of at least personal biological correlation.

388
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
All right, fair enough.

389
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,140
It makes kind of sense though, especially like if what you eat before bed is something

390
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,640
like sweet and sugary and stuff, and that's really bad.

391
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Okay, we're talking about how like we feel that our bodies are doing it as opposed to

392
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
the statistics.

393
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
I'm just saying let's...

394
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Well, statistically, if you only eat eight hours a day and you're fasting for 16, your

395
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,640
body goes into ketosis longer and burns your fat reserves, and that's my mindset behind

396
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
doing intermittent fasting.

397
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Okay, okay.

398
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,640
So you eat within an eight hour window, and then 16 hours, eight hours being awake, and

399
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
then eight hours while asleep.

400
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Ideally, your body's not eating anything, and it's just burning your reserves.

401
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
That's the idea behind that.

402
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Yeah, okay, all right.

403
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:47,640
I also read that you're supposed to eat sweets before the actual dinner, because sweets are

404
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,640
easily stored in the body and they become fat, but if you eat them first, they're going

405
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:59,640
to be used up, the energy, and your body can just digest the food at its normal pace.

406
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,640
So my mom's wrong this whole time, and you are supposed to have dessert first.

407
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Yeah, but the thing is, I think the reason people would say like, oh, you have to have

408
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,640
dessert last is so that little kids wouldn't ruin their appetite, because yeah, you should

409
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,640
eat the sweets first, but if you have nothing but sweets, that's also not good, you know?

410
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,640
And when you're growing up, you might want to eat a lot of sweets, and then you don't

411
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,640
feel like actually having the nice healthy dinner afterwards.

412
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,640
So they're making sure that you eat the normal good food first before you eat any sweets.

413
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
True, sir.

414
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Kids are very stupid.

415
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
That's true.

416
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Then again, so am I, because I'm still a man-child.

417
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Okay, so beyond your dieting goals, what else you got?

418
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
I might finally quit YouTube.

419
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Who knows?

420
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
That's definitely in the cards.

421
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Whoa.

422
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Yeah.

423
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Why would you do that?

424
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Because I hate YouTube.

425
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,640
It's like, it's a painful process.

426
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,140
I'm not going to start making things.

427
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,400
I might just like start blogging and just say, fuck YouTube, it's dumb, because I don't make

428
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,840
any Patreon money anymore like you guys do.

429
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:08,080
I make very little, but I found the most money that I've made online has been this month,

430
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,920
and this is a bad month, but through Amazon affiliate links, I've made more money this

431
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,920
month through that, then working my job, then Patreon, anything.

432
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Wow, that's pretty good.

433
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.

434
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,920
I mean, it's the holiday season, so I guess that's probably why.

435
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Oh, true, true.

436
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
There's tablet things.

437
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,920
You sure you're not going to keep doing those, at least?

438
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Well, I would, but nobody sends and responds to my emails anymore, so I can't get any.

439
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Otherwise I'd still be doing them, but I keep, like there's two good ones that came out the

440
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
last like couple months.

441
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I've been emailing both companies since October to be like, hey, gimme, and they're just like,

442
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,800
we're not responding to you, but they're not responding to anybody.

443
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,420
Nobody has any of these new tablets, so I get comments every day.

444
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
See, that's interesting.

445
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,420
Review this one, and nobody can, because nobody will give them away anymore.

446
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,360
It's like, well, now you got to buy them, and I'm just like, no, I don't.

447
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm just not going to do it, so no one will buy them.

448
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
You fools.

449
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
I don't know.

450
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,920
I've been doing a lot of research on actual blogging, and apparently people can still

451
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,920
make money doing that, and that's kind of cool, and that takes less effort.

452
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
I think YouTube is a clusterfuck anyways.

453
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,420
It's like turning into this not bad environment, but there's just a lot of bullshit going on

454
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,920
with YouTube right now in general that I'm not a huge fan of.

455
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
You ain't wrong about that.

456
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
I did a couple videos the last couple weeks talking about, like,

457
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,920
how YouTube's a clusterfuck, and then how YouTube alternatives that people are talking

458
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,920
about aren't going to work, and then the third one's going to be like the social network

459
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,920
that fixes it all, and I still haven't finished all the prep for it, but that'll hopefully

460
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
be going up in a couple days.

461
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I might still just use YouTube for vlogs and supplemental content to boost the actual

462
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,920
blog, like do little videos here and there, but I can definitely, I can do more with

463
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
writing anyways, so I'm better at writing than anything else.

464
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Maybe you could make live streams of videos.

465
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,920
You're self-typing the blog posts.

466
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Let's do a Let's Type.

467
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
It's so good.

468
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
That's a great idea.

469
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Let's blog.

470
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Let's blog.

471
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Yeah.

472
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Yeah.

473
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Watch me sit here.

474
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
So some major changes are coming for Tom Oliver, potentially.

475
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Potentially.

476
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,920
I mean, it's kind of like one of those things I'm probably going to play with a bit and

477
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,920
see if it works, because if it's a dead end and I can't get anything out of there, then

478
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
I'm like, ah, fuck it.

479
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I'm also possibly starting a new YouTube project, though, that I think would only work on YouTube,

480
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
because it's going to be another kind of review project.

481
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,920
I've mentioned it to you guys a little bit late to the party.

482
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Late to the boy.

483
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Oh, yeah.

484
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Which sounded like a great idea, and we all liked it.

485
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,920
I mean, you know, if it makes sense economically, of course.

486
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:54,920
I mean, it seems like it wouldn't be too much of a burden to do, so I might try and shoot

487
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,920
for doing that for next year.

488
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,920
The reason I haven't started it yet is because my friend Ashley, she was going to do all the

489
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
editing because, like, fuck editing.

490
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Oh, wow.

491
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Okay, cool.

492
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,920
But then we were talking, and she's like, well, maybe I could do more than editing because

493
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
I kind of want to be in that.

494
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,920
I'm like, well, I don't know what you're like on camera, so we have to practice that and

495
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
see if we can get a good dynamic going.

496
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
And she hasn't gotten back to me on that.

497
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,920
That sounds like she just wants to be a YouTuber, but she doesn't have the confidence yet.

498
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
I don't really know.

499
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
She's trying to suck you off, dude, and not in the good way.

500
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
She's trying to lead you.

501
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Oh, my God, did not intend to come out that way.

502
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Dude, watch out.

503
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
That girl's trying to suck you off.

504
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Get the fuck out of there.

505
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I think I'll stay right here.

506
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
I'm sorry.

507
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
No.

508
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I don't really know.

509
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,920
I mean, so depending on how that all goes, because we've been talking about, like, possibly

510
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,920
like, moving in and getting in place with her and our other mutual friends.

511
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,920
That's kind of why that conversation started.

512
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,920
But that might be delayed because I have to move out by August because that's something

513
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,920
big is going to change some of 2017 is I'm going to be losing my house.

514
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
Oh, yeah.

515
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Wow.

516
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Okay.

517
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
That's a change.

518
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Yeah.

519
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
So I'm going to try and find a place to live.

520
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,920
So that's something I'm going to start working towards probably in the next week or so,

521
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,920
like, trying to get another second job so I can save up money to get out of here.

522
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Oh, man.

523
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Such a real person tongue.

524
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
It fucking sucks, dude.

525
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Being a real person, it makes you want to die.

526
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Yeah, but I mean, yeah, but it just makes me feel like such a sheltered little baby boy

527
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,920
when I'm like, oh, yeah, I can just live with my parents for a couple of years.

528
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
It's fine.

529
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
I mean, I've already done that.

530
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I've been here since like 2012.

531
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,920
So I've paid my dues.

532
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
I'm just an older man.

533
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,920
So like I'm coming up on 30 and it's like, maybe it's time to stop being a little bitch

534
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,920
and be a real man and maybe I don't know if I can do it.

535
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,920
We're going to try and we'll see what happens.

536
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,920
That's another reason why I might have to just stop doing YouTube because like if I'm

537
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,920
like busting my ass like 60 hours a week and like possibly moving to like a shitty apartment

538
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,920
and it's like, oh, check out my awesome studio in the crack house down in, you know, wherever

539
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
the fuck I end up.

540
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
So I don't know.

541
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,920
It's going to be things are going to get super fucking different for me personally this year

542
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
or next year, depending on how you want to look at it, depending on when you're listening to this.

543
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
You have like a couple hours left of me saying this year.

544
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Yeah, maybe did you will get it up instantly?

545
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
We'll say.

546
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Sounded like he was busy with other shit tonight.

547
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
That's true.

548
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
He's busy getting drunk.

549
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
It's New Year's Eve.

550
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Oh, did you have problems getting it up?

551
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Here it is, folks.

552
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
I do have some bad news, everybody.

553
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Oh, monkey's dead.

554
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,920
I just looked it up and I think I was wrong about Moby Dick being serialized.

555
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Oh, no.

556
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,920
It's been bothering me for about 10 minutes now.

557
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Well, isn't it like a super old book?

558
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
How would they?

559
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
How would that function?

560
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
It's from like 1851, I think.

561
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Yeah.

562
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,920
And I thought King Critic got exposed for a hack today, but it turns out Monkey Jones.

563
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
That was pretty good.

564
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,920
I didn't know what you're talking about.

565
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Check out Monkey Jones, too.

566
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Some hot guys.

567
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Okay.

568
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Well, Tom, we are all excited and slightly concerned to see how things work out.

569
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
I'll let you know how I'm doing for my hardcore boss.

570
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm sure we'll be in touch.

571
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
If all else.

572
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Yeah.

573
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Guys, go help Tom out, patreon.com.

574
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Yeah, we'll make sure the money gets around, you know.

575
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Mage, why don't you tell us what your plans are for the coming year?

576
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,920
You're a mysterious entity and the procrastinators.

577
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
No one knows.

578
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Yeah.

579
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Not even you.

580
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Yeah, exactly.

581
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
I was just about to say that.

582
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm living in a constant limbo.

583
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
I don't know what happened in the past.

584
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
I don't know what's going to happen in the future.

585
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
What am I doing now?

586
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
What is this?

587
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Well, how do you not know what happens in the past?

588
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
She doesn't read the newspapers.

589
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
I forget.

590
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
I have such a bad memory.

591
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm not just trying to be cute here.

592
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,920
I really do have really poor memory.

593
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
Oh, you can't help it, Mage.

594
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
You just can't help it.

595
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Now can you?

596
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Shadam.

597
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Got him.

598
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Anyway, I am going to try and fix up my health and stuff.

599
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,920
I've had a big scare recently with my health.

600
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
It was terrible.

601
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
I'm going to test.

602
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm going to still have a stomach ultrasound soon.

603
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
That's called being pregnant.

604
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
No.

605
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
No, no, no.

606
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Stomach.

607
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
It's a natural process, Mage.

608
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
It's in the stomach.

609
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Yeah, when you're pregnant, the baby's in your tummy.

610
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Stomach and tummy are two different things.

611
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
No, it's in your tummy.

612
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
My mommy told me so.

613
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Stomach ultrasound.

614
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Are you calling mom key a liar?

615
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Guys, no.

616
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
You're on thin ice, Mage.

617
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Be careful.

618
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Don't even joke about it.

619
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,920
I don't want any kids.

620
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,920
That's like the worst joke I've ever had.

621
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,920
If you weren't slinging that thing around town, Mage, you wouldn't need to worry about it so much.

622
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:21,920
What, does she have like a three-foot clit or something?

623
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Oh, God, why?

624
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
That's a mystery for the ages.

625
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Guys, you're all gross.

626
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
You're all bad.

627
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
This is why I was apologizing earlier.

628
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
This is my PCP.

629
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
I'm kicking you all out.

630
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Goodbye.

631
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
All right.

632
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
All right.

633
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
It's time for the Mage cast.

634
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
Okay, Mage.

635
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,920
But seriously, yeah, I'm going to fix my health up.

636
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,920
I was going to go to like some sort of health camp or whatever my mom was talking about it.

637
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Me going there.

638
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Health camp.

639
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Yeah, health camp.

640
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
I'm going to starve myself for 10 days.

641
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Starve yourself?

642
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Is it a fat camp?

643
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Are you going to fat camp?

644
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
No, no, no.

645
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Okay.

646
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
All right.

647
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
To get stuff in order and stuff.

648
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Oh, I see.

649
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Yeah.

650
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,920
So I'll be needing to save up some months.

651
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,920
My mom said she would cover some of it, but she can't anymore because she has to have laser

652
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
eye surgery for both eyes.

653
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Oh, wow.

654
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Best news to find out on Christmas.

655
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
She's going to have laser eyes?

656
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Yes.

657
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
She's getting them installed, dude.

658
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Yeah.

659
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
My mom is going to be the best.

660
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Very important.

661
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
Yeah.

662
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Did you say you're going to starve yourself?

663
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
No, I'm not going to starve myself.

664
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
I'm going to go to this.

665
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Constantly interrupting you.

666
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Yes, exactly.

667
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,920
No, I just need questions for clarification.

668
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
That's what she said.

669
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Well, I'm going to go to this camp and they're going to like strictly regulate what I'm eating

670
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,920
and what I'm doing with myself for the 10 days and whatever it's like.

671
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,920
I'm just saying it sounds like fat camp.

672
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
That's all I'm saying.

673
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
That's all I'm saying, guys.

674
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Yeah.

675
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,920
I was going to say if you need to starve yourself, you can do it for free by going to Tom Oliver's

676
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
house.

677
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:59,920
I'll have you know that my pantry is packed to the brim with choice ramen, all right?

678
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
I've got all kinds of flavors.

679
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Whatever you want.

680
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
I'll hook you up.

681
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
All the cardboard you can eat will be available.

682
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,920
I can eat that for Tom, guys.

683
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
I do too.

684
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Patreon.com slash Ben St.

685
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,920
But yeah, I need to say up for whatever that camp thing, whatever it is.

686
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,920
My mom told me about it and like they all speak in Russian, so I have to go with her

687
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
because I don't speak a look of Russian.

688
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Sometimes.

689
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Does the name of this contain the word gulag at all?

690
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,920
You know, just wondering.

691
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
No, no.

692
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,920
It's actually in Latvia, but they all speak Russian because I don't know.

693
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,920
They probably speak Latvian too, but my mom can speak Russian, so there we go.

694
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Oh, that's cool.

695
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Yeah.

696
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,920
I would have spoken Russian too, but then at a young age, I decided to not.

697
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
So I don't speak Russian.

698
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Oh, really?

699
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
You made a choice not to?

700
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Yeah, well, yeah.

701
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,920
In school, you could have chosen like a third language.

702
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
The first one was Lithuanian.

703
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Third language?

704
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Yeah, first is Lithuanian, second was English, both mandatory, and then you had a choice.

705
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
What's the first one?

706
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Lithuanian.

707
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Lithuanian dog.

708
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
She's from Lithuania.

709
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Yeah.

710
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
What the fuck is that?

711
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Eastern Europe.

712
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
It's a European country.

713
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
Can you speak that language for me right now?

714
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Oh, my dick is rock hard.

715
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Yeah, dog.

716
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Oh my god.

717
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
But yeah.

718
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,920
I legitimately forget sometimes that languages besides English and Japanese exist.

719
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,920
That's how much fucking disgusting we buy them.

720
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Yeah, we had a choice between Russian, French, and German, and I already spoke a little bit

721
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
of German, so I went with German.

722
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
That's cool.

723
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
How's your German then?

724
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Is it good?

725
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,920
It was decent back when I used it, but now it's probably rusty.

726
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I probably understand a lot more than I can speak.

727
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I couldn't hold a conversation honestly, but I can understand a lot more than I can speak.

728
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
That's cool.

729
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Both languages, English and German, I was taught by cartoons.

730
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Oh, so you said, so you said, where did you learn English again?

731
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
You've told me before.

732
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Cartoons, Cartoon Network.

733
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,920
I'm just wondering if there's a specific one that stands out to you as a particularly

734
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
potential.

735
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I was just watching cartoons in general on Cartoon Network all day, every day.

736
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Well, not all day, but yeah.

737
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Like a real American.

738
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Like a real American.

739
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Like a real American.

740
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,920
That's the laboratory, stuff like that.

741
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Yeah.

742
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Mage, I'm curious as to how you're going to make that money.

743
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Because you don't, I mean, you occasionally make a, put an image on your deviant art that

744
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,920
I've seen, but I don't know really how you make money.

745
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,920
I haven't, yeah, I haven't been making money, per se.

746
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
I don't have a Patreon.

747
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,920
I haven't been concerned myself with making money, but I guess.

748
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Welcome to European culture, everyone.

749
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Not concerned about making money.

750
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
The state gives you everything.

751
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Here's your health care.

752
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Here's your food.

753
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
It's fine.

754
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Here's a live in Muslim refugee.

755
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Hey, hey, hey everybody.

756
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
I'm here.

757
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm here too.

758
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Hello.

759
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
Is the podcast on?

760
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Yes.

761
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
I hope you're recording this shit.

762
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
I am recording this shit.

763
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,920
I was going to poke you because I saw you playing Pokemon.

764
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,920
It's like, how do you play Pokemon while we're here podcasting?

765
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
I forgot.

766
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
I forgot the podcast was starting.

767
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Some nice fellow challenged me to a battle on the showdown.

768
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
How'd you do?

769
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
I defeated.

770
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
I crushed him.

771
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Thank God.

772
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
I was real lucky.

773
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
I got Diggers B.

774
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Ben's what?

775
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
That's the first guy.

776
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
I saw his dance and I swept half his team.

777
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
And then he told me that he loved my work and it really made my 2017.

778
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Oh yeah.

779
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Ben's won for 20 now.

780
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
All right.

781
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
We're working our way back up.

782
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Yeah.

783
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
But I'm sorry.

784
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Mage was telling us about her lifestyle, degenerate as it may be, but it is hers.

785
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Okay.

786
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,920
But yeah, for 2017, I kind of really liked doing that little animation I did.

787
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
So I might actually put up more.

788
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,120
I have more fun spending several days drawing an animation that I do sitting down for an

789
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,920
hour and recording myself play Undertale.

790
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
As weird as that sounds.

791
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Yeah.

792
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
It is.

793
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
It does seem a little more lucrative.

794
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
It's kind of amazing.

795
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
Actually, I have no idea.

796
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Lucrative.

797
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
But it gets a lot of views.

798
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
I mean, you're Undertale videos.

799
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,920
I was going to say Undertale videos are big.

800
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
They are not small.

801
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
You guys mean her animations.

802
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Of course.

803
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Yeah.

804
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Oh yeah.

805
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
All those.

806
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Yeah.

807
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
No, I meant the Let's Play.

808
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
I haven't finished that one.

809
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Yeah, the Let's Plays.

810
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Yeah.

811
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
But yeah.

812
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I just want to kind of do more.

813
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
They haven't gotten that many views.

814
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,920
As an American capitalist pig, I would advise you to drop the Let's Play.

815
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Focus on animations of that kind.

816
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,920
The only thing is I want to finish that Let's Play at the same time.

817
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
I have more fun drawing stuff than I do.

818
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
Oh, God.

819
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
Please draw, Mage.

820
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Please draw.

821
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Fuck the Let's Play.

822
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Nobody cares.

823
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
It's so true.

824
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
I'll consider it.

825
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,920
I kind of feel bad dropping it, like after, you know, just like procrastinating for half

826
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,920
a year and be like, hey, guys, I'm back and then one episode later.

827
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Okay, guys, I'm quitting this Let's Play.

828
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Just like, hey, guys, I'm back.

829
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Die and have game over.

830
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Just like, I guess the game's over.

831
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Yeah.

832
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
There you go.

833
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Sorry if my audio is, I'm using a new microphone and I just noticed that I'm clipping the fuck

834
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
out of my sandwich.

835
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
So sorry about that.

836
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I'll try and adjust it.

837
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Just don't shout and I think you'll be good.

838
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Okay.

839
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Yeah.

840
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
It's okay.

841
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,920
We've got Tom's audio, so we've got a bare minimum that we're still well above for the

842
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
rest of us.

843
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,920
As long as Whistler doesn't try to use hypnosis, Ben shouldn't be screaming.

844
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Whistler, you know, scholars will debate.

845
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Scholars will debate until the end of time whether Whistler really, whether Whistler just

846
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,920
made a mistake or whether he was an inside job, whether he was, whether he was, whether

847
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
he was your inside man.

848
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
But you know what?

849
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
It doesn't matter.

850
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,920
It doesn't matter whether it was intentional or not, you know, we can't, we can't stand

851
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
for that kind of thing.

852
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Incompetence is even worse sometimes.

853
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Do you think Whistler may be what, like he was, he was doing his hypnosis, but the fact

854
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,920
that it failed was because he was too busy whistling and waking him up.

855
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
I mean, I hope so.

856
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Or he's a Whistler blower.

857
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
My, my friend, he's a whistleblower.

858
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,920
My friend Crack, my friend Crack drew a picture of Whistler getting ready for the firing squad.

859
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,920
He's got a bandana around his eyes.

860
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Oh my God.

861
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
That shit.

862
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
I will go, yeah, he sent it to me on Patreon.

863
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
I will go and tweet it later.

864
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Put that in the next episode at the end.

865
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
Oh yeah, that's right.

866
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
I am hungry for guest art.

867
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,920
I have had to do my own guest art a couple times.

868
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,920
I'm just thinking of the way Polyworld looks and he's got like the eye bumps that come out.

869
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Would his eyes not have like an individual bow around each one?

870
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,920
Well, that's not how Crack chose to depict it.

871
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Give us the big questions.

872
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,920
All right, Mage, was there anything else you wanted to add about, I'm curious if there's, yeah, please, go ahead.

873
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Yeah, I kind of wanted to wrap it up.

874
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Yeah, I think I'm going to do animations on my channel.

875
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,920
I'm thinking about maybe actually starting a Patreon.

876
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
I'm not too sure about that.

877
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
Do a dog.

878
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,920
It seems very fiddly and then I'll have to do extra stuff and I'm not really reliable.

879
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
You don't have to.

880
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Dude, my Patreon has no rewards at all and I still make a pretty decent amount.

881
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Most people do, but you don't have to.

882
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Most people are suckers and they're chumps and I hate them.

883
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Well, I mean, it's going to be their own choice.

884
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,920
It's not like I'm going to pressure them to do Patreon stuff, whatever.

885
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Of course, otherwise they'd be right.

886
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Yeah, I'll say about that.

887
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,920
I've been debating on whether or not to have Patreon for a while now, so I might do that.

888
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Dude, we're the biggest pro-patreon people in the world here.

889
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,920
I don't see any reason to not do a Patreon ever.

890
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
It always seems like a good idea.

891
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,920
I mean, Christian Weston Chandler just started his successful Patreon.

892
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
And it's a rousing success.

893
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,920
$250,000 and he'll make you a 15 minute YouTube video.

894
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
About anything you want.

895
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Yeah, anything you want.

896
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Man, that's a bargain.

897
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Okay.

898
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
I'm sorry, mate.

899
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
We are interrupting.

900
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
One last thing.

901
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
No, it's fine.

902
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
One last thing.

903
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
I might start doing commissions.

904
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
I'm still iffy about that because I'm not.

905
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Like, I used to do pony commissions and ponies are really fun and kind of easy to draw.

906
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,920
But I want to, you know, start including like humans and stuff.

907
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,920
And I have big troubles with like anatomy of humans and I'm just like,

908
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,920
maybe I'll start off with Chibi's first and see how that goes.

909
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,920
So I might open up commissions soon.

910
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,920
I've been saying that for a while now, but I am legit thinking about it for serious

911
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
because I do need the months.

912
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Weren't you doing some commissions earlier this year or like a month ago or so?

913
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Yeah, I did some sort of private requests.

914
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,920
We kind of came about and I was like, well, I don't want to, you know, open up commissions

915
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,920
and have like a bunch of people commission me then I'll be overworked and I won't get

916
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,920
them done because I had to go for Christmas to my family and stuff.

917
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,920
So I did a few private ones that people asked me.

918
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
And yeah, and it turned out well.

919
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,920
And that's what kind of inspired me to maybe start actual commissions like public commissions.

920
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Well, hey, if you do it, let us know and we'll shout it out.

921
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,920
I have never done like a round of commissions before.

922
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,920
I don't really like working on commissions, but I don't know.

923
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,920
It's practice in a way and hey, some way to earn months.

924
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,920
Yeah, yeah.

925
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Who needs money when you live in Europe?

926
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
Am I right?

927
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
I do.

928
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,920
I do it for enough money, but frankly, I would feel uncomfortable asking for the amount of

929
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,920
money that would make me feel like that would make me feel like it was worth the pain and

930
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,920
suffering of doing someone's commission.

931
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,920
Yeah, I was doing commissions like a couple of months ago, but I was like thinking of

932
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,920
the pricing.

933
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
I'm like, no one's going to buy these.

934
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Like I'm not going to like bother drawing your shitty OC for less than like $50 baseline.

935
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Yeah.

936
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Yeah.

937
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,920
And I mean, you know, people are so goddamn entitled on the internet.

938
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
They think artists should just draw them shit for free.

939
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Dang it.

940
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
Well, it's just fucking lines on a paper, dude.

941
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,920
I have a system that I'm kind of happy with.

942
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
It's a little, I guess, you know, we achieve it at the same time.

943
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,920
I think it's good enough.

944
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,920
I charge by the hour and so the effort put in depends on how many hours, you know, you

945
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
commission me for.

946
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,920
So if it's a very detailed design and you commission me only for an hour, don't be

947
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,920
surprised if it's just like base colors at best.

948
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
That makes sense.

949
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Yeah.

950
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Well, the problem I would see with that is that I think a lot of customers probably wouldn't

951
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,920
know what to expect from, say, an hour's work.

952
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Yeah, I do like previews, you know, you know, examples of what it would look like after

953
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
an hour or two hours or whatever.

954
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,920
I don't charge for the sketching process, though, because the sketching can take anywhere

955
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,920
between like 15 minutes to like an hour or so.

956
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Because sometimes, you know, I don't get it right and then I have to redraw all the sketch

957
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
all over again.

958
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,920
So I don't feel like it's fair to charge for it because it'll double the price for some

959
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
of the commissions.

960
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,920
But other than that, the sketching is work.

961
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
On the other hand, though, it doubles the price.

962
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Yeah.

963
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
By the same token.

964
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,920
Well, I don't want to rob people of their money.

965
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
I want to be fair.

966
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Oh, but then we're coming at this from completely different angles, and if that's the case.

967
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Mages, sketching is work.

968
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Why is it not worth paying for the sketch part of the process?

969
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Mages, let me tell you how cheap I am.

970
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,920
If I ever start doing commissions, I'm making very sure I'm going to have a whole document,

971
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
like a terms and services agreement you have to do.

972
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
Yeah.

973
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,920
And it's going to have a revision clause in there that you get two free revision.

974
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
After that, I charge you $3 a complaint.

975
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,920
A revision's clause is important.

976
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Okay, guys, Ridley, I think of it this way.

977
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,920
I could make a butt load off of Nate if he ever commissioned me.

978
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
That's true.

979
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
That's how I do a lot of revisions.

980
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
He's like an addict.

981
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,920
He just keeps putting money into the machine, hoping that his commission will come out good this time.

982
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,920
When I worked with CeCe on my banner, she still tells tall tales about how many revisions

983
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
I had her to on that shit.

984
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Was that like 100?

985
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
No, but it was a lot.

986
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,920
It was a lot.

987
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
I mean, even one is too many.

988
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,920
We were in a group chat while you were doing that, and she just kept being like,

989
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
what the fuck?

990
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
This is crazy.

991
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
And we were all just like, made some mad man.

992
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,920
For me, I just kind of like send them a preview of the sketch for the pose and stuff,

993
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:14,920
and they okay me, then I finish the drawing, and I send it over the finished drawing after they pay me.

994
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,920
And I'm not going to change anything about the pose or whatever,

995
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,920
but if they want some adjustments with the colors, I can still do that.

996
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,920
If you're not happy with the pose, tell me at the sketch stage or else you're too little too late.

997
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Yeah, okay.

998
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,920
Well, we don't have to get too bogged down in the details of Mage's hypothetical commissions that don't even exist right now.

999
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Sorry, man.

1000
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Sorry you don't care about art, man.

1001
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Sorry you're just not an artist mindset, man.

1002
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
We get the idea.

1003
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Who have we heard from already?

1004
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Tom and Gibb, and now Mage.

1005
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Okay.

1006
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,920
His name's Hippo, by the way.

1007
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

1008
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Mage, do you have anything else you want to add?

1009
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Have a good year, everyone.

1010
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Yay.

1011
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
All right.

1012
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Now, Mumki, how about you, my friend?

1013
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
What are your plans for 2017?

1014
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Well, much like Hippo and Tom, I'm an aspiring writer,

1015
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,920
but the only difference is that two years ago I wrote my book.

1016
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,920
So my plan for 2017 is to actually release it.

1017
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,920
I thought you were saying delete it.

1018
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,920
That's probably the better plan, to be honest.

1019
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,920
I've been working on this deletion for years.

1020
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,920
I'm very proud of it, and I finally have a copy of it that I think I can release,

1021
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,920
so I'm waiting for the first copy to come in the mail so I can make sure it's okay.

1022
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Are you going to do a dramatic reading of it?

1023
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Oh, yeah.

1024
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,920
I was thinking about it, but it's really long, and I mean, if I did...

1025
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Maybe the first chapter.

1026
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Just to get people interested.

1027
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Yeah, I might do that for the...

1028
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
What is the total work count of your book?

1029
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
It's not bad.

1030
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
The word count?

1031
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
Yes.

1032
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,920
I think it's like right around 100,000.

1033
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Substantial.

1034
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,920
I mean, give me a work of comparable length.

1035
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,920
Are we talking like Deathly Hallows' length?

1036
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Or are we talking Animorph's length?

1037
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
I don't fucking know.

1038
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
Okay.

1039
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Okay.

1040
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,920
It's 21 chapters of a great story about a school shooting, and I love it.

1041
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,920
How are you going to release it?

1042
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,920
There's a website where you can self-publish called lulu.com that I actually recommend.

1043
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
It's pretty good.

1044
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Oolulilia released Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters through Lulu.

1045
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
You're a good company, dude.

1047
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Yeah.

1048
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Yeah.

1049
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Yeah, so it's going to be there.

1050
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,920
And if you're interested in hearing Munky's take on a school shooting, check out my YouTube

1051
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
channel, and I'll post links there.

1052
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,920
I thought it was going to be like the story of Elliot Roger, but from the perspective of

1053
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
the gun or the knife.

1054
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
That'd be interesting.

1055
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,920
The book was heavily influenced by the Elliot Roger case, so...

1056
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Imagine.

1057
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,920
As far as YouTube goals are concerned, I guess I just want to double my subs next year.

1058
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,920
If I end the year with 30,000 subs, I'd be pretty happy.

1059
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
And that's about it.

1060
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
God, you have so many.

1061
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,920
And you really gained a lot.

1062
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
You really gained a lot recently.

1063
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
I was just curious.

1064
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,920
What was the spike from now at like 15,000 or so?

1065
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,920
What were you before you started the surge?

1066
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
I don't know if I'm on a surge right now.

1067
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,920
I think I'd get like 30 subs a day.

1068
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
Okay.

1069
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,920
Well, when the Be Got to H.K.I. video went big, how many were you at at that point?

1070
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,920
Zero.

1071
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Oh.

1072
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,920
I went from zero to about 5,000 in about a day.

1073
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,920
Wow.

1074
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
And then that channel got deleted like a week later.

1075
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Oh, really?

1076
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,920
So I lost most of those subs.

1077
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
Oh, good.

1078
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,920
But then luckily, the video went viral again, and I got a bunch of subs back.

1079
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Oh, I see.

1080
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Okay.

1081
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,920
That's unusual.

1082
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,920
That video was on the front page of Reddit three times.

1083
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
Whoa.

1084
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,920
Damn.

1085
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I'm waiting for the fourth.

1086
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
If he got to H.K.I.

1087
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
He's a big one, you know.

1088
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,920
Which I actually have not seen.

1089
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
Wait, no, no.

1090
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,920
That's the one about the girl who wants to have sex with a million dudes or something?

1091
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1092
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,920
I have seen that one.

1093
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
Actually, I have not.

1094
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
The anime or the review?

1095
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
No, the review.

1096
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,920
I don't watch anime.

1097
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
Oh.

1098
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,920
I'm not a fucking anime.

1099
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,920
So, yeah, those are Mumke's goals.

1100
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,920
Go check out youtube.com slash Mumke Jones.

1101
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
Go check him out.

1102
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
All right, cool.

1103
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
He's pretty good.

1104
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
Well, I mean, yeah.

1105
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,920
He's pretty good at Pokemon, I've heard.

1106
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Yeah.

1107
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,920
He just gets lucky every time.

1108
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
Yeah, how do you like my Metagross I got, Ben?

1109
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,920
First, it's a fucking, it's a Beldom.

1110
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,920
It's a Metang and it will be a Metang in our next battle.

1111
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
So don't go counting your chicken for the hatch.

1112
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,920
First of all, why would I bring it to the battle if it's not a Metagross yet?

1113
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Hmm.

1114
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
That's solid.

1115
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,920
Yeah.

1116
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,920
Solid quest.

1117
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
Well, I mean, it's still pretty good.

1118
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,920
It's still like 420 base stats.

1119
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
Fair.

1120
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,920
420, I hear you on that, brother.

1121
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I hear you there.

1122
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
Yeah, high five.

1123
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
High five.

1124
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,920
Listen to Ben, not a nerd saying, talking about Pokemon stats.

1125
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,920
Yeah, 420, 420 plays it with my brothers.

1126
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,920
Ben, tell us more about your plans for 2017.

1127
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
Mumke, I assume that was everything you've done.

1128
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
Yeah, I'm a boring person.

1129
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,920
Okay.

1130
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Agreed.

1131
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Agreed.

1132
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Ben.

1133
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,920
YouTube goals in term, I guess maybe it'd be nice to hit 10,000.

1134
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
That'd be cool.

1135
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,920
I hadn't really thought about how I'm going to do that.

1136
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:42,920
But my real goals for this year, I guess, I mean, I thought the champion would be done

1137
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
a month or two ago.

1138
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
So definitely going to finish that.

1139
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,920
Going to finish this Nuzlocke and then probably not do one for a while.

1140
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Oh, Vapers 3, definitely going to do that.

1141
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,920
That shouldn't take the whole year.

1142
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Are the rumors true that this one's about Magda?

1143
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
That's right.

1144
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
It is.

1145
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Oh, shit.

1146
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,920
I know.

1147
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,920
The people cried out for it and I delivered.

1148
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,920
One more of that hot poof in my life.

1149
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,920
So, yeah, finish champion, do Vapers 3, and then do a lot more.

1150
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,160
I want to draw more comics and when I get a chance to take a break from Nuzlocke, I'm

1151
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,600
sure I will be able to draw more than I had been previously.

1152
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:37,120
And I guess I would probably like to release some kind of book, you know, like some kind

1153
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,680
of collection or maybe just paper, you know, soft cover, trade paperback copies of Vapers

1154
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,920
or Champion or whatever.

1155
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,920
Yeah, that's a good plan.

1156
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,920
So, I guess those would be my goals for 2017.

1157
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Oh, and also just make more money because I'm on a crash course with bankruptcy and

1158
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,920
something needs to change.

1159
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
What's your time frame?

1160
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Is that going to be within 2017?

1161
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Possibly.

1162
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
Possibly.

1163
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
We'll probably know by the end of the year.

1164
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
Worst case scenario, yes.

1165
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Okay, how exciting.

1166
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
Oh, yeah.

1167
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Oh, yeah.

1168
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,920
I've got one more question.

1169
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,920
You've been making a couple like little analysis type of videos on your channel.

1170
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,920
Oh, that's right.

1171
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,420
Plans to do more of those because I like them.

1172
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,420
Yeah.

1173
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,600
I guess in terms of YouTube, I'm not saying I'll never do another Nuzlocke again, but

1174
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
not for a while.

1175
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:33,920
And so, if I guess once that's over, I will probably go back to posting like speed draws,

1176
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,160
possibly art vlogs, and yeah, maybe a couple more of those little analytical, I don't know

1177
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
if I'd call them in now.

1178
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Yeah, I guess they're in now.

1179
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
Yeah, they're in there.

1180
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
They're analytical rants.

1181
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
They're just my thoughts.

1182
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,920
I just thought, thought dump, fucking vlog, you know, I just talked about shit.

1183
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,800
I really like those.

1184
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,800
And I thought that for the final product, the effort, the effort put into quality of final

1185
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,600
product ratio was really good on those.

1186
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,280
And that ratio is something that I'm pursuing intensely these days.

1187
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,120
And yeah, like, I mean, the first one was like, I just sat down and talked for half

1188
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,120
an hour.

1189
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,560
I spent maybe like, I don't know, two or three hours editing to turn like the film footage

1190
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:20,800
into the repeating like looping clips because I like, I like that inspired by Digi's decompression

1191
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
chamber.

1192
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,280
I decided to do that.

1193
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,520
And also, because that, that was an easy way to get by the YouTube restrictions because

1194
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,720
they, Davoo and Digi kept telling me, Ben, don't go over 10 second clips.

1195
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,720
And I was like, well, I don't want to find like, it's like a 20 minute video.

1196
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,960
That means I'd have to find like, like a hundred clips.

1197
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,960
I don't know.

1198
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
I can't do math.

1199
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,400
I need to find so many clips to fill that up.

1200
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Fuck that.

1201
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,160
I was like, what if I found one clip and just looped it over and over again?

1202
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,160
And it was great.

1203
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
It was brilliant.

1204
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,160
I'm a genius.

1205
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,080
So anyway, I really liked how those came out.

1206
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,600
And yes, I will do more of those.

1207
00:47:53,600 --> 00:48:00,560
And I guess that will probably be a big part of my YouTube shit going forward.

1208
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
Or I hope so.

1209
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,160
I hope they can find success because that one, the one about the Ghibli, the one about

1210
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,040
only yesterday performed reasonably well actually, better than I expected it to.

1211
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,040
How many, how many views does that have, man?

1212
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,120
The Space Funeral 1 did okay.

1213
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,960
It's like, is that like 3,000?

1214
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,000
That's pretty good for a channel of like 2,000 subs.

1215
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,800
Oh, or wait, wait, let me, let me double check.

1216
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,040
It got, it got, yeah, just under 3,000.

1217
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,560
Yeah, that's cool.

1218
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Yeah.

1219
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:32,280
So it reached outside my sub base, which is, I mean, what more can you ask for?

1220
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,360
To true.

1221
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
That's the goal.

1222
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,880
So yeah, that's my plans.

1223
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,720
Some more YouTube stuff, lots more comics, maybe doing some actual printing and trade

1224
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,040
paperback publishing and, you know, try and get that going.

1225
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,960
Since that, since that was the goal.

1226
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,400
Ever since I started drawing comics, that was the goal.

1227
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Like all my pages are formatted for book form and stuff.

1228
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,720
They're not really formatted for the internet because I always wanted to sell them and to

1229
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,720
sell physical copies.

1230
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,480
It would be pretty cool to buy a Vapor's Trilogy book.

1231
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,800
I know, man.

1232
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,240
It would be, it would be pretty, that's the dream, right?

1233
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,840
You know, I feel like, I feel like there's a lot of people that are more focused on that

1234
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,840
than me.

1235
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,120
Like I never really, I don't know.

1236
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,840
Some people don't feel like they're legit until they have a physical form, a physical

1237
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,040
book and like I don't feel that way, but still it is, it would be cool.

1238
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,720
That feels somewhat of a hangover from the days when books were all there was.

1239
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,720
Yeah.

1240
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,720
But now there's, you know.

1241
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,720
Totally.

1242
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,960
The tangibility definitely kind of like, oh yeah.

1243
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,440
It appeals to us as material beings.

1244
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,960
It just makes it feel more significant.

1245
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,200
There are, you know, there are people that would buy a comic book that would not read

1246
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,200
a comic on the internet.

1247
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,120
You know, like there's people that you can reach that way that you wouldn't reach on

1248
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
the internet.

1249
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:59,600
So like, you know, it's another thing, another region to expand into that would be neat.

1250
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,240
And I would really, I would really like to get like picked up by a company, picked up

1251
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:11,000
by a publisher and published, but if that doesn't happen, then I will just fucking bootstrap

1252
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,520
and do it myself because that's what I've done my whole life and I'm going to keep doing

1253
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,040
it for as long as necessary.

1254
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,680
I'd like to get picked up by a big burly man who can protect me in his arms.

1255
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,680
That's my goal for 2013.

1256
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,680
Sure.

1257
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,680
Like out of the act of one moon.

1258
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680
Get Machamp.

1259
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,680
Oh yeah, Machamp.

1260
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,760
That's right.

1261
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,760
My favorite guy.

1262
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,760
His warm embrace.

1263
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,280
Well, that's cool.

1264
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
Anything else?

1265
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,280
Is that everything?

1266
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,280
No.

1267
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,280
Wait.

1268
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,280
Yes.

1269
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,280
Alright.

1270
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,280
Patreon.com.

1271
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,280
Of course.

1272
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,280
Of course.

1273
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,280
Okay.

1274
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,280
So everybody's gone.

1275
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,280
So I guess.

1276
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,280
All the important people gone.

1277
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,280
Okay.

1278
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,280
We can go home.

1279
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,280
We can end the podcast now.

1280
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,280
Thanks for coming everybody.

1281
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,280
Goodbye.

1282
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,280
Wait.

1283
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,280
There are more people here.

1284
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,280
Well, there's me.

1285
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,280
I haven't gone.

1286
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,280
I don't know.

1287
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,680
I've made my stuff pretty clear in like my now second to last video.

1288
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,280
I gotta tell you, I'm so thrilled to have managed to get that last, you know, edit

1289
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,440
manga video out before the end of the year.

1290
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,440
That was one of my goals.

1291
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Thank God I did it.

1292
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,440
Yeah.

1293
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,760
It took way too long anyway, but still might as well get it done.

1294
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,960
Best manga ever, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer is, you know, it's really different

1295
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,720
from your other stuff.

1296
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:30,120
And yet I feel like it makes sense in the grand scheme of the best guy ever and what

1297
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,720
and the values that your channel represents.

1298
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,720
I agree.

1299
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Yeah.

1300
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,720
I think it does work as, as like, like you're the best guy ever and every video you make

1301
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:46,720
on anything has to be the best version of a review or a true thing of that thing ever.

1302
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,680
Whatever it is, whatever it is, it's the best one that I know that like you've been wrestling

1303
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,160
with the idea of like trying to find a way to increase your output of production, but

1304
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,920
I feel like at this point that it almost spits in the face of the channel's like established

1305
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,080
personality at this point, that like your production value is like so key to just like

1306
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,720
your identity at this point.

1307
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,160
And I think it's, it's something that YouTube is severely lacking.

1308
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,160
I feel like you're, I think what you should probably be focusing on isn't like, how do

1309
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,920
I make things faster, but how do I get people to partner their shekels in a more significant

1310
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,680
fashion to, to fund my slow production.

1311
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,600
I have, I have to disagree.

1312
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,600
I really think that I really think there are areas where fat could be trimmed from the

1313
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,760
production pipeline without sacrificing too much quality.

1314
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,680
I think, I think that's a fair argument, but I don't, that's not what I'm saying.

1315
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,880
I'm saying if you can trim the fat and make the same quality done faster, I agree, but

1316
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,160
I don't think that the production values should drop down in the name of quicker output.

1317
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,840
You know, I agree with that.

1318
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,840
I agree.

1319
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:52,320
And I think what it comes down to is sort of the way in which I release things like,

1320
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,320
you know, making one 45 minute video about a thing and releasing it once every six months

1321
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,760
is just like, you don't have to do it that way and it's not optimal.

1322
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,120
So you know, there are other ways to get to the same end goal than doing it in that way.

1323
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,400
So I mean, yeah, that's relevant.

1324
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,240
Like these, these are a lot of the things I've been thinking about, about the way in

1325
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,680
which I produce content.

1326
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,840
Because you know, I like everything I've done, but I am really trying to think I'm very serious

1327
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:26,760
at this point, since I've met all my obligations to making my stuff viable as a way to survive

1328
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,760
on YouTube.

1329
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,160
And people are already quite generous on Patreon with me, considering how much I've released.

1330
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,160
It's, it's, it's very, it's very much appreciated.

1331
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,800
But I do still need a bunch more if I want to be able to live solely on it.

1332
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,480
So, you know, but you know, so that, that's where I'm at.

1333
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:54,560
My goal is to in 2017, leave my job and do YouTube full time and you know, whatever capacity

1334
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,560
is appropriate.

1335
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:00,880
And a lot of that involves changing my content a little bit, you know, somewhat, and a lot

1336
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,480
of it also involves working with the procrastinators.

1337
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:09,280
Because I really see a bright future with, with the procrastinators and specifically projects

1338
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,720
like the plebe and the weeb and other things that we haven't, that haven't even been, you

1339
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,160
know, concocted yet.

1340
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,280
But there are all kinds of things we could do.

1341
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,400
And I really, I really use red letter media as an example of, of how you can make that

1342
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,400
work.

1343
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,840
Frankly, I don't know how those guys can afford to survive.

1344
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,280
It doesn't seem like their channel is quite big enough to support, you know, I don't know

1345
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,800
how many people are involved in that production, like six people, maybe some of them have jobs

1346
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,800
they do on the side.

1347
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,000
They're, you know, like they have that.

1348
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I don't know.

1349
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't know.

1350
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
But that's fairly new, you know.

1351
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
They have a Patreon.

1352
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,280
Even before Patreon, they were selling merchandise and they were, they were selling films and

1353
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,280
stuff.

1354
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,400
So I'm assuming they're making a decent amount of money through merchandising.

1355
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,400
Those guys make a lot of money.

1356
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,400
Even on ad revenue.

1357
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,560
I've bought two of their shirts over, over Christmas vacation.

1358
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:03,000
And finally, I'm so glad I got a, I got a VHS repair shop t-shirt and I love it.

1359
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I love it.

1360
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,560
That's what we need to do.

1361
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,280
We got to, we got to merchandise the PCP.

1362
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,160
You know, for real though, that's, that's, that's definitely true.

1363
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,680
Right now the PCP makes zero money.

1364
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,680
What's that made?

1365
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,360
I can make some draws for like maybe shirt designs or something.

1366
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,360
That'd be cool.

1367
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
Yeah.

1368
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,320
I really think in 2017, this is something that we should do.

1369
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:27,520
Uh, it just, just kind of building up the organizational infrastructure here.

1370
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:33,360
I mean, it'd be nice, really the, the show plebe and the weeb is sort of a PCP project,

1371
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,600
but we would just release it on Digi's channel.

1372
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,760
I mean, it's, you know, he did the thing for the most part, but since PCP is too small

1373
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,880
and it wouldn't be paid attention to it, it's, it's released on that.

1374
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,480
But like in the future, you know, this is the place where things like that would be

1375
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
for the most part.

1376
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,480
So, you know, I, I don't know, I don't have all the thoughts worked out yet, but I think

1377
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,480
about it.

1378
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,680
I think if we want the PCP channel to be like Reddler to Meteor, we would need to have like

1379
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:04,240
a, like a star show, like Mr. Plinkett to go on there.

1380
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,320
And I don't know whether anyone would be up for not putting it on their own channel

1381
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,440
and instead putting it on the PCP, which is why it's kind of weird that.

1382
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:18,480
Well, it would have to grow, you know, I looked it up and their Patreon is at $16,000 per

1383
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,480
month.

1384
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,480
Well, that's pretty good.

1385
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,480
There we go.

1386
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,480
It's pretty good.

1387
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,480
Yeah.

1388
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,960
That's split between, you know, like how many people I'm gonna say six, but I don't

1389
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,960
know.

1390
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,720
Well, I don't know.

1391
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,960
Maybe some of the guys are part-time and it's just like Mike and Jay and Rich, I guess.

1392
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,960
I don't know.

1393
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,960
I think Rich is a construction worker.

1394
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
What?

1395
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,960
He just showed up.

1396
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
Yeah.

1397
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,960
Yeah.

1398
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,960
Wait.

1399
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,960
Oh God.

1400
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,960
Does he build things?

1401
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,960
Yeah.

1402
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Like he just does this like part-time.

1403
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
He does build.

1404
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
He does build.

1405
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
Instruction work.

1406
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,960
Man, that's, that's, I want to say that's crazy.

1407
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,960
That union dog, that union.

1408
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,960
Wait.

1409
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,960
Oh God.

1410
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,960
I just remembered the most important goal for 2017.

1411
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,960
Yeah.

1412
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,960
Just touch more boobs.

1413
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,960
Oh.

1414
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,960
I don't even get into that shit.

1415
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,960
What?

1416
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,960
What?

1417
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
What?

1418
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Who said that?

1419
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
What?

1420
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
I don't know.

1421
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,960
I didn't hear it, but it made me mad.

1422
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,960
I just said I hope you kill yourself.

1423
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,960
Oh wow.

1424
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,960
Well, thank you.

1425
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:20,960
Yeah.

1426
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,960
I just, yes.

1427
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,960
I crave the, I crave the touch of a woman, the scent of a woman.

1428
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,960
And I must have it.

1429
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,960
I must hunt one down.

1430
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,960
By any means.

1431
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,960
Ladies get out there and date him.

1432
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,960
Ladies go on and date him.

1433
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,960
But she smells good.

1434
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
Smells like a woman.

1435
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,960
You know.

1436
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,960
That's a good smell.

1437
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,960
Then that's what I'm looking for.

1438
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,960
Yeah.

1439
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Anyway, yeah.

1440
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Mm.

1441
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,960
Yep.

1442
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,960
That's all I have to say about that.

1443
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,960
Great.

1444
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,960
Let's, let's please move on.

1445
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,960
Okay.

1446
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,960
I don't know.

1447
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,960
I'm just thinking if I have anything else to say.

1448
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
I don't know.

1449
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,960
I need money.

1450
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
Everyone give me money on Patreon.

1451
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,960
Yeah.

1452
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Yeah.

1453
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,960
Faster videos will come.

1454
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,960
Yeah.

1455
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
I need it most.

1456
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,760
I just want to say that I do think legitimately my transition from being able to do YouTube

1457
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,560
barely any time to do it at the end of the day after I work all fucking day to being

1458
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,560
able to do it all the time would be a big transformation and we all know best guy ever

1459
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,560
is the best content.

1460
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
We all know it.

1461
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,560
It's a fact.

1462
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,560
You can't deny it.

1463
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,060
So please people do yourselves in the world of favor by, by giving, giving me money so

1464
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,720
I can, so I can make more of it.

1465
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,400
How much do you need to do it full time?

1466
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,800
My, my goal is a month.

1467
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,200
This would be a massive pay cut from what I make now.

1468
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:47,480
But if I made around $750 per video on my Patreon, I think that would be a starting like

1469
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,480
livable wage.

1470
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,480
I could build on that.

1471
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,680
How are you people using such a little money?

1472
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,040
Based on how many videos per month?

1473
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,040
Based on two.

1474
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,040
That's based on two videos.

1475
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,360
Well, I'll raise you one, Nate.

1476
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,440
I, I could do, I could work full time for $600 a month, I think.

1477
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,440
But you already do.

1478
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,440
I think I could swing it.

1479
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
I think I could swing it.

1480
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
You do for $0 a month already.

1481
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:10,120
So, so who, so who's delivering the better value on your dollar here, patrons?

1482
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,000
Do we have any fan questions this week?

1483
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Oh yeah.

1484
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
That's, that's good.

1485
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,880
We certainly do.

1486
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,880
Let's go to the Twitter.

1487
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,040
I need to have like a private discussion with both of you and how you can live on such

1488
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,040
a little money.

1489
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,040
I need to learn these secrets.

1490
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,540
My overhead is like nothing.

1491
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,540
It's not.

1492
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,540
I mean, no, talk to Ben.

1493
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:28,120
I, I live on a salary, so I'm, I'm okay.

1494
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,120
You know, don't.

1495
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,120
Ben moves.

1496
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,720
My, my, I, I pay, I pay rent at, at Digi's house and I fucking eat leftovers and that's

1497
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,720
my whole life.

1498
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,720
Shit.

1499
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,720
Yeah.

1500
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,720
Ben's a master of, uh.

1501
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,720
I need to move in with Digi then, clearly.

1502
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,720
Yeah.

1503
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,720
Okay, here we go.

1504
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,720
Don't, don't muscle in on my leftovers.

1505
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,720
I eat nothing but ramen right now.

1506
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,760
I eat those for the Pokemon battles.

1507
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Oh shit.

1508
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,760
That's true.

1509
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,760
Okay.

1510
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,760
So we're, we're moving on.

1511
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,760
Last time.

1512
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
Yeah.

1513
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,260
Munch, uh, uh, monkey was wondering where Ben found those leftovers.

1514
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,760
Now you have your answer.

1515
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,480
Um, so, okay.

1516
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,360
So it's time to move into the non-gay section of the thing where we, uh, answer questions.

1517
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,960
We, we always tweet and when we start recording generally on Saturdays, uh, at the procrastinators,

1518
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,280
uh, Twitter at TP Crastinators, uh, that we're recording to ask us questions that we will

1519
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,000
answer at the end of the show.

1520
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,080
So, uh, let me see, I put that out and I'm going to find some fucking questions in here.

1521
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,960
I should mention right now that we're all recording this on New Year's Eve, so none

1522
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,960
of us went to a party.

1523
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
Yeah, I know.

1524
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
None of us had any friends.

1525
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,960
No.

1526
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,960
Pretend it's not that night.

1527
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,960
Pretend that we're cool.

1528
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,960
I'll be, I'll be drinking maybe.

1529
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,960
Yeah.

1530
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,960
I'll be trying.

1531
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,960
I guess I'll be trying.

1532
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:36,960
That's how shit my life is.

1533
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,960
I'm tipsy right now.

1534
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,960
Yeah.

1535
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,960
I have no friends and I'm home alone.

1536
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,960
Here, uh, okay.

1537
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
Here's one.

1538
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,240
I mean, I don't know if anyone even has an answer for this, but we can kind of chew on

1539
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,600
it while I look for more.

1540
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,240
Uh, anyone have a best creator non-PCP of 2016?

1541
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,000
Who's, who's somebody who's made some of that impress you this year?

1542
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah.

1543
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,480
Why did we need that, that special caveat?

1544
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,480
Of course I wasn't going to pick a fucking PCP member.

1545
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,480
Well, because obviously everyone would just say me.

1546
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,480
They would say me if they knew.

1547
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,480
So, exempting me.

1548
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,480
That's true.

1549
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,480
Well, the Ben Saints and the Nates of the World might, but I don't know about the rest

1550
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,480
of us.

1551
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,480
That's right.

1552
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,480
Um, some of it.

1553
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,480
Okay.

1554
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,480
Okay.

1555
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,040
What happened in 2016 in terms of YouTube videos?

1556
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,640
Uh, the Fine Bros launched their really successful network.

1557
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,760
Yes.

1558
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,760
Ben, Ben, Ben.

1559
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
Got him.

1560
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,760
That's pretty good.

1561
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,160
Uh, my answer is the Fine Boy.

1562
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,160
H3, H3 stopped being funny.

1563
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,160
Jon Tron stopped being funny.

1564
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,160
H3 is okay.

1565
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,640
H3, H3 is the same as he has always been.

1566
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,640
Okay, so he was never funny.

1567
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,640
He's got more money than he had.

1568
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,640
Yeah.

1569
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,640
A lot more.

1570
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,640
A lot more.

1571
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,640
Um, everyone sucks this year.

1572
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,640
Uh, Maddox destroyed his personal and professional reputation.

1573
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,640
Oh no.

1574
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,640
Yeah, that's true.

1575
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:48,640
I mean, Dick, Dick Show is just a commercial for Dick and how cool he can be.

1576
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,640
And it's the 50 second.

1577
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,640
Is that a good thing or a bad thing though?

1578
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,640
It's a 50 second tie as Patreon.

1579
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,640
He can't stand it.

1580
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,640
Okay.

1581
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,640
I don't, I don't watch it, but I can't stand it.

1582
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,640
Oh, I love the Dick Show.

1583
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,640
It's great.

1584
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,640
Yeah.

1585
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,640
I don't want to give it a chance.

1586
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,640
I don't want to give it a chance to win me over.

1587
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,640
I can't, I can't think of a single one 2016.

1588
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,640
I mean, 2016 is a whole year.

1589
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,640
So that's a long time.

1590
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,640
I'm trying to remember anything I even gave a fuck about.

1591
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,640
Did any video games, did any video games come out this year?

1592
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,640
Doom 2016 kicked fucking ass.

1593
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:21,640
Yeah.

1594
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,640
Wasn't Dark Souls 3 this year too?

1595
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,640
It was.

1596
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,640
Oh wait, wait.

1597
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,640
Oh wait.

1598
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,640
One minute ago.

1599
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,640
It's, it's, can I be in this video by a HGB guy?

1600
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:31,640
Let me link it.

1601
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,640
I don't know what it's going to be, but it's, it's my brother in a horse mask.

1602
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,640
I'm giving, I'm giving artist of the year to HGB guy for sure.

1603
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,640
That's my Amungus.

1604
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,640
Yeah.

1605
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,640
The fucking Champ of Amungus.

1606
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,640
He gets, he gets it.

1607
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,640
Everyone go onto YouTube, go to HGB guy.

1608
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,640
Let's put a fucking link in the description to the artist of the year.

1609
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,640
The HGB guy is your brother.

1610
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,640
Yeah.

1611
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,640
Yeah.

1612
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,640
That's right.

1613
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,640
I feel like I've seen that person fave some of my tweets and I had no idea.

1614
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,640
For introducing, for introducing the character of Cunt Corona.

1615
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,640
You know, he's going to be big.

1616
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,640
He's going to be big.

1617
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,640
I'm really excited for what he's going to do this year.

1618
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:17,640
Oh, I want to say I did, I took great strides this year because I finally got a YouTube URL.

1619
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,640
My YouTube URL is now, is now C slash Ben St. Comics and I'm so fucking proud of myself.

1620
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,640
Hey, hey, try entering that URL sometime without the C because it just works sometimes.

1621
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,640
I don't know.

1622
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,640
It's a little mysterious.

1623
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,640
Yeah.

1624
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,640
Give it a try.

1625
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,640
Whenever I post a link that's like going to be a text, I just get rid of the C and it's fine.

1626
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,640
It just sort of figures it out that hypocrite means hypocrite user.

1627
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,640
Okay.

1628
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,640
Here's, here's a substantive question.

1629
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,640
Oh, I forgot to say who that was.

1630
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,640
I'll go back to it in a minute, but at kin, kin.

1631
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,640
Okay.

1632
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:58,640
It's kin KKUK at that guy says, are you planning on doing any other PCP races anytime soon?

1633
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,640
And the answer is yes.

1634
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,640
Yes.

1635
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,640
We are thinking about what to do.

1636
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,640
We don't know what they're going to be yet.

1637
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,640
Race war.

1638
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,640
Race forever, forever to decide on the, on the Pokemon race.

1639
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:14,640
I said we should do Spyro one first person to get 10 dragons wins.

1640
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,640
I don't do over that audience.

1641
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,640
That's not a bad.

1642
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,640
I like that kind of goal.

1643
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,640
I think that's not bad at some point.

1644
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,640
I feel.

1645
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,640
Yes.

1646
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,640
I think that Mega Man or Mega Man X, but like a specific challenge.

1647
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,640
Let's just do them all at the same time.

1648
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:34,640
Each one of us picks our own game, makes up our own goal, and then we all race toward

1649
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,640
the end.

1650
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,200
I'm just telling you, I want a speed run gotten home in that case.

1651
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,640
That's a 20 second completion time.

1652
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,640
Oh, by the way, I just want to say before the best creator, non-PCB of 2016, that was

1653
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,640
at the out sin.

1654
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,640
So thanks.

1655
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,640
Thanks buddy for that question.

1656
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,640
HGB guy.

1657
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,640
HGB guy.

1658
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,640
Yes.

1659
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,640
It was him.

1660
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,640
Okay.

1661
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,640
So here's, here's one more and we get this is going to be the last one, I guess.

1662
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:03,040
Anyone have by at John Attenbury.

1663
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,840
What is the top PCP meme of 2016?

1664
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,840
So Radcon 2 was this year.

1665
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,440
I mean, Radcon 1 was this year.

1666
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,440
So there was quite a few.

1667
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,440
Oh man.

1668
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,440
There was a lot.

1669
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,440
It would have to be.

1670
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,440
I like, I like handboys.

1671
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,440
I think I got to go with handboys.

1672
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,440
Oh yeah.

1673
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,440
It's definitely.

1674
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,440
Handboys.

1675
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,440
Handboys.

1676
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,440
Yep.

1677
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,440
That's it.

1678
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,440
That's the answer.

1679
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,440
I also, I also enjoy, it's not really a PCB exclusive meme.

1680
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,080
Well actually, there's half of the people here that weren't at the first Radcon and don't

1681
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,080
know handboys.

1682
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,080
Yeah.

1683
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,080
I have no context.

1684
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,400
What I enjoyed the most simply because it related to something I was present for was

1685
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,520
the resurrection of Double Batman and introduction of Triple Joker.

1686
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,520
Double Batman, Double Batman.

1687
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
Yeah.

1688
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Expansion into the Triple Joker as well.

1689
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,520
Only a Triple Joker can kill the Double Batman.

1690
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
That is a solid pick.

1691
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
That is proven in the, in the.

1692
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,520
Solid match.

1693
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,040
You know, my favorite meme was the wrestling show that we did.

1694
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,040
The wrestling.

1695
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,040
That was great.

1696
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,480
Everything that happened in that thing was great.

1697
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,560
Everything about it was just solid, solid gold.

1698
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,560
It was.

1699
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,080
Man, I can't wait to do another one at Radcon 2 in one week.

1700
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,640
Actually, oh my God, it's so, it's so soon.

1701
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,640
It's not weird.

1702
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,640
It's like five days from now.

1703
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,640
That is fucking weird.

1704
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:13,640
Well, I don't know if this counts as a meme, but the, the hunger, the hunger games, the

1705
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,040
hunger games battles that the hippo has been popularized.

1706
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,200
He's popularized them a couple of times this year and I really like it.

1707
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,720
We did the Pokemon ones to pick Pokemon teams.

1708
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
And then we did the hippo.

1709
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,720
You just did the one with the PCP.

1710
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,720
That was great.

1711
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,720
It was great.

1712
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,480
It just so happened to be perfect.

1713
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,480
Especially with you.

1714
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,840
Yes.

1715
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,840
And the KKK and Vincent.

1716
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:38,080
Me and the KKK and Vincent and Davoo and, and I was like stealing from, from, from Brunswick

1717
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,080
when he's asleep.

1718
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,840
I think I'm just going to let all of the KKK in the back.

1719
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,840
Yeah.

1720
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,760
When his back was turned, he's too powerful.

1721
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:54,080
That's, uh, and then at the very end, uh, when, uh, Colt came back from beyond the grave

1722
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,600
to execute Jesse.

1723
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,600
Yeah.

1724
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,600
Glorious, glorious.

1725
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Okay.

1726
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,600
I think we're done for now.

1727
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,720
No more questions.

1728
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,720
No more questions.

1729
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,720
But there are so many questions.

1730
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,720
Uh, well, I mean, we can't fucking do this all day.

1731
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,720
How long have we been recording for?

1732
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,720
How long have we been recording for?

1733
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,720
How long have we been recording for?

1734
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
Wait, wait, wait.

1735
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
An hour and 10 minutes.

1736
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,960
We've got like 10 minutes, 10 minutes until, uh, New Year's for England.

1737
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,960
Yeah.

1738
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,080
Oh, should we just hang out for 10 minutes until it's New Year's time?

1739
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,080
Yeah.

1740
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,080
I think we should.

1741
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,080
We could do, we could do a few more questions.

1742
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,080
Okay, tell you what.

1743
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,080
We'll do some more questions.

1744
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,080
Especially the question I won.

1745
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,080
Oh, okay.

1746
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,080
Go for it.

1747
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,080
And then until 5.5, will, will you read it?

1748
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,080
Uh, will I read it?

1749
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,080
Yes.

1750
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,080
Okay.

1751
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,080
I'm looking.

1752
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,080
Uh, one sec.

1753
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,080
I don't, I know.

1754
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,080
Is this just on the Twitter?

1755
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,080
I mean, I'm looking at it.

1756
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,080
I don't.

1757
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,080
Oh, here it is.

1758
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,080
Okay.

1759
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,080
Let's see.

1760
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,080
Oh shit.

1761
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
Okay.

1762
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,080
This is a good question.

1763
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,000
Uh, like you said, at Ninto 55, if the entire PCP were to move to one country, which would

1764
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,480
you guys want, excluding the USA, UK, and Japan for obvious reasons, I might, I want

1765
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,480
to go to Japan dog.

1766
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,560
I want to go be a Gaijin, uh, live in the neat life, but can't do it.

1767
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,560
So.

1768
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,560
Estonia.

1769
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
No, guys, guys.

1770
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,920
Oh, let's, let's just go to Lithuania.

1771
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,920
Yeah.

1772
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,920
Exactly.

1773
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:09,280
Like, guys, Lithuania has like the best, fastest, unlimited interwebs.

1774
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,280
It's, it's.

1775
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,800
Oh, that's all I needed to hear.

1776
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,800
It's great.

1777
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,280
Like, like it doesn't, at least the internet I'm with, like it doesn't have any monthly

1778
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:22,120
limits and it doesn't have like a stupid limit on it for like to download at like 16

1779
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,200
megabytes for whatever.

1780
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,200
It's, what's the, uh, what's the lolliporn situation?

1781
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,240
Allowed?

1782
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,240
Not allowed?

1783
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,240
I, I haven't looked into it, Nate.

1784
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,240
Oh, you've looked into it.

1785
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,240
Don't lie to me.

1786
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,240
Don't lie to me.

1787
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,320
You, you shame me, Nate.

1788
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,320
You shame me.

1789
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,720
I'm just looking out for your best interest, Ben.

1790
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,720
I'm trying to protect you.

1791
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,720
No, stop.

1792
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,720
Get out of here.

1793
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,720
Don't, don't.

1794
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,720
Any other contenders here?

1795
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,720
Yeah.

1796
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,720
The internet's great.

1797
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,720
The food is great.

1798
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,720
It's, it's a good.

1799
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,720
It's a good country.

1800
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,720
Like if you guys, guys, like the best part is if you get paid for it, it's a good country.

1801
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:00,120
The best part is if you get paid by like Patreon, whatever, by like foreign money and

1802
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,720
just spend it in Lithuania, everything would be super cheap to you in Lithuania.

1803
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,720
Yes.

1804
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,720
Yes.

1805
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,720
That's true.

1806
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,720
You're making a solid argument right now, man.

1807
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:11,120
And if you say, if when you're coming in, if you say that you're a war refugee, they

1808
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,960
just like give you a hot wife to rape.

1809
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,720
So, you know, looking, that sounds pretty good.

1810
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,720
Nate, what the fuck, man?

1811
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,720
That's, that's right.

1812
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,720
That's what I hear.

1813
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,720
I appreciate it.

1814
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:21,720
All right.

1815
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,720
We're, we're in Eastern Europe, not Western.

1816
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Yeah.

1817
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,720
Oh, okay.

1818
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,720
My bad.

1819
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,720
My bad.

1820
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,720
We can go to Germany and that'll be fine.

1821
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,720
Actually, the refugees escaped from Lithuania to go to Germany from what I've heard.

1822
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,720
Yeah.

1823
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,720
But let's not go into that.

1824
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,720
But yeah.

1825
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:42,720
I was going to say, oh yeah, yeah.

1826
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,720
It's super cheap.

1827
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,720
I probably could.

1828
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,720
If I moved to Lithuania, I probably could live on what I make on Patreon right now.

1829
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,720
And then I'd never have to draw another comic in my life.

1830
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,720
Thank God.

1831
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,720
Thank God.

1832
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,720
Yes.

1833
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:57,720
I do want to say that I think Nigeria might be a good place because there's this, there's

1834
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,720
this prince who's been emailing me for a while.

1835
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,720
And it sounds like there's some good land deals that are just available to me.

1836
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,720
If I were to, you know, go down there.

1837
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,720
Wireless LAN.

1838
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,720
Yeah.

1839
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,720
Yeah.

1840
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,720
Wireless LAN.

1841
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,720
He's going to give me a budget on my, on my land.

1842
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,720
Well, hey guys.

1843
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:17,720
I mean, it, it's technically, in some respects, it is part of the United States, but it is

1844
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,720
also kind of an extra dimensional location.

1845
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,720
So I'm voting for the city of Quickville.

1846
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,720
Oh, that's a good one.

1847
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:29,720
The city of Quickville, it is a cool place with an average amount of cool places to chill

1848
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,720
at.

1849
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,720
That's true.

1850
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,720
I mean, they've got McDonald's.

1851
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,720
They've got the mall.

1852
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,720
Great places for a date.

1853
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,720
McDonald's.

1854
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,720
Quickville mall.

1855
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,720
The mayor is a benevolent dictator.

1856
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,720
That's true.

1857
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,720
He polices our thoughts for our own well-being.

1858
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:46,720
So I appreciate that.

1859
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,720
Yeah.

1860
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,720
Nobody's gay.

1861
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,720
Nobody's gay.

1862
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,720
They've cured gayness in Quickville.

1863
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,720
And, and asexuality too.

1864
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,720
So there you go.

1865
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,720
Thank God.

1866
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,720
I, I won't go there.

1867
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,720
No thanks.

1868
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,720
You might be obliterated if you set foot mage.

1869
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,720
So watch out.

1870
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,720
Disintegrate.

1871
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,720
I think we should all move to LazyTown.

1872
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,720
Oh, man.

1873
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,720
It's like a paradise.

1874
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,720
It is a paradise.

1875
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,720
I am pretty lazy.

1876
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,720
And we could join Rot and Robbie's team and help them out, catching that sport of flop

1877
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,720
faggot.

1878
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,720
I mean, Robbie Rotten, you fucking...

1879
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,720
Oh, what did I say?

1880
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,720
What did I say?

1881
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,720
You said Rot and Robbie.

1882
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,720
Oh, it's the same shit.

1883
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,720
Really?

1884
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,720
Yeah.

1885
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,720
Come on, dude.

1886
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,720
Wrong way around.

1887
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:27,720
And we're, we're the biggest, uh, uh, anime analysis of LazyTown guys there is.

1888
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,720
So you gotta, we gotta reputation to maintain.

1889
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,720
That's true.

1890
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,720
I was analyzing it in my head every moment I see it.

1891
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,720
Um, okay.

1892
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,720
We need a new question.

1893
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,720
This is, this, this one's dying.

1894
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,720
Um.

1895
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
We'll go on, man.

1896
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,720
Let's see.

1897
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,720
Let's see.

1898
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,720
I'm just sitting here.

1899
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,720
I'm just sitting here vaping, vaping my life away.

1900
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,720
Okay.

1901
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,720
Okay.

1902
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,720
Here's, here's one, uh, uh, by, uh, at unwe on me.

1903
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,720
Uh, how mad.

1904
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,720
So we're looking for a one to 10.

1905
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,720
Will Ben be when mumky beats him again?

1906
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,720
So, you know, what's...

1907
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,720
I can answer that.

1908
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,720
I can answer that question.

1909
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,720
I can answer that question.

1910
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,720
Only you can, Ben.

1911
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,720
It's, it's, it's an, it's an exponential increase every time.

1912
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,720
So like the first time I was upset.

1913
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,720
The second time I was 10 times as upset.

1914
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:17,720
Right.

1915
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:18,720
So next time.

1916
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,720
I detected that.

1917
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,720
Yeah.

1918
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,720
So next time.

1919
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,720
115 times.

1920
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:23,720
I will be, it'll be a hundred times.

1921
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:27,720
And, um, that'll be, that'll be, I think, that'll be approaching the limit of what a

1922
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,720
human being, uh, can survive.

1923
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,720
Yeah.

1924
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,720
If I can sleep up here, Ben.

1925
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,720
It's like mob cycle.

1926
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,720
Sure, mumky.

1927
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,720
Exactly.

1928
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,720
Exactly.

1929
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,720
To get your expectations at a fair level.

1930
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,720
Sure.

1931
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:47,720
I need to assure you beyond a reasonable doubt that you will never beat me in that game.

1932
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,720
I fucking promise you.

1933
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,720
Okay.

1934
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,720
And that's all I have to say.

1935
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,720
Expectations managed.

1936
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:53,720
That's all I have to say.

1937
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,720
Thank you very much.

1938
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,720
Well, I'm excited to do it.

1939
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,720
Oh shit, Ben.

1940
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,720
We, we got a battle.

1941
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,720
I battled mumky already.

1942
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,720
Uh, yeah.

1943
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,720
I am, I, I'm, I'm a little behind.

1944
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,720
Oh, and I want to battle mumky too.

1945
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,720
We'll do that.

1946
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,720
Guys, like, battle on the, like, the page where, uh.

1947
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,720
We go, it, it's, it's, I don't know.

1948
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,720
You gotta add each of his friend codes.

1949
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,720
Oh, you mean, like, are they actually giving me?

1950
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,720
You add friend codes.

1951
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,720
Okay.

1952
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,720
Yeah.

1953
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,720
Yeah.

1954
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,720
Not on Smogon.

1955
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,720
Yeah, okay.

1956
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,720
Although you can't, or not Smogon, showdown, although you can do it there too.

1957
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,720
Okay, here's one, here's one.

1958
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:32,720
Um, guys, by at Sefixer, it's S-E-P-H-Y-X-E-R.

1959
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,720
So fuck you, dude.

1960
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,720
Sefixer.

1961
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,720
Sefixer.

1962
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:40,720
Um, what kind of project would you like to do if you had all the time, skills, money,

1963
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,720
and motivation, et cetera, to do it?

1964
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,720
I would make exactly the same kind of content.

1965
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,720
I might make an anime myself, but other than that, I'd probably just make the same kind

1966
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,720
of shit I like doing already.

1967
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:56,720
If I had a limited whatever, I would like to recreate Homestuck, but starring me and the

1968
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,720
PCP, I'd actually have a good ending.

1969
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,720
Which you did start, which you did start.

1970
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,720
Oh man.

1971
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,720
Oh man.

1972
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,720
Sorry, I just realized what I would do.

1973
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:09,720
I would make a game the one I've always wanted to make.

1974
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,720
What kind of game?

1975
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,720
Kind of a tale too.

1976
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,720
No.

1977
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:19,720
Hippo, I did tell you about it when we met up before Pokemon Go a little bit.

1978
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,720
Remember?

1979
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,720
It's kind of like Pokemon, but not.

1980
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,720
Actually, I'd probably make a game too.

1981
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,720
There's a game I did that's burning in the back of my mind for a better part of five

1982
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,720
years.

1983
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,720
Oh really?

1984
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,720
I would probably do that.

1985
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,720
That's cool.

1986
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,720
Well, mostly I would do the same things I'm doing now.

1987
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:44,320
I would draw comics, but I would outsource some of the work.

1988
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,880
I would outsource backgrounds and things that take up a lot of time and that I don't feel

1989
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,520
nabbed that much.

1990
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,720
I would pay someone to do background art and stuff.

1991
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,720
That's cool.

1992
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:02,360
I would probably make games.

1993
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:12,120
I would start dabbling in mechanically minimal lists, narrative, short game projects is something

1994
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,720
that I've kind of wanted to do.

1995
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:18,720
So you'd make artsy faggots shit and off to worry about the money because you're already

1996
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,720
rich.

1997
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,720
No.

1998
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,520
He's trying to get around saying yes, but we all do.

1999
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:33,080
What I'm saying is that I'm not saying that I would make super artsy shit.

2000
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:38,400
I'm saying that the games I would make would be small and not.

2001
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:43,360
I wouldn't make sprawling RPGs or platforms.

2002
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,920
Are we talking like Tower of Heaven here and that kind of shit?

2003
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,080
I don't have a dream game project that I make.

2004
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,440
I just did something I'd like to dabble in.

2005
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,440
That's all I'm saying.

2006
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,440
All right.

2007
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,440
That's cool.

2008
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:59,720
I want to mention, in my version of Homestuck, since I'm the main character I'm replacing

2009
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,600
John, John Vriska, it's going to be canon.

2010
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,840
It's going to be the entire, as soon as she ends the story, it's going to be the whole

2011
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,840
thing.

2012
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,160
But you said John Vriska is going to be canon?

2013
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,160
Oh, because it's you now.

2014
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,160
Okay.

2015
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,160
I got you.

2016
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,160
It's going to be the whole thing.

2017
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:17,560
It's going to be just 300 million thousand pages of me and Vriska just kissing the concert.

2018
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,200
I'd read that for a dollar.

2019
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,000
Now this is how I know you guys are all gay because when this guy said what kind of project

2020
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,760
you want to do, you immediately thought art project, when there are far more important

2021
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,760
projects to get done.

2022
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,760
Let me tell you what I would do.

2023
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,760
Yeah, but I don't care about the truth.

2024
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,360
Let me tell you what I would fucking do if I had all the time, money, and resources

2025
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,800
to do it, which are already available.

2026
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,800
Star Trekking.

2027
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
I would work.

2028
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,560
We need a warp drive, guys.

2029
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,680
We need a warp drive because right now this planet is a ticking time bomb and humanity's

2030
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,360
existence is at stake.

2031
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:51,040
We've only got, who knows, millions of years, thousands of years, 10 years.

2032
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,040
I don't know.

2033
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,160
We work on our space program.

2034
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,840
We need to colonize other planets.

2035
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:58,920
We need to fucking get out there under the stars because I don't want humanity to die

2036
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,320
like a punk on one tiny ass planet.

2037
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,760
We need a warp drive.

2038
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,200
That's the number one thing we need.

2039
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:10,040
Nate, I hear what you're saying, but I think the right answer is to build Trump's wall.

2040
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,360
Once we solve the immigrant crisis, the warp drives are going to fall from the fucking sky.

2041
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,080
God will then understand that we've done his bidding and will just give it to us because

2042
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,080
that's-

2043
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,080
We need to nuke all of Europe and then we'll probably be safe.

2044
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,080
Sorry, mate.

2045
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,080
You've got to be sacrificed for the greater good.

2046
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,080
Yeah.

2047
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,080
I'll also get-

2048
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,080
Not if I sacrifice you first.

2049
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,080
Right, you know.

2050
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:36,320
Is England also, Gabe, you'd know this, is England building a wall between itself and

2051
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,320
Europe as well?

2052
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,320
It already has a wall.

2053
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,320
It's like the fucking-

2054
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,080
It's called the ocean, isn't it?

2055
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,080
It's the ocean.

2056
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,080
They're an island.

2057
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,080
Yeah, but that's not impressive.

2058
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,080
No, they need to cave in that tunnel.

2059
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,080
Yeah, that's right.

2060
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,080
There's an undersea tunnel, right?

2061
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,080
I don't think so.

2062
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,080
The channel, dog.

2063
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,080
The channel tunnel thing.

2064
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,080
Yeah, there is.

2065
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,080
No, you're right.

2066
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,080
You're right.

2067
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,080
Back me up.

2068
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,080
Yeah.

2069
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,080
He's gone.

2070
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,080
Do you live in the channel, Gabe?

2071
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,080
Is that where you are right now?

2072
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,080
What happened?

2073
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,080
There's a tube, right?

2074
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,080
There's a tube between France and England.

2075
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,080
He's asking if the tunnel exists between England and France.

2076
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,080
Yes, there's a train that goes called the Eurostar.

2077
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,080
I've gone on it a couple times.

2078
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,080
In fact, I've gone on it like eight years ago.

2079
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,080
Nailed the little boy.

2080
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,080
Nailed the little boy.

2081
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,080
Hey, we're two minutes to midnight.

2082
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,080
Okay, thank God, because I'm just filling time here, folks.

2083
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,080
We're filling time.

2084
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,080
Can we squeeze in one more question?

2085
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,080
I wasn't joking when I said I had to pee at the very beginning.

2086
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,080
We probably can.

2087
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,080
How do you deal?

2088
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:37,080
Okay, by at I Like Serial 421, how do you deal with creative dry spells

2089
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,080
when you have people constantly wanting new content?

2090
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,080
I don't know.

2091
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,080
I ignore them.

2092
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,080
You get depressed and you curl up and you turn on the shower.

2093
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,080
I don't have that problem because my projects take so long

2094
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,080
that I never lose ideas.

2095
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,080
You're saying the shower until you die.

2096
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,080
I don't give a fuck about people wanting new content.

2097
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,080
The one that wants the content to be done more than anyone else is me.

2098
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,080
It's only me that I'm a coward.

2099
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:03,080
Maybe he means to best succeed, feed the algorithm or any of that shit.

2100
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,080
Well, there's two options.

2101
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:08,080
You either just do it anyway or you do something else instead.

2102
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,080
Okay, we're getting close here.

2103
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:13,080
Usually what I do is I distract myself by making a give and take video.

2104
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,080
Yeah, that's what I mean.

2105
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:22,080
If you got something you want to do, you either do it anyway or you do something else.

2106
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,080
Who's watching the bombs?

2107
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,080
I'm getting rid of Europe right now.

2108
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,080
What's our time?

2109
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,080
We got seconds?

2110
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,080
23.

2111
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,080
I don't have seconds.

2112
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,080
Let me see.

2113
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,080
We're like one minute away.

2114
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,080
No, it's midnight for me.

2115
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,080
You guys are in the same time zone?

2116
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,080
Yeah.

2117
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,080
They should be.

2118
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,080
They're in England, dog.

2119
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,080
Wait, is it?

2120
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,080
Wait.

2121
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,080
In England it is.

2122
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,080
Here we go.

2123
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,080
For me, it's a few seconds behind, all right?

2124
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,080
Count it down.

2125
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:57,080
Five, four, three, two, one.

2126
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,080
We did it.

2127
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,080
We did it.

2128
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,080
Hippo, how many celebrities are dead in 2017?

2129
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,080
100 million.

2130
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,080
Oh, thank God.

2131
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,080
I'm hoping more die this year.

2132
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,080
All right.

2133
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,080
That's it.

2134
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,080
Thanks for that.

2135
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,080
Man, that was great timing.

2136
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,080
So we're ready to wrap it up.

2137
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,080
Thanks for listening, everybody.

2138
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,080
Thanks, everybody, for asking questions.

2139
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,080
Make sure you tweet us.

2140
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,080
If you got, this was a different one.

2141
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,080
This wasn't a topic that we took from anybody.

2142
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,080
Actually, some people did say talk about 2017.

2143
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:31,080
But tweet us at tpcrastinators throughout the week with ideas for

2144
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,080
things that we'd talk about next week's show.

2145
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,080
And also, when we record every week, we put out a tweet that says,

2146
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,080
ask us questions.

2147
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,080
You know, we responded this fucking tweet with questions and we'll

2148
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,080
answer them as we did right here.

2149
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,080
So if you want to do that shit, go to the Twitter at tpcrastinators.

2150
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,080
Send us shit.

2151
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Thanks for listening, everybody.

2152
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,080
And we'll see you next week.

2153
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,080
Bye-bye.

2154
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,080
Bye-bye.

2155
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,080
Happy news.

2156
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,080
What the hell is wrong with me?

2157
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:46,080
I'm supposed to be making money.

2158
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:51,080
I'm supposed to be creating funny.

2159
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:59,080
Think that the people gladly will pay for artistic genius.

2160
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,080
That's what they came for.

2161
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:07,080
Instead, I'm tweeting, hashtag repeating.

2162
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:14,080
That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling.

2163
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,080
Yeah, it's quite the burden.

2164
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:23,080
It's a hard knock life, being a genius.
