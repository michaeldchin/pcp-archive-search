1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright, let's turn on the game.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're free.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's just play all the video games, whatever it may be.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Alright, I'm gonna start with Pokemon.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And now!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Alright, I'm gonna do Mabeebley's quest.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, Mabeebley's.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's this?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Mabeebley.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Should we introduce the video?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, hey, it's RowdyFuckersCopKillersLIVE!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Live in Ben's room.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome to the indie game clusterfuck.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The game where we fuck all indie games ever made.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, fuck indie games.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't like them.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Nobody really likes them.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We all just pretend to, so we think each other is cool.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If they were good, they'd make a billion dollars.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Look, my favorite AAA game, Undertale.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, we'll probably switch games at some point,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but I, BenSaintofPatrion.com, slash BenSaint,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
am playing Mabeebley's quest,

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
which is like a Mega Man clone, basically,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
by a gay furry on Twitter.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And it's really hard, but it's really good and pretty cool.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do we get to do the Mabeebley?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are Mabeebley.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's do a new game.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll start a new game.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have not actually beaten this game.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've gotten, like, halfway, and then it got too hard,

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and I gave up.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're harsh.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, I'm not going to set up that kind of pushy attitude anymore.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mabeebley difficulty.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mabeebley easy or double easy?

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Be a true hero.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Easy or double easy.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, no.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It sounds like it wants you to play Mabeebley.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No, no easy.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Mabeebley.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Dude, Mabeebley.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Would you get stuck on easy?

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think I was playing Mabeebley.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You played Mabeebley, you fucking bitch.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Fine.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You already got halfway through.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
God.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Easy.

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ooh, I like it.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, yeah.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Your bullets are weird and, like, drop off halfway through.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What I like about this game is that it has the background,

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and it's like...

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh my god.

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Dude.

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Whoa.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Very artistic.

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You got a fucking dick, you got a dick, suck a dick, suck a dick.

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Go, go, go, go, suck the dick, suck the dick, suck the dick.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You guys are pressuring me too much.

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm feeling performance anxiety.

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm already impressed by the prevalence of tics in this game.

68
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's really appealing to my demographic.

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Which...

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Of most sexual...

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The gayden.

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Somebody's got to appeal to them.

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Whoa, okay.

74
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's cool.

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There's a lot of, like, weird creative shit you've never seen before.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, you're like rolling out the video game.

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's like game's art.

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Video game's art.

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Never heard that.

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Kill the art.

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Look at all this art.

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to kill that pencil.

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There we go.

84
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You shoot through walls.

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah, your bullets just kind of...

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They don't go a set distance.

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They go to sort of the end of the screen,

88
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and then just sort of drew balls.

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It seems like, like, programatically it was programmed to just kind of go...

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So wait.

91
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If they're programmed to go to the end of the screen,

92
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
does that mean if you run with them, they will never stop?

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes.

94
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, to an extent.

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It sounds like they sort of detect the edge of the currently visible screen.

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, shit.

97
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, you're so fucking gay.

98
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, he got me.

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What the hell happened?

100
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He fucking turned me into a...

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He hit me with his spotlight and turned me into a piece of art.

102
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I like it.

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Such art in this game.

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Such art, dog.

105
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is pretty cool, though.

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Art in the truest sense.

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a metaphor for art.

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, like, I really meant to finish the game,

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
because, like, there's actually some really great cutscenes and shit that happen

110
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and maybe we'll get to see one or two of them.

111
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And they...

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, you see, you are Mbibli, a creature of indeterminate anything,

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and your enemy is Croco-Bibli.

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
At least we know he's a crocodile.

115
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do we know that?

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Dude, you saw the pipe as well.

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Fucking art.

118
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's how you really know it's art.

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Also, the fact that this is called art world.

120
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Max lives.

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We did it.

122
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I didn't even need those lives.

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This game's the easiest thing in the world.

124
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is three of the max lives?

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, yes.

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't worry, it gets a lot harder.

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, gosh.

128
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, shit.

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're so bad.

130
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, let's see, I dodged that one.

131
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, gosh.

132
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, no!

133
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, no.

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're blowing it.

135
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That was a devious trap game.

136
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hey, this is great.

137
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, how have you guys been doing?

138
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This game reminds me of that one time I went to Las Vegas with no money,

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and I just killed people.

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, this is being recorded at Radcon 2.

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah.

142
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How are you guys enjoying Radcon 2 so far?

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's okay.

144
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'd rather be killing people in Las Vegas.

145
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
As previously mentioned, it's good.

146
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a good time.

147
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, I would download it.

148
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I would download the DLC.

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, that is real.

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Radcon 2.5 DLC.

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We were having snow adventures out in the wilderness today, which was fun.

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There's footage of that that will exist.

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, no.

155
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Did I miss the main event?

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You did.

157
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A snow event?

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, you did.

159
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is what I fucking get.

160
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I did try to wake you on two occasions, so you were just a check-down.

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can believe that.

162
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I am an indecipherable piece of crappy art, just like me.

163
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What a commentary.

164
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So...

165
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, there he is.

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Arch enemy.

167
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Crocodiebly.

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Crocodiebly.

169
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was...

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Crocodiable.

171
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Kill him.

172
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He's a fucking Bible character.

173
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He's a fucking Bible character.

174
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
See, it helpfully notes that he is Arch enemy.

175
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I do like that.

176
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, God.

177
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

178
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He has not accomplished much, if anything.

179
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Uh-oh.

180
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay, all right.

181
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Crocodiebly.

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Just chill a fuck out, dude.

183
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He's such an asshole, dude.

184
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Look at him.

185
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who would do this?

186
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is really beyond the pale of acceptable behavior.

187
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
God.

188
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If there's one thing I hate, it's pretentious people.

189
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Look at his hair.

190
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Look at him.

191
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Dude, look at his fucking...

192
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Whoa.

193
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Look at his comeover, bro.

194
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You can tell he's bald.

195
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, God.

196
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He's really embarrassed.

197
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What is that?

198
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wow, look at his fucking...

199
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wow, real originally, you took some organs out of someone's body that you didn't make.

200
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wow.

201
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, God made those.

202
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, you fucking bitch.

203
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, God.

204
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, all right.

205
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, my fucking God.

206
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm in like...

207
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, I can only move left and right.

208
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That up and down is automatic, but the left and right is up to me.

209
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's what's happening right now, viewer and friends.

210
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

211
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
All right.

212
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, as you can see, this is the best game I've ever made.

213
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
All right.

214
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah.

215
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is not fucking around.

216
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I just killed his Croco Man already.

217
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I mean, I would.

218
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All right.

219
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I would if you would let me.

220
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
God.

221
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not stopping.

222
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, okay.

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're actually doing quite well, Tim.

224
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, man.

225
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, man.

226
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He's spraying piss everywhere.

227
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's shooting at the ball.

228
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This guy reminds me of my...

229
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's shooting at the ball.

230
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This guy reminds me of my teacher in middle school.

231
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Was he a crocodile?

232
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I killed him.

233
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

234
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
HP bar is doing things now.

235
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Son of a fucking bitch.

236
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

237
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
All right.

238
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You know, one time, me and my friends, I was in a gaming club in college and we did a couple

239
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
of game jams because I had a lot of game design stuff at the time.

240
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And one of the things that happened was one of the game jams was about like breaking conventions

241
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
or something.

242
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Whoa, how unconventional.

243
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And there was a whole bunch of stuff.

244
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I know.

245
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We did it in the game that was made for a bunch of things like this where one of the things

246
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that happened was that if you get too much HP because there are HP pickups, it was a normal

247
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
2D platformer.

248
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And if you pick up too much HP health, your health bar extends too far, breaks the barrier

249
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
surrounding it and it just drops off the screen and then you're invisible.

250
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Whoa.

251
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's pretty cool.

252
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

253
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's pretty creative stuff.

254
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

255
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Enough with the intestines.

256
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No.

257
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh.

258
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
An immeasurably long time.

259
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Eventually they got born in parted ways.

260
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, I guess I won't.

261
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right.

262
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
All right.

263
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah.

264
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll call that a victory.

265
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's the moral victory of nothing else.

266
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What?

267
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh.

268
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, this game sure is quirky and fun.

269
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We're going to see another game I like to call...

270
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Undertale.

271
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Undertale.

272
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No.

273
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No.

274
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You watch there are good games that aren't Undertale.

275
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No.

276
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No.

277
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They're Undertale.

278
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They are all Undertale.

279
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Every time you see a good game, this really reminds me of Undertale for some reason.

280
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is a really good Undertale you're playing right now.

281
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
God, that makes me so mad.

282
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You know, Lisa's a pretty good Undertale, but you know, it just doesn't...

283
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It doesn't really...

284
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It doesn't quite live up to...

285
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I mean, there aren't any fucking memes.

286
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The Undertale is...

287
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There aren't any fucking Skeletons.

288
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're sad.

289
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Sad.

290
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
My dick is soft.

291
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You need to suck it to make it hard.

292
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sad.

293
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Sad.

294
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why are you not in this game as well?

295
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You would be a good addition.

296
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What are these people saying?

297
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They're all just saying really sad things.

298
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Damn, you're ugly.

299
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hey, fuck off, buddy.

300
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think the person who made this game has low self-esteem.

301
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's the Mibible.

302
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The Mibible.

303
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That was the Mibible that I almost reached, but I was teleported.

304
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What's the significance of the Mibible?

305
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, you'll see, but you'll see what the Mibible is.

306
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, what's that going on?

307
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You are hero.

308
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, okay.

309
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You are hero.

310
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are hero, Gordon Freeman.

311
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay, we're teleporting.

312
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
All right.

313
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I teleported in front of my own bullets.

314
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay.

315
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You ever want to do that in the battlefield?

316
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No.

317
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No, it's...

318
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's reckless behavior.

319
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
God, Battlefield 3 looks so fucking bad.

320
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Battlefield 3 is my favorite Undertale.

321
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why is this game such a fucking Pokemon ripoff?

322
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Pokemon is a really good Undertale.

323
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, that's true.

324
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Sun and Moon had a lot of good Undertale traits.

325
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, you're going to die, dude.

326
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're going to fall.

327
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Am I going to die?

328
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're going to fall.

329
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Maybe.

330
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, there we go.

331
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

332
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But it was a quirky like...

333
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, the force.

334
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Any second now.

335
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, here we go.

336
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, we did it.

337
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
By the way, I started Audacity in OBS, right?

338
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

339
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm almost positive, but I always doubt this.

340
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I really don't know.

341
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Just check.

342
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, not on this dramatic screen.

343
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, I get it.

344
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They're doing this to kill time while you're stuck in there.

345
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's funny.

346
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I like it.

347
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's quirk.

348
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's pretty good Undertale.

349
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, it reminds me of that one time on Undertale where they were like,

350
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
do you know that we're like a video game?

351
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And you're like playing a video game right now.

352
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I just want to let you know when people forget it.

353
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, Undertale had a lot of good Undertale qualities.

354
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It was all like, dude, like video games and RPGs, bro.

355
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah, it was basically Control-Alt-Delete, the video game.

356
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

357
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It was just all about video games.

358
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes.

359
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Is that elephant a good boy?

360
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'd say...

361
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's the fucking elephant from Dumbo.

362
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Holy shit, he's fucking here.

363
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Heroine Dumbo drank that shit and he was like,

364
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
oh my god.

365
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, wait, what did I do?

366
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oops, I didn't mean to do that.

367
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Just check your audio while you're...

368
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is recording.

369
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is recording.

370
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, we're good.

371
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We're good.

372
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Just kidding.

373
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Just kidding.

374
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Game over.

375
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Game over, fools.

376
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hurry up and get to that rave, dawg.

377
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hang on, hang on.

378
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's where the rave is.

379
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The rave is the city.

380
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Wait, was there a bar at the top and bottom before there was?

381
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
There was not.

382
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Here, just try double-clicking the screen.

383
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Or there might be an option on the top left

384
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
that specifically is like a maximized function of the game

385
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
as opposed to the window.

386
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No.

387
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No, you fucking died.

388
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Wait, there might be...

389
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Try like one of the...

390
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
First, F4.

391
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Unminimize and try F4 or whatever.

392
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

393
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Try some of the other Fs.

394
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
F.

395
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
F1.

396
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
U.

397
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, choose FU.

398
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes, I'm very sick.

399
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know how to do it before.

400
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It makes me want to cry.

401
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, really?

402
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Whatever, just maximize it's fine.

403
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, no, no.

404
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I really want to...

405
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
See, there's got to be a menu because I want to find how to save.

406
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Try right-clicking on the screen, maybe?

407
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No.

408
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's wrong.

409
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's wrong.

410
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Hit enter, maybe?

411
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And go escape, perhaps?

412
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Escape is how we got into this mess.

413
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
On its own, press escape again.

414
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Nope.

415
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Doesn't seem to be doing it.

416
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
First, all the buttons on your keyboard.

417
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let me just tell you, this would never happen in Undertale.

418
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, Undertale has a very concise method of doing anything.

419
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Undertale is always the same thing.

420
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Perfectly ergonomic.

421
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Even when it's trying to do the deal.

422
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Undertale, I really like Undertale.

423
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I respect it forever.

424
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I respect Undertale for continuing to present conventions

425
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and not breaking them whatsoever.

426
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Because I likely used to say the same.

427
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Although, I mean, what if I die?

428
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I haven't saved.

429
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Is that a problem?

430
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, maybe.

431
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I see how I skip...

432
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I buffed conventions and passed the levels.

433
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What about the rave?

434
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know.

435
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What about the rave?

436
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I just really wanted to go that way.

437
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's me.

438
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Sometimes a boy just wants to dance.

439
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Looks like I need three more hammers to, I guess, kill these horses.

440
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hey, it's Tommy.

441
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're a ready-fuck-your-cop killer now.

442
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You are officially a ready-fuck-your-cop killer.

443
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, it's this.

444
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You will soon.

445
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We're sitting here and playing shitty indie games

446
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
that we all love.

447
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Buy yourself a place.

448
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, who's gonna be an indie clusterfuck?

449
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We hate all video games ever made

450
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
unless they were made by Toby J. Fox.

451
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Is the middle initials J?

452
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No.

453
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, he doesn't have a name.

454
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He doesn't have a real name.

455
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was gonna say, the same for Jim.

456
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
All that money he took.

457
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, all that money he stole from me.

458
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Man, go to the rave.

459
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All right, fine.

460
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What the fuck is this shit?

461
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Grind up against a fucking fag, bro.

462
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This isn't a beat.

463
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You know, this game is not as hard as I remember.

464
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No, that's good.

465
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But it does get...

466
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, this is the best fucking level.

467
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay.

468
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So the thing about these games, or this level,

469
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
is it's DVR inspired, and if you hit one of these arrows,

470
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
you don't get hurt, but you do freeze in place

471
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and are shot at, and you can only move

472
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
when you hit the corresponding direction or button.

473
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Cool.

474
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's so fucking great.

475
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay, fuck that up.

476
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And I'm about to die.

477
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

478
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, I died.

479
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay, don't worry about it.

480
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Never mind.

481
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This is the hardest game I've ever made.

482
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
All right.

483
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Does it remind you of that one time in Archeo

484
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
where, like, you were at a magical place

485
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and it was like, dude, you have to fucking do it?

486
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I remember that.

487
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It was the best thing that ever happened to me in my life.

488
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, sad!

489
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, sad!

490
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I feel like I'm a pretty pretty boy.

491
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Mmm, I don't.

492
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Who's that?

493
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Indie games are all...

494
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Indie games are for nerds.

495
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Papyrus.

496
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's my sense.

497
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Indie games, more like Indie games.

498
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's time for a woman, Papyrus.

499
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I can't wait to vote for Donald Trump.

500
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No!

501
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Audience, I said this yesterday.

502
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It was literally the funniest thing that ever happened.

503
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Just trust me on that.

504
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm still with her, man.

505
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm still with her.

506
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm still with her, Papyrus.

507
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm still with her, Papyrus.

508
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm always going to be with her.

509
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's her time.

510
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm not my president.

511
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't know.

512
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You seem to have a few votes to pick from these polls.

513
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, no!

514
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No!

515
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Because he's a skeleton!

516
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
A skeleton!

517
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Fuck my asshole!

518
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Because Donald Trump is a skeleton.

519
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So he has bones to pick with him.

520
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's true.

521
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He's so evil, he's literally a skeleton.

522
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There we go.

523
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Alright, good work, good work.

524
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Keep it up.

525
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So as you can see, the game is really getting...

526
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're just bad.

527
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, and you gotta get the check marks to, like, progress shit.

528
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh, I see now.

529
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What game is this?

530
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's M'Beebley's Quest.

531
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, it's Santa's Quest.

532
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's an independent funded game.

533
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The best game ever made by a gay furry.

534
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No!

535
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know.

536
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I have played it.

537
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you lose this game, that means we'll have to fucking vote for Trump.

538
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, no.

539
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Anything but that.

540
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Um, yeah.

541
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This game is the hardest game.

542
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, no!

543
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Did you see how much fucking damage it took before?

544
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It was ridiculous.

545
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Quite a bit, quite a bit.

546
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It was a sin.

547
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I forgot.

548
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Are you playing on M'Beebley's difficulty?

549
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No!

550
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I am playing on M'Beebley's difficulty.

551
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay, good.

552
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So you're playing like a real boy.

553
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Ah!

554
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No, it's Mediton!

555
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's Mediton!

556
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's Undertale!

557
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why is this game such a fucking bitch?

558
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That is a Mediton.

559
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Uh-oh.

560
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Uh-oh.

561
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Uh-oh.

562
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's like it's taking out a mega ton of info.

563
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's very name-based, man.

564
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No!

565
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Shit!

566
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Undertale!

567
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Shit!

568
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Undertale!

569
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Sin!

570
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Sin!

571
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Sin!

572
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's Mediton, Sin!

573
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You know Mediton!

574
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Shit.

575
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay.

576
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sin, help me clear my semen from the Disneyland Hot Topic area!

577
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Disneyland Hot Topic!

578
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Shit!

579
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Goddamn it!

580
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I think I must goddamn damage that shit.

581
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, Shans!

582
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I love wingmunch!

583
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Sin's real relatable like that.

584
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You know what they say, Shans?

585
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Everyone is a Sora, and everybody else deserves a fuck.

586
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Say it or not.

587
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Say it or not, Shans!

588
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah, something like that.

589
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Are you saying it or not?

590
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Shans!

591
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Where the fuck is Mickey the Mouse?

592
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Shans, why doesn't Donald Trump view me when I ask him?

593
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Shans, why doesn't Trump love gay assholes like me?

594
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He's my president, Shans.

595
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I just don't listen like I love you.

596
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I just wanna help the Trump!

597
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I can't help the Trump.

598
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I love video games, though.

599
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The only thing I love more than Donald Trump is video games.

600
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Sam.

601
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Shans, please.

602
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But only Triple A once.

603
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Shit, no!

604
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, I only love Triple A games like this one.

605
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Shans, why is Ben Saint to Ben Saint?

606
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Why is he shit at everything?

607
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I am the best gamer.

608
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I play on the hardest difficulties, and my experience reflects that.

609
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Shut up, Vincent.

610
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No!

611
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We're acting like you're a separate character.

612
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's an autobiography.

613
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's an autobiography.

614
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Called Tiberius Rising.

615
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Like Monkey Jones.

616
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No!

617
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You guys see Monkey's new autobiography about his school shooting?

618
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, I think it's more of like a manifesto of future plans.

619
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
More like a hagiography, you know what I'm gonna say?

620
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
More like a hate crime.

621
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, the next lives.

622
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh, fantastic.

623
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Just in time.

624
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Everyone's having a great time.

625
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I love the guys.

626
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Those guys are having the most fun.

627
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I wish I were them.

628
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Are they raving or having a seizure?

629
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's hard to tell.

630
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They were having a rape.

631
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
They don't even have anatomy, so who can say?

632
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's true.

633
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, dude, you see how with such dispassion and skill...

634
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No!

635
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Jesus!

636
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'd never say anything.

637
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Please go on about your great skill at video games.

638
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Never ever be good at games.

639
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Perhaps I will.

640
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Perhaps I will.

641
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Shand, I actually pissed my poop into the fighting Nemo's submarine at Disneyland.

642
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, dear.

643
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, dear.

644
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What are we gonna do with you?

645
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We're continuing adventures of Shand's babysitter.

646
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What's his name?

647
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The Undertale fan 589?

648
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, the Undertailer 587 or something.

649
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, some of the Undertailer.

650
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We spent a lot of time perfecting his character.

651
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

652
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He's got a rich lore.

653
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We totally remember his name and everything.

654
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They call him the New Cold Corona.

655
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I do have the New Cold Corona on the Undertailer 589.

656
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I have no wonder if this guy is just calling his carer Sans because he loves Undertale so

657
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
much, or Sans is actually his carer.

658
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
His carer?

659
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I mean, I always vision him in like a Satan orange fur, like praying to Sans to grant these

660
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
wishes that he wants.

661
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I guess that was the interpretation of the Undertailer 589.

662
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This is that rich lore we were talking about.

663
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, exactly.

664
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We're gonna have a zone of psychophedia or dramatic, or we're just like CWC.

665
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Exactly.

666
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There's gonna be tons of fan theories.

667
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The Undertale.

668
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sans, stick your head down my lemon pipe and suck out the bot flies.

669
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I can't feel my skin.

670
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Holy shit, that's disgusting.

671
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I hate that so much, dude.

672
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I hate that so much.

673
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Highly offensive.

674
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Sans, I opened the umbrella in my asshole again.

675
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Tell me, Sans, tell me.

676
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Get the god and she is.

677
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's very important you get the god and she is.

678
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Nothing else will do.

679
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You guys see that fucking skill just there?

680
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I did, I did.

681
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Sans, I was almost killed by a creeper in Minecraft when I killed him.

682
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh fuck.

683
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Sounds like everything's working out here, Undertale.

684
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Also, my dick is stuck in the toaster.

685
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I love to dance.

686
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You have to if you want to survive that thing.

687
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh, I get it.

688
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
He's so good.

689
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, he's right.

690
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh god, here we go.

691
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Is it our boy?

692
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's Flowey!

693
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You know, this is too shape number.

694
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
No!

695
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You read time!

696
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It died!

697
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Okay, it's okay.

698
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I gotta concentrate.

699
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I gotta concentrate.

700
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You turn into Alphys when you die.

701
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You turn into something worthless.

702
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No!

703
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
No!

704
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No!

705
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh god, okay.

706
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Alright.

707
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay, brutal.

708
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You still got this.

709
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I might.

710
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're fine.

711
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Everything's fine.

712
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
This is the easiest game ever made.

713
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's right.

714
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's what they tell me.

715
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh god.

716
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh god.

717
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Ah!

718
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ah!

719
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Ah!

720
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No!

721
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Ah!

722
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He's booking it.

723
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This guy reminds me of one of those little kids from Dr. Seuss.

724
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This guy reminds me of my middle school teacher.

725
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Okay, okay.

726
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I got two more chances.

727
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes.

728
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Love the dance.

729
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Love the dance.

730
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Fuck it up.

731
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Fuck it up.

732
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Kill that nigger.

733
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Kill that nigger.

734
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Right on the map.

735
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Fuck up.

736
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I hate myself.

737
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Very upset.

738
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We hate you too.

739
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Aw.

740
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Not at all.

741
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay, alright.

742
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Maybe you have to be with you.

743
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes, this guy.

744
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Oh, like just go under it.

745
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Oh, that's gonna make it way easier.

746
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

747
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There you go.

748
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Alright.

749
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There you go.

750
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay, that's a strat.

751
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Sans, give me the ultimate strat.

752
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I want to be Undertale!

753
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Hello!

754
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Why is Undertale so fucking hard?

755
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't even remember this part of the game.

756
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm very so disappointed.

757
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This is the DLC, the Greedy Jew, the Tobey J Foxx release.

758
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Tobey, why do you hate Mexicans and women and also the black people?

759
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, I mean…

760
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What are you talking about, Munchie?

761
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes.

762
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Munchie J Foxx.

763
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Munchie the bitch.

764
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Munchie J Foxx is my real life OC.

765
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
He's Tobey Foxx's brother and Andrew Hussie's dad.

766
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Shit!

767
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh, no!

768
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I love his beard shape and I just can't even read.

769
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Okay, I'm gonna blast through it.

770
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay, alright.

771
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
See, I know all the strategies for the level now.

772
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Why does that elephant have to play the game?

773
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
See, it's like Dark Souls, you know, they run.

774
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's like Dark Souls.

775
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
First thing off the bat?

776
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Nothing.

777
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay, I'm really doing good so far.

778
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Did you guys know that Ben Stain's skill at video games is directly proportional to

779
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
how much money he has on paper?

780
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That's right.

781
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Pledge now.

782
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Pledge now.

783
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Stop sucking.

784
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's within your power.

785
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah, I don't know.

786
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Maybe that'll get people to un-pledge.

787
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That was my plan all along.

788
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The quality of the video is directly proportional to how much money he has.

789
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Your entertainment.

790
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Your entertainment.

791
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Whatever that means to you, it's totally different.

792
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You could just watch a better let's player for free, but when you're invested at this

793
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
point, you don't even try to do that.

794
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Wouldn't you rather watch me beat this game and be the coolest guy ever?

795
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Shans.

796
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Shans!

797
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I want Patreon money, but nobody loves me.

798
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Shans, I tried to use my game furry comic about furry gaming, but no give me money.

799
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Shans, I want to play video games, but I don't know how to make money doing it.

800
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Hey, why don't you just call yourself Ben Stain and make yourself a let's play channel?

801
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
All Ben Stain.

802
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And change your words.

803
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh my God.

804
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The lore is that the Undertale are 5 and 7.

805
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh my God!

806
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I was commanded by Shans.

807
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Shans.

808
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And what?

809
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You can't disobey that.

810
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Shans granted you the grace to make you use Shans.

811
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
His pupils went all black, and I was like, oh, better do it.

812
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I think I'm real serious.

813
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah.

814
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Shans, why am I so bad at Pokemon training?

815
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Too real.

816
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't know.

817
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I bet Shans is too real.

818
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Too real.

819
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Too real.

820
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Too real.

821
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What would Shans, if Shans were a gym leader, what type would he be and what would his team be?

822
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Boat.

823
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Ghost.

824
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Boat.

825
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He'd be ghost type.

826
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

827
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah.

828
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Well, sorry for my shitty question.

829
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I didn't even think of it.

830
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's okay.

831
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You have to promise to never speak to him.

832
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Cubone is rock type, isn't he?

833
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
He's ground type.

834
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
He's ground, you fucking Marowak.

835
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And Marowak is ground too, yeah.

836
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Well, now it's fire ghost.

837
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yes.

838
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Which I guess, I don't like it.

839
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I came down on the side and I don't like the old Marowak.

840
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Is he still holding a bone?

841
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yes.

842
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What's the lore with new fire Marowak?

843
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't know.

844
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He's a fire boon.

845
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
He's a fire thingies that they use in Hawaii.

846
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah, he does.

847
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But why would he change his type just because he took up a fucking new hobby?

848
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Because it's sick and it has a good typing.

849
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's a video game.

850
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If something is a new type, he just happens to be able to burn.

851
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Well, except there was already...

852
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I think the thing that sucks is that Cubone isn't also different.

853
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah, that's kind of weird.

854
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That does really suck.

855
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Like, if it was just Cubone, it's just different.

856
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh, I already beat it.

857
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I think what they should have done is they should have just...

858
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Every one of the original Pokemon should have had it a little more.

859
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They should have not have been a lazy cunt.

860
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Go watch the good, great video on Hippocrates channel.

861
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah.

862
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Where he says, fuck that shit.

863
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And then you just go watch the Hippocrates video.

864
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I think I just stole your point about realizing it.

865
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah.

866
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But it's not as important as everyone else.

867
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And there's what?

868
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
There's like 10 of them or something?

869
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
15?

870
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I can't remember.

871
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Not a lot.

872
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What, a lowland form?

873
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah.

874
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
There's like...

875
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's like a dozen or something.

876
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
No, there's a bunch.

877
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
They're all...

878
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I really don't think there's that much more than a dozen.

879
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Hippocrates.

880
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah.

881
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Has a fantastic...

882
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Fuck!

883
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, I could have easily...

884
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I could have easily...

885
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
There's like 16 or so lowland forms.

886
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

887
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah.

888
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The variety in this game is really...

889
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I think the biggest problem with Pokemon is that they just...

890
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They kept making like 100 new Pokemon at a time.

891
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So instead of just making 20 new Pokemon and like refining the gameplay.

892
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah.

893
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Well, there aren't some big changes.

894
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I think there's both of them.

895
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Tom, they make like 70 new Pokemon now.

896
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Well...

897
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
They don't...

898
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
They never make like 100 anymore.

899
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Not anymore.

900
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Not anymore.

901
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
They should only do like 20.

902
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Why don't they just fucking do both?

903
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah.

904
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
They just don't want to.

905
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yes.

906
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
No.

907
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Sounds like they can't make new Pokemon.

908
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Sounds like they got kicked out of the blue bar.

909
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You might wish you might smack one to literally every dish they serve there all day, all week.

910
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
They all...

911
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Look.

912
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm sorry that I...

913
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Was a normal goal.

914
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Now there's like...

915
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You want to catch 1,000 Pokemon, you need to have autism.

916
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, come on Tom.

917
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That is not fair to be like, oh now there's too much stuff and I don't want to do it all.

918
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Exactly.

919
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Well, okay, but that's why they invented the National Pokedex or whatever that lets you

920
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
only...

921
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You catch all the Pokemon from that region, that's like a first tier accomplishment.

922
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But that's not really catching them all.

923
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Like you know that.

924
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Well yeah, but you know, that's on you.

925
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Nobody has ever cared about catching them all except for asking.

926
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You did when you actually could catch them all.

927
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Now you can.

928
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I just...

929
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Tom, you're saying that the game would be better if there was less of it.

930
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No, no, no.

931
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Sometimes that's true.

932
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Sometimes.

933
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I think if the focus was put on adjusting the game mechanics all the time and adding

934
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
just a few new Pokemon...

935
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
By adjusting the game mechanics, do you mean buffing Pokemon that are clearly shaped?

936
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I don't actually...

937
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Honestly, to be completely fair, I don't know what that would entail because I've never

938
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
sat down and actually thought about it.

939
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm just saying I think of that time spent in coming up with like a hundred new monsters.

940
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You're so big and undertale.

941
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It needs twenty more dollars guys to get better.

942
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
If I don't make it this time, either I'll pick a new game or I'll just pick a new level.

943
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
If you're on dot com slash Tommy all over.

944
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Tom, I agree that there are a lot of Pokemon that are bad and they should just fix them

945
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
all and that would be easy to do.

946
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But also they should just keep adding more Pokemon because I like new Pokemon.

947
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I like new Pokemon too.

948
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I don't know if the focus on time...

949
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
There's so many more now.

950
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Is hurting or enhancing?

951
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I don't think it should be hard to do both.

952
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I really don't get why.

953
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Everyone says, oh they couldn't have made you be able to ride any Pokemon.

954
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They would have had to model all these Pokemon.

955
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah, they should have just modeled all the Pokemon because they're fucking Nintendo.

956
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Well, I don't know how much of that is they were too lazy or how much of that was

957
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
they're using a shitty cartridge that doesn't have a lot of space.

958
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, both are their own Pokemon.

959
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I will say that if they had less Pokemon, it would have been much less work to model

960
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
all the Pokemon.

961
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But they only did one.

962
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You don't fuck out of here.

963
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What's up? What do you got there?

964
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Where are you going to put them?

965
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah.

966
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This means plastic.

967
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh, here we go. Here we go.

968
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The Jesse Defense Squad.

969
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
This is the glass versus plastic.

970
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Oh, the glass thing.

971
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Right, but glass is good for doing experiments.

972
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You have your beakers to shit because plastic.

973
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And when you drink out of plastic, little bits of butane can get in your water.

974
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What sounds to me what you're saying is that plastic is for cool people and glass is for bad people.

975
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
What I'm saying, what I'm saying is that glass has uses and plastic has uses.

976
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

977
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Windows.

978
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You could theoretically make plastic.

979
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah, but they're better at keeping them in when they're made of glass.

980
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm sorry about heat. I care about plastic.

981
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Well, you know, in Star Trek, there's transparent aluminum.

982
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Do you not have the windows in Star Trek?

983
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah, we're the Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers.

984
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The most important show.

985
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Okay, let's now officially wrap up.

986
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Also, I'm pretty sure you're really mad at us.

987
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So close the door, come in here or leave if you don't want to come in.

988
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But you can come in. Okay, well, alright.

989
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay, okay. Bye.

990
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah, I know what you're doing.

991
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Sam's a little ass full of made of glass and plastic.

992
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Sam's a little ass full of made of glass and plastic.

993
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So much! Just like my Iron Man saying who I am also.

994
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
No! I was doing good at that time.

995
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
No, one more. No, one more. I'm good.

996
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Sam's, I was up to Ben St. so much in the fact that he can't do anything right just like me.

997
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Why didn't you go to the cave?

998
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
He's a real role model.

999
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Because I want to beat this level.

1000
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You guys aren't hurting my feelings. The game is hurting my feelings.

1001
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm hurting my own feelings by letting myself down.

1002
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Excuse me, I sniz.

1003
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Quick being a Rowdy Fucker.

1004
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You cop killer.

1005
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That's right.

1006
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Sam, well on Splash Mountain, I puked and peed in front of the people but they didn't notice

1007
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
because you know like the water was like splashing and I liked it.

1008
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Just want to let you know.

1009
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You know, I really wonder if the Undertale, if the Undertailer is also, you know, at Drill or Wint on Twitter.

1010
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
They seem to have a lot of similar thoughts.

1011
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh my god, I saw that every treat by Drill is such a masterpiece.

1012
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
They're wonderful.

1013
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The latest one I saw was like, adorn your front door with a festive welcome mat or go to hell.

1014
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah, that's right.

1015
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
What a legend.

1016
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Does anyone know what his icon is?

1017
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's Jack Nicholson.

1018
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Jack Nicholson.

1019
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's what I thought.

1020
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't know from what.

1021
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I really want to know exactly what it comes from.

1022
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
One day I'll find out.

1023
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's some random movie where he actually is just saying Drill at that very point.

1024
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Maybe, maybe.

1025
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Drill!

1026
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So long suckers I say, revving my motorcycle, making a huge cloud of smoke.

1027
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
When it clears, I'm lying there, completely dead.

1028
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's a great one.

1029
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
He has a poetic gift.

1030
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He's so fucking funny.

1031
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I like followed his links on his Twitter to his website or whatever.

1032
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah.

1033
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It was weird.

1034
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It was some kind of comedy that wasn't that great and there was some animations I think.

1035
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I don't even need that potion.

1036
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
This guy.

1037
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
This guy fucks.

1038
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Maybe I can get it later.

1039
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
This guy has fucking sex and I relate to that because I also have sex.

1040
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Please have sex with the all women in the audience.

1041
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1042
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Don't listen to him.

1043
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He just wants to get your attention so he can shut you down.

1044
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
If you're a sexy lady.

1045
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Don't listen to the same.

1046
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And you have Snapchat and Nate Bestman so you can have sex with me in the future.

1047
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah, eventually.

1048
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
All of them in the audience.

1049
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Then please message me so I can kill you.

1050
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Send me a, send me a, send me a, send me a telegram and I'll fax you my address.

1051
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
All women.

1052
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Please kill you.

1053
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
All women.

1054
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Please kill yourself.

1055
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Sad doesn't like women.

1056
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
He told me to kill women.

1057
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You're gonna die.

1058
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You're gonna die.

1059
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You're gonna die.

1060
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
A bunch of dirty bitches.

1061
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Frisk is a boy dude.

1062
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm a mooch out now.

1063
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Dude, sense of the all women.

1064
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Obviously.

1065
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I thought McDowell was a wrestler.

1066
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He should be.

1067
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, you're blowing boyo.

1068
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I don't even know what that thing is.

1069
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's a shame.

1070
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
How long can you stay in those things?

1071
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I don't actually know.

1072
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Maybe.

1073
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Freda?

1074
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Maybe I can.

1075
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Maybe a test.

1076
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Is there another time to find out?

1077
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh.

1078
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Forever.

1079
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well that makes it easy.

1080
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Ah, shit.

1081
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Ah, shit.

1082
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Whatever, I got two more lads.

1083
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Give me tranquility so I can defeat my foes.

1084
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Give me the tranquility to know the difference or whatever.

1085
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

1086
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
To fight my crippling outhaul.

1087
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Sad dude.

1088
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah, it is sad.

1089
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The lore is deep.

1090
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The Undertaleers had a tough life, dude.

1091
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah.

1092
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Why do you think he's come to Sands for coming in his great old age?

1093
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
He's also 85.

1094
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh no, in my experience he was like 28 at most.

1095
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
28, 82, whatever, same thing.

1096
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh.

1097
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Sands!

1098
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I just came because my future self didn't say it just completed a level in the video game.

1099
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yeah.

1100
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I must have gotten a donation on Patreon.

1101
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Boost your finger power.

1102
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I got a mighty hammer.

1103
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
A mighty hammer.

1104
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
A mighty hammer to fucking brain one of those farm animals standing in the way.

1105
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Progressing on my quest.

1106
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Hell yeah.

1107
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
This has a lot of cool imagery.

1108
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I just realized that you have a poster of your own art.

1109
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Someone sent, when that guy sent Digi like a hundred fucking anime posters,

1110
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
he sent me one that was my comic and he sent Davoo one that was, I forget what.

1111
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Oh, it was his waifu, Annabelle or whatever from Kirby 64.

1112
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
There was one of the Maya and there was one of the...

1113
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That was a weird waifu choice.

1114
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah, Davoo's got a weird waifu.

1115
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
No, waifu!

1116
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Anyway, this is a meme.

1117
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh shit.

1118
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Okay, that thing's alive.

1119
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
No.

1120
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
This is a meme level because it's all about hats.

1121
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It seems that I want to play TF2 anymore maybe.

1122
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah I know.

1123
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So, I probably shouldn't bother to continue this level, but I will.

1124
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,720
Yeah, be the legend.

1125
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,920
I don't know what this hat does.

1126
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, just, yeah, all right, you got it.

1127
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,520
You could have jumped, you could have.

1128
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,640
Just go down one at a time, man.

1129
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,520
I know it does something.

1130
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,840
I am.

1131
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,480
Oh, Twitter hashtag, follow me.

1132
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,960
Follow me at TheUnderTaylor.com slash forward, fuck you.

1133
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,600
We should make a Twitter for the underTaylor.

1134
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,800
Yeah, I'm gonna make that right now.

1135
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,640
The Undertaylor 587, yeah.

1136
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,720
Dude, you should just keep that Twitter going forever.

1137
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,440
And just pray to Sands every day.

1138
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:27,880
No, Sands, my fucking dick is, my, my Sands, my dick is fucked.

1139
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,240
Sands have my seam is all over the orphans of India.

1140
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,280
Hey, everyone, it's Jesse.

1141
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,880
You are officially a Rowdyfuckercop.

1142
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,440
Yeah, we're all Rowdyfuckercop killies.

1143
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,640
We're doing a podcast right now?

1144
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,440
Yeah, we're doing Rowdyfuckercop.

1145
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,160
We're doing Rowdyfuckercop.

1146
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,480
No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'll leave.

1147
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,240
Whatever happened to anyone?

1148
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,640
No, I can't do this, podcast is too many people.

1149
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,160
Sands, I can't fucking suck dick if I can't see my dick.

1150
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,520
It was adequately terrible.

1151
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
No!

1152
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
It sounds like it.

1153
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,680
It sounds like you're all being weaves and fucking

1154
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,040
plebes up there at the same time.

1155
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
You're being something.

1156
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,540
Yeah.

1157
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,880
You're being a bunch of whiny bitches, is all you are.

1158
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,600
I was, I was just sucking a lot of dick.

1159
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,640
That's true, I didn't hear you much, which is a surprise.

1160
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,880
You gotta love anime, dude.

1161
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,840
You gotta love anime.

1162
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,360
You gotta love anime, man.

1163
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,320
You don't love anime.

1164
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Sands, I came.

1165
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Oh, Sands.

1166
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
There you go.

1167
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,440
I prayed to you for the orgasm, and it finally came out.

1168
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,200
Oh, oh.

1169
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,000
You should use words.

1170
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Anime is a mistake.

1171
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
No!

1172
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,960
Oh, yeah.

1173
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,680
Sands, I shot a big boob in an anime at one point or another,

1174
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,920
and holy shit, bro.

1175
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,840
That boob was big.

1176
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,760
I can't believe how big the boobs are now.

1177
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,960
And when I was my age, they were like one or two,

1178
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,200
and now they're like 500.

1179
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,280
Is this the new awesome possum?

1180
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,920
This is Mabeeblee's quest.

1181
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Oh, yeah.

1182
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,640
This is.

1183
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,120
Oh!

1184
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,080
Mabeeblee's quest is over.

1185
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,920
Don't judge me.

1186
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,320
Sands, my future self, Ben St. is dead yet again in Miami.

1187
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,880
This is Ben St. found dead in Miami.

1188
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,920
Following a series of gruesome serial killings.

1189
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,480
I like that, Jambi.

1190
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Isn't it great?

1191
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,840
The guy who made all the big digi, all those posters.

1192
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
He made that.

1193
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Awesome, man.

1194
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Yeah, he's a nice guy.

1195
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Yeah, he's a nice man.

1196
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
Me.

1197
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
No.

1198
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Oh.

1199
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
That was a good save.

1200
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
Yeah.

1201
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,840
I thought that was done.

1202
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
No!

1203
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
You didn't know he was going to be there in time.

1204
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
Yeah, right.

1205
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Yeah, right.

1206
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
I didn't.

1207
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,920
I was, I had positioned myself carefully before.

1208
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,280
It seemed arbitrary, but in fact it was RNG manipulation.

1209
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Oh, okay.

1210
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
You don't have to say that.

1211
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
Patreon.com says bullshit.

1212
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
Oh.

1213
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,200
See, every time I die, I'm actually manipulating the RNG to give me a more favorable outcome

1214
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
later in the level.

1215
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Yeah.

1216
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Really?

1217
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Absolutely.

1218
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Absolutely.

1219
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,240
Hey, do you guys know that AGDQ is going on right now?

1220
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
Yeah.

1221
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
I'm following them.

1222
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Do you want to go?

1223
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
Do you?

1224
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
You could be watching that instead of Patreon.

1225
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
No, no.

1226
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
By now it's over.

1227
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
No, don't leave.

1228
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,760
Anyway, but yeah, the weekend's over, so it's all done.

1229
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
Oh, really?

1230
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
Okay.

1231
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Well, they do keep releasing videos on YouTube.

1232
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
I look forward to it.

1233
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Have we done enough?

1234
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
AGDQ.

1235
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
AGDQ.

1236
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Awesome game.

1237
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
The speedrunning.

1238
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
The speedrunning.

1239
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Average game's done.

1240
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
A toast.

1241
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Which I love.

1242
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
I'm all about speedruns.

1243
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
It's super fun to watch.

1244
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Bunch of games.

1245
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Hey, so they started watching more speedruns.

1246
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,880
I understood why that one time you were like shout-outs to thing, because speedruns always

1247
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,760
say shout-outs too, and then they'll name some totally random thing.

1248
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
Shout-outs to data from something.

1249
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
But yeah, I like the shout-out fictional characters.

1250
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,760
They'll say shout-outs too, and then just say a thing that just happened in the game.

1251
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Maybe I did that unconsciously.

1252
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
I think you must have been there.

1253
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
I haven't watched a lot of speedruns.

1254
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Goodbye.

1255
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
I'm never coming back.

1256
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Shem, I was at the Matterhorn bobsled race, and then when I saw the yeti, I just had to

1257
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,760
have sex with her.

1258
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
No!

1259
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Shem!

1260
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Shem!

1261
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,760
No!

1262
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
No!

1263
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
No!

1264
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Oh!

1265
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Shem!

1266
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
How could you do this?

1267
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Shem!

1268
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Shem!

1269
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Why would you create me in your image if I was also there going to be gay?

1270
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Well, you are not!

1271
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Oh my god.

1272
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
This looks challenging.

1273
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
No, no.

1274
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Does it?

1275
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
No!

1276
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Oh yeah, he's a confirmed trans gay boy sexual.

1277
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Trans gay boy sexual.

1278
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
No!

1279
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,760
He's a straight, white male.

1280
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,760
He's white, and he's male.

1281
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
He can't be straight.

1282
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
He voted for Hillary.

1283
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
That's true.

1284
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
He's a straight cuck male.

1285
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,760
No, a white cuck boy.

1286
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
He's clearly gloom gender.

1287
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
That's true.

1288
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,760
That's true.

1289
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,760
Yeah, that's why he's always crying in all his fan colonies.

1290
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,760
He's a boner boy.

1291
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
He's probably what, polyamorous?

1292
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Because he's always got a boner for everybody.

1293
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Hey, you know who's polysexual?

1294
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Steve.

1295
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,760
People made a plastic instead of glass.

1296
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Polyethylene, polypropylene.

1297
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Dude, my dick.

1298
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Yeah, I'm with you.

1299
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Oh, my dick.

1300
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
This is my de-sax.

1301
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,760
I have gone to the gym now, and now I am powerful.

1302
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,760
My dick still doesn't work, so please send help.

1303
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Please send more dick juice.

1304
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
My dick is out of gas.

1305
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
You told me that would help.

1306
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
Oh, you've worked it.

1307
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
You've got to jump really far.

1308
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
You've got to get it.

1309
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
No!

1310
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,760
No!

1311
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
I had it!

1312
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,760
Shans!

1313
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,760
You betrayed me!

1314
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,760
That was just bad RNG.

1315
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
That was just a bad roll of dice.

1316
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
This time it'll be better.

1317
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Shans, when I was a little boy, I saw Megaman,

1318
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
and I was like, why would I make that game?

1319
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,760
I'm not with gay shit, and also I'm a furry,

1320
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
and it's all fucked up, bro.

1321
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,760
Thank you for then making Undertale.

1322
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
Yes, this is very good Undertale.

1323
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Prime cut, if I was to say so.

1324
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,760
Choice Undertale.

1325
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,760
Oh, no, I'm fucking trapped.

1326
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
Wait, you can jump on the platform to the right.

1327
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
I'll die if I get hit once.

1328
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Then you're done.

1329
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,760
You're a nigger!

1330
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
You are a nigger!

1331
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,760
I can do it, I can do it.

1332
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Oh, you can do it.

1333
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,760
I can beat the game in every sense of the word.

1334
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Oh, boy.

1335
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1336
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,760
Get that hat you packed up.

1337
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Oh, boy.

1338
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
You didn't get the hat.

1339
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,760
Quick a nap.

1340
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,760
So you're wearing the hat now?

1341
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Okay.

1342
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,760
I don't know what the hat does.

1343
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,760
It's probably like, at the end,

1344
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,760
you probably have to get into a tuxedo park.

1345
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
Yeah, you have to have formal attire.

1346
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Oh, my God, you know what game we should fucking play

1347
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
on this Clarence's Big Chance?

1348
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Literally the best game ever made.

1349
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
It's pretty good.

1350
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Always kind of had ambitions to play that on T-Bat plays.

1351
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
Yeah, right.

1352
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
Maybe I'll just fucking do it on Ben Sains.

1353
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,760
You should.

1354
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,760
I fucking love Clarence's Big Chance.

1355
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,760
I actually have completely forgotten why I liked that game.

1356
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
Because it's fucking the best game in every way.

1357
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,760
Well, yeah.

1358
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,760
Just shut up.

1359
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,760
Just shut up, that's all you need to say.

1360
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,760
Well, you know this for me.

1361
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
No, I'm not saying it's bad.

1362
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
I'm just saying it'd be cool to play it again,

1363
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
because I forget what was good about it.

1364
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
Oh, Shads!

1365
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
Shads!

1366
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Shads, why did you invent death that made me

1367
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
experience it over and over?

1368
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
He invented death.

1369
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,760
That was a dick move, Shads.

1370
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,760
He invented death just for this guy.

1371
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,760
Shads!

1372
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,760
Oh, Jesus.

1373
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Shads, why am I blind in the future?

1374
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,760
I'm really shitting the page.

1375
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Yeah, by the way, guys, you're sitting on my bed,

1376
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
which I literally shit in.

1377
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Awesome.

1378
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
Yeah.

1379
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
What?

1380
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,760
I mean, where else would you shit?

1381
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,760
Shads told me to.

1382
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Shads only shits on the toilet when I'm not looking,

1383
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,760
so I don't know what's happening.

1384
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,760
What is a toilet anyway?

1385
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,760
What is a toilet?

1386
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,760
If nothing but a wriggling mess of lies

1387
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,760
and fucking that shit that you know when I'm showing it.

1388
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,760
What is a toilet but a wriggling mess of lies?

1389
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,760
It can't be real if my eyes are real, Shads.

1390
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,760
You can't fool me.

1391
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,760
Stick this semen down my lemon pipe,

1392
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,760
and hopefully I will have two semen instead of one.

1393
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,760
That's twice as many.

1394
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,760
I can take one person in my town.

1395
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,760
No!

1396
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,760
I want to go, but I'm busy playing the best game in the world.

1397
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,760
You can go if you want.

1398
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,760
No, I don't want to go.

1399
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,760
Okay.

1400
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,760
Wait, can you pick me up? Everything?

1401
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
Yeah, can you give me a fucking...

1402
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,760
Okay, goodbye.

1403
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,760
Shads, give me a text.

1404
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
Shads, give me McDonald's.

1405
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,760
I mean, I need a 40-piece ticket, but not Shads.

1406
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,760
Shads, we need to be friends.

1407
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,760
We're a big baby.

1408
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,760
We're a big world.

1409
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,760
Goo Goo Gaga, please send me a breast milk shot.

1410
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,760
It's the only way.

1411
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Get out of here.

1412
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,760
You're so fucked out of here.

1413
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,760
Let's play.

1414
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
Yeah, we're doing Mbibli's Quest.

1415
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,760
I actually do want some chicken nuggets.

1416
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
Wait, wait, you played Mbibli's...

1417
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
Shit.

1418
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,760
You played Mbibli's Quest, right?

1419
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
For like 15 minutes, it was too hard.

1420
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,760
Yeah.

1421
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Fuck, I want Nuggets, but I don't have cash in my Nuggets.

1422
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
No!

1423
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Oh, wait, I didn't die, but I fucking died.

1424
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,760
I want the Nuggets, fuck.

1425
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,760
Sick, bro, thanks.

1426
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Thank you, Shads.

1427
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
Thank you, Shads.

1428
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,760
You know how it is with me and my Nuggets.

1429
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,760
You know how much I love my Nuggets, Shads.

1430
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,760
They just get everywhere when I go to town with those Nuggets.

1431
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,760
Those fucking Nuggets don't know shit.

1432
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,760
When I'm in the room with my Nuggets, they get very scared.

1433
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,760
They go white like a sheet.

1434
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:47,760
When I eat Shads, I love chicken nuggets because I hate blacks.

1435
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,760
No!

1436
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,760
No!

1437
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,760
Fucking dammit!

1438
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,760
That again!

1439
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,760
What, Shads?

1440
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,760
Take one more person.

1441
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,760
I'm not going.

1442
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,760
No.

1443
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,760
This is very important.

1444
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,760
We're focused on protecting Shads!

1445
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
Shads!

1446
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,760
This is the worst place.

1447
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,760
You're doing it, man, you're doing it.

1448
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,760

01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,480
messed it up by like blowing something up with the robot that needed to be here

1603
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,440

01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,040

1674
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,960

1675
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,960
oh you got a thing

1676
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,960

1677
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:24,960
other bits

1678
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,960
i hope that i hope that the fact that

1679
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,960
i died to um

1680
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,960
violent rock doesn't mean that like the fact

1681
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,960
that i beat human eebly is erased

1682
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,960
yeah though that may or may not even make

1683
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,960
a difference

1684
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,960
i feel like that might be possible

1685
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,960
considering that like nothing happened

1686
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,960
so maybe you had to hear the actual level

1687
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,960
of gay pride

1688
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,960
i don't think so i think cause like

1689
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,960
next time you fight human eebly he has fewer

1690
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,960
clothes on because you knocked his suit off

1691
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,960
and like i knocked his suit off so i'm pretty

1692
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,960
sure it counts

1693
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,960
whatever counts he means

1694
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,960
i mean you have to make him completely naked

1695
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,960
you have to embarrass him beyond

1696
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,960
yeah yeah the last time you fight him

1697
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,960
he gets a stick out

1698
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,960
really

1699
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,960

money is the root of all the evil

1715
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,960
money is the root of all the evil

1716
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,960
but i don't know what the root of all the root

1717
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,960
of all the bot flies

1718
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,960
that potion doesn't actually restore your HP

1719
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,960
it only restores your lives

1720
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,960

01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,960
even if it won't do anything

1723
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,960
is there anything funny in bot flies

1724
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,960
no

1725
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,960
i don't think so

1726
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,960
let me think

1727
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,960

1728
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:06,960

1729
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,960
i went through everything

1730
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,960
you sifted through the list you keep

1731
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:12,960
yeah

1732
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:13,960

01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,960
obviously

1739
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,960
it's not really annoying

1740
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,960
those

1741
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,960

yeah

1748
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,960
does the bullet always go at the same downward angle

1749
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,960
it doesn't go down it just goes straight ahead

1750
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,960
oh yeah i guess you're right

1751
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,960

01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:09,960
that's true

1785
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,960

01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,960

1834
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:31,960

1836
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,960
try just hit him like three times

1837
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,960
and then focus on the blue

1838
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,960
the blue should be

1839
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,960
sans

1840
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,960
why did you do this to me samuel

1841
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,960
i don't actually need to beat this guy

1842
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:49,960
but i really want to

1843
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,960
because i hate him and he must die

1844
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,960
okay no one shoot game over

1845
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,960
and we have to go do a new game

1846
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,960
because that's the entire point of the bush

1847
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,960
as soon as i beat this guy

1848
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,960
and then find them a bible

1849
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,960
pdrall.com

1850
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,960
we're about to find them a bible

1851
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,960
after this we find them a bible

1852
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,960
i guess this is

1853
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,960
this game is for finding jesus

1854
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:10,960
yeah this is a bible dude

1855
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,960
it's the most powerful artifact

1856
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,960
so you're a furry

1857
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,960
who realizes the area of your way

1858
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,960
to try to find jesus

1859
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,960
the bible isn't saying

1860
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,960
that shell not yiff dude

1861
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,960

that shell only yiff

1863
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,960
that shell

1864
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,960
that shell only yiff

1865
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,960
that shell indeed

1866
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,960
that shell only yiff

1867
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,960
if thy woman has no furry boobies

1868
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,960
then she is killed instantly

1869
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,960
