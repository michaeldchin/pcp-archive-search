00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:18,120
I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:28,160
Hello everyone. Welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,720
Saint and Gibbontake is here as well. I'm here. I'm also here. It's the two casts. We haven't had

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,560
one of these in a while. For some reason. It feels like we have had two casts. It hasn't been,

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,320
actually. There's been a guest or there's been Tom. There's been three for a while.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:56,800
I think you're right. I think you're right, but I don't know why you would be right. Why would

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:05,600
you do this? I have to make up for last episode for being slightly wrong.

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,480
Too much benefit of doubt. I'm still not convinced Riley is like an evil mastermind.

10
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,880
I definitely gave him too much credence. I was too on the fence on that one, so that is my bad

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,360
a little bit. I think it's maybe giving him too much credit to think that he is like some kind

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:40,080
of mastermind or whatever. On the one hand, I am completely right and therefore the best thing

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,080
to do is agree with me unconditionally. On the other hand, I can't. I mean, agreeing with Ben

14
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,040
saying, could you imagine? On the other hand, every single comment,

15
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,400
every hundreds of comments in the last episode saying, God, I hate Ben, but he's so right.

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,080
Every single one. Yeah, those are funny. I have issue though. Here's an issue I got.

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:13,040
Wait, let me let me send it. I was going to say, on the other hand, I kind of understand if you

18
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,840
feel like you don't have all the sides, then don't not coming to any conclusions. I feel like you

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
should have had all the information. It was all there, but if you didn't have it, you didn't read

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,600
it, you never got around to it, then okay, fair enough. If you're like, well, I'll withhold judgment

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,600
until I'm satisfied. I don't think I was totally wrong, but I can see how people are like, oh,

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,800
that's cringe game. I'm like, yeah, sure, sure. Yeah, I can see both sides of that issue.

23
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,880
But yeah, the issue I have was with the group of commenters who were being like

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,120
outwardly, openly transphobic towards Trixie wanting to even towards me.

25
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,520
There were a handful. There were a handful of those and they were all bad.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,040
I don't like that they're mixed in there. They're embarrassing. They're embarrassing when I see

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,920
that. It was really quite, you know, because they hear like, oh, a trans person doesn't like

28
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,080
people who are being transphobic or saying things and like, haha, whatever.

29
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,680
But like, there's two things to it, right? There's one, it's despicable, die, but also,

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,240
it sort of ruins their own argument against Trixie. Like, if you have problems with her,

31
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:44,880
like the trans stuff, it sort of like to include transphobia in there is like,

32
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,120
antithesis, it goes against your own argument because you're sort of muddying the waters with

33
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,600
stuff that actually doesn't have anything to do with it. Because they don't know what

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,720
people are, right? Did you even listen to the episode? Do you even know what's going on? Do you

35
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,320
even know what the actual problem is? Were you even paying attention? Yeah. Well, I think they

36
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,600
all know, right? It's just that they ascribe like being trans equals bad to that whole thing as well.

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Like, oh, did you know Trixie? They kept saying did you? So I'm thinking about it. But like Trixie's

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,000
trans, therefore, she's stupid and would do all these things. Oh, that's why. Oh, that's why.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,960
That's why she did all these stupid things and is a bad person.

40
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,880
It's like, it's, it betrays a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding of Trixie and also of,

41
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,360
you know, they don't know like the transfer perspective of trans people is just that they

42
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,320
don't understand what it is. Like, it's, they don't care to know what it is. And so they make

43
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,760
big assumptions, usually very negative ones about the, you know, trans people in general.

44
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,360
And it's like, if you know your shit, you realize that it has nothing to do with

45
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,040
the arguments against Trixie. And so it allows people who do know their shit about trans people

46
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,800
to dismiss arguments that include transphobia in them. So you're doing yourself a disservice.

47
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,040
Also, fuck you, because that's horrible. You shouldn't be your bigots. It's kind of a bad

48
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:24,480
thing to do. It's not great. It frustrates me because Trixie is legitimately delusional.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,080
But when I say that, those people think I mean something else. They think I'm agreeing with

50
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:40,640
them about something that I do not agree with them about. It's just, it just comes from a

51
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,520
place of ignorance. And that's cringe, like on its own, aside from all the political stuff

52
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,240
around, you know, surrounding it. It's just stupid. It's just cringe on its own. Imagine,

53
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:04,240
imagine being like, they just don't know what words mean. They just haven't thought it through

54
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,400
and are like angry that like the world is more complicated than their sixth grade understanding

55
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,000
of things. That's, I feel, I would feel pity. I would feel pity if I didn't find them so

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,160
despicable and want them destroyed. Yeah. Yeah. And it's been like annoying because I like, I want

57
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,840
to like say yes, I agree with Ben. Yes, Trixie is bad. And then that's right. It's all the

58
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,080
things that people associate with that are assumed because a lot of this drama around Trixie,

59
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,360
if you didn't watch the last episode, go watch the last episode of the Progress News podcast

60
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,920
where we talk all about it. But like a lot of that stuff is on Kiwi Farms, which is like, you

61
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,800
know, like literal like scum fuck place website. Like you don't want to be there.

62
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,760
Those guys, it's, I've said, I've said this before, but those guys are so embarrassing because

63
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,720
like they pretend they have this very, very thin pretense of like, we do not take a side.

64
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,080
We do not, we are above petty concerns of like whether you call this person a he or a she.

65
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,160
It's totally fine to call them a he, even if they're a trans woman, because it doesn't matter.

66
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
Like call them whatever you want. But if you do that, if you don't do that, if you call them a

67
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,720
she, people in the thread will lambast you and make fun of you and demand that you stop. They get

68
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:38,080
upset, which is pretty cringe, pretty cringe, pretty cringe to be triggered by pronouns bro,

69
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,320
in my opinion. Yeah, that was basically it. It's just sort of like, I don't like that there's that

70
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,920
element of it. And I would encourage everyone who has a problem with Trixie to, you know,

71
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,920
not hold back just because you're afraid of being called a transphobe, just leave the transphobia

72
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,280
out if it's in any point part of your reason why Trixie is bad, because it's stupid. You don't know

73
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:13,200
what you're talking about with regards to that. It's, it's, yeah, it's, it's, it's, you're, I don't

74
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,480
know, if you think that's the problem, then you're just, you're just confused. You're just,

75
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,520
you're just confused because two things like happened at the same time. I don't know.

76
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:35,280
I mean, it's not like being trans is, is like, like, it's not like being trans is like,

77
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,840
like not indicative of anything like this completely the same. Like obviously,

78
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,760
she's changed a lot through going through this transition. She's changed her mind about certain

79
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,360
things. She's changed her perspective. But that's not like a blanket thing that is like, oh, trans

80
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,560
people, they change always for the bad. And that's why trans people are stupid and insane.

81
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,680
And it's like, no, that doesn't, it doesn't track in any way. Lots of people transition

82
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,240
in different ways. It's a very personal thing. It really has nothing to do with anything other

83
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,440
than the specific person that you're talking about. You know, anyone could be trans and they

84
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,160
will all transition in the way that they would, you know, because that's who they are.

85
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm glad you brought this up. Most, most people commenting seem to be on board, but definitely,

86
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,960
definitely a handful were confused. They were confused. And, you know, it's good,

87
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,160
it's good to set them straight, set them on the right path, the far right path again.

88
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,200
No, that was so fucking funny. I listened back to most of the episode and that joke is like,

89
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:49,440
I don't know. So right. So right. So I'm so right. I'm alt right now. Dab, dab, dab.

90
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,600
I don't know. Yeah, that's about it. That's all I had to say on that topic. I didn't really want to

92
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,000
talk about drama all over again because it's like, no, not really. What else is there? What

93
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,200
else is there to really say about it? voicemails? No, Ben. Yes. Yes. What have you been doing the

94
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,360
past week? What's been going on in the same past week in the cathedral? Well, I mean,

95
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,640
I haven't really been. Oh, wait, Ben, happy birthday. Oh, yes. You had one of those. It was my

96
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:38,720
birthday four days ago as of this recording on the seventh. Yes. That was pretty, pretty good,

97
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:47,280
I guess. That was, yeah, they confined me now. I got a lot of, I got a couple of nice pieces of

98
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,160
birthday fan art on Twitter. Thank you to the people who made me those. I really liked all those.

99
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:04,160
I don't know. That was fine. I didn't really, I didn't really do anything. I did go and see

100
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,640
Munchy and Kazzy as a sort of late birthday hangout yesterday, and that was fine.

101
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I don't know. I'm 33 and I'm dust and bones. I'm 33 and I'm drinking pee.

102
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:33,280
Yes, please. Ben, you look, you don't look a day over, you don't look a day over 32.

103
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:41,360
What's your secret? Well, zip, zip down and grab a, grab a bucket and a bucket.

104
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,120
Well, yeah, because you got to store it. You got to store it over long periods.

105
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:55,600
It, you know, you got to age it. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it gets more powerful the longer it's,

106
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,960
it's steep. Terrible. Oh God, I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up just thinking about it.

107
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,480
Fuck, I don't even, what did I do? What did I do on my birth? Did I do anything? No. Did you wake up?

108
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,600
I did. I, unfortunately, I did. I feel like I'm forgetting something.

109
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,480
Oh, whatever. I got, I got that. Oh, Nate and Michelle called me. That was, that was cool.

110
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,360
I don't know. Whatever. It's fucking, I didn't do anything.

111
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,440
I found some new, there are some new energy drinks, though, that are, that exist now and

112
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:45,680
being out yesterday. We found some and I tried some and I didn't, I didn't love any of them. I was

113
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,680
really disappointed. Some of them had really cool flavor names, but they weren't that good.

114
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,320
Rain has a new flavor called white gummy bear, which is like a great idea and was very exciting.

115
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,000
But it was just okay. It wasn't like my favorite or anything. It was just fine.

116
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,200
There's a, there's a new, there's new monster ultra. There's ultra gold and ultra watermelon.

117
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,800
What does the ultra do? Is it just the ultra? No, the ultra is the, it's the different flavors,

118
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,040
but they're all like zero sugar, like zero calorie. What is there? There's white, there's

119
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:32,800
ultra white, ultra, ultra black, ultra violet, ultra blue, ultra sunrise, ultra, there's ultra red.

120
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:40,320
Ultra brown. Now there's ultra, now there's ultra gold and ultra watermelon. Oh, there's ultra rose.

121
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:50,480
No, Rosa, Rose, whatever. Oh, ultra paradise. Ultra paradise is the one that looks like slime

122
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,560
because it's like super bright green. And I, this blew my fucking mind. I was so sure that

123
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,760
ultra paradise was green apple watermelon flavor. And I remember thinking to myself,

124
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,800
ooh, green apple watermelon, that sounds really good. I can't wait to try that. And then trying it

125
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,600
and thinking, hmm, that's really good. And tastes just like green apple and watermelon.

126
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,160
Everything's, everything's coming up millhouse. And, but I was looking up what the new flavors are.

127
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,880
And apparently ultra, ultra paradise is not green apple watermelon. It is kiwi cucumber

128
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:32,400
lime flavor. And this is, this has changed everything for me. Nothing will ever be the same.

129
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,200
Maybe, maybe it's all in your head and it's actually just a bunch of sugar and you just think it's

130
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,880
a fruit when it's just sugar. It's just, it's just, it's just the color of the can that tricks me

131
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,920
into thinking they taste different. Yeah. I could believe it. I could believe it.

132
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,640
I don't know. None of the, none of the new flavors blew me away. I was a little disappointed.

133
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,800
There were opportunities there. Wasted opportunities.

134
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,760
It's just, how, they didn't fill the void. The, the, the new, the new monster ultra

135
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,760
colors didn't fill the void inside me. What, what should I do?

136
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,240
From being one year older, you have an extra year's worth of voice to fill. You've been collecting them.

137
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,560
I've been, I've been void gazing. I've been chasing it. Yeah.

138
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,320
I just, I just gotta find something else. Gotta find, gotta find meaning. I can't,

139
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,520
I think, I think I, I've said this before, but I think I've finally hit the point where I have no

140
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:52,320
more joy. I have no more joy to extract from Noida anymore. I, I'm just, I've got a game going

141
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,520
right now. My wand is amazing. I'm at the last boss and I'm like, well, I could go and collect orbs,

142
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:08,640
but what's the point? You know, what's the point? I know that feeling right now. It's,

143
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:15,600
it's in Minesweeper. Even though Minesweeper is like endlessly fun, I'm like, I can just complete

144
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,760
like an evil sized board in no guessing mode. Evil sized. Yeah. And it'd be like clickity,

145
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,640
clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity, clickity,

146
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,680
down the track, down the Minesweeper track. And I completed it and I was like, ah, yeah.

147
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,960
Well, I can do that now. It's no longer that much of a challenge. Yeah. Just the times I lose is

148
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:42,240
usually just when, oh, it's very difficult and, like, I can't do it, and then I lose. Or I just

149
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,080
slip my finger, but if I can, you know, if the, if there's no, like, big guess work,

150
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,600
I'll just go all the way through and I'm like, okay, I've spent so long listening to

151
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,360
YouTube videos and playing this game. I don't care about what I'm doing, but I guess I'll

152
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:07,280
do another one. Oh, yeah, I guess I'll just do another, I guess I'll just start up a new

153
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,880
Noida because I beat the last one. Okay. I've been playing Dark Souls as well, that sort

154
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,400
of thing where I got the Black Knight Greatsword early on. I was like, oh, I guess I should

155
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,560
do a strength build. And I just played the game with a strength build, one-shotting most

156
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,680
things. It's like, this is so boring. I've played the game like this at least two times

157
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,920
all the way through. And it's not fun. Dark Souls 1 is very slow. The Black Knight Greatsword

158
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,360
is extremely slow. But I know all the enemies, I know all the places, I know everything. I

159
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,800
can just run through it, kill everything, grab everything, kill the bosses. I'm like,

160
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,760
I spent like three, four hours to last, you know, that day just doing that. And I didn't

161
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,320
enjoy myself. I was just on autopilot. I was playing the thing.

162
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,320
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,240
Why go to be like that?

164
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,480
Where am I going to get? The dopamine well has dried up. We got to find more. We got to

165
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,600
migrate somewhere. We got to be nomads and roam somewhere to find new supplies.

166
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,000
I think it's just because it was so easy to click on. I've been, we wanted to get into more

167
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,200
into Subnautica. And that was pretty cool. Subnautica seems scary.

168
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:40,480
It is. That's why I liked it. I played it and it's big and scary and wet and it's an ocean,

169
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,120
you know, like a big scary wet ocean. And the day-night cycle causes it. Because it's

170
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,640
you know, an alien planet. There's no artificial light anywhere. As soon as the sun sets,

171
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,160
underwater is like almost completely pitch black. And if your torch or your flashlight, I

172
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,240
should say, that can run out of battery and you have to like collect materials to craft

173
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,680
batteries. So you could be out in the middle of the ocean. The sun could set. Your torch would

174
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:15,320
be out of juice. And then you'd be right at the deep down and scary. There's big scary monsters

175
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:21,720
making noises. And it could be anywhere 360 around you because it's, you know, water. It's great.

176
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:29,880
The idea of a giant like beast looming up out of you, at you out of the depths of the sea is like

177
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,200
one of the scariest things I can even imagine. Oh, dude. There was this one bit

178
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:46,280
where I, you can only go so far down with your regular like mask, what do you call it? O2?

179
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,360
The thing you breathe, canister, you need like to upgrade it so you can dive deeper and stuff.

180
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,640
So I can go down a certain way. And then I got that upgrade and then I found a cave. And I was

181
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,520
like, oh, let's go down into this cave now that I can. I went really far down and then it opened up

182
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,560
into this gargantuan like underground cavern with very strange, completely new foliage and

183
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,080
flora and fauna and like different fish I'd never seen before. And it was all just this

184
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,360
out of reach. And then there was big scary screaming noises. I was like, ah, no.

185
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,280
Like it was very, very, very dark because the sun can reach down there. So I was like,

186
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,600
I had to throw a flare down and it just kept going down. I was like, no, no, no, no, no.

187
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,440
If this is the next part of the game, I don't want to play anymore. I don't want to go down here.

188
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,280
Yeah. Yeah. Wait, you have a VR?

189
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,360
It's not VR. Maybe it is VR, but I don't have one. You can just play it with a controller.

190
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,840
Oh, I thought Subnautica was a freaking VR game. There's a non-VR version?

191
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,480
I don't know. It definitely is in VR. You can play it that way, which would make it so much

192
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,400
scary. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You have a VR, so you could play that version if it exists. I haven't

193
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:15,240
seen it. But I won't. But I fucking won't do it. I mean, it's very satisfying overcoming these fears

194
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,520
because when you're first plunked into the ocean, you don't know anything. So anything could be

195
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,000
like, you're thinking, okay, sharks, are they going to come? How am I going to respond to that?

196
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,600
Oh god, I don't know how to play. I don't know how to move. Left, right, up, down. Oh my god,

197
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,360
what the fuck is that? And then you're constantly running out of food and water. You have to find

198
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,440
materials to cook things so that you can live, so that you can disinfect seawater, so you can drink

199
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,600
it. So there's a time thing. You can't just relax. You have to keep going out into the ocean to get

200
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:59,240
things. It forces you to face the scariness of the unknown until you're comfortable in a certain

201
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,560
area and then you branch out a bit and then you get more materials. You find secret materials,

202
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,440
special materials. You get gold and you can make super computer chips and you can craft vehicles

203
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:15,320
that can go even further. You make beacons and you can build underwater bases.

204
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Can you build a chainsaw wand, though? I didn't think so.

205
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,160
Noida 1, Subnautica 0.

206
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,920
I don't know about a chainsaw, but you can definitely get a drill at some point to drill

207
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:39,640
through big veins of iron or it was not iron. I think it's not iron. That's pretty good.

208
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,880
Yeah. Very nice. Impressive.

209
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,080
So are you saying, so is it terrifying or no?

210
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,120
It is terrifying, definitely at first.

211
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,320
I feel like it's not supposed to be like a scary game and yet I feel like just the feeling of being

212
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:06,280
in that in the sea with the possibility of monsters is just, it's too scary even though it's not

213
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:15,320
trying to be. I think it is trying to be pretty scary. Because it's the unknown and you can't

214
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:22,600
see you very far because it's murky and there's these big huge kelp. I don't know. They're not

215
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,040
called kelp because this is an alien planet. Everything has a funny name. There's these

216
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,880
huge forests of kelp and you can swim through them, but obviously they block your vision and then

217
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:39,640
you hear a weird snarl from some predator and it could be attacking you, but it also could very

218
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,920
easily be attacking some other fish. So you don't know whether a prompt from an audio cue is

219
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,480
something that you should be wary of or something that you could get used to just happening because

220
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,800
some creatures, they just make noises. So you have to get used to all of these things. It is

221
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,960
supposed to be like venture into the unknown and figure it out because you crash landed and

222
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:12,440
nobody is there to help. You have to get your scanning thing and you craft a scanning thing and

223
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,920
then you can scan items like creatures, but you have to hold the scanner on them. So if I needed

224
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,880
to scan a predator to see what its weaknesses are or whatever, I would have to get in range of one

225
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,600
to scan it for long enough and hold the scan beam on it while it chases me and I was like, no, no,

226
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:40,280
no thank you. But yeah, you can build up your knowledge database of all the things you've

227
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:47,080
scanned and things you understand. It's such a satisfying progression of that kind of survival

228
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:55,160
game. I think you really would enjoy it. Yeah, I could see there's aspects of it that I do think

229
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:04,280
seem pretty cool. And I think I watched Joseph Anderson review of it. Do you know him? I think

230
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:13,000
I saw that as well. Yes, I know him. He's the project methematosus lol. He pretty much is,

231
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,640
who actually makes videos, Lamal. But yeah, it seemed cool and I considered playing it for a

232
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:28,520
little while, but I never got around to it. I think maybe the reason is because my current set

233
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:40,920
up in my room is like, it's not quite big enough to make VR work. I can use the headset. I can just

234
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:49,000
barely sort of make it work, but it's a little smaller than is optimal. And I have a problem

235
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:59,240
with, I set up the sensors and they work and they have enough space, but I can move in ways where

236
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,240
the table will clip between me and the sensor and it'll stop sensing me because the line of

237
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,680
sight is interrupted and stuff. It's just a little bit inconvenient. It doesn't quite work as well as

238
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:20,600
it should, which is a bummer. I think I watched a video at the Xammon Life of Gaming, talked about

239
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,680
Subnautica in a best of 2018. I think that's why I was so interested in it because he really

240
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,440
sold me on how it works. Xammon Life of Gaming was that channel that Jesse liked or he knew the guy

241
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,760
who made it, right? Jesse knew the guy, yeah, and friends, I assume, they're like forum friends.

242
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:46,680
I met up before, but yeah. Xammon Life of Gaming was that guy. He was very nerdy looking and

243
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,480
sounding, but he seemed to really like guns and most of his videos were about FPSers.

244
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,160
Yeah, he's a good boy. He would always take special mention of how the guns work in the

245
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,720
game and whether they're accurate and so on, which I thought was pretty funny.

246
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,600
He's got really good content. I have subscribed and it's been good.

247
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,680
I liked his old stuff. Does he still make videos?

248
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,480
Yeah, I have so often. I haven't checked his channel in a long time, but I would.

249
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,160
He went through Marathon, which is a franchise I hadn't heard about.

250
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:35,560
Yeah, he makes videos about things and I'm like, I never have heard of many of these things,

251
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,680
but I like that he's so into them and he cares about these types of games so much that he can

252
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,840
really praise something done right in a certain way for shooter games and stuff.

253
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:55,720
His last video was five months ago.

254
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,280
So he makes them occasionally. Oh yeah, I haven't seen any of these.

255
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,640
These are all new since the last time I checked. Awesome.

256
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:18,440
This is my bread and butter. It's just a YouTube video where a guy talks about a video game.

257
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,800
I have endless appetite for this. I cannot stop watching this genre.

258
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,160
It's just there's an infinite amount of it and I can just put it on

259
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,560
and I can pay attention or not pay attention and that's what I do all day every day.

260
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,040
It's fucked up, honestly.

261
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,360
Truth? I've talked about this. We've talked about this.

262
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,720
Put on a video to ignore, but then sometimes I get distracted by it and I do pay attention

263
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,760
and it does distract me from what I should be doing, even though I didn't want it to.

264
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:04,280
Did you see the red letter media best of the worst supercut of really memorable moments from

265
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,960
almost a hundred episodes? The hundredth episode is coming out soon, apparently,

266
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:15,000
of best of the worst. Oh no, I didn't see this. This montage, I guess it came out yesterday?

267
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,200
Yeah. No, I haven't seen it. It was just so... I don't know.

268
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:27,880
I had seen all of those videos multiple times and to see so many of those moments,

269
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,680
I'm like, oh, that was a great episode. Oh, that was a great episode. Oh,

270
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,920
that was in a great episode. All of these were in so many great episodes of best of the worst.

271
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,640
How many fucking hours of content have I watched of that?

272
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,920
There's a hundred episodes of best of the worst. Soon to be 100 episodes, yes.

273
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,680
That's insane. It doesn't seem like there's a hundred. I would have guessed there were maybe

274
00:29:50,680 --> 00:30:04,600
like 20 or 30. Oh no, wow. Way more than 20. What? What? I just... I don't... I can't believe it.

275
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,160
Also, I can't believe this best of the best of the worst. It's only two minutes long, like...

276
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,880
It's a very short... Only two minutes. They definitely would have cut out the things.

277
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:23,080
They can't have like... I just feel like there's more than two minutes worth of memorable highlights

278
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,120
from that. It's not like highlights from the show. It's like highlights of movies they've

279
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,360
watched on best of the worst, like little clips, like exploding environments, like a

280
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,640
environment explodes, like that part. And then there's things like that. Remlazar is on there

281
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,480
for like a frame. So it's like... One frame. Yeah, just little bits of all of these things. Like,

282
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,960
how do I remember this? Oh my god, I do. I can get of them. The guy blows up at the end.

283
00:30:50,920 --> 00:31:00,040
I don't even... I don't remember some of these. Like, I don't remember the movies themselves.

284
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,880
This one, it's like really at the beginning, it's like a guy with a beard and a mohawk

285
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,880
getting his head chopped off. I don't remember that at all. I have no clue what movie that was from.

286
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,280
I guess I like don't remember the movies as well as I remember the discussions, because I mean,

287
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,320
a lot of the time I'm not even looking at the screen, right? I'm not like watching it. I'm

288
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,440
listening to it passively. Wait a minute, it says... I guess I forget the Raiders of Atlantis. I forget

289
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,680
that one, yeah. Is that the one with... The mohawk guy's head chopped off? Yeah, Raiders of

290
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:42,840
Atlantis. No recollection of that whatsoever. Red Letter Media. What a franchise. What an

291
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:50,120
unlikely story. A bunch of fucking weirdos from Milwaukee. They said they'd never amount to

292
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:56,200
anything, but they made a couple of shitty movies and then they made a YouTube channel and now look

293
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:03,400
at them. Have you seen any of their movies, because I actually have not seen Space Copper?

294
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,400
I haven't, no. I've heard they're bad, so I'm like, I'm not that interested. It's a movie,

295
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:15,000
it's different. What's the one about a gorilla? They had an old movie they made that's something

296
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:23,640
about a gorilla. I don't know. They made a lot of old movies, like little fun film,

297
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:34,280
student projects stuff. Space Cop. Hold on. No, Revenge...

298
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,680
Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and the Red Letter Media affiliates

299
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,080
have been largely horror and comedy, such as Feeding Frenzy, The Recovered,

300
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,920
Orange's, Revenge of the Eggplant, and Space Cop. I swear to God, they have one about a gorilla

301
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,280
and there was a... if you like a patron or something, you could get a behind-the-scenes

302
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:13,800
documentary. Am I having a stroke? I was 100% sure of this, but maybe I'm confused. I don't know.

303
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,920
And I think I wanted to watch it, but it cost money and I said, no. Oh well.

304
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:31,080
Yeah, I haven't seen Space Cop or any of that. It looks like... I'm sure it's fine.

305
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,320
I'm sure it's fine. I think these guys are funny, but I don't necessarily trust

306
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:45,640
that they have immaculate filmmaking sense. I've seen a bunch of their old sketch comedies on the

307
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:53,960
channel. You left? I left to pee. Oh, lol. I didn't hear what you said. Have you ever gone back and

308
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,520
watched their oldest videos in chronological order? No, not all of them. I think I've watched the

309
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:09,080
making of some of their old films, which were interesting. If you... If you go back and...

310
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:16,760
I mean, I'll look right now. If you go to their channel and just sort their videos oldest to

311
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:27,560
newest, you get their fucking fruit pal puppet shorts. Oh, Gorilla Interrupted. Gorilla Interrupted

312
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,200
is the monkey movie. And there's a trailer for it posted nine years ago.

313
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,240
I remember Dale Jackson reporting. I see. I've seen that one.

314
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:45,080
Like their movie reviews don't even start until... Well, I guess it's the Plinkett reviews. Yeah.

315
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,200
Or like the oldest stuff, the oldest like review content that they have on here. You know? But

316
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,960
yeah, it's all these fucking puppet shorts with fruits. What was up with the fruit? I've never

317
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:05,240
actually looked at these. They just are like... It's like a satirical sitcom about a sassy black

318
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:15,400
apple married to a cowardly bitch of an orange man. I think I've seen one of these, the bitch orange,

319
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:27,080
I remember. Oh, dear. Oh, I'm still... I can't look for a job, sweetheart. I need to spend that

320
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:35,160
time finishing my ice sculpture. Yeah, that... Wait a minute. All right. I just think it's pretty

321
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:44,440
funny. So the star was Phantom Menace Plinkett review. Seems to have come out after a Star Trek

322
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:53,880
review. I never saw that. Is it a Plinkett review? Well, I'm going to click on it. I don't know. I

323
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,520
think these are... I think a lot of these are reposts because like the channel has existed

324
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:05,960
for 16 years and the oldest videos are only nine years old. So I don't know if these are

325
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:18,280
necessarily chronological. Yeah. Like I know Mr. Plinkett, I think he existed before the Plinkett

326
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:29,400
reviews. Yeah, 2012. No, it definitely came out before 2012. Nine years ago. This thing about

327
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,160
the Olsen twins movie, this little skit of him like getting a phone call from the Olsen twins,

328
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:45,160
Plinkett's in that. And even back then, Rich was playing him in the live action bits.

329
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:54,600
Yeah, I think there was older stuff on here that has been removed and I don't know what it could

330
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:04,440
have been. I wonder. Maybe some like internet historians. No, maybe it's a cataloged somewhere.

331
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:14,600
The shameful history. Oh, yeah. Orange's revenge of the eggplant. So many of their old

332
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,000
projects were about like puppets with fruit. Oh, wait, wait. Stoklasa created his first

333
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:30,680
video review for Star Trek Generations after watching the film in 2008. Stoklasa believed

334
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,400
his own voice sounded too boring for the review. I remember seeing this in an interview actually.

335
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,960
Are you reading this on Wikipedia? Adopted the persona of Harry S. Plinkett, yeah, Wikipedia.

336
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:52,680
Thought his voice was too boring. Man. Imagine if every fucking YouTube video essayist.

337
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,160
Because that's basically what it, imagine if every one of them was like, my voice is boring.

338
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:04,920
I'm gonna like adopt a wacky character. Yeah, it was great. It could be great. It could be great,

339
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,280
but it could be, it could probably get pretty annoying too. Well, sure. But like, I think

340
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,840
it was his like creativity to even think that, oh, I don't want to just be a guy,

341
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:23,080
a shleby guy talking about a movie because that's a stupid crazy thing to do. That's the worst thing

342
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:30,600
you can be. So I'll just like play into like the crazy old, shleby, insane nerd thing and be like,

343
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:37,880
oh, oh, this movie sucks. So I like to fuck my cat, you know, like that's, it was the stereotype

344
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,040
that's playing into. That's the natural progression of ideas. Yeah. Yeah. It's the only, it's the only

345
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,840
way. Everyone knows. It's the only way. Everyone knows red letter media is good. I don't know why

346
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,320
even bothered saying anything. Sure. I just went one time on a lark. I was like,

347
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,640
let me look at their oldest shit. And I was like, what is all this fruit doing here?

348
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,520
Some of us funny though, the orange Apple bits are like funny enough, I suppose. Holy shit.

349
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,360
Space cop trailer nine years ago. When did they make space? What?

350
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:23,480
I'm looking at nine years. I mean, maybe they were making it nine, but it probably didn't come out for

351
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,600
a while after that because like, I'm sure they made the trailer like well before the movie was done.

352
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:36,440
What is the 2012 same as all the other things early on in the channel? So it could be a reupload

353
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,720
in fact, you know, I think I was six years ago. I'm so raisey for space cop. That's an old

354
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,240
I think I was thinking of guerrilla interrupted, but I think it's space cop that has like the

355
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:54,680
making of documentary that you can like buy, I think somehow on their fucking, I don't know,

356
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:03,960
gum road or some shit on a gum road, please, please and thank you.

357
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:13,960
Um, yeah, red letter media. Good channel. What more can I say?

358
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,040
God, this is so weird. I'm scrolling. I'm like, haha. Yeah, I remember that. That wasn't that long ago.

359
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,400
Eight years ago, eight years ago, seven years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Best of the worst episode one,

360
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,080
eight years ago, almost 10 years old. No, not almost, but eight years is a long time.

361
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:38,680
It's so January 2013. It's so unsettling. I mean, you can see in the old old videos,

362
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,800
like they look so much younger, but like even even just over the course of best of the worst,

363
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:50,040
they look a lot different. Like Mike's hair is going like has recently started to go gray at a

364
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:58,040
rapidly accelerating rate. Mike looks Mike looks the same as ever, but better. He just like learned

365
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,320
to comb his hair and trim his beard. And now he looks perfect. And he used to look like a fucking

366
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:08,760
chipmunk. But other than that, he hasn't changed. What did I say? Did I say Mike? Yeah, I meant Jay.

367
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:18,760
You said you said yeah, yeah. Josh has just gotten Balder. Mike has just gotten fatter and grayer.

368
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,680
Rich, I guess, looks rich, looks pretty much the same. Like when he was when he was like young,

369
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,440
young, like in his twenties, he looked he looked different. But at some point,

370
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,320
he just got kind of like fat and stupid looking. And he has just kind of stayed the same.

371
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,080
Classic, good old reliable, not to be cruel or anything, not to be mean.

372
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:52,280
Josh looks the same because he has no hair to change. So he's just like a smooth egg

373
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,200
unaffected by the passage of time. Wait, no, I meant Jack. I meant Jack. I'm so. And also

374
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,960
Jack did used to have hair like really early on. He yeah, he had but he looks really funny with

375
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,160
the hair because he's like a ginger. And he but he's like bald, but his hair is like fluffy

376
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,840
on the side. So he looks like a clown.

377
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,280
He had clown hair. I can totally understand why he would why he would trim it. He looks much.

378
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,000
You know, he kind of the old clown look, it has a certain appeal. If he was if he was some sort of

379
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,680
like if he was playing some kind of character, like some kind of wacky scientist for children

380
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,520
or something, I think that would be a perfect look. But if he's not going for that, then probably

381
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,760
shaving it is the right thing to do. Lamal, you know, it's a little bit of bold. Yeah, in general,

382
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:50,280
I think so. Yeah. God, you know, who looks Josh without his beard? That's a mistake.

383
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,680
He should. Yeah, it's good. He should keep the beard. It's it's much better.

384
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:01,880
I did wonder about like whether it's like a like more of an objective thing or like a

385
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,480
perceptual thing. If you see someone with a beard more than you see them without a beard,

386
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,200
then obviously it's going to be different when they are without the beard. But can you get used

387
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,120
to it? And is it better? Like, is there a clear judgment able to be made with regards to beer

388
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:24,680
and hair and stuff? I mean, everyone might have their own opinion. In my opinion, it's not it's

389
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,440
not merely that like I was used to him with the beard, seeing him without it makes me go makes

390
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:38,360
me feel weird. It's that like beardless, you can just see his face and his his jawline is just is

391
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:48,280
so like pudgy. And and he's got like a very pronounced shadow anyway, even when he's

392
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:55,000
shaved the beard. So like just have the fucking beard. And it looks like it looks like deliberate.

393
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,320
I don't know. The with the beard he looks. I don't know. I guess it makes you look

394
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,520
like I guess a little more badass, I guess a little more hardcore in a way, whereas like

395
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,800
beardless his jawline and his chubby cheeks just make him look like a soft

396
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:26,440
a soft fucking. What's the word? Potato man, puke. Oh, potato man. Did you say potato man?

397
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,960
Yes, I think something like that. The roundness. Yeah, something like that. Yeah,

398
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:38,680
you get what I'm saying. You got you got to you got to play to your strengths. You got to you

399
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:47,720
got to do you got to do an assessment, a frank assessment of like, all right, what do I look

400
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:57,400
like? What are my problem areas? How can I how can I how can I mitigate? How can I mitigate these?

401
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,240
In Josh's case, a beard is is necessary in Jack's case, shave in the head. That's what you got to do.

402
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:13,720
In Jay's case, it's to, I don't know, change everything, grow the beard a little bit, but

403
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,720
sort of not the way all Jay needed to do was just have his beard be normal. Like the reason

404
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:25,560
he looked bizarre before was because he did his beard like weird, like he would have like,

405
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,640
he would have like weird like sort of semi mutton chops, or he would have like just like

406
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,760
just the the mustache and it was like, what are you doing? And his hair would be all messy,

407
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,760
but now he's got the nice like comb to the side. He's just got like the nice normal beard on his

408
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,800
like pretty normal face and it just looks good. And he's improved his dress sense to I think he

409
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,160
wears like he wears like, I don't know, like leather jackets now and it just works. It just

410
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,360
works for him. He's still a manlet, but he looks like a manlet who knows what he's doing.

411
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,120
Good for him. Good for him. I'm looking I'm looking through Jay footage.

412
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,960
Well, so this is the the the boy judging corner of the procrastinators

413
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,040
podcast. The boy judge, maybe the past judgment on boys.

414
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,800
Then I don't know about this boy right here.

415
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,360
Which yeah, wait, which you got a particular one? No, no, I was just saying that like this

416
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:32,040
the boy in general just in general. Yeah, this this boy is this boy is not is not living up to

417
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:41,800
his boy potential. Is there a way to boy potential and potential like boy potential? No, that doesn't

418
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:48,760
really work. No, I'm sorry. You fucked up. Fuck. I didn't fuck up. I was experimenting and it

419
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,760
blew up in my face. But you know what? At least I tried. No, no, you shouldn't have.

420
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,440
You shouldn't have done that. No, he's right. He's right. I should have. If you hadn't tried,

421
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,080
you wouldn't have failed. So but let this be a lesson to you.

422
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:15,960
Yeah, red letter media, movies, boys. It's all it's all good. It's all good. Have we forgotten?

423
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,880
Have we forgotten any boys that need judgment? There Oh, there's that. Well, there's that one

424
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,680
guy who wears like the flannel shirts and he has the mustache and he's bald. And he's like

425
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:36,040
Tim Tim. He's he's new regular, I think he was there before. But I think lately he's been

426
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:43,960
around a little bit more often. Yeah. Yeah. He's fine. I don't know, whatever. He looks like how

427
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,960
he looks. I mean, obviously, like a bold, bolding is like difficult to make look good. So it's,

428
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:57,880
it's like, you know, whatever. His mustache thing is a bit was distinctive, at least. I don't know

429
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,360
where I hate it. It's distinctive at least. And I don't have any strong opinion about it. And I

430
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:05,560
like him being like a really weak drunk, like he can't take his liquor and he goes like really

431
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:12,440
slurry really quickly and everyone laughs at him. That's really funny. I guess, was he just

432
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,400
doing that that one time as like a bit? No, I think he really can't hold his liquor very well.

433
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,720
Maybe. I think they all drink about the same amount and he starts going, well, a lot quicker.

434
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:31,400
I mean, they all drink about the same amount, except, I mean, Mike, Mike seemed to get like

435
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:39,080
kind of hammered sometimes. Like Mike seemed to be drinking like the heart stuff and like

436
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:46,280
actually confused. Mike is a real alcoholic. I don't, I think. No, literally, I guess. I

437
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,840
shouldn't say real, like I know anything. I think, I don't, I mean, I don't know. They make fun of him.

438
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,200
They poke fun at his drinking a lot. They make fun of him for getting drunk, which,

439
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,560
which he definitely does. I feel like, and maybe I'm jumping into conclusions here,

440
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,880
I feel like Rich might be like an actual alcoholic. And that's why like a lot of the time,

441
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,440
like the other guys will have a beer, but he will have like something else. I feel like at some

442
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,760
point they were like, Rich, you are actually an, he's like, you know what, I'm actually an alcoholic

443
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,280
and I probably just shouldn't drink. That's, I don't know that for sure. I just, I've noticed,

444
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,680
I've noticed that I never see him with it with a drink. And I think like, there's got to be a

445
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:27,560
reason for that. They do like mention it at some point. Yeah. Why Rich is having energy drinks or

446
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:33,160
like water instead of beer. I think. Yeah. And it's because he doesn't want to have alcohol,

447
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,120
which is like, so there must be a, there must be an issue there, which like, if so,

448
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,320
I thought it was a medical thing, but maybe it's just like basic alcohol. I guess it could be like

449
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,840
a medicine interaction. You know what? It could totally be that too. I didn't even think about

450
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:55,160
that. I just jumped to conclusions. That's a real boy judged right there by Benson.

451
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:04,040
That guy's probably alcoholic. I mean, it's one explanation, but I guess it's not the only one.

452
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:10,280
So yeah, shows what I know. Thank you. Thank you for broadening my, my, my mind. Thank you for

453
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:17,720
expanding me into new ter, unexplored territories of the human condition. Speaking of medicine,

454
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:27,160
so I'm on the, I'm on the vaccine waiting list now. I think I should, I think I need to go and

455
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:33,640
redo my application to let them know that I'm a former smoker, because apparently

456
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,000
that is considered a co-morbidity and can get you moved up to the priority list, lol.

457
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:47,880
Very funny. Well, it is a long thing. So. It is a long thing. I gotta admit, I'm embarrassed to

458
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:54,360
admit this. This is going to be very cringe, but I am scared to get it.

459
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:00,040
Where do they stab it? Do they stab it in your shoulder? Cause that's fine. There's plenty of

460
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,160
flesh there. My, my roommate got it in the, yeah, in like the upper arm. Yeah, that's easy.

461
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,720
Cause it's, no, it's, I mean, I don't, I don't even see it. No, no, no, no, that's not what I mean.

462
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,840
I mean, I don't like the shot. I am scared of, of needles and such and like, that's bad, but

463
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:22,520
it's okay. I can take that. No, I'm, I'm scared of like, I'm scared that it's going to do something.

464
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:28,040
Oh, it will. It'll, it'll probably make you sick for a bit. That's cause it's like a small,

465
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:34,760
it's a baby coronavirus in there. Essentially. Something like that. I mean, I've heard people

466
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:41,000
say that like, I don't know, apparently it's very rare and like there's only, only one brand has

467
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
done this and it's not even the kind you can get in a marriage. There was one brand in other

468
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,720
countries that gave some people blood clots and like, I guess. That was bullshit. That was

469
00:51:52,040 --> 00:52:00,200
bullshit. It was like, well, I guess nobody knows for certain, but the tests were done.

470
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:07,720
The amount of people who got blood clots after getting the vaccine is so low that it could

471
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:14,120
easily have just been normal instances of having blood clots. Like people were getting very scared

472
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,840
about it. I think it was in Europe, right? It's the AstraZeneca, a vaccine. That's right. That's

473
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:26,280
the one. It was sort of fear mongered like that because in Europe, a lot of people,

474
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,080
a lot of people in Europe don't trust vaccines for some reason, or at least in France, I've heard.

475
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:37,800
So it's sort of a political thing to like, not seem like you're trying to push vaccines too

476
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,400
hard because the public won't like that. They won't vote for you or some bullshit. So there's

477
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,920
lots of, oh, we got to ask as many questions as possible. Is this causing blood clots? Like,

478
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,120
if somebody brings that up, a politician in one of these countries can't just dismiss it,

479
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:56,600
it's kind of like, oh, they have to address these concerns because even though the concerns are

480
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:04,520
probably bogus, they would look bad if they don't follow it up. And so in the UK, nobody cared

481
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,200
that scientists said, no, there's probably another thing. And we got the vaccine. We kept

482
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:15,000
getting the vaccine for our people. Then everyone in Europe was like, oh, we're all busy with

483
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,400
bureaucracy and paperwork because we're trying to discern whether this blood clots are actually

484
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:26,200
like a real threat. And it turns out, really, no, it's so little evidence to suggest that that's

485
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:31,080
true. And then so many people just waited too long to get their vaccine, lol.

486
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:39,640
It's not, it's not, it's not rational. It's, it's genuinely just that like, I know that there are

487
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:45,480
other people that are like, scared and don't want the vaccine. And even though like, it's not,

488
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,920
those aren't even like people who I agree with. But I know that they exist. And my animal instinct

489
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,280
is like, if they're afraid, I should be afraid. You know what I mean? Understandable, yes.

490
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:04,920
I'm not so, I haven't been, because like, I've been told, they'll call you when you're ready.

491
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,400
So everyone's somewhere on the list. It's not like you have to sign up to get one. They'll just

492
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,160
I had to, I had to sign up. I had to sign up somewhere.

493
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,840
So like, they say they'll call me when it's my turn. And I haven't really thought about it.

494
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,600
And I never really like considered anything potentially going wrong.

495
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,200
I just be like, yeah, now I've got the thing. Eventually I'll have the thing.

496
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,360
It's just, you know, I've heard, I've heard, even though I've heard that like, oh, it makes your

497
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,560
arm hurt. It's like, oh, it makes you feel like it gives you like a mild head cold or something.

498
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,320
And I'm like, even though those don't seem like a big deal, it's still like

499
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,280
scary because it's like, wait, I'm putting something in my body that's

500
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,240
that's fucking with me even a little bit like Jesus. And it's stupid because like,

501
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,840
obviously coronavirus would fuck with me more. But still, but still it's like to

502
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,280
voluntarily like fuck with my body is like, yeah.

503
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:12,920
But I'm, but I'm kind of like, I think I'm kind of just like scared of like doctors and medicine

504
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:19,000
in general. This is a thing that I have been like in the last few years. And I never used

505
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,760
to be like this. I think I've become, I've become paranoid, terrified.

506
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:31,720
It is. It is. I told you it was going to be cringe and then here it is that I'm right again.

507
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:43,160
Far right. Yeah. Scary. It's scary. I'm so scared. I'm so fucking scared. I'm so fucking scared.

508
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,040
You're going to go to the doctors, the hospital, whatever they're going to say. All right, Ben,

509
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:55,320
Saint, sit down here. We're going to, we're going to, we're going to throw this needle at you.

510
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,880
You're going to take it. You're going to, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to

511
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,360
tie you to this wheel and spin it. And then we're going to throw syringes at you like a dartboard.

512
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:09,480
And, and you know, one in five of these syringes has syphilis on them. So you better watch out.

513
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:18,840
No. Not, not syphilis. I'm so scared to even exist in a human body.

514
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,960
You know what really? Such a terrifying state of affairs. Yeah.

515
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:30,200
What really does scare me is like medical trash cans, like the bins that they throw,

516
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:36,600
used needles, things that have been in other people, things that are like not, not disinfected.

517
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,320
They just throw them in like a medical waste bin. I've seen those bins sometimes like just

518
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,560
open top and I'm like, God, if I just put my hand in there, I could have every disease on earth

519
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:50,280
and I would die instantly. I don't, I don't like the idea that I could potentially fall into that.

520
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:57,400
And then, oh, the needle with the aids on it got onto my face. And now I have face aids.

521
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:04,040
That sucks. I really, really unnerve me when I see like a medical waste disposal thing.

522
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:10,440
Sure. Sure. I mean, true. But I mean, there's so many things that could kill you in so many

523
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,160
different ways. They're all over the place. I mean, you could just walk out your window

524
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:22,600
and you fall. If you're on the second floor of your house, you have enough fucking potential

525
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,360
energy to kill yourself instantly. You just walk out the window and that's it. You did it.

526
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:33,000
Oh, there's an electrical socket. Oh, there's enough voltage there. There's enough voltage

527
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,520
there that like, you know, if you fucking stuck two tongs in there, the amps going through your

528
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,560
body would fucking kill you. There's like, there's a potential drop there that's lethal.

529
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:47,800
Yeah, you just take the toaster and the bus. Dude, have you ever thought about like how in like

530
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,440
thrillers or whatever, there's like the torture scene or like there's a bad guy and he's got a

531
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,000
weapon and he's in your house like, oh, shit, what am I going to do? He's got a weapon in my house.

532
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,040
Nobody needs a weapon. You just like, you just get like, you go to the house like the cupboard

533
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:08,680
under the sink, you get like, some sort of like, you know, cleaning thing, and then you force it

534
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:14,200
down someone's throat, you get bleach and you put them like household objects are so dangerous.

535
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,640
Well, I mean, yeah, but you would have to I mean, to do that, you would have to,

536
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:27,400
he would have to like wrestle me first, he would have to like dis, what's the word, he would have

537
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:33,960
to like, disable me some or hold me down in a way to kill me with that. Yeah, I mean,

538
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:39,960
there's kitchen knives and stuff as well. It's just sort of the idea that like a weapon,

539
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,120
like somebody brings a gun, I mean, a gun is long distances, very loud and dangerous and obviously,

540
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:53,080
but like so many things in your house could kill you right now. So easily if you just fell into

541
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:57,560
like a strange mindset where you're like, what if I just did this and you idiot die?

542
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,800
Sure. I mean,

543
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,080
that there's a there's a word for that, like the idea that you can see that a train is coming and

544
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:11,640
you're thinking, hmm, you know, if I did walk off, I would die right then. God, I sure hope I don't

545
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:17,400
do that. I better sit down, I better clinch my my legs together so that nothing moves.

546
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,960
I think about that all the time. And I think about being hit by a train. I think about having

547
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:27,160
my head crushed. I think about having my head crushed every day and what it would feel like.

548
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:33,720
And it's a horrifying thought that I keep having and can't stop myself from having and sometimes

549
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:41,400
I'm just sitting or I'm lying down alone and I think about it and it's so unpleasant to even

550
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,960
cross my mind the possibility that I like bad and sometimes I like involuntarily like scream a

551
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:53,720
little bit because I thought about it too hard. This is true. This is true about me. No, I understand.

552
00:59:53,720 --> 01:00:01,720
I feel I feel similar. It's like when you something has like fucked with me that I've seen,

553
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:09,480
maybe just in a video even. I'm thinking about it now and and and then it like beyond that point,

554
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,600
it's like, it pops into my head randomly and I'm like, oh shit, I should not think of that. And

555
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,120
now I'm thinking of not thinking about it, which causes me to think about it.

556
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,560
I'm having like an anxiety attack. I'm thinking about what it would feel like to have my head

557
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:31,560
crushed and it's so bad. I hate that I exist in a universe where not only can this happen,

558
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,480
it has happened. It has happened to other people before. How fucked is that?

559
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:42,200
I wonder what like therapeutic methods there are because I've because

560
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,920
like to like guarantee getting over something like that because I've heard, you know,

561
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,600
you've all heard of like, oh, if you expose yourself to the things you don't like,

562
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:58,120
you'll realize it's so bad. But it's like getting your head crushed is a little different. How do

563
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:02,200
you expose yourself? Do you watch like horror movies? Would that make it worse or better? I don't know.

564
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:09,560
I don't. It would probably just make me think about it more. Yeah. I don't know.

565
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:14,120
I don't know. What can be done? I don't know if there's any solution to this problem.

566
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,520
Dude, what if COVID cures your ability to get your head crushed?

567
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:29,800
I read, okay, I read that apparently a large number of people who had COVID develop

568
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:38,840
like neurological or mental issues afterwards. Wait, large amount? How many?

569
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,360
I think it was something like, oh, God, I'd have to find the article, but I think it was like 40%.

570
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:51,080
Which, yeah, they develop like- That seems impossible. How could a vaccine do that?

571
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:57,080
And it does 40% of that. No, no, no, not the vaccine. Not the vaccine that having COVID,

572
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:03,720
having full-blown COVID, and you develop these. And by neurological or mental,

573
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,280
includes stuff like depression or chronic anxiety or something, right?

574
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:15,400
Not like brain damage, but some. I mean, some people's brains are damaged by COVID,

575
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:22,200
but it's other things too. Depression is- But it's like a large percentage more than

576
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:29,080
other things. More of a percentage, significantly more people who were treated for COVID

577
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:35,320
would go on to develop issues like that than people who were treated for, say, the flu

578
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:44,280
or something by a percentage. And this is very bizarre. This is a very bizarre piece of information,

579
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:50,120
but I had to wonder what if the vaccine does the same thing? What if the vaccine does it too?

580
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,520
What if the vaccine will give me depression or anxiety or something?

581
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:01,400
That sounds crazy, I know. It seems like if it's something that happens with COVID,

582
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:07,240
it could happen with the vaccine, because the vaccine would be like a small dose of

583
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:12,840
the disease to get your body immune system able to recognize it so that you can fight it in the

584
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:19,480
real world. So it might make you depressed for a bit. I don't think anything would be long-lasting,

585
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:24,200
from a vaccine. It doesn't seem like it has the power to do anything.

586
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:31,800
Okay, I don't know. I might embarrass myself by not knowing what I'm talking about, but I don't

587
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:41,320
think that the vaccine is just a small dose of the virus, because the virus itself does not

588
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:47,080
create immunity to itself, because you could get COVID and then recontract it and get it again.

589
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:55,000
It's something else. It's some piece of the genetic material that causes you to create a

590
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,600
certain spike protein. I don't even know what that means. I don't know either, because I haven't

591
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:07,320
read up on it, but I just understand vaccines to be the purpose of them is to get your body's

592
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,960
immune system. Give it the data. It's like a data download. Here's the cheat codes for when this

593
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:19,640
enemy you're supposed to roll. This Dark Souls boss enters the body. You roll here. This is the

594
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:26,360
eye frames, and it's like, okay, thanks. It's basically a little tutorial for your body's

595
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:31,320
immune system. That's what I think of it as. Now that I've thinking about it like that, it's kind

596
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:37,240
of cute. It's your body's immune system. It's a little Dark Souls guy, and he's rolling around.

597
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,840
He's like, oh, I died. All right, let me try again. That's you feeling a little bad after

598
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,680
taking the vaccine, but then he gets it, and then the real thing comes, and he can roll.

599
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:50,440
He can do all the rolls. He can do a soul level one, fists only, attack, and win.

600
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,040
I know that some people who got COVID got what was called long COVID, which was when

601
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:04,520
you don't actually have COVID anymore, but your immune system over responds to the virus,

602
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,680
and it continues to do its thing even after the virus is gone, and it gives you symptoms

603
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:17,000
that last for months or a year, where your immune system is just making you sick continually,

604
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:25,880
which is fucking cringe. I heard some people speculating that could the vaccine,

605
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:31,000
since it's just about your immune response, could the vaccine trigger a similar thing?

606
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,160
To the best of my knowledge, it seems like the answer is no. I haven't seen any reports of

607
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,120
long COVID being brought on by the vaccine, which is good.

608
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:49,240
I mean, I don't know. Nevertheless, it's scary because I don't understand.

609
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:55,240
Sure, sure. I think the important thing to understand is that all of those

610
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,880
potentials are very, very minor. Otherwise, it would be a very big story.

611
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:05,320
In the grand scheme of things, COVID itself is a much more...

612
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:12,120
Vaccine, yeah. You want to take the vaccine over getting COVID, so it doesn't really matter

613
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:17,320
what the potential bad things are. You'll probably take the vaccine on the off chance

614
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:24,440
that it will save you from COVID, and the side effects of the vaccine are largely lesser and

615
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:30,520
rarer than the side effects from COVID, which can lead to death, and it's worse.

616
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:40,200
COVID is the more dangerous danger, it seems. I mean, not that I would even expect to die if

617
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:47,400
I got COVID. No, yeah, that's even the thing. I guess neither of us know exactly how these

618
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,480
side effects would manifest in a person like us. We don't know whether we have the exact wrong

619
01:06:54,440 --> 01:07:01,000
set of characteristics that would lead to the most rare, terrible of circumstances from the

620
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:13,480
vaccine, but I don't know. Whatever. Whatever, yeah. I guess I must have been a little,

621
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:19,720
little kid when I got my other vaccinations, and I wonder if like, did I get mildly sick

622
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:25,240
from those vaccinations, too? And I just don't remember. Did they cause my autism? Is that where

623
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:31,720
it came from? Makes you think, makes you wonder, hmm, two things happened. Yeah, I was just a

624
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:37,640
perfectly normal kid. One must have caused me. Socializing. I walked into the playground,

625
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:45,480
and I did the finger bang like, I was talking to everyone. I was the king of the castle, got my

626
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:51,720
flu jab, and I became a social introvert. I was star quarterback. I was star quarterback

627
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:58,760
before I got vaccinated. Yeah, I took that. I took that and I became a social intro, and

628
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,840
I lost all of my memory of my Chad's days, and everyone also lost their memories because they

629
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:10,360
also took the vaccine. Nobody remembers when I was a Chad. That was the big, that's big pharma

630
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:16,360
doing that. Big pharma wants everyone to forget that they can be Chad's. They want them to be

631
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:22,840
cringe, cringe, autistic consumers. I used to be a Chad, but now I'm a queen. I guess it's better

632
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:29,800
lol. It's, it's more, I don't know. I'm sure, I'm sure George Soros is happy about that for some reason.

633
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:38,440
The, I don't know. I don't know, man. I just, everyone I know is getting it. Like, one of my

634
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:44,760
roommates is, is vaxxed. I think, like, I know a couple of people who are getting vaxxed. They're

635
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:49,880
all, they're all, they're probably, they're all gonna be fine. It's all gonna be fine. The worst

636
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,120
thing, the worst thing about people getting vaxxed is that we're gonna run out of the ability to

637
01:08:54,120 --> 01:09:02,760
sell, I have COVID shirts. No, our markets. Have we even sold one of those? I am really curious.

638
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,560
We sold a couple. No, we did. We did a few people.

639
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,320
Oh my God. Incredible.

640
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:17,000
I know. Imagine someone out there, maybe you listener, own that shirt. It's gonna, it's only

641
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,040
gonna, it's gonna age like fine white. It's gonna get funnier and funnier as the years go by.

642
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:28,040
It's an investment in the future. Honestly, now is the time. If you haven't done it already,

643
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,040
click the link in the, the T-Spring link in the description. Get your own I Have COVID shirt

644
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,600
before it's too late, before your vaxx and you can never again claim to have COVID. You should go

645
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,760
out right now and get COVID just so you can wear that shirt because you'll, this is a chance that

646
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,160
will, that will pass you by and never come back. This is, this is a moment in time and you don't

647
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:55,800
want to miss it. That's, that's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. Oh, fucking boy. Um,

648
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:03,560
well fuck. Yeah. You want to go to voicemails? I, well, I got one really for voicemail. Oh,

649
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,560
sure. Go on. No, it's not too early, but I got one little thing to say. Um, so, all right, you

650
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:13,960
might not have anything to say about this, but I was watching Buffy, um, season, season five.

651
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:20,920
Classic Gib. Yeah. Classic Gib, watching Buffy, enjoying it, but I had noticed something. Um,

652
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:27,720
in Buffy, it's like, not a kid's show. It's sort of teenage young adults. So there's blood,

653
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:34,920
there's gore, not extreme gore, but like, you know, 90s gore. Um, the, you know, vampire's blood,

654
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:42,680
there's quite a few sex scenes. There's a known like explicit nudity, but there is like suggestive,

655
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:47,800
like, you know, back of, you know, you know, back nudity and stuff like that. So it's like,

656
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,200
gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. There's been, there's been love interest stuff in the show.

657
01:10:53,160 --> 01:11:01,880
And there is a new couple that have is two, two women, two ladies. No fucking way. And they are

658
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:06,200
together. They are, they are canonically going out with each other. They're girlfriends. What the

659
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:11,480
fuck? And it's like, ah, cool. You know, television show in the 90s, they had a lesbian couple that

660
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:16,680
wasn't like a joke and it's cool and it's cute and it's wonderful. And I love it and it's great,

661
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:23,160
but my mind, my mind is blown. But here's the, my head has been crushed by this information.

662
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:33,960
But the thing that fucking pisses me off so much is that they will not let these lesbians kiss

663
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:41,560
on camera or at all. They just really, they will not let them kiss. There is so, it was this one

664
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:48,040
particular episode where this couple, there was a thing with one of the parents and they were like,

665
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:54,040
I don't like you doing stuff. Your new friends are a bad influence, you know, stuff like that.

666
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:59,880
And she's like, the episode was about her. And then her friends, you know, the main cast were

667
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:06,360
like supportive of her as against her family who are shitty. And it was like, this is when she came

668
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:12,600
out as a lesbian, you mean? It was more that she came out as like a witch because, you know, allegory.

669
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:20,440
Oh, sure. But that, yeah, they didn't really talk to the parents about the gayness, but

670
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:27,320
lesbian is, it's known by everyone else. And there have been like a few like funny jokes

671
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:35,080
about like people's reactions to like, oh, oh, you've, oh, like girlfriend, oh, like it's,

672
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:40,040
it's surprising. But nobody like makes fun of it. So that's nice. It's a good show in that regard.

673
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,360
But they just won't let them kiss. They won't let them kiss. Despite the fact, despite the fact

674
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:49,560
that in this episode, it was the perfect romantic moment. They were dancing together. It was a

675
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:57,240
slow dance. And it was like, I'm so happy and you're stood up for me and you, my girlfriend are so

676
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:03,880
wonderful. And they'd hug. They hug on the dance floor. They hug on the dance floor. And it's

677
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:09,880
so. They hug zone each other. It's so actually cringe inducingly like unsatisfying. Everything

678
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:15,400
was leading up to a kiss. We hadn't seen a kiss up to that point. And other characters kiss

679
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:21,320
constantly. Buffy. I was going to ask, do other characters kiss? Yeah. Buffy kisses her boyfriend

680
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:28,760
so much. She has so much kissing. Nice. And it's like, oh, okay, I see what it this is.

681
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:34,760
Now, I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure it's the show runner, not the show, like creators, but like the

682
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,840
like TV, like saying, no, no, you can't have them kiss. Sorry, you just can't do that.

683
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:46,760
Like, I'm pretty sure the show runners would have wanted them to be able to. But no, TV says no.

684
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:53,880
So that's fucking a lot. I mean, I mean, if if they're if they're just dating, like if they're

685
01:13:53,880 --> 01:14:01,880
just straight up fucking dating each other, like I don't why, why not? What's the problem? It was

686
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:07,880
so confusing. It's because they they've even had like scenes in that. Unless they're trying to keep

687
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,440
if they're trying to keep plausible deniability, I would at least get it. But if they're not doing

688
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:19,320
that, then why would it be an issue? It's so strange. Like there's innuendo, you know, because

689
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:25,160
it's like ha ha witches. Like what are the witchy things they're doing together? It's like, ah,

690
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:31,800
that sex like implied sex, but they haven't confirmed sex. But they did. Okay. In that very

691
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:37,000
episode I'm talking about, they had a scene where they were snuggling together in bed together,

692
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,960
talking about stuff. Yeah, like really cute and romantic and like, you know,

693
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:49,800
they're overtly going out. Everyone knows they just lips on lips. I don't know why. Imagine

694
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:56,200
you're you're you're a Christian soccer mom, and you're flipping through channels on daytime TV,

695
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:03,000
looking for something that you don't want your kids to see. And you flip, which are you going

696
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,320
to be more upset by? You see the two girls kiss or you see the two girls snuggling in bed together?

697
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:17,720
I feel like they're equivalent at the very least. I don't know. It's bizarre. It was so it was so

698
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:23,160
like bizarre is the right word because I felt so like it was one of those like moments that I

699
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:29,880
don't doesn't happen often with me. But I was it was like, oh, come on, like throw popcorn at the

700
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:35,240
screen. We like, what the fuck? They couldn't do it. I just had a thought. I just had a thought.

701
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:40,120
But I don't think it's true. My thought was what if the actresses just didn't want to do it. But

702
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:45,240
like, no, that's no horseshit actors are fuck actors are perfect actors will kiss whoever you

703
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:51,800
fucking tell them to kiss. These are pros. There's no way there's no way I doubt it. No, I doubt that.

704
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,000
I guess I could look into it. But they're quite young. They're not I would be shot. I would be

705
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:02,760
shocked if that was the reason like young hip 90s kid actors doing like, which is which is more

706
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,360
likely which is more likely to not to be against it, though the actresses or the fucking or the

707
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:17,560
cigar chomping execs at the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy, easy choice. The worst thing ever cringe.

708
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,040
Let them kiss. Let lesbians live.

709
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,480
Let them live. Maybe they I don't know maybe they maybe they will later. I don't know your

710
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:36,920
significant other than why live exactly. Maybe I mean maybe as they stay on the show for a while

711
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:42,120
and the audience and they it becomes clear that the audience accepts them maybe they will

712
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:46,600
be allowed to do that eventually. I don't know. I could I could see it. Well, the thing is they

713
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:51,880
have been they've been like girlfriends for a while. It like started off as like a weird thing

714
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:57,080
like the one character used to be used to have a boyfriend. They were like, I actually find that

715
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:01,880
I like this person more means more to me. It's like, okay, that's been set up. It's been building

716
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,320
up. It's gotten to a point where they had an extremely romantic moment and they didn't do it.

717
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:12,200
And it's like, if not, then when would the right person the time be? It's like,

718
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,400
there's an episode about one of them.

719
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:24,520
Yeah, I'm working record about it. But yeah, yeah, you're all torn up inside. Yeah, damn.

720
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Why don't they fuck? Where's their vaginas? Where's the where's the where's the what's the

721
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:40,040
what was Plink Plinkett say in the in the Force Awakens like there's something missing. Where's

722
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:49,400
the sacks or whatever. Yeah, I don't think that fuck. I don't think they can't fuck a black guy.

723
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:57,480
What the fuck? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that is a thing. Like, like, why wouldn't they?

724
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:03,640
They just didn't. They just didn't they just didn't they just didn't think Finn was an

725
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:12,760
appropriate male romantic lead for no particular reason. All right, I haven't seen the fucking

726
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:18,120
Star Wars. I haven't seen any of the new ones. I saw like Force Awakens because it's like, oh,

727
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:25,000
like a new Star Wars. So I was like as an event. Sure. Sure. I haven't seen the other ones, but

728
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,640
like, yeah, it seems like there's just no romance in those. I'm like, I mean, that's what Plinkett says.

729
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:37,320
It definitely would have helped. Yeah, I wonder I wonder if there's like a, oh,

730
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:46,040
I can't have sex in a thing. We just can't have that. I think I don't know. I don't know if it's

731
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:52,760
a J.J. Abrams thing. Maybe it's like, wait, no, that kind of it can't be a J.J. Abrams thing.

732
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:57,720
It was like a weird thing with Spock and that black lady in the Star Trek movies.

733
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,400
Oh, I didn't see that, but maybe.

734
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:09,160
It's like Spock was like getting his bone on with some lady and Kirk is obviously a sex boy.

735
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:16,600
I don't know. I'm tempted to say that like culture, like I'm tempted to say that like

736
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:24,200
youth culture these days is like more squeaky clean, no sex, please. But I don't actually

737
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:30,600
know if that's true. Sometimes I feel like that's true and maybe they just thought it wouldn't play

738
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:41,720
well with an audience. I don't know. I would say it's definitely the group that are mostly online

739
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:47,800
of the new generation. I don't know what percentage of the new generation is like

740
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:55,320
too online like Twitter online. But those that crowd seems to be very squeaky clean,

741
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:03,320
puritan, weirdos. I don't like it. Yeah. You know, I say that, but I was honestly,

742
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:13,240
I was kind of like that as a kid. I had sexual thoughts, but I was very much like,

743
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:20,120
no, I'm not a person who has sex. I'm not like, I'm not like horny or anything like,

744
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:24,680
like publicly I was very much like, no, no, no, that's not for me. I'm not interested in that

745
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,960
kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I can't judge. I guess I really can't judge.

746
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:38,680
Yeah. It's like, even though now I see it and I'm like, I don't know. I was definitely,

747
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:45,800
well, I definitely was fucking wanted to look at adult content when I was under the legal age to

748
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:55,000
do so. I remember this one time when I was very scared of being caught seeing boobies

749
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:04,280
where I think it was, I didn't want my parents to find, I found an image, right? It was just

750
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,040
like a very tame image. It just happened to be anime. I didn't know what anime was.

751
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,840
Because I typed in boobs into Google and I saw them and I was like,

752
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:18,920
you know, oh my God. Holy fucking shit. I could just, if I wanted to, I could just

753
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:24,200
see these things that I heard about. Oh my God. I got this really, really tame anime.

754
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:31,080
It's like really like covered up, but you know, it's kind of, it's obviously supposed to be sexual,

755
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:37,720
but it's very covered up anime image. I got the file, I put it on a USB, I took it to school,

756
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:42,760
and then I printed it out on the school computer so that my parents wouldn't find out.

757
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:51,960
That's so fucking funny, but I know I am completely, I would have done, no, I fucking print it out.

758
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:57,400
Not, I didn't take it on my school computer, but I secretly printed out images onto,

759
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:04,440
on my fucking inkjet printer. It was, it was only because the printer in my house was like,

760
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:11,240
you know, right next to mom's computer or the family computer at the time, and I knew in the

761
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:15,640
school, in the art department at school, there was a printer that was like easily accessible

762
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:20,280
in a computer area that nobody really went to, and I could easily get in there and be like,

763
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:27,400
yes, nobody will find out. I can do it during lunch, I can do it during, during, during break,

764
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:33,320
or whatever, and nobody will find me. And it was just such a bad, like not even good image.

765
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,560
I just like, it was just, it was boobs, I googled it and I have it now.

766
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,560
And you found it and you were like, oh my god, I have to save this, otherwise it could slip

767
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,680
through my fingers. I might never, I might never find these again.

768
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:51,320
It's true, I might never find it. If I type in boobs now, the whole, the whole games changed.

769
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:54,280
I'll never see those again. The meta game has shifted.

770
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,480
War, but war never changed. Oh wait, no, it wasn't that. It was, you, you would type boobies,

771
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:08,120
because, and then you would get the bird. Remember that? No. The blue-footed booby?

772
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,000
I mean, I know, I know what the bird is, but I never had that experience.

773
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:19,240
That was the first, that was the first word I typed in was boobies, which is adorable.

774
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:25,640
Very funny, funny, funny that you remember. I don't remember what I, what specific, what terms

775
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:34,520
I was searching for. Who knows, who even knows? It's fine. It's whatever. Late at night,

776
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,920
fucking one in the morning, parents asleep, dial up internet is

777
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:44,360
pbbang logging on and I'm like, I'm gonna, I'm on a fucking question.

778
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:51,320
Go to Google.com, type in girl. Sorry, no, go to fucking yahoo.com type in whatever,

779
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:58,200
because this was a female. Go to ask. Go to ask jeves.com, and ask, where

780
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:05,480
is the pornography sticker? He directs you, you like, he, he ushers you in his hands like,

781
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,880
Oh, this way, sir.

782
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,880
Follow me, follow me, my lord.

783
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,280
Right, right this way.

784
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,280
Right.

785
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,380
Better, simpler times, better times.

786
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,080
Ask Jeeves.

787
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,080
I can ask Jeeves.

788
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,880
What the fuck?

789
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,280
Before we reinvented racism, we'd solved racism back then,

790
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,480
but then we had to go and re-invent it.

791
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,280
And now, and now there's no more boobs on the internet.

792
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:41,080
Nah, well gone.

793
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,780
What did you say?

794
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,880
Where is the pornography?

795
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,780
Yes.

796
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,680
Where is the pornography?

797
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,780
Sir.

798
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:54,180
I shouldn't call, why would I call my manservant sir?

799
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,280
We call him Jeeves.

800
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,480
Where is the pornography, sir?

801
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,680
On askjeeves.com.

802
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,880
Oh.

803
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:02,780
Oh.

804
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:04,480
Oh, what happened?

805
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:11,780
Oh, it's news articles about people getting caught on child pornography.

806
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:14,180
Yeah, I don't think I want to be on askjeeves anymore.

807
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,180
I'm going to exit out of that.

808
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,280
Bummer, bummer.

809
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,380
Jeeves, why did you send me to this place?

810
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:21,380
Jeeves, that's not.

811
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:24,980
What were you thinking?

812
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,480
You're fired, Jeeves.

813
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,980
The first thing that comes to his mind.

814
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:28,980
You're fucking fired.

815
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,980
You think your pension?

816
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:32,980
Forget about it.

817
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,180
Nah, you're done.

818
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:35,880
You're out in your ass.

819
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,380
No more fucking, no benefits for you.

820
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:42,980
You're going to have to fucking, you're going to beg in the streets.

821
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:47,980
You're going to say, I was Jeeves once upon a time, but not anymore because you fucked up.

822
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:51,980
Ah, okay.

823
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,180
That's all well and good.

824
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,180
That's fine.

825
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:56,180
That's cool.

826
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:58,280
I'm out of shit.

827
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,280
I don't have anything to say.

828
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,280
You want to go to voicemails or no?

829
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,280
Well, I can, one last thing.

830
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:12,280
My pee is a strange lime green color.

831
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,280
I was a little worried, but then I looked up.

832
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,280
You know what I bet it is?

833
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,280
Okay, I think I know what it means, but go on.

834
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,280
No, no, no.

835
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,280
Tell me what you think.

836
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,280
I think it's vitamin B, right?

837
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,280
Yeah, you got it.

838
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,280
Yeah, I'm a genius.

839
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,280
I'm a penis.

840
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,280
It's a penis.

841
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:42,280
I've been having multivitamins for like, you know, food supplements, vitamins, voetamines.

842
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,280
Just get them in me.

843
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,280
Just get them in me.

844
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,280
But I drank one today and I'm like, pee in green.

845
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,280
I guess I have enough.

846
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,280
I don't really need to take that, actually.

847
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,280
Yes, if you.

848
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,280
Which is good.

849
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:57,280
This means my urinary tract is all functioning and it's doing its job of getting rid of the

850
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,280
excess bullshit.

851
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,280
If you have excess vitamin B, it makes you pee.

852
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:05,280
I mean, it's not like green green, but it's like neon yellow to almost like a highlighter

853
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,280
yellow, like.

854
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:14,280
It's like Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band, John Lennon, yellow, green.

855
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:19,280
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band.

856
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,280
Oh, his suit.

857
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,280
Yeah.

858
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,280
Yeah, I see.

859
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,280
I see.

860
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,280
Yeah, I'm pretty much like a word, yellow, green.

861
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,280
Some people just see it as one or the other and I don't get it.

862
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:41,280
I mean, honestly, like, I mean, different, different photos of these, it looks different.

863
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,280
Like in some of the more, the more like saturated, like high contrast ones, it looks yellow, but

864
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,280
the less saturated, like group shots of him, it looks green.

865
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,280
I think it's like, I think it's green though.

866
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,280
It's green.

867
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:59,280
It looks more green when it when it's shot on the yellow background, but on a blue background,

868
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,280
it looks more yellow.

869
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:04,280
You know, because that's how colors work.

870
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:08,280
Oh, God, it's so confusing.

871
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:14,280
Wait, is this is this dress white and gold or black and blue?

872
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,280
This is your eye black and blue.

873
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,280
Yes.

874
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,280
Based.

875
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:24,280
I'm, I'm, I'm so proud of myself.

876
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:28,280
I'm so proud of myself for identifying the pee.

877
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:32,280
No, because I've had, I've had that.

878
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:36,280
I also was taking multivitamins and was like, why is my pee greenish?

879
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,280
And I looked it up and was like, oh, it's vitamin B.

880
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,280
Okay.

881
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,280
No problem.

882
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,280
No problem.

883
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,280
Too much of that shit.

884
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:47,280
I took, oh God, that reminds me.

885
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,280
This is so embarrassing.

886
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,280
The other, it was for, for Christmas.

887
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,280
My parents, no, it wasn't for Christmas.

888
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:57,280
It was for, it was more recent than that, whatever.

889
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:04,280
I saw my parents not too long ago and they gave me a bottle of gummy vitamins and these

890
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:07,280
gummy vitamins were incredible.

891
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,280
They were so good.

892
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,280
They were the most delicious gummy vitamins I've ever had.

893
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:18,280
And in case you're curious, these are, the brand is Welby, W-E-L-B-Y.

894
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:23,280
Welby adult gummy multivit, they taste incredible.

895
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:31,280
They taste so good that I couldn't stop myself and I ate like half the jar all at once because

896
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,280
they were like too fucking delicious.

897
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,280
That's the stupidest thing you could have done.

898
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,280
I, you don't understand.

899
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,280
You don't understand how good they taste.

900
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,280
You fool.

901
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:49,280
Well, it's one, if you like the taste, you should have spread it out over less times

902
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,280
so you could enjoy the taste more.

903
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:55,280
And also, I don't think you're supposed to take so many vitamins at the same time.

904
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,280
You're not.

905
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,280
You're not.

906
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:02,280
But as soon as I had done it, I was like, I was like, oh my God, what have I done?

907
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,280
And I started Googling like, how many,

908
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,280
can I overdose on multivitamins?

909
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:14,280
The general consensus seemed to be that no, the only thing that would be in any multivitamin

910
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,280
that can actually be toxic is iron.

911
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,280
And these don't have iron in them.

912
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:26,280
So the worst that was going to happen, I mean, they all said, okay, some vitamins are water soluble.

913
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,280
Those, no problem.

914
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,280
You will just pee them out easy.

915
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,280
Some of them are fat soluble.

916
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,280
And those, you might get kind of sick if you take too much of them.

917
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:39,280
Yeah, you can over-saturate yourself with them and it'll make you sick.

918
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,280
It's not so bad.

919
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:45,280
Iron, too much iron can actually be poisonous, so that might be a problem.

920
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:50,280
So I'm like, okay, some of these vitamins, there's no iron, but some of them are fat soluble.

921
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,280
And I was very scared.

922
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:56,280
And I went and I induced vomiting.

923
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:02,280
I spent like an hour making myself throw up so that I could get these gummy vitamins out of me.

924
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,280
And I'm like, oh, they were so good.

925
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,280
Why did I do this?

926
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:12,280
Why did I turn something so good and beautiful into something so horrible to such a nightmare?

927
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:16,280
Literally, why the fuck did they make them so tasty, though?

928
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:20,280
They only need to be a little bit sweet so that it doesn't, it isn't bad.

929
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,280
They don't need to be like delicious.

930
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:30,280
These are, I mean, I appreciate the deliciousness I do, but, you know, it backfired.

931
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:33,280
It backfired in spectacular fashion.

932
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,280
I'm so stupid.

933
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,280
I don't know.

934
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,280
I just love gummies so much.

935
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,280
And I'm not kidding.

936
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,280
I have had so many different gummies.

937
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,280
These were not just some of the best multivitamin gummies.

938
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,280
They were some of the tastiest gummies I've ever had.

939
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,280
They're shockingly good.

940
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,280
Do you still have the...

941
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,280
I have the bottle.

942
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,280
Yeah, I have the bottle.

943
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,280
Maybe you could reverse engineer why the gummies taste so good from the ingredients.

944
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:14,280
Dextrose, sucrose, pectin, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural peach flavor, natural orange flavor, natural strawberry flavor, vegetable oil, beta carotene, or purple carrot juice concentrate.

945
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:19,280
The carrot juice might have something to do with it.

946
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,280
I don't know.

947
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:27,280
The dextrose and sucrose pretty standard, pretty standard main ingredient for a gummy.

948
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,280
Maybe it's the natural fruit flavoring.

949
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,280
Maybe.

950
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:34,280
I mean, it was the flavor and also the texture.

951
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,280
They had a perfect gummy texture.

952
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,280
They weren't, they were juicy.

953
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,280
They weren't too chewy.

954
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,280
They weren't rubbery.

955
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,280
I don't know.

956
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,280
It's so hard to describe them.

957
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,280
They were just chewy enough.

958
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,280
There's...

959
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,280
I don't know.

960
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,280
The other...

961
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,280
It was also bad because like I'm trying to do keto and I can't eat half a...

962
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:01,280
I can't be keto and eat half a bottle of the...

963
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,280
Even if they weren't vitamin, I can't eat that many gummies.

964
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,280
Honestly, I feel bad even.

965
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:10,280
I'm sort of glad that they're gone because now I'm not eating them anymore.

966
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:15,280
Because now I'm eating like normal vitamins that are not gummy vitamins that don't have any carbs in them.

967
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,280
Because carbs bad for keto.

968
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:20,280
So, you know, problem solved.

969
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,280
But I think...

970
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,280
I keep thinking like, damn, I mean, if I'm ever...

971
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:29,280
If I'm ever wanting to have gummy vitamins in the future, I want these.

972
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,280
I want these well-bees.

973
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,280
These are just shockingly good.

974
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,280
Everyone, I cannot...

975
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:41,280
I cannot recommend well-bees gummy bites highly enough.

976
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,280
Really, just 10 out of 10 is my review.

977
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,280
Let me know in the comments.

978
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:55,280
The active vitamin I was having was like a dry pill that you put into a glass of water and then it fizzes up.

979
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,280
It turns a blood red, which is kind of cool.

980
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,280
Does it taste like...

981
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,280
Does it have like a flavor in it?

982
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,280
Yeah, it tastes like cranberry, raspberry a little bit.

983
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,280
Okay.

984
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,280
Quite nice.

985
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:08,280
I just take a pill.

986
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:12,280
I think I have like spectrovite when I got from a CVS.

987
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:17,280
I need a fucking effervescent beverage.

988
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,280
Okay, so that's my fucking story of why I had to puke.

989
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,280
It's so...

990
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,280
Puking is so bad.

991
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:34,280
And when I do it, when I do it, it like fucks up my face.

992
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:40,280
Like after puking for a while, I looked at my face and my eyes were bloodshot.

993
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:50,280
And there were like spots on my skin, like little tiny blood specks on like around my nose and eyes.

994
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:53,280
Like tiny capillaries had burst.

995
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,280
And I'm like...

996
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,280
Oh no.

997
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,280
And I'm like...

998
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,280
Are you straining that hard?

999
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,280
You know, I didn't feel...

1000
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:05,280
I mean, it was a bit strenuous, but I didn't feel like I was like pushing myself to the breaking point.

1001
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:10,280
And yet I must have been because I was clearly like bursting capillaries in my fucking face.

1002
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,280
And I'm looking at this and I'm like...

1003
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,280
I look like a nightmare.

1004
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,280
I look like...

1005
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:20,280
I look like decrepit and like sickly and like a mutant.

1006
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:24,280
Like I just aged like 30 years just by doing this.

1007
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,280
God, no.

1008
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:30,280
I should avoid doing this at all costs in the future.

1009
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:34,280
It was very, very unpleasant to see that.

1010
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:40,280
Yeah, I've been vomiting recently because of the sickness that I'm not quite over.

1011
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:43,280
I'm still like this whole last week I've been like...

1012
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,280
Oh, I feel fine today.

1013
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,280
Wait, no, I don't know.

1014
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,280
I don't.

1015
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:50,280
I'm feeling terrible and fine and sort of bad and fine.

1016
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:53,280
So I think I'm on the mend, so that's good.

1017
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,280
Like the vomiting days are...

1018
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,280
They're so annoying.

1019
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,280
Like it's like a combination of...

1020
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:08,280
I feel like the world is going to crumble around me because I feel so weak that it can't move.

1021
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:12,280
And I know that I need like sustenance in order to live.

1022
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,280
And I'm like, am I going to be able to make breakfast today?

1023
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,280
I don't know.

1024
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,280
Oh, God.

1025
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:22,280
Because I don't know that I'm going to vomit until it's too late and then I'm vomiting.

1026
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,280
Because I feel sick and I'm like, I hope it just goes away.

1027
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,280
Sometimes it does.

1028
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,280
Sometimes it doesn't.

1029
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:32,280
I've never had my fucking eyes bloodshot from puking, though.

1030
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,280
That sounds so scary.

1031
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,280
This...

1032
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:39,280
Yeah, no.

1033
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,280
That is consistent.

1034
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,280
Whenever I throw up my eyes get bloodshot.

1035
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:48,280
The burst capillary spots on my face, that was new.

1036
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:50,280
I'd never noticed that before.

1037
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,280
Very creepy.

1038
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,280
I don't know if that's normal, but I mean...

1039
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,280
That's not normal.

1040
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,280
Oh, God.

1041
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,280
What do you want me to do about it?

1042
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,280
I don't understand.

1043
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,280
I don't know, Ben. I think you're fucking falling apart.

1044
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,280
I think we should...

1045
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,280
I don't see...

1046
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:16,280
I don't see why it would put like enormous strain on my face to be doing that.

1047
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:20,280
Like my fucking diaphragm maybe, you know?

1048
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,280
Like why my face?

1049
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,280
I don't know.

1050
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,280
It wasn't...

1051
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,280
It was oddly satisfying when I...

1052
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,280
I mean, it hurt and it felt bad,

1053
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:36,280
but it was in a way oddly satisfying to, you know,

1054
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:41,280
attempt to throw up and finally get it.

1055
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,280
Oh, yeah.

1056
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,280
I finally got it.

1057
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,280
I think there's definitely a part of the brain that's like,

1058
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:50,280
oh, you successfully expelled the poison from your body.

1059
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,280
Good job. Now you feel good, you know?

1060
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:59,280
Which is sort of abstractly enjoyable,

1062
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,280
even while the process is like nightmarish and suffering.

1063
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:07,280
Oh, definitely the worst part about vomiting is the...

1064
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:11,280
I'm not literally vomiting yet, but it's getting close.

1065
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,280
It's getting closer and I can't do anything about it really.

1066
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:18,280
I just have to sit by the toilet and wait and there it comes.

1067
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:20,280
And then it's gone and then it's like,

1068
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:25,280
oh, it's a great start to the day and I feel full of women vigor

1069
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,280
and I can do everything.

1070
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:31,280
I mean, what I did, because I needed to throw up,

1071
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,280
what I did was I just drank tons of water, like too much water.

1072
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,280
Oh, no.

1073
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:43,280
Like make myself bloated by like drinking like half a gallon

1074
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,280
or a gallon just like right there.

1075
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,280
And then it's like my stomach's so full it needs to expel

1076
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:52,280
and it like kind of like forces the issue and it made it like,

1077
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,280
that was how I, if I was feeling like,

1078
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,280
okay, I'm kind of feeling like I'm going to puke,

1079
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,280
but I'm not quite there yet.

1080
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:02,280
I would just like chug some water and then it would like get me closer.

1081
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,280
This is disgusting.

1082
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,280
No, this is the worst podcast ever.

1083
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:09,280
Vomit, vomit talk with Ben and G.

1084
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:12,280
Well, you know, everyone knows how it feels.

1085
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:17,280
Everyone knows how this is a relatable gamer moment for everyone.

1086
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,280
We've had shitcast.

1087
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,280
We talked about pee.

1088
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,280
We talked, in previous episodes, we've talked about shit.

1089
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:27,280
This is the pee episode and the puke episode.

1090
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,280
So you can double your money.

1091
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:35,280
The vaccine and some other stuff.

1092
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,280
The transphobia.

1093
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,280
That was the first thing.

1094
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,280
Oh, sure.

1095
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,280
Right.

1096
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:41,280
Yeah.

1097
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,280
But mostly the gross shit.

1098
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:46,280
All your favorite things.

1099
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,280
Cool.

1100
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,280
Cool.

1101
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,280
Okay.

1102
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,280
Well, you want to go voicemail?

1103
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,280
Okay.

1104
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,280
We actually have a lot.

1105
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:00,280
So let's try and be fast.

1106
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,280
Yeah, I know.

1107
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,280
Let's try and be fast.

1108
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,280
Yeah.

1109
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:07,280
You have to go all the way back to page three.

1110
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,280
The first one is called.

1111
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:13,280
I know the first one is called who is Yig even for.

1112
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,280
Do you see that one?

1113
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,280
Yep.

1114
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,280
Okay.

1115
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:19,280
Three, two, one, go.

1116
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,280
Hey guys.

1117
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,280
So while we're shitting on Yig studios and don't get me wrong,

1118
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,280
we definitely should keep this up.

1119
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,280
I just got to ask.

1120
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,280
Who is it for?

1121
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,280
Like what audience are they trying to court?

1122
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,280
I legitimately don't understand it because they're always going

1123
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,280
on about how much they hate parasocial relationships.

1124
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,280
Fuck parasocial relationships.

1125
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,280
I don't know you anything.

1126
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,280
You don't know who I am, but it feels like their entire

1127
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,280
business model is built around it.

1128
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,280
Like having meetups and.

1129
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:53,280
Constantly making videos of them just getting high and shit

1130
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,280
like anyone cares.

1131
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,280
I don't know if I agree with that.

1132
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,280
Think that they're friends.

1133
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,280
I just legitimately don't understand.

1134
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:04,280
I mean, it's not like you have casual fans because you're not

1135
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,280
making anything that's worth watching at all.

1136
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:10,280
And it's not like you're making your old fans happy because

1137
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,280
you're constantly shitting on them.

1138
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,280
Calling them entitled and not giving them blue rays that they

1139
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,280
paid for.

1140
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:22,280
So I just really don't understand what Trixie is trying to do.

1141
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:24,280
You guys can enlighten me.

1142
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,280
Let me know.

1143
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,280
But I don't think you don't either.

1144
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:28,280
I think you are wrong.

1145
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,280
Anyway, PCP forever.

1146
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:33,280
Tom will never die.

1147
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:36,280
Tom will outlast all of us.

1148
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:40,280
I think you are wrong to say that Yig is about like courting

1149
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,280
parasocial relationships.

1150
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,280
I don't think it is.

1151
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,280
The meetups they talk about doing are not with like fan.

1152
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,280
They're not fan meetups.

1153
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:53,280
They talk about meeting with like other, you know, people that

1154
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,280
make creative.

1155
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,280
So people like noise.

1156
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,280
Raps.

1157
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,280
Yeah.

1158
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,280
It's like other other people who make who make raps.

1159
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:06,280
They talk about like meeting up with those people on their bus

1160
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,280
tour, which for the record is never happening.

1161
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,280
There is no RV.

1162
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:14,280
I think the stuff is that it's it's weird because it's like it's a

1163
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:20,280
Trixie project with music and and I don't know how much of the

1164
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:23,280
direction like obviously Trixie wants to do a lot of this weird

1165
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,280
music stuff.

1166
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,280
And that's fine.

1167
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,280
That's cool.

1168
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,280
I guess.

1169
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,280
And the anime is fine.

1170
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:29,280
It was fine.

1171
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,280
It was fine when it was on when it was on the after dark channel.

1172
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:33,280
Yeah.

1173
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,280
The there was a comment or something that somebody was

1174
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,280
complaining.

1175
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,280
Nobody minded the idea that this this channel that she's had

1176
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:45,280
with 300,000 subscribers who subscribed for a particular type

1177
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:50,280
of content are like they're obviously not going to be happy

1178
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:54,280
with like the majority of the things that is anime analysis

1179
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,280
still being made.

1180
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:59,280
But like they're obviously confused and like, oh, OK, what

1181
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:03,280
what the fuck and they're leaving and and Riley was like,

1182
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,280
yeah, well, if you don't like it, you can leave.

1183
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:09,280
We're definitely trying to bleed subscribers who don't care

1184
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,280
about what we're doing.

1185
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,280
Yeah.

1186
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,280
And I'm like, if that's the case, why did you want to then why

1187
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,280
did you put it on this channel?

1188
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:17,280
Yeah.

1189
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:21,280
Then if you even what what was the point of starting here?

1190
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,280
Like it seemed to be working fine.

1191
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,280
Like you had the void gazes chases on the after dark thing

1192
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:30,280
that could be the whatever did you know nobody minded nobody

1193
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:32,280
minded when it was on that channel.

1194
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:35,280
It wasn't like because people who were subscribed to that

1195
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:39,280
channel already wanted to see like the side content the other

1196
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,280
stuff besides the anime analysis.

1197
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,280
That's what that channel was for.

1198
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,280
You put it on the main channel and it's like, well, this isn't,

1199
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:49,280
you know, most people are like, this is not what I signed up

1200
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,280
for.

1201
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:56,280
I don't know the who the who the intended audience is.

1202
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:59,280
I mean, it's it's a little.

1203
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:03,280
I don't I honestly don't know other than like they're making

1204
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,280
stuff that like the stuff they make.

1205
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,280
Well, sure.

1206
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,280
But like, what does that mean?

1207
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,280
I don't I think they're just making it for themselves because

1208
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:18,280
they like it, which on the one hand is like, I guess that's admirable.

1209
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:22,280
If you're not like catering it to anyone, but at the same time,

1210
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:27,280
no, I also don't really know who it's supposed to appeal to other

1211
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:31,280
than maybe if you if you knew these people and by people,

1212
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,280
I mean Trixie because nobody knew these other people before.

1213
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,280
If you knew them and you're invested in whatever they're doing,

1214
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:40,280
then maybe you're interested in these videos that she's making

1215
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:41,280
with these other people.

1216
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,280
And if not, then you're probably not.

1217
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:48,280
I guess that's mostly just like on the off chance that the people

1218
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:53,280
Trixie has as followers also like her music.

1219
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,280
That would be that's what they're looking for.

1220
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:58,280
I just want to.

1221
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:02,280
You know, hope they have enough people into interested to like

1222
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:05,280
survive with the money they could get from that.

1223
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,280
So yeah, sure.

1224
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:11,280
I just I just.

1225
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:15,280
OK, yeah, it's bizarre.

1226
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:20,280
Next voicemail is called protagonist three, two, one, go.

1227
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:24,280
Who do you think in your opinion is the protagonist

1228
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:27,280
of the PCP me me?

1229
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,280
I mean, what sort of question is that?

1230
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:32,280
I don't see anyone else is like more important.

1231
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:38,280
I'm the protagonist of my own story and the PCP is really a thing.

1232
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:42,280
I feel like I feel like.

1233
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:46,280
I mean, I don't know for sure, but I feel like everyone should

1234
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:49,280
feel like they are the protagonist.

1235
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:53,280
I would I would hope that everyone involved.

1236
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:57,280
Sees it sees it sees it as their project sees it as their

1237
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,280
project to an extent.

1238
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,280
Yeah, yeah.

1239
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:03,280
If it's not me, then it's nobody.

1240
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,280
Like like from the outside looking in, maybe if it's a show,

1241
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:10,280
you could you could just you could like ascribe a protagonist

1242
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,280
onto the podcast from the outside.

1243
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,280
But from the inside, I can't think of anyone other than myself

1244
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,280
because that's it.

1245
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,280
I don't I see my own perspective way more than anyone else's

1246
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:22,280
because I'm me.

1247
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,280
So yeah, I don't know.

1248
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,280
Yeah.

1249
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,280
I don't know.

1250
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:27,280
I don't know.

1251
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:30,280
Funny question, but I don't know if it really has a great

1252
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,280
answer.

1253
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,280
Sorry about that.

1254
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:37,280
Next voicemail is called return of a hilarious gimmick.

1255
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:45,280
Three, two, one, go Beatrice more like but yeah.

1256
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,280
Yeah.

1257
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,280
More like nice.

1258
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:55,280
But I like it didn't it sounded like there was more more like

1259
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,280
but.

1260
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:59,280
Okay, cool.

1261
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:02,280
Next one is called sad, but surprisingly sexy boy.

1262
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:07,280
Three, two, one, go.

1263
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:10,280
Holy fuck.

1264
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,280
Movies.

1265
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:16,280
People movies are videos where real people are the primary focus

1266
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:18,280
sort of like reality.

1267
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,280
I hurt myself.

1268
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:25,280
You know, I do have a sizable chip on my shoulder and I always

1269
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,280
have had a chip on my shoulder about the fact that I am not

1270
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,280
more widely known on YouTube.

1271
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:34,280
People movies are not more successful.

1272
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:39,280
I'm not, you know, a member of the glorious 100k subscriber

1273
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,280
clock.

1274
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,280
I allowed myself to be fired from the show so that it could be

1275
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,280
allowed.

1276
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,280
I might never have 100k subscribers.

1277
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:48,280
I've never even had 10,000 subscribers.

1278
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,280
I was also until recently a member of a podcast called

1279
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:52,280
The Procrastin Interest.

1280
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:55,280
I deserve a lot more recognition than I can.

1281
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,280
That's not me being arrogant.

1282
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,280
I mean, it's just a fact.

1283
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,280
I've been doing this for so long and I've been doing it for so

1284
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,280
well.

1285
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,280
I decided to formally leave the podcast because this would be

1286
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:05,280
insane.

1287
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:09,280
And it's just one of those, you know, random, deep and sad truths

1288
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:13,280
of being an artist that I haven't, you know, hold on like wildfire

1289
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,280
and playing other channels and other things have been lucky

1290
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,280
enough to do it.

1291
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:22,280
You heard some legal people move video logs.

1292
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,280
I...

1293
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:34,280
I don't really get the Jesse, like, a bit.

1294
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:35,280
Okay.

1295
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,280
What did it say at the end?

1296
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:38,280
We were in a people movie all along.

1297
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:39,280
Okay.

1298
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,280
Sure.

1299
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:44,280
It felt like what was supposed to be happening here is that we

1300
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:48,280
were supposed to be contrasting what Jesse was saying with

1301
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,280
what Trixie was saying.

1302
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:54,280
But I don't really see them as like...

1303
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,280
I don't see the connection.

1304
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,280
I don't see the connection.

1305
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,280
Jesse's saying I should be more famous.

1306
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,280
Trixie's saying...

1307
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:05,280
I mean, she's saying I'm what, like...

1308
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,280
That I was...

1309
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:11,280
Describing what people movies are and saying that she quit

1310
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:14,280
CanTent and the PCP.

1311
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:16,280
Man, maybe I'm missing...

1312
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:17,280
Yeah, I don't know.

1313
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:21,280
Maybe the song is like, oh, like, you could have it all.

1314
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,280
Like, oh, the all AK 100,000 subs.

1315
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,280
Is it just saying subs go down?

1316
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,280
I think we might be just saying that.

1317
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:33,280
I mean, maybe.

1318
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:36,280
I don't know if it's if it's if there's a message here.

1319
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:38,280
I'm afraid it flew over my head.

1320
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,280
I apologize.

1321
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:43,280
People at movies.yig.

1322
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:48,280
Next voicemail is called pure Shadden Freud pumping through my veins.

1323
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,280
Three, two, one, go.

1324
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,280
Here comes Trixie, worse teeth in the game, looking just as

1325
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,280
unattractive on the outside as she is on the inside, burning

1326
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,280
bridges left and right.

1327
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:02,280
The PCP knows she's untrustworthy and ungrateful.

1328
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:03,280
The dick show things.

1329
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,280
Yeah, you're a bunch of drama whore and cowards, which is true.

1330
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,280
Not to mention they still think she's a pedophile.

1331
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:11,280
Nate Baseman laying down the ultimatums because he's not

1332
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:14,280
blind and he knows a train wreck when he sees one.

1333
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:17,280
Just to think that this man quit his job and moved to Virginia

1334
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,280
just to make content with her.

1335
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,280
Bad role, dude, bad role.

1336
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:24,280
Also, what the fuck are movie movies?

1337
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:27,280
Didn't she ditch the Digi branding to make herself more appealing

1338
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,280
to advertisers?

1339
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,280
If so, excellent job, honey.

1340
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,280
You're really killing it.

1341
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:34,280
I only got one last thing to say.

1342
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:37,280
Brush your teeth, bitch.

1343
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:41,280
I mean, I believe she's brushes her teeth now.

1344
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:44,280
I believe that's canon.

1345
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:48,280
Other than that, I agree.

1346
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,280
Yeah.

1347
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,280
Thanks for the voicemail.

1348
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:55,280
Next one is called, next one is called

1349
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,280
Gibbtfo love jelly beaner.

1350
01:50:58,280 --> 01:50:59,280
How much do you want to bet?

1351
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:00,280
He will mention the Jews.

1352
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:03,280
Odds on the odds on admission of the Jews.

1353
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,280
100%.

1354
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:06,280
100%.

1355
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:07,280
Here we go.

1356
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,280
Three, two, one, go.

1357
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,280
I don't like Jews.

1358
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,280
Oh, you said it.

1359
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,280
I said it.

1360
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:19,280
It was you all along.

1361
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,280
No, that can't be.

1362
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,280
I kind of said that.

1363
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:26,280
Maybe I blacked out for a minute there, but I'm pretty sure.

1364
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:28,280
I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.

1365
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:32,280
I, you know, I think you probably did say it.

1366
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:39,280
Actually, I don't know, but I just think you would and did for sure.

1367
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:42,280
Sorry, but it's true.

1368
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,280
You got to look yourself in the mirror.

1369
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,280
Take a long, hard look.

1370
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,280
Okay.

1371
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:50,280
Next voicemail is called Digi bro.

1372
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:52,280
Three, two, one, go.

1373
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:54,280
Tricksie has spoken.

1374
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,280
Digi bro is dead.

1375
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,280
Well, not anymore.

1376
01:51:58,280 --> 01:51:59,280
Fuckers.

1377
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,280
Guess what?

1378
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:05,280
She transitioned to Tricksie and I'm transitioning to Digi bro.

1379
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,280
My pronouns are autistic and pedophile.

1380
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:13,280
My gender is human content machine.

1381
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:17,280
I'm going to make anime videos while wearing women's sunglasses

1382
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:20,280
and nobody can stop me.

1383
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:23,280
If you ever want your name back, Tricksie, you're going to have to

1384
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,280
liquid Chris style rap battle me for it.

1385
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,280
I don't think she wants it back.

1386
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,280
More like a golden snitch.

1387
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,280
Ha, got him.

1388
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:36,280
I'm a fucking legendary PCP music intro creator.

1389
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:39,280
I'm unstoppable.

1390
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:44,280
Also, if you want a new co-host for content.

1391
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:47,280
I can even pronounce it right.

1392
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,280
Content.

1393
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,280
Do you say content?

1394
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:53,280
It's canton.

1395
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,280
Canton.

1396
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,280
You have to say it exactly like that.

1397
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:03,280
I don't think you're going to get liquid Chris style challenge

1398
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:06,280
to a karaoke battle.

1399
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:13,280
I think she's happy to leave the name, but enjoy it, I guess.

1400
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,280
Enjoy yourself with it.

1401
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:19,280
The next one is called...

1402
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,280
It's a link to a YouTube channel.

1403
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:28,280
The link goes to a channel called DITRH, which appears to be a

1404
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:33,280
Flat Earth Truth video or channel.

1405
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:36,280
Alright, let's give this a listen.

1406
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:38,280
Three, two, one, go.

1407
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:43,280
David Weiss is the greatest Flat Earther of all time.

1408
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,280
He's really cool and he goes on lots of podcasts.

1409
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:50,280
He'll give you a Bitcoin if you can prove the Earth is round.

1410
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,280
Dude, a whole bit.

1411
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,280
But the Earth isn't round. It's flat.

1412
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,280
Nobody can prove that it's round.

1413
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:00,280
Because when they never went to space, it's all fake.

1414
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:04,280
And the world is not spinning. It's stationary.

1415
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,280
Whereas the Coriolis effect?

1416
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:09,280
Well, you can't prove that it's real because it's bullshit.

1417
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,280
I've never seen the Coriolis effect.

1418
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,280
The Sun is spinning overhead.

1419
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,280
It's spinning around the disk.

1420
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:18,280
And the Moon is also doing that.

1421
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:21,280
And the Sun goes in and out between the tropics and stuff.

1422
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,280
I know that.

1423
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:26,280
You can circumnavigate, but you can't go north to south.

1424
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:31,280
Because if you go south, you end up beyond the Ice Wall.

1425
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,280
Who knows who's there?

1426
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:36,280
It could just be New Tartaria. Who knows?

1427
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:40,280
All I know is that the Great Pyramid of Chihulu, Chathula,

1428
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,280
or whatever you say, is covered in mud.

1429
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:44,280
Why is it covered in mud?

1430
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,280
It's covered in 20 feet of mud.

1431
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,280
Why is it covered in mud?

1432
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:53,280
Because there's ruins everywhere.

1433
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,280
Have you ever heard of the wow lines?

1434
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:58,280
They're called wow lines because they make you go wow.

1435
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:00,280
There's ruins everywhere, man.

1436
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:02,280
There's an ancient civilization.

1437
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,280
Rome was a worldwide phenomenon.

1438
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,280
They don't want you to know this.

1439
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:08,280
They don't want you to know your history.

1440
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:10,280
The Civil War was a cover.

1441
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:13,280
Like the bit of just being a big conspiracy weirdo

1442
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:17,280
and not thinking Ireland and Scotland are different places.

1443
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,280
No, that was a different guy.

1444
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,280
That was the same guy.

1445
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,280
Was it the same guy?

1446
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,280
Maybe it was the same guy.

1447
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:29,280
I wasn't convinced until you told me about the mud

1448
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,280
on the Great Pyramid of Chihulu.

1449
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,280
Why is it there?

1450
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,280
Why is there mud on Chulula?

1451
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,280
Maybe there is an ice wall.

1452
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:39,280
Why else would there be mud?

1453
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,280
Why can't they ask the question?

1454
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,280
Why can't they say where the mud is from?

1455
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,280
A simple question should have a simple answer.

1456
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,280
Am I right?

1457
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,280
And it does.

1458
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,280
No curvature, baby.

1459
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:53,280
Well, you know what?

1460
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,280
I believe all saw it.

1461
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,280
Oh, my God.

1462
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,280
We got four more voicemails

1463
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,280
while we've been listening to them.

1464
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,280
No.

1465
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,280
We got our first the page.

1466
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,280
Rapid fire.

1467
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,280
The next one is called

1468
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,280
Hi Ben smiley face.

1469
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,280
Did you see that one?

1470
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,280
Three, two, one, go.

1471
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,280
Hey, Ben.

1472
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,280
I heard you weren't

1473
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,280
invited to Radcon 5.

1474
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,280
So I'm thinking 4.5.

1475
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:25,280
Maybe you can make the next one.

1476
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,280
You know, Radcon 6.

1477
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,280
We're going to have a

1478
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,280
Golden Witch 101.

1479
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,280
People have floated this.

1480
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,280
Nice lecture.

1481
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,280
I miss those.

1482
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,280
Those are pretty cool.

1483
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,280
People have floated the idea.

1484
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,280
I think it has.

1485
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,280
I think it's not.

1486
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,280
I mean, I don't know.

1487
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,280
I mean, I don't know.

1488
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,280
There's enough there to talk about, I guess.

1489
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,280
But do I actually want to do it?

1490
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,280
I don't know.

1491
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:57,280
The next one is called

1492
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,280
Gaming 3, 2, 1, go.

1493
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,280
Hey guys, it's me.

1494
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,280
It's that Mario Kart guy again.

1495
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,280
Oh, fuck yeah.

1496
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,280
I'm actually playing Mario Kart right now.

1497
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,280
I'm listening to the new episode.

1498
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:11,280
I'm in the middle of it.

1499
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,280
Incredibly through base.

1500
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,280
It's real interesting so far.

1501
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,280
It's a little bit of a bummer, but it's also really great.

1502
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,280
There's a lot of back and forth.

1503
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,280
A lot of different viewpoints.

1504
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,280
Ben is right.

1505
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,280
There's lots of different viewpoints.

1506
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,280
There's Ben, right, and others wrong.

1507
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,280
No.

1508
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,280
But I found out something crazy about the switch.

1509
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,280
And this one's going to be the end of me.

1510
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,280
You can actually take it out of the dock.

1511
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,280
And it still plays games.

1512
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,280
No kidding.

1513
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,280
It's like a Game Boy.

1514
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,280
But it plays video games.

1515
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:47,280
Dude, this is a game changer.

1516
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,280
How did you do that?

1517
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,280
Like, literally what the fuck?

1518
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,280
What do you mean what the fuck?

1519
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,280
What's so confusing about it?

1520
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:57,280
This changes everything.

1521
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,280
Bro!

1522
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,280
The entire console is the thing.

1523
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,280
And then the stand is just a stand.

1524
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:07,280
Console out of the stand?

1525
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,280
That's...

1526
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,280
I'm sorry, but why aren't more people talking about this?

1527
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:15,280
Why aren't more people talking about this is all I'm saying.

1528
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:17,280
Why is there mud there?

1529
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,280
Let me know.

1530
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,280
Why is the mud?

1531
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,280
Why is there mud on the chinchalula?

1532
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,280
Okay, next voicemail is called

1533
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,280
Hey Look It's a doigazers.

1534
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,280
I gotta say, doigazers needs

1535
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,280
to get some fresh material

1536
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,280
because it's wearing a little thin.

1537
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,280
Like, I get it. They do drugs.

1538
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:37,280
Alright, let's give it a shot.

1539
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,280
Three, two, one, go.

1540
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,280
Hello, welcome to doigazers.

1541
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:43,280
This is your host, Dee.

1542
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:45,280
And today we're going to be smoking some weed.

1543
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,280
And then we're going to be

1544
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,280
debunking Ben St.'s claims

1545
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,280
that we don't have

1546
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,280
an RV using facts and logic.

1547
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,280
There's no RV.

1548
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,280
Benjamin, I correct to inform you

1549
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,280
that we do indeed have an RV.

1550
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,280
It is almost...

1551
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,280
It's almost done being complete.

1552
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,280
We just have to make a few calls

1553
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,280
to the Lego Corporation

1554
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:09,280
about some missing pieces.

1555
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,280
And then, you know, after that, we're ready to roll.

1556
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,280
The numbers just don't add up.

1557
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:15,280
There's simply no way they can afford one.

1558
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,280
After that, we're going to release our diss track.

1559
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,280
To say nothing of the fact that

1560
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,280
living in an RV is difficult

1561
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,280
and wouldn't work.

1562
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,280
And she's been quite a thorn in the matter of fact.

1563
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,280
They wouldn't be able to hack it.

1564
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,280
But they can't even get that far.

1565
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,280
They simply can't afford it.

1566
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,280
So she really needs a diss track made about her.

1567
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,280
And Riley will be in it.

1568
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,280
My best friend.

1569
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,280
And after that, we're going to smoke some more weed.

1570
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,280
So stay tuned.

1571
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,280
And give me some more money.

1572
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,280
You know, I'm making $900 a month.

1573
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,280
Right away.

1574
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,280
But, you know, that's all getting smoked away.

1575
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,280
So...

1576
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,280
I need more.

1577
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:55,280
Thank you.

1578
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,280
You're welcome.

1579
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,280
Patreon thing also.

1580
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,280
Side note is almost up to

1581
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,280
$8.

1582
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,280
Great.

1583
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,280
Okay, next voicemail is called

1584
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,280
Watch Out 3, 2, 1, Go.

1585
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,280
I'm pretty sure Tommy J.

1586
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,280
is at large.

1587
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,280
I'm pretty sure he's sending in voicemails.

1588
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,280
No.

1589
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,280
I'm like 100%.

1590
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:21,280
It's impossible.

1591
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,280
I'm pretty sure some of these guys are Tommy J.

1592
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,280
Putting on a funny voice.

1593
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,280
It can't be true.

1594
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,280
Oh, no.

1595
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,280
You've reached our defenses.

1596
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,280
Maybe it's coming up.

1597
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,280
Tommy J's. But you know what?

1598
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,280
You know what? If he is,

1599
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,280
it hasn't been a problem.

1600
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,280
Whatever.

1601
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,280
Maybe you're right. Maybe this wild

1602
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,280
conspiracy theory is true.

1603
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,280
We can never truly know.

1604
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,280
Okay, the next one.

1605
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,280
Watch Out.

1606
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:53,280
Watch Out, the voicemail is called

1607
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,280
Tommy J is at large and on the loose.

1608
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,280
He's on the lam.

1609
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:59,280
Next voicemail is called

1610
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:01,280
Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.

1611
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:03,280
Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.

1612
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,280
Damn.

1613
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,280
Ernest for your brother.

1614
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:33,280
Are you going to fuck him?

1615
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:35,280
Ernest for your brother.

1616
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:37,280
Yeah.

1617
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,280
That's right.

1618
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,280
Okay.

1619
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,280
Good. It's fine.

1620
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:47,280
It's not multiple sclerosis.

1621
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,280
Just the one sclerosis.

1622
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,280
Singular sclerosis.

1623
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:53,280
Okay.

1624
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,280
Next voicemail is called

1625
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,280
Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.

1626
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:59,280
Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.

1627
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,280
Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.

1628
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,280
Sclerosis Man, 3, 2, 1, Go.

1629
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:05,280
Hey!

1630
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:07,280
Give and take this track.

1631
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,280
Let's get it.

1632
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,280
Get it. Hey, give and take.

1633
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:13,280
You're really a fake.

1634
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,280
I don't like your hair or your glasses.

1635
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:17,280
You're a snake.

1636
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,280
I came to drop rhymes about all your

1637
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,280
crimes and all of your projects.

1638
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,280
You keep clandestine.

1639
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:25,280
Here's Riley to take you to school.

1640
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,280
Yeah.

1641
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,280
Get him, Riley. You're my new best friend.

1642
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,280
Yeah, golden bitch.

1643
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,280
I'm going to get this guy

1644
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,280
give and take.

1645
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:37,280
I have a girlfriend.

1646
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,280
I'm the fizzier.

1647
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,280
Yeah.

1648
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,280
Yeah.

1649
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:45,280
Yeah, brother.

1650
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,280
Yeah.

1651
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,280
Okay.

1652
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,280
Give and take. You're a real bad girl.

1653
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,280
Every time you speak, it makes me hurl.

1654
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,280
Every breath you take, I wish you was your last.

1655
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:57,280
I drove your ass to school,

1656
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:59,280
so pay attention in class.

1657
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,280
Riley!

1658
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,280
Riley!

1659
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:05,280
Oh, god, I feel so fucking owned right now.

1660
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,280
Yeah, get it, Riley.

1661
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:09,280
This was a Doidgazer's original.

1662
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:11,280
Name Ben, you're still not cool.

1663
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,280
Holy shit.

1664
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,280
You're okay.

1665
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:17,280
Shout out to everyone who gets me money.

1666
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,280
I don't owe you anything, though.

1667
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,280
Get me more money.

1668
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:23,280
Okay, that was a winner.

1669
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,280
That was a real climb.

1670
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:27,280
That was a real high point in the Doidgazer's side.

1671
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,280
I really got stabbed through the heart

1672
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:31,280
a couple of times.

1673
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,280
Honestly?

1674
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,280
Those bars right there.

1675
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,280
You know, I'd unsub, but I think I might go back.

1676
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:39,280
If this is the kind of quality

1677
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:41,280
that the channel is dropping, I might have to go and resub.

1678
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,280
I'm interested now.

1679
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,280
They pulled me back in.

1680
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,280
Next...

1681
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,280
Next phone.

1682
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,280
That's really good.

1683
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,280
It's genuinely funny.

1684
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,280
Next voicemail is called

1685
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,280
the plural word for mice.

1686
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,280
Three, two, one, go.

1687
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,280
Mouses. Hey, Gib, obviously

1688
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,280
the plural to mouse is

1689
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,280
meese, like, jaw.

1690
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:07,280
Right, because Goose and Geese.

1691
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,280
Right.

1692
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,280
Call me back. It's Mouses.

1693
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:13,280
Goose. Goose and Geese.

1694
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:15,280
Moose and Mese.

1695
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,280
Moose and Mese.

1696
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,280
Moose and Mese.

1697
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:21,280
Mox.

1698
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:23,280
Mox and Mese.

1699
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:25,280
What about an ox?

1700
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,280
What about an oxen? Ox?

1701
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:29,280
Eeks.

1702
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:31,280
Eeks.

1703
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,280
I believe you. What about a moose?

1704
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,280
What about a cat?

1705
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,280
No. No more questions.

1706
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:39,280
No more questions. Only voicemails.

1707
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:41,280
Next voicemail is called

1708
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:43,280
Bees.

1709
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,280
Bees in my eyes

1710
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,280
and bees everywhere.

1711
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,280
Three, two, one, go.

1712
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,280
Oh!

1713
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:53,280
Konnichiwa.

1714
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:55,280
Konnichiwa to you as well.

1715
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,280
This is Ninja-sama.

1716
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,280
Peno-Sento-san.

1717
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,280
Resist.

1718
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,280
Tretel.

1719
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,280
We asked once more

1720
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:07,280
the ninja's just

1721
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,280
higher register.

1722
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,280
Ninja scroll.

1723
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,280
This is the last time

1724
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,280
we request

1725
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:17,280
return of the scroll.

1726
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,280
Ninja is not civil.

1727
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,280
It calls me a racist.

1728
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,280
We'll be declared next week

1729
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,280
Peno-Sento-san.

1730
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,280
Tushio,

1731
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,280
the Tokyo Ninja

1732
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,280
Chrono. Serious.

1733
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:33,280
Se, Konnichiwa,

1734
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,280
to you as well.

1735
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,280
Peno-Sento-san.

1736
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,280
Peno-Sento-san.

1737
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:41,280
Peno-Sento-san.

1738
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,280
Samurai-sama.

1739
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:45,280
Samurai-sama.

1740
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:47,280
My god, no!

1741
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:49,280
Oh god.

1742
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:51,280
Unlikely allies.

1743
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:53,280
Peno-Sento-san.

1744
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,280
I never thought I'd miss the old best too.

1745
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,280
No.

1746
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,280
Sayonara.

1747
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,280
That can't be true.

1748
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:05,280
This is so bad. This is so fucked up.

1749
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,280
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

1750
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,280
I just don't have it in me.

1751
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:11,280
It's going against my nature.

1752
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,280
It's my nature to steal

1753
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:15,280
and hoard scrolls.

1754
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:17,280
I'd be living a lie.

1755
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,280
I just want to say

1756
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:25,280
it's not cultural appropriation

1757
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,280
when I steal samurai

1758
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:29,280
and or ninja scrolls.

1759
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:31,280
It's cultural appreciation.

1760
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,280
I love them so much.

1761
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:35,280
It's cultural appreciation

1762
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,280
and value when I sell them on.

1763
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:39,280
I love the Japanese people

1764
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,280
so much that I will

1765
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,280
keep the scrolls

1766
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:45,280
even though a Japanese man

1767
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:47,280
will be killed over it.

1768
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:49,280
That's just the level to which I

1769
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:51,280
appreciate their culture.

1770
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:57,280
I'm so right.

1771
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,280
I'm so right. I'm far right.

1772
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,280
Fuck the Japanese.

1773
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,280
Next voicemail

1774
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:07,280
is called Riley Killed Pizza Party

1775
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,280
Man this is bullshit.

1776
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:15,280
Pan pizza suddenly decided

1777
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,280
I don't want to do pizza party anymore.

1778
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:19,280
Is that true?

1779
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:21,280
We finally got a man in.

1780
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,280
It's all a lie.

1781
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,280
Somehow this is Riley's fault.

1782
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:27,280
I fucking know it.

1783
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,280
He's got his fingers in every pie.

1784
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,280
Just keep making the show.

1785
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:35,280
He's got his fingers in every pizza pie.

1786
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,280
Get it? It's a joke.

1787
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,280
He's got his fingers in every pizza pie.

1788
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:40,280
Huh? Yeah? Pretty good.

1789
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:44,280
I've got my fingers in every one of your eye holes.

1790
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:46,280
Ow. God.

1791
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:48,280
No, don't crush my skull.

1792
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:50,280
And then I use your head as a bowling ball.

1793
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:51,280
How about that?

1794
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,280
No.

1795
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:58,280
I saw Cheezy saying that he had killed the Pizza Party podcast.

1796
02:07:58,280 --> 02:08:03,280
I thought it was just an off-handed like Cheezy just likes to say that.

1797
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:08,280
I thought it was just a joke, but I mean, it would make sense if it were true.

1798
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:12,280
They realized we had that they've been compromised by Cheezy.

1799
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:17,280
That the PCP had an in and then they shut the whole thing down to get us off.

1800
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:20,280
I want, it's time to dance in their grave.

1801
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:21,280
It's time to dance in their grave.

1802
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:25,280
We got you got to go to the last episode and comment and say the PCP one.

1803
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:27,280
PCP beat the Pizza Party podcast.

1804
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:28,280
We subverted it from the inside.

1805
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:31,280
We took it down and we didn't survive.

1806
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,280
Not a single drop of blood was shed.

1807
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:36,280
We did it all through intrigue and subterfuge.

1808
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:37,280
The gentlemen's right.

1809
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:44,280
Gentlemenly war warfare, psychological warfare with our clown secret agent.

1810
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:46,280
Our psychological guerrilla warfare.

1811
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:48,280
Sewing discord.

1812
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:51,280
Speaking of clowns, I'm behind on.

1813
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:52,280
I'm behind on.

1814
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:53,280
Cycloneos.

1815
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:54,280
Cyclone.

1816
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:55,280
I'm way behind.

1817
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,280
I'm like three weeks behind.

1818
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:57,280
Three weeks of shit.

1819
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:59,280
You got to get on that.

1820
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,280
I know.

1821
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:01,280
The clown designs.

1822
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,280
The clown designs.

1823
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:04,280
There's more of them and they look cool.

1824
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:05,280
Really?

1825
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,280
I got spoiled a little, but not too much.

1826
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:12,280
I know that someone dies, but that's not much of a spoiler because it could be anyone.

1827
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,280
So.

1828
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:14,280
Yeah.

1829
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:17,280
So it's fine, but I should catch up before I get genuinely spoiled.

1830
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:18,280
Okay.

1831
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:21,280
Next voicemail is called doid gazers finale.

1832
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:23,280
I'll go going out of the high note.

1833
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:24,280
All right.

1834
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:28,280
Three, two, one, go.

1835
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:31,280
Hello and welcome to another episode of doid gazers.

1836
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:37,280
This is your host, the and today we're going to be, of course, smoking some more weed.

1837
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,280
As we do.

1838
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:43,280
And then we're going to be talking about the fire disc track that we released against

1839
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:49,280
give and take who is the catalyst to everything genuinely fire in the world.

1840
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:54,280
And then we're going to be talking about how my RV totally exists.

1841
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:56,280
It's not a ban.

1842
02:09:56,280 --> 02:10:02,280
I found that out because Riley told me so and, you know, he knows everything.

1843
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:06,280
And then I just wanted everyone to know that the baby's all right.

1844
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:07,280
You know, baby's cool.

1845
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:09,280
I was worried about the baby.

1846
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:16,280
Baby don't want to say nothing, but you know, he's cool.

1847
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:27,280
He's like halfway across the tub and he he's like so scared to get in.

1848
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:29,280
Oh my God.

1849
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,280
Sorry.

1850
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:32,280
This is the last door.

1851
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:34,280
Oh my God.

1852
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,280
Sorry.

1853
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:36,280
This is the last door.

1854
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:44,280
But Ben, Tom, given like just continue what you're doing, please.

1855
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:47,280
Or just switch to a different like podcast.

1856
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:52,280
If you have to work brand do it because like you're the you're the best.

1857
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:55,280
And I love y'all like you guys.

1858
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,280
Thank you.

1859
02:10:56,280 --> 02:10:57,280
No.

1860
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:58,280
That's nice.

1861
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:00,280
Oh shit.

1862
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:02,280
I didn't expect that because there was a baby involved.

1863
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:06,280
There was a baby, which means I like I feel sympathy.

1864
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:07,280
I'm ambivalent.

1865
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:09,280
I'm ambivalent about the baby.

1866
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:15,280
But I mean, you know, someone mentioned the idea of a rebrand.

1867
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:18,280
And I don't think it's too stupid an idea.

1868
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:20,280
I think it's so different now.

1869
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:23,280
We may as well, but I just don't know how to do it exactly.

1870
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:24,280
Like what?

1871
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:25,280
Yeah, I agree.

1872
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:31,280
Like, I mean, we did the rebrand with like the graveyard stuff as a bit of a like mini rebrand.

1873
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,280
It's true.

1874
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:34,280
The show is so much different than what it used to be.

1875
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:35,280
I don't know.

1876
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:37,280
It's not a crazy idea.

1877
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:42,280
But I have at the same time, I have no clue what we would change it to or what.

1878
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:47,280
We could change like the name of this podcast to not be called a podcast.

1879
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:50,280
It'd be called The Procrestinated Show.

1880
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:52,280
So it was the PCS.

1881
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:54,280
But what?

1882
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:56,280
I like procrastinators.

1883
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:57,280
I don't want to get rid of that.

1884
02:11:57,280 --> 02:12:06,280
But I guess, you know, what would be like an appropriate name, do you think?

1885
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:08,280
I mean, wait, why would we start calling it a podcast?

1886
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:10,280
It's still a podcast.

1887
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:13,280
Because the acronym PCP is like the thing people think of.

1888
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,280
So if we change that, everything will change.

1889
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:18,280
Even if it's still called a procrastinator something.

1890
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:26,280
I mean, honestly, I would think that if we change the name but kept the abbreviation PCP,

1891
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:29,280
that's probably what I would do because PCP is...

1892
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:34,280
Well, no, because the point of a rebrand is to like, you know,

1893
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:38,280
not associate with what people think of the previous thing, right?

1894
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:40,280
Necessarily.

1895
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:42,280
People have like negative opinions of...

1896
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:49,280
Because I've heard some people think of that PCP show as, oh,

1897
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:56,280
the show that hosted that person who was a pedophile.

1898
02:12:56,280 --> 02:13:01,280
And that's the only way they know the PCP through like Dick Masterson area of things.

1899
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,280
I'm like, ah, that sucks.

1900
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:07,280
I don't like the fact that some people know that acronym as that.

1901
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:13,280
So rebranding would be to get rid of that association at least.

1902
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:16,280
I mean, I'm not that worried about it.

1903
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:19,280
I guess neither am I, but like, it's something.

1904
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:27,280
Like, if there's a reason to rebrand, I would think that would be changing to something different.

1905
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:28,280
I'm not...

1906
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:30,280
I don't know.

1907
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:36,280
I'm not worried about like, Trixie Stigma exactly.

1908
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:40,280
Like, that doesn't make me worry at all.

1909
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:46,280
But the idea that like the show is different and therefore call it something different,

1910
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:52,280
if only to just distinguish one era from another is like, makes sense to me.

1911
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:53,280
I don't know.

1912
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:55,280
I would have to think more about it.

1913
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:59,280
I would need a strong idea of like, this is what the new show should be called.

1914
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:04,280
You know, I would need something that's like, ah, that's a good idea that would be cool,

1915
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:07,280
but I don't have any ideas like that because I'm stupid.

1916
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:11,280
Maybe we could just have like a formal rebranding.

1917
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:16,280
Like, it's the new arc that keep the PCP like procrastination or whatever,

1918
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:19,280
but it's now like just golden age or something.

1919
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:21,280
Golden age.

1920
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:23,280
We just call it PCP2.

1921
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,280
An ironically could work.

1922
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:30,280
Just from now on, it's called the PCP2.

1923
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:32,280
It's just a little sillier.

1924
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:34,280
Whatever that means.

1925
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:36,280
It means whatever you think it means.

1926
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:41,280
You do the homestuck thing, the homestuck symbol thing.

1927
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:43,280
We should rebrand.

1928
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:45,280
We should stop coming on the show.

1929
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:50,280
We should just hire like, we should just hire like ghost podcasters.

1930
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:54,280
We should hire two people to like be on the show instead of us.

1931
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:57,280
I don't know.

1932
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,280
Wouldn't that be wacky?

1933
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,280
Okay, whatever.

1934
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:03,280
Okay.

1935
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:08,280
Next voicemail is called Pover D.

1936
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:10,280
Three, two, one, go.

1937
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:12,280
Hello, I'm a party cast patron.

1938
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:15,280
I pay like a dollar a month for that show.

1939
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:17,280
I'd like more.

1940
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:23,280
Also would be cool if then you caught up on one piece.

1941
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:26,280
Then maybe you could have some of those dollars.

1942
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:28,280
Some of those cents per month.

1943
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:30,280
Maybe like 10 of them.

1944
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:32,280
I don't know what the split is like.

1945
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:33,280
I have no idea.

1946
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:34,280
That's all.

1947
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:36,280
Just, you know, keep up the good work, boys.

1948
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:38,280
At this point, it's such a meme that I need to kick.

1949
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:44,280
No, I'm just saying we, I should get talking to Nate too.

1950
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:46,280
Because we haven't done a party cast in a while.

1951
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:48,280
Keep, we keep leaving it.

1952
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:53,280
Well, I keep leaving catching up on one piece.

1953
02:15:53,280 --> 02:16:01,280
I need, I'm, I'm, I had almost caught up at Radcon four.

1954
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:03,280
And then I like haven't read since then.

1955
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:06,280
So I'm like, I'm a year behind again now.

1956
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:10,280
Yeah, I have a lot to catch up on.

1957
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:11,280
I don't know.

1958
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:15,280
God, I'm always just like, yeah, I should catch up on it.

1959
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,280
But like, I can always do it later.

1960
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,280
Like it's not, it's not going anywhere.

1961
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:22,280
I don't feel any urgent need to catch up on.

1962
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:26,280
Unless I wanted to be on the, on the POTY cast.

1963
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:32,280
Ultimately, like when one piece ends, you'll be like, oh, well now I should.

1964
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:36,280
Cause, you know, if it, if it does like get to the point where you

1965
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:39,280
haven't read it since that point, that point.

1966
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:40,280
And then it ends.

1967
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:42,280
It's like, well now I got to read all of it.

1968
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:45,280
So it's really just in postponing the inevitable.

1969
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:47,280
Yes.

1970
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:50,280
That's, that's exactly how I feel about it.

1971
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,280
But I do think it's cool.

1972
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:56,280
So you just, just should read it.

1973
02:16:56,280 --> 02:16:59,280
Maybe after I, cause then, cause then you can like reread it.

1974
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:02,280
You can reread it later.

1975
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:06,280
I haven't even considered that possibility.

1976
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:10,280
As it comes out slowly and then you can blast through it as well.

1977
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:12,280
You can have both experiences.

1978
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:13,280
It'll take a lot of time.

1979
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:17,280
Maybe after I finish my secret project and I have some,

1980
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:22,280
and I feel like I have some more time that I'm willing to spend on frivolous

1981
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:25,280
activities, I will do that then.

1982
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:27,280
Perhaps, perhaps.

1983
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:33,280
Next voicemail is called Researching Flying Submarines voicemail movie.

1984
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:36,280
Three, two, one, go.

1985
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:49,280
We've saved the peg, so it's time to go.

1986
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:55,280
I was at the beach, watching a sunrise.

1987
02:17:55,280 --> 02:18:01,280
The orange ocean glow brought a tear to my eye.

1988
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:05,280
Until I saw a plane flying up so high.

1989
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:11,280
There's more planes in the sea than ships in the sky.

1990
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:18,280
We need a billion glad to make submarines fly.

1991
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:22,280
These are so weird.

1992
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:23,280
Yeah.

1993
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,280
These are so odd.

1994
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:27,280
I can't really grasp what the vibe is going for.

1995
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:32,280
Like I felt like this one was supposed to be poetic.

1996
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:35,280
I mean, I think they're all, they're all rhyme.

1997
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:40,280
They all rhyme, but like some of them feel like more obviously comedic.

1998
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:41,280
Yeah.

1999
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:47,280
Some of them feel like I don't know whether it's supposed to be comedic or a rap or a poem.

2000
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:52,280
I think they're all mostly supposed to be silly to one degree or another.

2001
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:55,280
This is like, this is like an opera.

2002
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:59,280
This should be, I feel like this should have, there should be like a band camp album that

2003
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:02,280
is just each of these in order.

2004
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:09,280
If you ever wanted to just listen to the whole saga from start to end.

2005
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,280
Yeah.

2006
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:15,280
It feels like a piece of a larger thing.

2007
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:23,280
There are like elements that recur like pigs, but in this one, like the pig was only like

2008
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:28,280
in the figure of speech about pigs flying, which I think that was a reference to the

2009
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,280
last one.

2010
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:31,280
I think a pig did fly.

2011
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:32,280
I think.

2012
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:33,280
Am I crazy?

2013
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:34,280
Yeah, it did.

2014
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:35,280
Okay.

2015
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:42,280
So it's like obliquely referencing it, but like, I guess nothing really happened in this

2016
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:43,280
one.

2017
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:52,280
He just watched a sunset and contemplated flight, which is, uh, these are, these are,

2018
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:55,280
these are, these are, these are like, these are like nothing I've ever heard before.

2019
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:58,280
I can say that much about them.

2020
02:19:58,280 --> 02:19:59,280
Okay.

2021
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:04,280
Next voicemail is called doid gazer's finale part two.

2022
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:05,280
Okay.

2023
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:07,280
Three, two, one, go.

2024
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:10,280
Also, these have all been people movies.

2025
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:13,280
Um, Ben and Nate, you're still not cool.

2026
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,280
Thank you.

2027
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:15,280
Give me money.

2028
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:16,280
Of course.

2029
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:19,280
Uh, next one is called part three, I guess.

2030
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,280
Three, two, one, go.

2031
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:25,280
Also, that this track was a music movie.

2032
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:27,280
Fuck you.

2033
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:28,280
Yeah.

2034
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:30,280
All right.

2035
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:31,280
Yeah.

2036
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:32,280
Got a hand.

2037
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:34,280
What about a regular movie?

2038
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:36,280
What, what, what about a regular movie?

2039
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:37,280
I don't know.

2040
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,280
What about a regular movie?

2041
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:40,280
No.

2042
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:45,280
I guess there are regular, I guess movie movies are movies about movies.

2043
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,280
So movies are just movies.

2044
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:49,280
Wow.

2045
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,280
Makes sense.

2046
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:52,280
It does.

2047
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:56,280
Unless it's an animated movie and then it's a cartoon movie.

2048
02:20:56,280 --> 02:21:03,280
Wait, wouldn't, wouldn't a cartoon movie then be a, a movie about, about cartoons?

2049
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:04,280
But no, a cartoon.

2050
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:07,280
No, be a cartoon about movies.

2051
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:10,280
Oh God.

2052
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:13,280
Jesus.

2053
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:17,280
Uh, next voicemail is called the real best guy ever.

2054
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:19,280
Three, two, one, go.

2055
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:22,280
Yo, it's the real best guy ever here.

2056
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:24,280
Hey, good to hear from you.

2057
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:30,280
You know, Riley best to me cause I'm five eight, but you stand no chance pal.

2058
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:31,280
Bring it on.

2059
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:34,280
I give you a little kiss.

2060
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:36,280
I'm, I'm too scared.

2061
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:40,280
Yeah, trust me, they're stupid.

2062
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:41,280
I'm too scared.

2063
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:42,280
I'm too scared.

2064
02:21:42,280 --> 02:21:45,280
I think you would crush my head and I don't want that.

2065
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:51,280
So I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to cowardly refuse with my tail between my

2066
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:52,280
legs.

2067
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:53,280
I'm sorry.

2068
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,280
Next voicemail is called for jelly beaner.

2069
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,280
Three, two, one, go.

2070
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:59,280
Oh my God, baby.

2071
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:02,280
You want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes?

2072
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:03,280
Some latkes?

2073
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:04,280
No, just.

2074
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:05,280
Cool.

2075
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:09,280
It would be the anti-semitic remorse.

2076
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:10,280
Delicious.

2077
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:12,280
I couldn't even hear that.

2078
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:14,280
Next voicemail is very quiet, but whatever.

2079
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:15,280
It was quiet.

2080
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:22,280
It was, he was frying, he was frying up latkes for jelly beaner, but it was offended by the

2081
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:23,280
anti-Semitism.

2082
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:29,280
I think that's, he won't do it because it, whatever.

2083
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:30,280
Yeah.

2084
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:32,280
Next voicemail is called Ben Pilled.

2085
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:34,280
Three, two, one, go.

2086
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:40,280
What is it with you people in the comments going on about bad Ben politics?

2087
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:42,280
What are the bad Ben politics?

2088
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:43,280
I know.

2089
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:45,280
Socialist ideas don't like that.

2090
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:48,280
You're real, not a fan of that.

2091
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,280
Imagine.

2092
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:52,280
Is it respecting people's identities?

2093
02:22:52,280 --> 02:23:00,280
Don't like that Ben takes the side of trans rights and doesn't, dead name, Trixie?

2094
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:01,280
Honestly, it's us.

2095
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:03,280
What was the bad Ben politics?

2096
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,280
I'm out of a loop.

2097
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:09,280
Honestly, it's us that there are a number of people like, I disagree with Ben on politics,

2098
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:10,280
but he's right.

2099
02:23:10,280 --> 02:23:13,280
Like, what do you disagree on exactly?

2100
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:14,280
There was a, it was similar.

2101
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:16,280
It's a common sentiment.

2102
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:21,280
It was like, oh, that Ben, he's being based right now by hating Trixie.

2103
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:24,280
A shame about his dumb lefty positions though.

2104
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:26,280
I wish he was stopped being a dumb lefty.

2105
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:27,280
It's like, what?

2106
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:28,280
Okay.

2107
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:30,280
I guess I can see where you're coming from.

2108
02:23:30,280 --> 02:23:31,280
Okay.

2109
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,280
Okay.

2110
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:33,280
I guess.

2111
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:34,280
Yeah.

2112
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:37,280
Wait, wait, I want to read.

2113
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,280
There was, there was a comment.

2114
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:45,280
This is from the Kiwi Farms thread that I saw and I just wait.

2115
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:47,280
I want to find it.

2116
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:52,280
I just, I just, this one, this one really, it really struck me that this guy completely

2117
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:55,280
gets me.

2118
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:57,280
Eleazar.

2119
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,280
Cut out this awkward sound.

2120
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:00,280
Oh no, here it is.

2121
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:02,280
Here it is.

2122
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:07,280
Ben, Ben Saint is a literal Jew commie bottom feeder.

2123
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:11,280
Yet he appears like a fucking chad to these people because at least he has a spine and

2124
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:14,280
isn't afraid to tell someone to fuck off.

2125
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:17,280
Literal Jew commie bottom feeder.

2126
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:18,280
Ben Saint.

2127
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:21,280
Absolutely true and, and valid and accurate.

2128
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,280
And I thank you.

2129
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:24,280
I feel seen.

2130
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:26,280
LeMau.

2131
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:28,280
Yeah.

2132
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:33,280
Anyway, a fucking vote, vote Bernie fucking losers in the comments.

2133
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,280
LeMau.

2134
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:37,280
Bernie 2020, 2024.

2135
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,280
2020, 2024.

2136
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:39,280
That's very fun.

2137
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:40,280
2020, 2020.

2138
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:47,280
We want to run on a, we got to run on the fucking the Cor, the Corbin, the Corbin Sanders ticket

2139
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:52,280
for president of the, of the United Nations.

2140
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:56,280
Next voicemail is called ideas man.

2141
02:24:56,280 --> 02:25:00,280
Three, two, one, go.

2142
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:03,280
All right, guys.

2143
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:04,280
Hear me out on this one.

2144
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:09,280
What if you made one more episode with a topic now hold on.

2145
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:10,280
I know what you're thinking.

2146
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:11,280
Unthinkable.

2147
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:14,280
But this one's a good one.

2148
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,280
Voicemailer rules.

2149
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:17,280
Get it done.

2150
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:18,280
Come on.

2151
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,280
Just one topic episode.

2152
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:20,280
Come on.

2153
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:21,280
You can do it.

2154
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:22,280
I believe in you.

2155
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:25,280
I feel like we have been over the voicemail rules.

2156
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:30,280
We have talked, we have talked many times about what makes a good voicemail.

2157
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:34,280
It's, it's only, it's only when it comes up that a voicemail sucks so bad and we say,

2158
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:35,280
ah, this sucks.

2159
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:38,280
And sometimes we give a reason why, but a lot of the time we just say stupid, lol.

2160
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:39,280
And move on.

2161
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:40,280
So I don't know.

2162
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:42,280
Maybe there's a topic in there.

2163
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:44,280
I don't know if there's a full episode.

2164
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:46,280
I don't, I don't know if there's a whole episode.

2165
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:47,280
Maybe part of an episode.

2166
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:53,280
I mean, we've, it's, I don't want, I don't, I don't want to get into it now.

2167
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:56,280
I, I, I guess.

2168
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:57,280
Hmm.

2169
02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:03,280
I think a reason like a topic episode would be more difficult now is because there's only

2170
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:05,280
two of us, maybe three of us.

2171
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:06,280
Yes.

2172
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:11,280
Like in the day when there's a single topic and six of us or seven of us were on an episode.

2173
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:12,280
Sure.

2174
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:15,280
Everybody would have one thing to say in a half long episode.

2175
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:16,280
Yeah.

2176
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:17,280
Yeah.

2177
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:20,280
And it would fill out the episode if people just had their one thing to say about that

2178
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:21,280
one topic.

2179
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:25,280
One topic between you and me wouldn't last nearly as long.

2180
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:26,280
No.

2181
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:27,280
No, I don't think so.

2182
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:28,280
No, I agree.

2183
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:31,280
That's totally true.

2184
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:34,280
Next voicemail is called inexplicable.

2185
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:36,280
Three, two, one.

2186
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:37,280
Go.

2187
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:42,280
So do you guys know about the pool multiple and the stop to flow model?

2188
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:46,280
So the pool multiple or P, U, E, L multiple.

2189
02:26:46,280 --> 02:26:55,280
It is a formula and the output of that formula, whenever it gets to a range of above like

2190
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:59,280
four, Bitcoin tends to reach its peak.

2191
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:06,280
Whenever the pool multiple reaches something like 0.5, that's when Bitcoin reaches its

2192
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:07,280
lows.

2193
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:11,280
So this pool multiple, it seems that it hasn't reached eight yet.

2194
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:16,280
So that means that Bitcoin still has a lot more to go before it reaches its peak.

2195
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:19,280
And the pool multiple has been pretty accurate so far.

2196
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:23,280
There's also another thing called the stock to flow model.

2197
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:27,280
It's just a price prediction for the, for Bitcoin until the end of time.

2198
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:30,280
And it's been pretty accurate.

2199
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:33,280
And Bitcoin also has a four year cycle, right?

2200
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,280
Every four years it reaches a new peak.

2201
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:43,280
And so if you add four years to the last peak, the next peak should be around like, I don't

2202
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:45,280
know, February of 2022.

2203
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:49,280
And I think the price is going to reach something like 100,000.

2204
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:51,280
So that's my prediction.

2205
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:55,280
$100,000 Bitcoin, February 2022.

2206
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:56,280
Yeah.

2207
02:27:56,280 --> 02:27:57,280
Peace.

2208
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:02,280
I have not heard of those things, but it's interesting.

2209
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:09,280
I mean, I, huh, I have heard that there was an idea that you could out like guess where

2210
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:15,280
it's going with an algorithm, but I have heard that maybe there's something to that.

2211
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:18,280
I have heard that there are models like this.

2212
02:28:18,280 --> 02:28:22,280
I haven't really looked, I probably should have looked into them before I got into it.

2213
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:27,280
I made me Bitcoin investments, but I didn't.

2214
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:29,280
Maybe I will.

2215
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:35,280
And then once I understand them better, I will maybe consider, if I were to read these

2216
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:38,280
and it was like, okay, the math is rock solid.

2217
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:44,280
Bitcoin is like very likely to continue to grow for the next year or so.

2218
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:50,280
Then I think I would be like, well, I might as well trust the math.

2219
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:56,280
I would, I would consider it a stock to flow model, well multiple.

2220
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:58,280
And then you also mentioned a four year cycle.

2221
02:28:58,280 --> 02:29:04,280
Do they do all three of these things like agree with each other in terms of their predictions?

2222
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:06,280
I mean, hopefully.

2223
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:08,280
Interesting.

2224
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:11,280
Good thinking.

2225
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:15,280
Next voicemail is called a thing not shit on enough.

2226
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:17,280
Three, two, one, go.

2227
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:23,280
A thing not talked about enough with all this is why the hell did B decide to become a touring artist

2228
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:25,280
during the pandemic?

2229
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:28,280
Who the hell thought that was a good idea?

2230
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:30,280
That is true.

2231
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:31,280
Yeah.

2232
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:37,280
I feel like she's been very lax on believing COVID is that big of a deal, but I don't know

2233
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:40,280
exactly whether she's had a statement about that.

2234
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:43,280
I just get a feeling she doesn't think that is that.

2235
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:44,280
Well, she was scary.

2236
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:45,280
Well, she was on.

2237
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:51,280
She was on the Bill Gates did COVID thing for a while.

2238
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,280
Yeah, that was strange.

2239
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:55,280
Very bad.

2240
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:56,280
Stupid.

2241
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:59,280
It's one of those like, I can't tell if you're joking, but you see.

2242
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:01,280
She wasn't, she wasn't joking.

2243
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:03,280
Yeah.

2244
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:08,280
And which, but I don't know how you could do that.

2245
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:12,280
And also think she, I haven't heard her say like.

2246
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:18,280
COVID is not a big deal, but she doesn't act as though she thinks it's a big deal.

2247
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:23,280
Case in point that she's going on supposedly going on tour, which again.

2248
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:25,280
I mean, she was doing road trips.

2249
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,280
There is no.

2250
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:30,280
Like with the Yig gang, she's been driving around.

2251
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:32,280
It's like, I don't know.

2252
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:35,280
I feel like before that, maybe she was a little more reserved.

2253
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:38,280
Maybe they've sort of convinced her that it's fun.

2254
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:40,280
You should really get out in the world.

2255
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,280
And it's like, cool.

2256
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:44,280
Maybe.

2257
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:46,280
Cool.

2258
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:48,280
Who knows?

2259
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:49,280
Who knows?

2260
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:51,280
I mean, I mean, get vexed first.

2261
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:53,280
Get fucking vexed.

2262
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:54,280
It's not going to.

2263
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:59,280
I'm expecting to be vexed probably within like maybe a month or so.

2264
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:00,280
I don't know.

2265
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:03,280
I don't actually know, but you know, other people I know are getting it.

2266
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:07,280
So it seems like it's, it's, it's basically, we're basically there.

2267
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:09,280
Yeah.

2268
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:10,280
Yeah.

2269
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:13,280
No, I agree, voicemailer.

2270
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:17,280
Next voicemailer is called Sorry If This Is Too Serious.

2271
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:19,280
Three, two, one, go.

2272
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:22,280
Yig Studio is comprised of violent and shady people.

2273
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:23,280
Yes.

2274
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:26,280
Riley is a compulsive, manipulative, sociopathic opportunist who abuses drugs.

2275
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,280
Probably.

2276
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:30,280
She is an emotionally vulnerable person that's slowly retracted from a friend group

2277
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:33,280
after attachment issues with a romantic partner and after breaking up.

2278
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:34,280
Yes.

2279
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:38,280
Some distance from their former support group of friends in the middle of an identity crisis.

2280
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:42,280
Riley has convinced Trixie to overtake her once popular channel with his group.

2281
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:48,280
To leech what money Trixie had, convincing her to let the Yig crew attempt to invade every other content creator group Trixie was a part on.

2282
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:52,280
To attract attention for financing their awful and sustainable lifestyle.

2283
02:31:52,280 --> 02:31:57,280
When Trixie splits with Yig Studio, because her online identity has crumbled into irreparable ruin,

2284
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:00,280
financially useless, Trixie will have nobody.

2285
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:03,280
I'm afraid if nobody can help her.

2286
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:06,280
She's got, she's got well off parents.

2287
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:07,280
People are too worried.

2288
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:08,280
She'll, she's fine.

2289
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:09,280
Yeah, I don't know.

2290
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:10,280
She'll be fine.

2291
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:15,280
Even if her, even if her, even if her internet income became zero, she wouldn't die.

2292
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:18,280
Like, I, I, I see this a lot.

2293
02:32:18,280 --> 02:32:24,280
I don't know how much of like, if there's a, like a blame for this.

2294
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:29,280
Is it, oh Riley's a super manipulator or is it Trixie making the gross decisions ever?

2295
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:30,280
I think it's both.

2296
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:36,280
I, I don't think you can say that Riley is completely like, like being, I don't know.

2297
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:37,280
I don't know.

2298
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:42,280
Swept up by Riley to a point where she's completely vulnerable.

2299
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:43,280
Maybe she, I don't know.

2300
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:46,280
I think that Riley, I don't know enough, but I feel like it's the same.

2301
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:47,280
Yeah.

2302
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:53,280
I think that Riley is an opportunist who is encouraging this because it is to his benefit.

2303
02:32:53,280 --> 02:33:00,280
But I also feel like Trixie is probably to some extent also encouraging him.

2304
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:03,280
She's encouraging, she encouraged the whole thing of it.

2305
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:08,280
Maybe like, she allowed him and them into her life in the first place.

2306
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:11,280
Now, I mean, Trixie, she, I mean, she wants this.

2307
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,280
Like she wants this all to be happening.

2308
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:16,280
She is enthusiastically going along with it.

2309
02:33:16,280 --> 02:33:25,280
So, you know, I don't like, I feel bad like saying this stuff like I know anything about

2310
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:27,280
what's going on in their heads.

2311
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:32,280
So from an outside perspective, this, this voicemail is like, yeah, I can see that.

2312
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:37,280
It's just about as, as valid as anything I could imagine.

2313
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:41,280
It's, we cannot agree that it's not, doesn't look good.

2314
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:42,280
Doesn't look good.

2315
02:33:42,280 --> 02:33:43,280
Yeah.

2316
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:47,280
This is, this is similar, this voicemail is similar to my take on the situation.

2317
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:50,280
Similar read to my own.

2318
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:54,280
With a few, a few little nitpicks.

2319
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:57,280
And next voicemail is called Razzmatazz Bean.

2320
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:00,280
Bring back the PCP cock discussion arc.

2321
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:02,280
Three, two, one, go.

2322
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:09,280
Holy shit.

2323
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:11,280
Oh boy.

2324
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:16,280
I sure do wish the PCP would stop talking about foreskin for every episode.

2325
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:19,280
Said the listeners.

2326
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:23,280
And then a finger on the monkey's paw curl.

2327
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:27,280
This is, this was it.

2328
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:30,280
This was, this was when we entered the dark timeline.

2329
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:31,280
We stopped talking.

2330
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,280
I like that.

2331
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:33,280
That's an arc.

2332
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:36,280
That's an arc of the show where foreskin just kept coming up.

2333
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:37,280
It was.

2334
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:39,280
It kind of was an era.

2335
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:40,280
Yeah.

2336
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:47,280
It's, it's in the, it's in the, it's in the, the, the early late stage, whatever.

2337
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:52,280
There should be a timeline made of all the stupid PCP arcs.

2338
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:53,280
Oh yeah.

2339
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:54,280
Yeah.

2340
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:59,280
With like over overlapping like, like lions that denote like when a thing was happening.

2341
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:01,280
They all like kind of overlap with each other.

2342
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:02,280
You know what I mean?

2343
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:03,280
Yeah.

2344
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:04,280
There's like times when.

2345
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:05,280
Along the timeline.

2346
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:06,280
Yeah.

2347
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:11,280
Like, like, oh, Final Fantasy 7 came out and then like seven episodes were about that.

2348
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:13,280
Yeah, true.

2349
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:17,280
Pokemon was a thing for years.

2350
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:21,280
I guess it was, it wasn't like every episode though, but there was constant.

2351
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:22,280
It just kept coming up.

2352
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:23,280
Like every other episode.

2353
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:27,280
It just kept coming up and kept coming up.

2354
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:30,280
Next one is called Guerrilla Sausage.

2355
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:33,280
Three, two, one, go.

2356
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:37,280
Yix Studios is super fucking gay.

2357
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:39,280
And so is Ben St.

2358
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:41,280
But at least he's cool.

2359
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:46,280
Also, isn't eating Guerrilla meat basically just the stones throw away from cannibalism

2360
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:47,280
or am I just like.

2361
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:51,280
That's what I, that's why I feel like it's gross.

2362
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:55,280
When I learned that like, oh yeah, people hunt Guerrillas for bush meat.

2363
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:58,280
I was like, God, imagine eating a Guerrilla.

2364
02:35:58,280 --> 02:36:04,280
I would feel really fucked up about it.

2365
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:06,280
I mean, yikes.

2366
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:11,280
It's like you get a hand and it's a human hand looking thing, but it's a Guerrilla.

2367
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:16,280
I mean, if the only thing we should be hunting Guerrillas for is for monkeys paws for their

2368
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:21,280
fingers to curl when we make ill advised wishes about foreskin.

2369
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:26,280
Next voicemail is called Sad but surprisingly enticing boy.

2370
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:29,280
Three, two, one, go.

2371
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:32,280
Hey Ben, I was watching your old lectures again.

2372
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:37,280
You know how it is needed some background noise when Jack hammering my cock to incest head high.

2373
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:38,280
Absolutely.

2374
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:39,280
And I noticed something.

2375
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:44,280
I couldn't help but ask myself whoever allowed you to exist on this astral plane without a beard.

2376
02:36:44,280 --> 02:36:45,280
Don't get me wrong.

2377
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,280
Today, you're a pretty boy.

2378
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:51,280
Wouldn't say no to messing with that chocolate starfish, but back then you looked like one

2379
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:55,280
of those dudes that import dirt poor Thai women to date on reality TV shows and bragged to

2380
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:57,280
them about their 2009 Subaru.

2381
02:36:57,280 --> 02:37:01,280
Anyways, say I love her and stop talking about Drixie all the time.

2382
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:03,280
Don't burn all the bridges.

2383
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:06,280
Save up that spy for the eventual RV fallout.

2384
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:08,280
Puts me kisses.

2385
02:37:08,280 --> 02:37:09,280
That's a fair point.

2386
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:15,280
No, what I said about Josh and how he needs to have a beard is like true not to the same

2387
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:17,280
extent, but it's also true of me.

2388
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:21,280
I looked just much better with a beard, which I'm growing it out again now.

2389
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:22,280
It's coming along.

2390
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:24,280
It's coming along.

2391
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:26,280
Yeah.

2392
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:28,280
Next voicemail is called Hi Ben.

2393
02:37:28,280 --> 02:37:30,280
Three, two, one, go.

2394
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:36,280
Hey, so a couple quick questions about Nate.

2395
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:40,280
So his content can't shit.

2396
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:45,280
Is that why he left the podcast and is not coming on?

2397
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:47,280
He's focusing on that.

2398
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:51,280
But also aware of the league and their shenanigans.

2399
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:53,280
He is aware of the league.

2400
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,280
He knows of them.

2401
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:56,280
Yes.

2402
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:58,280
Oh, did he talk to him about it?

2403
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:01,280
He meant he was sort of jokingly mentioned it.

2404
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:03,280
Yeah.

2405
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:05,280
He's aware.

2406
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:09,280
But I, I can't, I can't comment any further.

2407
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:11,280
I don't know.

2408
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:14,280
We didn't like talk about it at length or anything.

2409
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:18,280
He's just, he's just frozen with fear about the idea.

2410
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:21,280
He's got a chastity like shorts, shorts.

2411
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:27,280
There's no, there's no reason why Nate could, why can't tent would keep Nate from being

2412
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,280
on the PCP.

2413
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:31,280
I've said, he just doesn't want to come on for whatever reason.

2414
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:33,280
He just doesn't feel like it.

2415
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:35,280
And that's, that's literally it.

2416
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:37,280
That's all there is to it.

2417
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:38,280
Yep.

2418
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:44,280
Next, next voicemail is called fuck Trixie three, two, one go.

2419
02:38:44,280 --> 02:38:47,280
Also, fuck Trixie.

2420
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:48,280
Trixie's a shit.

2421
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:49,280
Yeah, I agree.

2422
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:51,280
Has never made good content.

2423
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:59,280
Didn't involve other PCP members such as Nate and Tom because they're great.

2424
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:03,280
They think that Ben may have done something with Trixie at some point and that may have

2425
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:04,280
been good.

2426
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:05,280
I don't know.

2427
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:06,280
I have to disagree.

2428
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:12,280
A few of her videos in the past were genuinely interesting and informative.

2429
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:16,280
That one about main six's ages.

2430
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:20,280
That one and that one retrospective on the career of the your name guy.

2431
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:22,280
I really liked that one.

2432
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:25,280
So I wouldn't go quite, I wouldn't go quite that far.

2433
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:28,280
So there's a lot of good anime stuff that is now gone.

2434
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:32,280
Yeah, all based.

2435
02:39:32,280 --> 02:39:37,280
Next voicemail is called slowly three, two, one go.

2436
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:47,280
Hey, so about like Trixie and again and all that isn't like separating people from their

2437
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:54,280
other relationships and being like, oh, it's us or them isn't that kind of isolation sort

2438
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:56,280
of classic abuse tactic?

2439
02:39:56,280 --> 02:40:00,280
Should we be worried at all?

2440
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:01,280
It is.

2441
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:04,280
Yes, it is potentially worried.

2442
02:40:04,280 --> 02:40:09,280
I feel like I couldn't do anything from over here.

2443
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:17,280
Some people have speculated that what's going on over there is like really dark and I don't

2444
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:20,280
feel like there's any like strong evidence for that.

2445
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:22,280
No, I've looked for it.

2446
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:25,280
It can't really be ruled out as a possibility.

2447
02:40:25,280 --> 02:40:32,280
I haven't seen anything that's like isolating from like clips of like Riley shouting at

2448
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:34,280
Digi on live stream.

2449
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:36,280
So telling you shut the fuck up.

2450
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:41,280
I don't know if that's like indicative of anything other than Riley just being a loud

2451
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:42,280
mouth.

2452
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:43,280
It's hard to say.

2453
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:45,280
It's hard to say.

2454
02:40:45,280 --> 02:40:54,280
I would say it isolating from other social groups is an abuse tactic, but it's just it's

2455
02:40:54,280 --> 02:40:59,280
just hard to say like to what what is the intent here?

2456
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:03,280
Like who is who is doing this to who?

2457
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:09,280
I don't think it's that much of a stretch to think this Trixie just is self isolating

2458
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:17,280
from other groups because she likes this new one better for whatever reason.

2459
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:21,280
So yeah, who knows.

2460
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:24,280
Next voicemail is called what a tragedy.

2461
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:27,280
Three, two, one, go.

2462
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:31,280
The real tragedy of this whole scenario is that the alias Digi bro was just so phonetically

2463
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:35,280
satisfying to say and the only people who would really say it nowadays are those who

2464
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:38,280
are out of the loop or intentionally trying to misgender her.

2465
02:41:38,280 --> 02:41:40,280
And as neither of those people, what am I supposed to do?

2466
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:45,280
Just sit in the corner of my room with Digi bro to myself in repetition until I meet my

2467
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:50,280
daily quota, hoping that someone else takes the name for themselves.

2468
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:53,280
I'm well that other guy took the name.

2469
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:57,280
So you can call him that now.

2470
02:41:57,280 --> 02:42:00,280
You problem solved easy.

2471
02:42:00,280 --> 02:42:04,280
It's kind of a little shame that it's like it is a shame.

2472
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:05,280
It was a good name.

2473
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:06,280
It sounded good.

2474
02:42:06,280 --> 02:42:08,280
Yeah, I agree.

2475
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:15,280
Next voicemail is called Jebediah goes international three, two, one, go.

2476
02:42:15,280 --> 02:42:20,280
Hello, this is me, Jebediah Pritikson.

2477
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:25,280
I don't really know what to ask today.

2478
02:42:25,280 --> 02:42:33,280
Because did you hear about this news about fucking pooping?

2479
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:35,280
You know.

2480
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:40,280
We're having up to 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine.

2481
02:42:40,280 --> 02:42:43,280
I can't say that I did.

2482
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:44,280
Sir.

2483
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:45,280
Sir.

2484
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:50,280
Give me your education.

2485
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:53,280
Shut up.

2486
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:54,280
Bye.

2487
02:42:54,280 --> 02:42:55,280
Fuck you.

2488
02:42:55,280 --> 02:43:02,280
I like the sort of like aesthetic of Jebediah Pritikson just sort of slumber like slumbering

2489
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:05,280
and lumbering into like a voice call.

2490
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:06,280
He's like not prepared for it.

2491
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:11,280
She's like, oh, hey guys, like he walked into a room and just saw us.

2492
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:12,280
He knows what he's doing.

2493
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:15,280
He knows exactly what he's doing.

2494
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:22,280
Next voicemail is called Jebediah can't find the them three, two, one, go.

2495
02:43:22,280 --> 02:43:28,280
Oh, so I gotta say I don't know how to find the leak.

2496
02:43:28,280 --> 02:43:29,280
I guess.

2497
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:30,280
What?

2498
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:35,280
And I'm not as gay as them, so.

2499
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:36,280
No, please.

2500
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:38,280
How to find the leak?

2501
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:40,280
What?

2502
02:43:40,280 --> 02:43:43,280
Do you know what he's saying?

2503
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:47,280
Let me do it again.

2504
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:49,280
We got a hurry, by the way.

2505
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:52,280
We're at like, we've only got 10 minutes before we hit the three hour cap.

2506
02:43:52,280 --> 02:43:53,280
Oh, fuck.

2507
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:54,280
That was our asses not to go over.

2508
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:55,280
Oh, shit.

2509
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:56,280
Is this the last page?

2510
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:57,280
All right.

2511
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:58,280
Keep going.

2512
02:43:58,280 --> 02:43:59,280
Yeah, we're on the last page.

2513
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:00,280
Next one is called a shambling zombies.

2514
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:02,280
Last coherent words to this world.

2515
02:44:02,280 --> 02:44:04,280
Three, two, one, go.

2516
02:44:04,280 --> 02:44:11,280
I've heard that one before.

2517
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:12,280
Yeah.

2518
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:19,280
Oh, there we go.

2519
02:44:19,280 --> 02:44:28,280
There we go.

2520
02:44:28,280 --> 02:44:44,280
Okay, got it, got it.

2521
02:44:44,280 --> 02:44:46,280
Next one is called canned tent.

2522
02:44:46,280 --> 02:44:48,280
Three, two, one, go.

2523
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:52,280
Hey, everybody, and welcome to this week's episode of canned tent.

2524
02:44:52,280 --> 02:44:57,280
And that's going to do for this week's episode of canned tent.

2525
02:44:57,280 --> 02:44:58,280
Thanks for the voicemail.

2526
02:44:58,280 --> 02:44:59,280
Next one is called.

2527
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:01,280
You didn't even on can it.

2528
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:06,280
Next one is called give diss track emotional warning bad word piss.

2529
02:45:06,280 --> 02:45:09,280
Three, two, one, go.

2530
02:45:09,280 --> 02:45:14,280
So on the last episode, you said that give should have a diss track done against her

2531
02:45:14,280 --> 02:45:16,280
because it, it builds character.

2532
02:45:16,280 --> 02:45:17,280
That's right.

2533
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:23,280
I thought I should build my flex my creative muscles and try my hands.

2534
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:24,280
So here I go.

2535
02:45:24,280 --> 02:45:25,280
Okay.

2536
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:26,280
All right.

2537
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:30,280
One, two, one, two, three.

2538
02:45:30,280 --> 02:45:38,280
My name is me and I'm here to say I'm going to diss you give in a big way.

2539
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:42,280
You are a girl on the internet.

2540
02:45:42,280 --> 02:45:43,280
There's nothing on void.

2541
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:48,280
You talk about things on this podcast with your friends.

2542
02:45:48,280 --> 02:45:53,280
You make funny jokes and cool art.

2543
02:45:54,280 --> 02:45:58,280
I've got something to say to you.

2544
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:00,280
You suck.

2545
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:02,280
That's my diss.

2546
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:05,280
How does it feel?

2547
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:08,280
I'll bet it feels like this.

2548
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:10,280
Oh, there's the bad word.

2549
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:11,280
Okay.

2550
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:12,280
That's it.

2551
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:13,280
Thank you.

2552
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:14,280
Thanks for the voicemail.

2553
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:17,280
Next one is called Noi to good three, two, one, go.

2554
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:21,280
Hey, Ben, you know what Trixie's opinion on Noia is?

2555
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:22,280
No.

2556
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:27,280
Next one is called a good idea three, two, one, go.

2557
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:28,280
All right.

2558
02:46:28,280 --> 02:46:30,280
This one's for free.

2559
02:46:30,280 --> 02:46:33,280
PCP DND.

2560
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:35,280
Yeah.

2561
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:36,280
We floated this idea.

2562
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:38,280
I wanted to do one at Radcon.

2563
02:46:38,280 --> 02:46:40,280
We just didn't have time and it didn't happen.

2564
02:46:40,280 --> 02:46:45,280
What if we just did DND instead of a regular podcast for a few weeks?

2565
02:46:45,280 --> 02:46:46,280
Okay.

2566
02:46:46,280 --> 02:46:48,280
Or like alternating.

2567
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:50,280
We could try that.

2568
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:51,280
Okay.

2569
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:52,280
Okay.

2570
02:46:52,280 --> 02:46:53,280
Yeah.

2571
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:54,280
Let's do that.

2572
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:57,280
Let's just fucking do that.

2573
02:46:57,280 --> 02:46:58,280
Why not?

2574
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:00,280
I'm down.

2575
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:02,280
I'm fucking into it.

2576
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:03,280
Yeah.

2577
02:47:03,280 --> 02:47:08,280
I always wanted to do like a DND with the PCP and it just has never materialized.

2578
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:10,280
It takes so much, it takes work though is the thing.

2579
02:47:10,280 --> 02:47:11,280
And I hate work.

2580
02:47:11,280 --> 02:47:12,280
Yeah.

2581
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:16,280
And I guess if we're just two of us, it would be like, well, I do this and then you do that.

2582
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:17,280
Yeah.

2583
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:19,280
You can't do it with just two people.

2584
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:21,280
We would need Tom in there.

2585
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:27,280
We would need regular attendance because you can't.

2586
02:47:27,280 --> 02:47:32,280
I mean, you can sometimes miss a sesh, but you shouldn't be missing seshes.

2587
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:34,280
Next one is Margar.

2588
02:47:34,280 --> 02:47:35,280
Oh, there we go.

2589
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:38,280
Three, two, one, go.

2590
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:40,280
Margar here.

2591
02:47:40,280 --> 02:47:47,280
As it turns out, I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons, both as a dungeon master and a player.

2592
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:54,280
And I have a number of opinions about some of the stuff you guys have talked about in terms of DND.

2593
02:47:54,280 --> 02:48:03,280
Namely, Ben and your opinion on players asking to make roles.

2594
02:48:03,280 --> 02:48:15,280
I think that a core aspect of Dungeons and Dragons is using the mechanics and abilities that your characters have to solve problems.

2595
02:48:15,280 --> 02:48:23,280
And I don't think that it's inherently a bad thing to ask DM to, you know, use your abilities in that way.

2596
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:31,280
But it might just be a case of you having a different expectation of the game than it is sort of capable of providing.

2597
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:41,280
And there are a number of games that you might prefer that aren't as sort of mechanically focused that I could maybe recommend to you.

2598
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:44,280
Because there's a lot of games out there and they're all pretty different.

2599
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:48,280
I generally do like role-playing games that are less mechanical than DND.

2600
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:56,280
So I do think if you like the mechanical part of it, then maybe there is just a difference in expectation.

2601
02:48:56,280 --> 02:49:04,280
I really do think, though, that like, I really do think it's, I mean, you can have your own opinion,

2602
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:09,280
but it's not the way that I want to play is not to be being like, hmm,

2603
02:49:09,280 --> 02:49:15,280
my character has seven ranks in a climb.

2604
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:26,280
Hmm, can I make a climb check to ascend to heights of dazzling intellect? Hmm, DM, please?

2605
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:29,280
You know, that's stupid.

2606
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:33,280
A terrible example, but hopefully you understand what I'm saying.

2607
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:39,280
Next voicemail is called Based Ben Believer, 3, 2, 1, go.

2608
02:49:39,280 --> 02:49:44,280
You know, I never thought it would happen, but a lot of people have been saying it lately and it's really true.

2609
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:48,280
Ben truly is the most based member of the PCP now.

2610
02:49:48,280 --> 02:49:49,280
Thank you. I know.

2611
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:54,280
All it took was Nate the Voo, Mage, Munchy, and Nate leaving the podcast, Tom not being on half the episodes,

2612
02:49:54,280 --> 02:49:59,280
and Gib being milk toast and never having a stance on anything.

2613
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:04,280
And so that leaves Ben as the only person with actual informed opinions on things.

2614
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:08,280
And just by default, he is the most based person on the podcast and it's just incredible, you know?

2615
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:14,280
I really think the transition from Old Ben to Communist Ben was really rough and there were some real lows there.

2616
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:20,280
He was maybe only slightly better than Munchy, you know, in the PCP member rating.

2617
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:25,280
But overall, I mean, on the other side of it, Ben is more based than ever,

2618
02:50:25,280 --> 02:50:28,280
and I couldn't be happier for it, keeping based.

2619
02:50:28,280 --> 02:50:31,280
I have stances on things.

2620
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:36,280
Thanks? I don't, I don't, I don't feel complimented.

2621
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:41,280
No, fuck you. Fuck this guy. No.

2622
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:44,280
No, fuck you.

2623
02:50:44,280 --> 02:50:48,280
Next voicemail is called Based Joker 3 3 2 1 Go.

2624
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:55,280
When I tell my friends that I listen to the PCP, they say, hey, that's pretty based.

2625
02:50:55,280 --> 02:51:02,280
But when I tell my friends that I listen to the PCP, well, suddenly I'm cringe.

2626
02:51:02,280 --> 02:51:08,280
But see, that's the thing you people don't understand. I'm, I'm not cringe.

2627
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:11,280
I'm just ahead of the turd.

2628
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:15,280
Wait, that's it. That's the rebrand, the PussyPoo.

2629
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:16,280
No.

2630
02:51:16,280 --> 02:51:19,280
Yes, that's it.

2631
02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:23,280
The PussyP, the PCP.

2632
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:27,280
He said PCPoo, but I say why not change both?

2633
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:28,280
The P-

2634
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:29,280
The P-

2635
02:51:29,280 --> 02:51:30,280
Twice?

2636
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:33,280
The P-E-E-C-P-O-O.

2637
02:51:33,280 --> 02:51:34,280
Perhaps.

2638
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:41,280
Also, I should, I will say, I keep forgetting that this guy exists, and then he makes a voicemail as really, really good.

2639
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:42,280
Voice Grail, I think.

2640
02:51:42,280 --> 02:51:44,280
Voice Grail for Based Joker?

2641
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:46,280
Yeah, Based Joker.

2642
02:51:46,280 --> 02:51:49,280
You know what? He's had too many hits. I'll give him.

2643
02:51:49,280 --> 02:51:53,280
A Based Joker ascends to the Voice Grail. Congratulations.

2644
02:51:53,280 --> 02:51:57,280
First in a while, first in a while, but I think he's earned it.

2645
02:51:57,280 --> 02:51:58,280
Yeah.

2646
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:08,280
Next voicemail is from Cross, and there's a YouTube link, and the link is to a video of like a, of like a, a no, like a, like a synth music setup.

2647
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:10,280
Playing some synth sounds.

2648
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:12,280
Three, two, one, go.

2649
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:15,280
My friend Jake Ellis made this sick-ass space shanty.

2650
02:52:15,280 --> 02:52:18,280
It's like a sea shanty, but it's a space shanty.

2651
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:21,280
Listen to it, please. He deserves it.

2652
02:52:21,280 --> 02:52:22,280
Here's a clip of it.

2653
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:38,280
Pretty based. Pretty based.

2654
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,280
Pretty good.

2655
02:52:39,280 --> 02:52:44,280
I guess I'll put, um, I guess I'll put the link in the description.

2656
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:45,280
Yeah, in the show notes.

2657
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:46,280
In the show notes.

2658
02:52:46,280 --> 02:52:49,280
Jake Ellis space shanty number one.

2659
02:52:49,280 --> 02:52:51,280
Sounds pretty based.

2660
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:53,280
Next voicemail is called Put, Put, Prince.

2661
02:52:53,280 --> 02:52:56,280
Three, two, one, go.

2662
02:52:57,280 --> 02:53:07,280
Uh, third week now, I've had some ideas, but I don't think they're funny enough, even though I know these things aren't the highest.

2663
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:12,280
But instead of like leaving a three second voicemail, I'll put my phone in and I'll leave it in song.

2664
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:14,280
So, uh, kick it, Bonnie.

2665
02:53:14,280 --> 02:53:16,280
One, and a two, and a three.

2666
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:18,280
This is...

2667
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:29,280
I mean, as a big Simpsons fan, I have to appreciate it.

2668
02:53:29,280 --> 02:53:32,280
I appreciate the reference. It's classic.

2669
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:48,280
Cool, man.

2670
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:52,280
Nice voicemail. You're ascending the ranks.

2671
02:53:52,280 --> 02:53:58,280
Uh, uh, adding music is the first step towards becoming a classic voicemailer.

2672
02:53:58,280 --> 02:54:00,280
Historically speaking, it's true.

2673
02:54:00,280 --> 02:54:05,280
Next voicemail is called Really Quick Question, three, two, one, go.

2674
02:54:07,280 --> 02:54:10,280
Hey, PCP, it's me, Max Clutch.

2675
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:12,280
I just wanted to get a quick...

2676
02:54:12,280 --> 02:54:14,280
This guy makes me nervous.

2677
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:16,280
Is that Trixie?

2678
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:28,280
See you next time, boys.

2679
02:54:28,280 --> 02:54:29,280
Okay.

2680
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:30,280
What was the question?

2681
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:32,280
I don't know.

2682
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:33,280
Is that Trixie?

2683
02:54:33,280 --> 02:54:35,280
So Trixie, and he just gunned it.

2684
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:37,280
The question is, is that Trixie?

2685
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:41,280
The real question is, was he driving towards or away?

2686
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:49,280
That's what I assumed a hit and run, but we just don't have enough information.

2687
02:54:49,280 --> 02:54:54,280
Next voicemail is called Fuck PCP Callers, three, two, one, go.

2688
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:59,280
Alright, so I've started to catch back up with the PCP episodes as I rage at online Smash Bros.

2689
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:03,280
And I just finished what I hope is the last of the Tommy J arc.

2690
02:55:03,280 --> 02:55:06,280
And this got me thinking about a rant that I've had brewing in my head for a while.

2691
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:09,280
I fucking hate the PCP voicemail callers.

2692
02:55:09,280 --> 02:55:12,280
Why do they think that anyone gives a fuck who they are?

2693
02:55:12,280 --> 02:55:14,280
The sheer you on these people is insane.

2694
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:17,280
I think it all started back with Riddle My Ass Batman.

2695
02:55:17,280 --> 02:55:19,280
Because when he became a recurring caller, everyone thought,

2696
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:21,280
Ooh, her there, I'm gonna do that.

2697
02:55:21,280 --> 02:55:24,280
Except that they couldn't do that because they aren't creative or funny

2698
02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:26,280
and they don't have any sort of production value.

2699
02:55:26,280 --> 02:55:29,280
And then Samurai was the second wave of this.

2700
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:32,280
And now all these obnoxious Kretans tried to rip him off.

2701
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:35,280
You know why the Samurai works and you're a larping dozen, you fucks?

2702
02:55:35,280 --> 02:55:37,280
It's because the Samurai didn't make it about him.

2703
02:55:37,280 --> 02:55:40,280
It was always about Ben stealing the Skrull.

2704
02:55:40,280 --> 02:55:42,280
It's like if I felt the need to leave a voicemail every week going,

2705
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:45,280
Hey guys, remember me? I'm fuck Dibuster.

2706
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:49,280
I said that Dibuster is bad. Isn't that so cool how I said that Dibuster is bad?

2707
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:52,280
By the way, I also write novels and draw.

2708
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:56,280
That's so unique. You guys should follow me because I'm a one of a kind person.

2709
02:55:56,280 --> 02:55:58,280
And also please have me on the podcast.

2710
02:55:58,280 --> 02:56:00,280
No, no one gives a shit.

2711
02:56:00,280 --> 02:56:02,280
Anyway, I'm not actually that upset.

2712
02:56:02,280 --> 02:56:05,280
But hearing Ben rage at Tommy J was pretty funny.

2713
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:08,280
Okay, then yeah, that should be the end of the Tommy J arc.

2714
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:13,280
I think there is a lot of truth in what this guy is saying.

2715
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:15,280
Yeah.

2716
02:56:15,280 --> 02:56:20,280
Yeah, like the whole league of Nate fuckers is kind of funny.

2717
02:56:20,280 --> 02:56:28,280
Nate isn't here to feel the brunt of the tidal wave of all of these funny things.

2718
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:31,280
Yeah, but that's not that's not their fault.

2719
02:56:31,280 --> 02:56:36,280
No, but like some of the characters are just just explicitly made for that purpose.

2720
02:56:36,280 --> 02:56:39,280
And there's multiple of them.

2721
02:56:39,280 --> 02:56:45,280
Yeah, but each one is its own gimmick and it's it's just there for one call and then it's dropped.

2722
02:56:45,280 --> 02:56:48,280
Yeah, so I don't hate them or anything.

2723
02:56:48,280 --> 02:56:52,280
But like I feel like that that joke has sort of run its course.

2724
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:57,280
I bet. Yeah, I mean, what more can you really do with it? I guess.

2725
02:56:57,280 --> 02:56:59,280
I guess we'll see.

2726
02:56:59,280 --> 02:57:02,280
The next voicemail. I think the last voicemail.

2727
02:57:02,280 --> 02:57:06,280
Thank Christ is called Mr. Suck and Fuck 3, 2, 1.

2728
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:08,280
Speak and go.

2729
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:17,280
Trixie, my golden princess.

2730
02:57:17,280 --> 02:57:26,280
I have such wonderful plans with her.

2731
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:33,280
She still has her decadent vimosis.

2732
02:57:33,280 --> 02:57:40,280
No stop, please.

2733
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:45,280
That excess for skin.

2734
02:57:45,280 --> 02:57:49,280
That hollow poop of blood.

2735
02:57:49,280 --> 02:57:52,280
This is like being in a fucking haunted house.

2736
02:57:52,280 --> 02:58:00,280
You feel it with strawberry ice cream.

2737
02:58:00,280 --> 02:58:06,280
Top it with sprinkles and chocolate syrup.

2738
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:08,280
I'm getting hungry.

2739
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:16,280
And then I'm going to...

2740
02:58:16,280 --> 02:58:19,280
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go.

2741
02:58:19,280 --> 02:58:25,280
Get it. Get it, Mr. Suck and Fuck 3.

2742
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:30,280
Itadakimasu.

2743
02:58:30,280 --> 02:58:32,280
Gross. Terrible.

2744
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:35,280
Itadakimasu.

2745
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:40,280
Oh God, why? Why does it end like this?

2746
02:58:40,280 --> 02:58:45,280
Decadent. Well, I think that's a great note to go out on when you say.

2747
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:47,280
Yeah, I think we fucked up.

2748
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:50,280
We went over the limit.

2749
02:58:50,280 --> 02:58:55,280
Eleazar, just maybe you can snip out a minute here or there or two to get it under the three hours.

2750
02:58:55,280 --> 02:58:58,280
Sorry, fucked up, fucked up. So sorry.

2751
02:58:58,280 --> 02:59:02,280
Okay, that's it. Patreon.com slash the procrastinators bonus episodes.

2752
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:05,280
Speakup.com slash PCB voicemail.

2753
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:07,280
I think that's it.

2754
02:59:07,280 --> 02:59:10,280
Get the I Have COVID shirt and goodbye.

2755
02:59:10,280 --> 02:59:12,280
Goodbye.
