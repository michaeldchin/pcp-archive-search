1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I won't bless that guy. That's son of a bitch.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello everybody and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The only show where Ben Saint is here.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Actually that's completely incorrect, cause we were on something else.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We were on a different show.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh yeah, I wasn't gonna mention it because fuck those guys.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, well I still haven't mentioned it.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You mean the pro and on. You mean the pro and on cast.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Make sure to bleep that. Make sure to bleep that so it's extremely secretive.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And people ask questions and starts drama and then people attack us in the streets.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
They invited, they asked me to come on and I was like, okay, I guess.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And I was shocked to show up and see you and Tom there lol.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
They had asked me. It was like sure.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But we talked on that show the day before we were recording this one.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And now we don't have anything to say.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, I spent all my content.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I mean, I'll have to revisit all the same bullshit again.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ugh, what a nightmare for everyone, but especially me reliving this the worst week of my entire life.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What was so bad about it?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, was it the worst week of my entire life? Probably not.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, I'll complain. I'll complain about some stuff.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I got some, you know, you know, we're both working on our secret projects and I've been trying to work on mine and I thought I was ready to post a an update for my patrons on that.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, and that and that was like two weeks ago and since then I have like hit a point where I'm like it's not ready, but I have not made significant progress on it.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I feel I've been hitting my head against the wall and hasn't it.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's it's at a point where like it keep it looks the same like I'll work for a work on it and then I'll look at it and then like it's the same it didn't change and I fucking can't stand it.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I hate it. I hate I've got I'm learning to hate it and it's very distressing.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, that feels like a lot of projects get to that point where the amount of work you put in does not anymore corresponds to the amount of stuff that is new that is that you've made.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, when you're first starting anything there's nothing there and then suddenly there's something the amount of difference is staggering but every second you add something else, the increases less and less impressive.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But I know what I want it to be and I know that it isn't that yet.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And what you want it to be is good.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Good. Good, good, good.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I was working on a little bit this morning. It's okay. It's it's fine. It's, I just got to get over it. I just got to get over my shit with it and just fuck it you know just fuck it.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was feeling a little I wouldn't say bad it was just sort of like I needed a bit of a break from from my secret project.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Not that I was going to stop doing it but like I wasn't managing everything very well and you did like a time to like really thick because I jumped into a little too quickly and planned out everything exactly.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I took a week off near the end of February to like figure it out like figure out exactly what I'm going to be doing and now coming back in March it's it's a little more clear the path to victory is some feeling.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I stepped away from it for a little while and then stepping back I felt like lost.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh yeah I didn't what was I doing.

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I didn't exactly step back from the project I just stepped back from creation of the project and went into like a pre production sort of like a like a like a research phase.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was trying to like figure out it's hard talking about this without just explaining what it is.

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I mean it's obviously a creative thing people can probably get all that and they can probably be like hmm well there's only so many things it could be.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:58,000
These true true they'll figure it out and then I'll be like oh I can't I can't excite anyone anymore but that's fine nobody knows exactly what it looks like and I think it's looking fucking sick right now.

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They're going to be like what.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Mine is looking.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's there looks good.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's just missing.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's missing some things that I wanted to have and.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you are you like working like totally by yourself like no help at all on this.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hmm.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That seems like a recipe for having to learn new skills that you don't have.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No I don't agree with that.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean everything easy skills are easy.

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well I mean getting to a point in a skill where you can make the thing that you want in the way that you wanted in a timely fashion takes a lot of time to get that skill.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So like it's easier just to get a group of people.

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't have a make everything.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't trust anyone else.

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Honestly I think that anyone else working on it we just fuck it up and I would just have to like undo whatever they did.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And and and tell them like no that's wrong do it again or else just like except their version of it and I don't want to do that.

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I think it would make it worse and harder and longer.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So I'm just fucking suffering through it on my own and it's gonna be great.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's gonna be great.

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I mean maybe but like is an endless war sort of like mostly other people coded the bulk of it crack was like the backbone of the initial thing.

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's that's different.

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Endless war was an organic thing and I had some ideas for it but I was fine letting it sort of become whatever it was going to be.

72
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is not like that.

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is like I know exactly I know exactly what this is supposed to be.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So the more I just have to keep hammering away at it until it is exactly that.

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So the more important it is the less likely it will exist.

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't understand.

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Like the less the less likely you are to accept help from others.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The longer it'll take to get made because it's not that it's it's not that it's more important.

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's just that my vision is stronger.

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

83
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Lol.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was thinking about like Psycholonials you've played that.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know how much.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Did you did you play it yet?

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I bought it.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I played chapter one and I'm like it.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's it's comfy.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's like you know it's Hussey's writing style.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a visual novel.

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah.

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And that's pretty good and it's like contemporary where it's no longer taking place in the infancy of the Internet.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And it's a different way.

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's like 2020.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's in like coronavirus world.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And it's like dude relatable haha.

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I know that what it's like to have a phone and look at it.

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But it's it's looking good.

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But I couldn't help but notice how shit the art looks the whole time.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Like it is like one or two moments where it's like oh yeah cool.

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's it's almost like like why would it why would I waste time making it look good when you're going to be reading anyway.

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I just need the very barest essential features of this character to be portrayed and the rest you can figure out yourself.

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And yeah I was thinking about that because it's like it is kind of like about it.

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think that's good.

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's like Hussey's minimalist approach to Homestuck in a way as well where like I don't want to draw all that shit.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll use a photograph and I'll like copy paste the cathedral and make prosper out of that.

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Instead of drawing it and it works great because you don't need it to be drawn entirely by the artist in order to get the gist of what it is.

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm like yeah thinking about that like how how he can do away with the visual aspects of of a comic.

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
When it's not necessary.

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm like it's it's good.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's it's good.

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know.

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm really like Psycholonials so far.

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm on chapter four.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just finished the newest one.

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I think it's great.

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm excited for chapter five.

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't want to I don't want to spoil it though.

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into details.

124
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's not the same universe as Homestuck's far as I know anyway.

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
In fact, the main character is a like past fan or like a once was a fan of Homestuck.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah.

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah.

128
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
She mentions it once or twice.

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She's got a car cat on her wall.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There's a yeah.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know.

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There's there's still there's still mysteries.

133
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's still questions that get raised in in chapter one that I still don't have the answer to.

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I mean I mean yeah I didn't really bring it up.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've been recommending it to people.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't really bring it up to like talk about the plot or anything.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's kind of interesting how like Hussey used to be like like way back in trying to make quote unquote legitimate comic books with like pages and like drawings and whatever with juggle whistles the clown was a pretty cool big thing that he was doing.

139
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And then Homestuck rather MS Paint Adventures took it in a more like fast paced.

140
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't worry too much about like what it looks like is you can you can make up for the lack of visual flair with like gifts and animations because that's possible with the internet and that's cool.

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's sort of that's sort of it doesn't matter if it looks kind of bad compared to like an incredible illustration is.

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't know it's sort of inspiring away because I was awesome.

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And you know I sometimes feel like that is kind of based in a few of the shittier panels where it's just cool stuff is happening and I like it.

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And then when it gets to the ending animation I think I tried I was a bit too much of a try hard with making it look good.

145
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I drew too many frames and took too long and the end result is like not worth the time investment I put into it necessarily.

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's still pretty cool way but like I feel that way about some things that I've made that I'm like why did I bother spending that much time on it.

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think I kind of feel that way about the Slime and Punishment finale pseudo finale video like I don't know I could have done that one faster but I also could have done it easier I could have made it easier on myself probably didn't have to take as long as it did.

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And you know what I think shit I think this new thing that I'm working on I think that is sliding into the same territory of like I probably could have done this easier.

149
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I just had a vision I just had it's got to look exactly like this and exactly what it looks like I might have it must be that.

150
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Even though it won't be because it never is nothing you make ever looks exactly how you intended it to be.

151
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah that was my secret that was my secret ulterior motive in this discussion was to get you to realize that maybe you're working too hard on something that you could cut corners on new be fine.

152
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My my plan I was thinking about this earlier I think my plan with it is to basically release or basically show patrons the like most bare bones version of it, which is almost ready.

153
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And just think like anything that I could possibly cut like cut it all show the most basic version of it, get there like the reaction to it, and then decide like okay.

154
00:13:47,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What what do I like need to add and what can I just leave on the cutting room floor and have it still be like a functional thing that is that people would still appreciate.

155
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's it's I'll spoil what it is if I go too much into like what things I have started to question like do I need to add that do I need to add that.

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But yeah, sometimes I feel like my desire to make the Clarissa gun smoke comic.

157
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I still sort of intend to finish that because I wrote the ending of it, but it being like a physical comic that you could print out in like an a for you know like normal comic book shape.

158
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, you could have it and you'd put it on your wall and not on your wall and your shelf.

159
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like that is like a limitation that is entirely just because like there's no reason for it to be like that at all.

160
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There's so many more formats that it could be.

161
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I just wanted to do that because I hadn't done it yet.

162
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And now that I've tried to do it.

163
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's kind of annoying trying to get it to fit even though it's like a cool skill to have to like make it work when it works really well.

164
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's like a few pages.

165
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm really proud of how the how it flows where your eye move thing to thing.

166
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's good to learn those things but like I don't need it to be like an like a comic book shaped comic.

167
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I could do it however I like.

168
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I could make it a Twitter comic where there's just like a panel every day or something strange like that.

169
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I could make it look really shitty.

170
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I could draw it using a crayon.

171
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's no reason the lines have to be smooth.

172
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There's no reason there has to be like a halftone little dots.

173
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Those are all limitations for the print media.

174
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If it's designed to be read on the Internet or if it will primarily be read on the Internet then yeah.

175
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's the point?

176
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I mean I like the idea of printing it off just because the Internet feels.

177
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It used to feel like everything would be on the Internet forever but as the longer I have existed the more I've realized that it only exists for as long as the servers are up or the website doesn't change.

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The URLs are still functioning.

179
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I prefer everything that I ever make to at least become physical at some point so that it can't ever be completely lost.

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But of course physical stuff can still get lost.

181
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's just sort of everything's temporary and it sucks.

182
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
When I was a youngster I always thought things would last.

183
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They don't.

184
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I am really looking forward to after I finish this thing then I have a little bit more to do to finish Slime and Punishment and then I'm going to make a book out of it and it's going to look great.

185
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's going to look so good.

186
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's not even going to be that hard.

187
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I was working on making like a Bill J. Book.

188
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

189
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But it was just sort of like I don't know is this stupid?

190
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Everything's stupid.

191
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah but like is it really stupid?

192
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Like is it I don't know.

193
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's the same thing with like the time wasting like I'm placing all the panels in there and I'm like copying and pasting the things and making each page look nice and I got like 40 pages in.

194
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And I was like this is looking all right but like who cares about Bill J. that much enough to buy a book.

195
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't even know if I do.

196
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It'll be cool but like it'll be cool if it exists.

197
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I would probably buy one depending I mean I probably buy one for like maybe a joke for a laugh.

198
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How many pages would it be?

199
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Because of the gifts and the animation I think it might be like 200 pages.

200
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I would buy one of the I would buy a book of it for I don't know maybe 30 bucks 35 something I don't know how much is not in the book costs.

201
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah I was looking at this like a while ago.

202
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Like the type of paper to use for a paperback or hardback probably a paperback be much nicer.

203
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Just like a you know a square Homestuck shaped book in the same way that Homestuck makes their book versions.

204
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah.

205
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I could still do that there's nothing stopping me from doing that I am pretty preoccupied with my secret project.

206
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Once my secret project gets to a point where I can announce what I was working on and then that ball could be rolling into the future and then I can sort of I don't know.

207
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There's so many things constantly going on.

208
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I feel like I can only work on one project at a time.

209
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But if you would like a bail Jake book please say I would like a bail Jake book in all camps in the comments and I will see how many people.

210
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I have been I've been I've been frustrated with progress on the thing.

211
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And I can't even procrastinate with Noida anymore.

212
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't even like Noida.

213
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm sick of it.

214
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I hate it.

215
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's just it's just frustrating.

216
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So I guess I'm looking looking forward to streaming that on Wednesday like we said we would do.

217
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh yeah.

218
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I can't I don't know now like a couple weeks ago I would be like I don't want to work anymore.

219
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm going to be naughty.

220
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm going to play some Noida.

221
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Now I'm like I can't I can't look at this.

222
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can't look at my work anymore.

223
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I have to do something else.

224
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I need Noida and I boot it up and then I'm like oh god but I hate this.

225
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is torture.

226
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't even like this anymore.

227
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I know the feeling where you've played a game for long enough that you're like I'm legitimately not interested in playing this anymore but I've made a habit of it and I'm booting it up yet again.

228
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah this sucks.

229
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This sucks.

230
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is so boring.

231
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I wish I was at work.

232
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I wish I was working a nine to five right now.

233
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Sometimes I wish I worked in 95.

234
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It would just be it would just be so easy.

235
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There would be nothing at stake.

236
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You just clock in.

237
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You fuck around.

238
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You follow instructions for nine hours and then you leave.

239
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh but I'd probably get COVID though because I'd have to go out into the world.

240
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So never mind.

241
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't wish that.

242
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I wish I had a nine to five dig in graves.

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh that's tempting.

244
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's tempting.

245
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh god I wish I I wish I worked minimum wage so that I could get that fucking $15 an hour.

246
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Timmy.

247
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That didn't go through though did it?

248
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
No it didn't go through.

249
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It didn't go through because those eight fucking demons voted against it including the only,

250
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
the first openly bisexual senator serving in the Congress.

251
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Who was that?

252
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Absolute girl boss.

253
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Was it the lady who?

254
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The one who did the cute little curtsy and the thumbs down.

255
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The cute little fuck the poor.

256
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No thanks essential workers.

257
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Does she have an argument for that?

258
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Would it be something like oh 15 is too much.

259
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We should be 14.

260
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No thanks.

261
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
To my knowledge no she made like a tweet that was like an image with like a paragraph.

262
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Explaining like how much she cares about like the little guy.

263
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But I don't think it explained like actually I think that we need to give subsidies to businesses instead of raising the minimum wage.

264
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I don't think it had like a thesis statement or anything.

265
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So it was just like pretending to be good.

266
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Classic.

267
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I think it was basically just like no guys no I do care though in spite of everything I promise.

268
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's funny.

269
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's funny.

270
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's really funny when legislation gets denied.

271
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's a very popular proposal.

272
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I think it's like 67% of people supported but some fucking Congress people are like no.

273
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Why is this allowed to I mean like I know like it's it's complicated getting people in office and out of office but I feel like if the majority of people.

274
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Or like the majority of someone's who they vote for a senator or whatever for their place state.

275
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't fucking know they vote for them and then they get elected and then they do something that the majority of the people who voted for them do not want.

276
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And that's fine.

277
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
They can just vote in someone else.

278
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But like for that one moment that they voted and they waited and then the senator they elected didn't do the thing they wanted.

279
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That's not representing the people but they can't do anything about it until the next election.

280
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The fucked up thing is that she and like most of the other or at least several of the other people that voted against it like we're on record like on Twitter and stuff as being like pro raising the minimum wage.

281
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Like they said they were for it and then they voted against it.

282
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

283
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So it's really fucked up.

284
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Like if anybody voted for those people to get them elected on the assumption that they could get the minimum wage raised.

285
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
They've been lied to but they the voter has no power to like protest.

286
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They can write an angry letter I guess but the voters pass have to wait until the next cycle.

287
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
They just have to they have to wait.

288
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And then like OK are you going to vote against minimum wage again and it's like no I'm going to vote to increase it.

289
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'll do it this time.

290
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I promise.

291
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And then it doesn't happen.

292
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
They vote against it again or it doesn't even come up or something.

293
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:59,000
My favorite one of my favorite posters Posadas Trapgod got banned from Twitter because he told the senator cinema that she should jump into a volcano and that was against the terms of service.

294
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That's that I mean that was that's just too violent.

295
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
That's just too like that's that's so abusive.

296
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And you know she's just she's just she's just a simple bisexual woman trying to live her best life as a girl boss.

297
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You can't go tell you can't go.

298
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That's violence against women to tell a senator that she should jump into a volcano.

299
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Have you have you seen the temperature of magma.

300
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I mean what the fuck that's so high.

301
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's high.

302
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Distressingly so.

303
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh man.

304
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That guy.

305
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That that stupid piece of shit.

306
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Dev Devtrospective a.k.a. the short fat otaku a.k.a. Sargon's Todi.

307
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh you had a thing on with Twitter a little bit ago.

308
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Like like like several months ago I think I had a fight with him on Twitter.

309
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,000
He was the guy who I correctly identified that he was like regurgitating Sargon shit.

310
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And then he he's he wouldn't drop it.

311
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
He kept like laughing at me like haha you keep talking about Sargon.

312
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That means that Sargon lives in your head rent free.

313
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yes in fact I am close personal friends with Sargon and I message him directly.

314
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And I messaged him to tell him that haha Ben St. knows who he is.

315
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That means he wins.

316
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But it's you Ben in whose head he lives rent free.

317
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You fool.

318
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:43,000
He showed up in the in response to me saying something disparaging to senator cinema to say like it was it was funny.

319
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And by which I mean it was infuriating.

320
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He was like haha rack up another L lefty and the strange part is like that guy hates Democrats.

321
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
He thinks that like the Democrats are bad.

322
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So he showed up to laugh at the Democrat at Democratic Democratic voters like me or so he thought.

323
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
On the basis that the Democrats did what he wants because he hates the minimum wage and wants there to be no minimum wage at all.

324
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
He wants to lower the minimum wage not raise it and the Democrats did what he wants.

325
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And to him that means that the Democrats have failed and are bad and he was there to make fun of them for it.

326
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So I don't really get the angle there.

327
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The angle is hate that guy.

328
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The angle is haha I get to love but people who didn't get something they wanted.

329
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
He thinks the Dems are so despicable and yet he is more like them than I am.

330
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
They would he and they want the same thing.

331
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So I don't know what I don't know why he thinks he's so fucking high and mighty.

332
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I think he's just maybe happy that something triggered the left triggered the lips.

333
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Something owned the lips and he was like haha now I like that haha I am not owned.

334
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I make slightly more than minimum wage and therefore I will only laugh haha.

335
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What a fucking bitch what is what a stupid what a stupid fuck I fucking hate that guy.

336
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
My blood boiled I saw I saw him.

337
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I saw him show of my men cheese and immediately my blood starts boiling like this fucking mutant this fucking blight on humanity is back back to torment me from the beyond the grave.

338
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It never ends.

339
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Oh, I guess.

340
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Okay, okay.

341
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Speaking of Twitter.

342
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I want to.

343
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I want to talk about getting canceled for being racist.

344
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah, what the fuck.

345
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I was very racist.

346
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
No, I don't think I was being racist.

347
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But people thought I was racist because a guy actually I think they're non binary.

348
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
A person a black person artist on Twitter said if you draw.

349
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Well they were talking about characters with like the big lips right characters that were like derived from.

350
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Blackface right mostly in Japan because Japan's a little backwards I guess right well I mean.

351
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I don't really understand because like it's it's not like it's only black people they draw this way like they draw Japanese people like the guy in the guy in what's it called.

352
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I know the guy you mean the big boyfriend man.

353
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
No, not big boyfriend man.

354
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
There's like a show where there's a big Japanese man and he's like in lovey-dovey relations with this girl.

355
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's just a romantic cute show.

356
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Oh, oh that one.

357
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah, that's not I was thinking of the editor from.

358
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Oh, by the one with him.

359
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah, the editor from Bakuman.

360
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Like he's not black.

361
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
He's Japanese.

362
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But I guess okay whatever this this artist said like hey don't draw characters like this if you want to draw a fan art of them draw them different.

363
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And then they showed like two examples.

364
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
One was basically just no lips.

365
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And the other one was like Steven Universe lips.

366
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And we're like here's two examples of how to draw them.

367
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And then and then they showed like you know USOP draw in the way and I was like I think that's irritating because I don't know I just thought I just thought it was weird.

368
00:30:46,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I think it's a weird reaction to be like the fan artists need to like do something about this like fan artists must simply simply don't draw the character how they appear in the media.

369
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't know.

370
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I didn't agree with it.

371
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I didn't agree with it and I said it was bad and people said that's racist Ben and I said oh shit I shouldn't have waited into this discourse.

372
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Well, I agree with your general premise that it is weird to expect that of fan artists because they're just drawing characters the way they look.

373
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:33,000
But the way you said you expressed your discontent with this like perspective was the cringe moment.

374
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah, I don't I don't blame anyone for getting mad at me.

375
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I don't I think it was I should have expected it.

376
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I was asking for it.

377
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What I said was what I said was what did I say?

378
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
This is no ACAB ACAB includes art cops like don't be like don't be an art cop like you're being an art cop by policing what people draw.

379
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Which was an inflammatory way of phrasing it and people were annoyed people didn't like it and like yeah, I get it.

380
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I get it.

381
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I was being a dick.

382
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I was being a dick and so for like a whole day my men she's were just like but some some of those people were some of those people were just being unreasonable like the white people.

383
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:37,000
There were too many white people in there trying to trying to cape trying to trying to attack me for and fuck all those people those people were wrong.

384
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And there were there were a few people saying like you need to pay money for this here is my cash app send me money.

385
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And I thought that was funny and of course I didn't do that but I wonder if like that works.

386
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I get several people were on several people were on some bullshit of like oh this guy made a tweet.

387
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm gonna one call him racist and to demand that he pay either me or some black people I know.

388
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And I like I want does that does that work.

389
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Do you mean I guess if somebody says something like out and out completely racist and they mean it they wouldn't donate after saying it.

390
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Obviously it would only work.

391
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It would only work for people who slip up slightly on accident and then they feel bad and maybe they do that.

392
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm not sure.

393
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah.

394
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah.

395
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But I I never feel bad.

396
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I can never be made to feel guilty enough to pay money for anything.

397
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So it doesn't work on me.

398
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
They were very disappointed.

399
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah.

400
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I think OK I've been I've been thinking about it since then and I think that the I can the original tweet I can interpret it in a way that I completely agree with which is just like as as advice or like how to avoid drawing a racist character design like you can simply draw them a different way.

401
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And like I would say yeah you sure can and that's fine and good and thumbs up.

402
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So there in that case there was no need for me to criticize this person.

403
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And if I even if I interpreted in like the least charitable way even if I decide like oh no this person was saying nobody should ever draw like this and if you draw like that you're a bad person in your racist right.

404
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Like even if they were saying that which they weren't honestly their tweet was like very polite and like pretty pretty moderate.

405
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So it wasn't even like that.

406
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But even if it were like that it's not like this person has any power to like make anyone draw anything any particular way so it still wouldn't have really warranted me like getting upset about it.

407
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So yeah the whole thing was a mistake and stupid and I would not do it again if I could go back.

408
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I would undo it if I could.

409
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Well the only way to undo it is to pay up.

410
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Pay all black artists.

411
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So someone told me just pay every black artist.

412
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
OK.

413
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
How many could there be.

414
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
There can't be.

415
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It can't be that many.

416
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Twelve.

417
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Easy.

418
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Fifteen perhaps.

419
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Well so that was a nightmare.

420
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That ruined my day.

421
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
What was that like.

422
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I was like last Thursday or something.

423
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't know.

424
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I eventually had to mute that whole thread because I just was like I can't keep.

425
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I can't keep.

426
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I can't keep dealing with this.

427
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I can't.

428
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't want to see any more of these replies and every time I see a reply I'm tempted to sarcastically respond to it and like that's only making things worse.

429
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah.

430
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I must stop myself and I must stop myself.

431
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You were going into like Bencinct Twitter mode sarcastically replying to a lot of the people who did not know who you were or what you were like and just thought based on what you were saying that this guy is a racist and doesn't respect doesn't believe like that.

432
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I saw a lot of people who were like confused and they thought your use of ACAB was like disparaging.

433
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Sarcastic.

434
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
They thought it was sarcastic.

435
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah.

436
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Like I was making fun of ACAB.

437
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Like no.

438
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
No I'm totally ACAB.

439
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It was a very confusing moment.

440
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Some.

441
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
All around.

442
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Very.

443
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Mostly me.

444
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Mostly me.

445
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
A couple of people saw the phantom horn.

446
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Maga hat DC riot drawing.

447
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That was funny.

448
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That was pretty funny.

449
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
They were like oh my god this guy is like a he's one of those conservative bronies.

450
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
He's one of those Trump or bronies.

451
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Like.

452
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I wish.

453
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That would be that would have been epic.

454
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Unfortunately.

455
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
No.

456
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Well.

457
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So.

458
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So you know these are.

459
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So that's two things that were bad.

460
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This week.

461
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm sure I could think of more.

462
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Nope.

463
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Well that's not so bad then.

464
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I guess it's pretty good.

465
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I don't know.

466
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
How are you.

467
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
How's your.

468
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
How are you.

469
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know.

470
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah.

471
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The week has been.

472
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It's just been.

473
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah.

474
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know.

475
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
God this sucks.

476
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You know what.

477
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You know what.

478
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I have.

479
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I think.

480
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You know I'm complaining about this rut that I've been in with the project.

481
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But I think.

482
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Like yesterday I finally started to climb out of it.

483
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I think yesterday I actually got like.

484
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I got more done yesterday than I had like for a few weeks.

485
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And so I think and then again today I'm like okay.

486
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I've made a little bit of progress again.

487
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So I think I'm finally like.

488
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Climbing out of it a little bit.

489
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Wait a minute.

490
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
One last thing one last thing that's fucked up.

491
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
The hot water in my house is broken.

492
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I have no hot water as of today.

493
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm hoping that that gets fixed soon.

494
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
If it doesn't that would suck really bad.

495
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But I guess we'll see.

496
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I hope I don't have to like heat up my bathwater on the stove.

497
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That would be that would be unfortunate.

498
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
How cold is it over in Boston right now.

499
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Like outside.

500
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I don't know.

501
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It's pretty cold.

502
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I mean the water is icy.

503
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The water coming out of the showers just is just terrible.

504
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Medford, Massachusetts temperature.

505
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It is 37 degrees.

506
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So a little above freezing.

507
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's chilly.

508
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's chilly.

509
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It's getting warmer though.

510
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It hasn't snowed in a while.

511
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I feel a little stupid.

512
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Because like, you know, we come on the PCP.

513
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Well, I mean, I yeah, you know, it's me.

514
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But my last week has been very monotonous.

515
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Regardless of progress I've made on my secret project.

516
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's like I work on that.

517
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I was doing some stuff that I can't talk about.

518
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Lamau.

519
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Then at the end of the day, I checked the Bitcoin.

520
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Bitcoin went down.

521
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh, Bitcoin goes up.

522
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Hmm.

523
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's nice.

524
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Bitcoin goes up and down.

525
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And then I look at it.

526
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm like, huh, well, if it's gone down.

527
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Hmm.

528
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Well, it should go up soon when it's going up.

529
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But it's going to go down some point.

530
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Like that's every day.

531
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
My musings on Bitcoin is just one or the other.

532
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And I'm just looking at it.

533
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And it's just like I'm just living like a dull life.

534
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Oh, are you are you like obsessively checking it?

535
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Not obsessively checking it.

536
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's just sort of like a thing I've fallen into like at the end of the day.

537
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I wonder whether it's done well today.

538
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Oh, it has.

539
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Oh, it hasn't.

540
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh, well.

541
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Oh, hell yeah.

542
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And then like at the middle of the night, me and my brother will go downstairs and watch

543
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
two more episodes of Bovee the Vampire Slayer.

544
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And that's been epic.

545
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
The last time I was, I had some Bitcoin.

546
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I was checking it obsessively and it was really bad.

547
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And I was like watching it constantly.

548
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This time, it's not like that.

549
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I've, yeah, I'd like, yeah, I've just, I check it like a couple of times a day.

550
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Just look at it and like, oh, that's the number.

551
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Okay.

552
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And it's fine.

553
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's going to the moon.

554
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's going to the moon.

555
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Yeah.

556
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Honestly, the crypto hype has worn off.

557
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm not.

558
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yeah.

559
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm not interested in what happens unless it goes really big.

560
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And then I'm like, oh, I suddenly have a little more money.

561
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
That's nice.

562
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
But if it doesn't ever do that ever again, ever in the whole existence, then I'll just

563
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
probably not notice and I'll be like, whatever.

564
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm going to, I'm going to be watching it for a little bit because, you know, they did,

565
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
they cut the 15 minimum wage, but they did pass the STEMI.

566
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So STEMI STEMI checks are going to be going out probably in the next couple of weeks.

567
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So I'm going to watch that.

568
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I was looking, I saw people saying on Twitter today, like, you make sure you put all your

569
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
fucking STEMI into Bitcoin because that's going to the moon and fiat currency is a thing

570
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
of the past.

571
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And I'm like, I'm rubbing my hands like, yes, the plan, the plan is all coming together.

572
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm going to, I'm going to stick with it.

573
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm going to stick with it.

574
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I think it's going to work out.

575
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, it is at five.

576
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It is, it is just hovering right around 50 K right now.

577
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It is like just bouncing around.

578
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Is it 50?

579
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It is exactly 50,000 point one, right?

580
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Oh, 50,000 even.

581
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

582
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
no, no, it's going down.

583
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
No, it's good.

584
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's actually dropped quite a bit since the episode started, but it's been going up this

585
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
week.

586
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So it's fine.

587
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Uh, someone.

588
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Oh, there was a good comment.

589
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Uh, there's a good comment on last week's episode.

590
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Now I got to find it.

591
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Uh, it made me chuckle.

592
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It was about crypto.

593
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Was it like do the opposite of Ben St.

594
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And you will make money.

595
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Somebody said that and that's true.

596
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Except this time.

597
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This is the time.

598
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Oh, here.

599
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
No, here it is.

600
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Maric 24.

601
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Ah, yes.

602
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's time for my favorite podcast, the pro crypto traders podcast.

603
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm supposed to be trading right now, but I'm not trading.

604
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm fucking crying.

605
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
GameStop is soaring.

606
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Bitcoin is dying.

607
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Uh, true.

608
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Too true.

609
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Too real.

610
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Too real.

611
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Too real.

612
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Well, voicemails.

613
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I guess so.

614
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I mean, I, I, I feels like I, I could have had maybe more to say it was that, it was

615
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
that damn pro and on cast.

616
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
They, they, they, uh, let us dry with their asking of questions about stuff.

617
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
They, they let us dry, but also, I mean, I, I went on there to complain about Trixie,

618
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
which is something that I don't, I want to keep like limited a bit here on this show.

619
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I don't want to do too much of that.

620
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So if I, if I were gonna, if I were going to continue on that train, I, I guess I could,

621
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
but like, I don't want to on the PCP anymore.

622
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Like that's fine.

623
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I've said enough about it.

624
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Um, so, I mean, I guess fine.

625
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The, the interesting thing that, that episode they were talking, they basically had us on

626
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
to talk about the anniversary of Rack on four, which I think was then, or is at some point,

627
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
cause it's March now.

628
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's, it's this month.

629
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's sometime this month.

630
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Is it the end?

631
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Is it the end of March?

632
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I don't even remember.

633
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Well, I forget the, the exact like dates that we were here.

634
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Um, but, uh, dumb, it's in March and it's been a year.

635
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And I guess, you know, the things we said on that show, the same that we would say here.

636
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
More or less.

637
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Which is, uh, please don't kill us.

638
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Please.

639
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We're trying to get the stuff out as fast as we can.

640
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I don't feel bad.

641
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I don't feel bad about the other stuff.

642
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I don't, I don't feel bad about the stuff that we haven't released yet because it's,

643
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I've said this already.

644
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I, I don't want to delve too deep into it, but it's, it makes sense.

645
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Like the, the, the final, the, the OVA, like it's got work, it's got work in it.

646
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And like it's going to be, it's people are going to like it.

647
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Even if people don't like it, people will at least nod and go, I understand why that took a year.

648
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Um, oh, I gotta make a, I gotta make a beach background.

649
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I gotta draw, I gotta draw a beach.

650
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I tried and I failed.

651
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So I gotta try again.

652
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Did you use the wrong color for the scene?

653
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It was piss water.

654
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I, I just, I, I opened up like a, I opened up like a photograph of a, of a nice sparkly beach.

655
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And I tried kind of like painting it and it just looked like shit.

656
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And I just trashed it.

657
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It was like, I'll, I'll try again tomorrow.

658
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Uh, it just didn't look.

659
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
The water looked like goo.

660
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I don't know.

661
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Yeah.

662
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
What is hard to paint?

663
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It is.

664
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Um, I'm no, I'm no landscape artist.

665
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm not like super good at painting like a sunset on the sea.

666
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Uh, it's not really my forte.

667
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Mmm.

668
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Mmm.

669
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But, uh, she just used, she's just steel photographs.

670
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
No.

671
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It's just steel photographs.

672
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Like, what are they going to, like, what are they going to do about it?

673
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
What's anyone going to do about it?

674
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Um, they're going to say, no, it's not that it's just going to look worse.

675
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Oh.

676
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah.

677
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
That would be bad.

678
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Um, you say that, but I don't know.

679
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And I say it because I mean it.

680
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I don't, yeah.

681
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Oh, I don't know.

682
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I don't know if my drawings would be any good.

683
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I mean, I guess they'll be fine.

684
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Thank you.

685
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Good at drawing.

686
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
What are you saying?

687
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
My, my beach, the beach background on the radcon for poster.

688
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It looks okay because it's like mostly hidden.

689
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I went in and I, like, I took the figures out of the foreground to just have the background

690
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
only to realize that the only, like the very edges of the drawing are complete.

691
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And like the middle behind everyone is just like smud, it's just like smudges and blotches

692
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and it's just, it's like nothing.

693
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's like nonsense garbage.

694
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And I was like, and I realized, like, oh shit, I don't, I don't actually have like a drawing

695
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
here.

696
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,880
I have just sort of, I just kind of worked around the edges to create the approximation

697
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,000
of a drawing of a beach.

698
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Uh, now I have to actually do one.

699
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Ugh.

700
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I mean, it's not that hard.

701
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,680
It's just like you get a rectangle of sky and you get a rectangle of little thin, thin

702
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,120
rectangle of ocean.

703
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,720
You got a, you get sand on the bottom.

704
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:12,920
I was looking at a photograph and the, the line where the sand meets the water, I was

705
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,800
looking at it and I was like, wait a minute, water is clear.

706
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,800
What the fuck?

707
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:27,640
Like I can like see the sand through the water and like the only indication of the end of

708
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,560
the water is just like a very slight, like a white line.

709
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,080
But then it's sort of like the blueness kind of like creeps in as like you get a little

710
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:43,140
further from the water line that sort of mutates into blue very, very gradually.

711
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,280
And I tried to like approximate that.

712
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,120
And I think the end, it ended up looking like a lagoon.

713
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,480
Like the water wasn't sparkly enough.

714
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,480
The water was too like, just kind of look like thick blue ooze.

715
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,200
And I was like, no, this garbage trash.

716
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,640
You've got to look, I mean, it's an anime thing.

717
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,600
So just look at what anime does.

718
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,160
How do they get the limitations of having to draw it all?

719
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:13,920
You know, that's a way better idea than trying to copy like a photograph because it's supposed

720
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
to look like an anime.

721
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,640
Oh my God.

722
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:23,120
So it's so obvious, so simple and clean.

723
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm going to Google it right now.

724
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Anime beach.

725
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,120
Why don't I just, let's just steal this, just steal this.

726
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
What's even the point?

727
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,240
What's even the point of making anything original?

728
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,760
Literally, there's none.

729
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,440
No, yeah, I can't think of anything.

730
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,480
No, not a damn thing.

731
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,080
Some of these don't even look real.

732
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,120
Some of these, I'm sure these look fine like in a show when you're not paying attention

733
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,720
to the background, but scrutinizing them, it's like, that's not a beach.

734
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,800
This is a mere facsimile of a beach.

735
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,400
This is just colors on canvas.

736
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,600
This is just an arrangement of pixels meant to approximate an image of a vista one might

737
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,000
see in nature.

738
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
What the fuck is this?

739
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You know what I'm saying?

740
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Yeah.

741
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,200
I don't know.

742
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,680
Fuck art.

743
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:32,680
Fuck art is what I'm saying.

744
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Voicemail?

745
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,640
Yeah, that's voicemails.

746
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,120
Let's fucking voicemail.

747
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,680
Hopefully some of them will distract us from this nightmare.

748
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:58,360
Okay, it looks like the first one this week is called, ass blast at last, 3, 2, 1, go.

749
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,360
The large samurai is right back.

750
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,640
Hello, American, hello, American conservatives.

751
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,120
My name is Genki Fujii.

752
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:13,120
I'm a Japanese journalist and an author of modern 70 books on international relations.

753
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
I know this.

754
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:21,720
There was a Japanese man who was part of the Republican something, CPEC.

755
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,840
President Trump fought against Chinese communists in order to protect the entire free world.

756
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,800
President Trump is a real American samurai.

757
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,840
I want to make US Japan alive and stronger.

758
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,960
I almost built a solid friendship with real American patriots.

759
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
This is some bullshit.

760
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,960
This is some...

761
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,960
Yeah.

762
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:50,840
It's like a Japanese man doing samurai moves and saying, I love a president to Trump and

763
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,760
then he has the Kawasaki scrolls or something.

764
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,560
Was he doing like sword moves?

765
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,760
Yeah, he was doing like the real American samurai or something.

766
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,760
It's like, okay.

767
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,760
Oh, wow.

768
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,760
That sounds pretty funny.

769
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,760
I need to crack open.

770
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,760
Republican samurai.

771
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:17,480
So like, I wonder if they're affiliated with the Kawasaki clan.

772
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,480
The Kawasaki clan?

773
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,760
God, I hope not.

774
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,480
If they were, that would explain why I ran away and betrayed them.

775
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,480
Next.

776
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,480
Okay.

777
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,480
Next voicemail is called Ben is canceled.

778
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,480
Three, two, one, go.

779
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
Wake up.

780
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
Check Twitter.

781
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,480
Ben is canceled.

782
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,480
Yeah.

783
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,480
Good.

784
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,480
No, I'm uncancelable.

785
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
I'm uncancelable.

786
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,480
There was one.

787
00:52:51,480 --> 00:53:02,480
There was one person, a white person, by the way, who retweeted me saying like Ben St.

788
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:15,480
is a racist and a homophobe and an ableist because he says the N word and many other slurs

789
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,480
in the tales gets trolled lecture.

790
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,480
And they tweeted the tales gets trolled lecture time stamped to when I talk about the words

791
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,480
of power.

792
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,480
And I was like, well, I've made my bed time to lay in it.

793
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,480
But it got like eight, it got like eight likes.

794
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,480
So whatever.

795
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Did they know about your video beforehand or did they get mad about the Twitter drama

796
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,480
and then go watch your content to find stuff like that?

797
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,480
I don't know.

798
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,480
I don't know.

799
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,480
Yeah.

800
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,480
Like they would have had to watch like a full two hour video to find that.

801
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,480
I do wonder because it doesn't seem that ridiculous that somebody would like find somebody freshly

802
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:05,480
canceled or like freshly on the cusp of being destroyed online and then just click on their

803
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:12,480
social media links, look at their stuff for the purposes of like adding fuel to the fire.

804
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,480
I don't think that's like that out of the question for some people to do.

805
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,480
No, but but I would be surprised if they sat through a whole a whole lecture.

806
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,480
I yeah.

807
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
Looking for it though.

808
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,480
So I don't know.

809
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:31,480
And this this person was then like they they made another post afterwards that was like,

810
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,480
I didn't really understand it, but it was funny.

811
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:41,480
It was like someone just blocked me and I don't appreciate like I wish you would have

812
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:47,480
the decency to just tell me if you're going to block me because it's so nerve wracking

813
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:53,480
and it makes and it's so upsetting to me because I don't know why it's happening.

814
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,480
And I don't know like who blocked them or anything or even if it had anything to do

815
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,480
with that post.

816
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,480
But I thought it was pretty funny that they would that they would try and cancel me like

817
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:09,480
that and then get like so upset that someone they don't know blocked them.

818
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
I don't know.

819
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,480
It was a funny, funny moment.

820
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:23,480
I guess if you employ yourself in that sort of culture where people get like burned at

821
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:30,480
the stake online on Twitter that you'd be terrified if you were the one in the line of fire there

822
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,480
because you know what it's like to burn someone else.

823
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,480
I can imagine your own angry mob because you are one of another.

824
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:45,480
That person's avatar was hideous.

825
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:53,480
Just like very, very off putting for various reasons.

826
00:55:53,480 --> 00:56:00,480
I just want to say fuck you your avatar is ugly stupid lol.

827
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:08,480
Okay, next voicemail is called Sniper King 3, 2, 1, go.

828
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,480
I completely understand not liking the idea of deeming some art unacceptable.

829
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,480
But as a black man and one of your likely very few, very, very few black listeners,

830
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,480
I will say that I am disappointed.

831
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,480
You can't call a black person an art cop for very reasonably asking people to not draw

832
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,480
characters with racist features.

833
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,480
That should make you very questionable.

834
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,480
It got worse when instead of apologizing for misgendering someone in their replies,

835
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,480
you just told them you'd never read a bio.

836
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
Come on.

837
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
I don't feel bad about that.

838
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,480
You keep saying that you didn't say anything racist,

839
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,480
but it's not your explicit words that made people think that.

840
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,480
It's that your reaction was to defend artists drawing racist caricatures,

841
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,480
which they should be smart enough not to do even if usops lips really do look like that.

842
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,480
Re-examine some shit, man, because that whole thing made your advocacy look just a little bit

843
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,480
on the performative side.

844
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,480
I partially agree with that.

845
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,480
And don't say Negro.

846
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,480
Okay, gotcha.

847
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,480
I partially agree with that.

848
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,480
I don't feel bad about the bio thing.

849
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,480
I didn't read that person's bio.

850
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,480
I didn't know they were non-binary.

851
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,480
I don't feel bad that I accidentally called them she.

852
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,480
I don't care.

853
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,480
Well, I think that in that instance, you didn't say the word sorry,

854
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,480
so they assumed that you were like...

855
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
I wasn't sorry.

856
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
I don't feel bad about it.

857
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,480
About misgendering someone accidentally?

858
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,480
I really don't.

859
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:51,480
Yeah, I made a mistake, but I don't think it matters.

860
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
It probably matters to them.

861
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,480
I think that's the point, isn't it?

862
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,480
It doesn't matter to them.

863
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,480
They were there.

864
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,480
This was that same person.

865
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:07,480
This was that same person with the ugly avatar.

866
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,480
Do you think it really hurt their feelings that me,

867
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,480
who they were there to call out for being racist,

868
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,480
didn't know their gender?

869
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,480
It's not that in any individual situation,

870
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,480
maybe somebody doesn't have a problem with it.

871
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,480
It's just the idea that as a rule,

872
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,480
you should probably do it just in case they do have a problem

873
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,480
or they would feel sad,

874
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,480
because some people feel very strongly about that.

875
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:45,480
I should have just said nothing.

876
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,480
I do agree.

877
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,480
I do agree that calling them an art cop

878
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,480
over the not wanting people to draw racist characters,

879
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,480
I do agree that was foolish of me,

880
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,480
and I don't stand by that.

881
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:04,480
So I'm with you there.

882
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,480
Yeah, I guess that's it.

883
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,480
Thanks for your voicemail, sir.

884
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,480
Sorry.

885
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,480
I feel pretty stupid about the whole thing.

886
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:25,480
I hope not too many people made voicemails about it.

887
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,480
I can see one that might be about it.

888
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Okay, that's cool.

889
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,480
Next one is called Kringus Bingus 6.

890
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,480
Three, two, one, go.

891
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,480
Here he is.

892
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,480
It's me, Kringus.

893
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,480
Back after your little break.

894
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,480
Hi.

895
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,480
My fate, my Kring this week is that,

896
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,480
I think two weeks ago now,

897
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Ben mistook some random voicemail color

898
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,480
who just happened to say Kring and Bing for me,

899
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,480
and it wasn't me.

900
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,480
He didn't sound anything like me.

901
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,480
He did outside of the single thing,

902
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,480
my Kringus Bingus,

903
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,480
and it made me very offended that Ben did not,

904
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,480
Ben thought that someone else was me,

905
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,480
because I thought me and you were very good friends, Ben,

906
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,480
so I would like you to apologize,

907
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,480
and I will accept your apology,

908
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,480
and we will continue to be friends.

909
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,480
Oh my God.

910
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,480
Sorry, Kringus Bingus.

911
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,480
What I've been binging is,

912
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,480
I've been binging the Sopranos,

913
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,480
the HBO show from the 2000s.

914
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,480
It's actually pretty good.

915
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,480
That's a pretty good one.

916
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,480
It has a lot of emotion and drama,

917
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,480
and it builds this web of these characters

918
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,480
who all lead very intriguing or dangerous lives,

919
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,480
and it has a lot of heart,

920
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,480
and it's about family,

921
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,480
and it's about obligation

922
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,480
that people think that they have,

923
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,480
and it's a very smart show.

924
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,480
I would recommend it to anyone.

925
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,480
You can torrent it.

926
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,480
You don't have to have HBO.

927
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,480
You can torrent it.

928
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,480
Okay, yes.

929
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,480
Kringus Bingus is out.

930
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,480
Goodbye.

931
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,480
Okay, goodbye.

932
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,480
Thanks for recommending the Sopranos,

933
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,480
Kringus Bingus.

934
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,480
I am so glad to know that it's good.

935
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,480
It's got a good intro song.

936
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,480
You listen to that,

937
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,480
and you're like,

938
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,480
well, I want to listen to that again.

939
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,480
The episode itself is like,

940
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,480
whatever.

941
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,480
Tony Soprano going,

942
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,480
hey.

943
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,480
Yeah, yeah, that's my shit right there.

944
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,480
Okay, next one is

945
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,480
Kringus Bingus bonus episode two.

946
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,480
Wow.

947
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,480
Three, two, one, go.

948
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,480
Hey, it's Kringus Bingus with a bonus episode.

949
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,480
But how do I know it's Kringus Bingus?

950
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,480
He says he says he's Kringus Bingus.

951
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,480
I've been thinking for a while,

952
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,480
for a few weeks, actually,

953
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,480
that I've been thinking about

954
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:57,480
is everything that Trixie is doing,

955
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,480
everything Trixie is doing right now,

956
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,480
not only did you take all of her videos down

957
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,480
from her channel,

958
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,480
and she didn't give everybody

959
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,480
a lot of time frame

960
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,480
that she said she was going to give them

961
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,480
to do it,

962
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,480
and then a lot of people didn't have

963
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,480
videos that they wanted,

964
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,480
so everybody's mad about that.

965
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,480
And also, not releasing the Burning Recture,

966
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,480
you can just give it to the backers

967
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,480
as backer content,

968
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,480
or you could just release it.

969
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,480
It's whatever you want to do.

970
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,480
But I think that you should put it out there

971
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,480
because even though it wasn't explicitly

972
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,480
promised in the rag-con for Kickstarter,

973
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,480
everybody expected it,

974
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,480
and you didn't make it clear

975
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,480
that it wasn't backer content.

976
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,480
So I think it's weird not to release it,

977
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,480
and you should release it

978
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,480
because everybody wants to see it.

979
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,480
I agree 100%.

980
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,480
Kringus Bingus out, goodbye.

981
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,480
Hey, that was a pretty good bonus episode,

982
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,480
Kringus Bingus.

983
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,480
I like that one.

984
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,480
Was that two crings and no-bing?

985
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,480
Was it just one cring?

986
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,480
That was two crings.

987
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,480
I think it was multiple items

988
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,480
under the umbrella of a single Kring category.

989
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,480
Oh, yeah.

990
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,480
Yeah, yeah.

991
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,480
Yeah, it was just a Kring,

992
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,480
but a fairly broad and robust Kring.

993
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,480
Okay, next one is called...

994
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,480
Oh, yeah, this is gonna be great.

995
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,480
This one's called Racist Ben Strikes Back.

996
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,480
Three, two, one, go.

997
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,480
Yeah, I knew it.

998
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Ben was racist the entire time.

999
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,480
I'm sorry.

1000
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,480
I feel stupid.

1001
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,480
I'm stupid on Twitter, lol.

1002
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,480
I see that there's another one coming up

1003
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,480
called Sniper King 2,

1004
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,480
and these were all released on the same day.

1005
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,480
So that one's gonna be great.

1006
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,480
I hope that one doesn't make me feel even worse about

1007
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,480
the things I said.

1008
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,480
Okay, next one is called...

1009
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,480
Bort Coop.

1010
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,480
This is Ben's weekly reminder to catch up on one piece.

1011
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,480
Number four, three, two, one, go.

1012
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,480
Nah, but in all seriousness, though,

1013
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,480
Ben, you're totally right on Twitter.

1014
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,480
It's a shame you're getting ratioed by these absolute brainlets.

1015
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,480
I'm not totally right.

1016
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,480
What do they expect to do with their claims and shit?

1017
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,480
What do we do?

1018
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,480
Just not draw Usopp anymore?

1019
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,480
Just because he looks racist?

1020
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,480
It's a racist caricature or something?

1021
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,480
No, that's literally bullshit.

1022
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,480
Anyways, it's your weekly reminder to catch up on one piece, Ben,

1023
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,480
if you haven't already.

1024
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,480
I know it's been soiled a little bit, you might want to say,

1025
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,480
but just do it, fam.

1026
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,480
No, no.

1027
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,480
No, I actually...

1028
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,480
I always knew Usopp was racist,

1029
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,480
and that's why I liked it from the very beginning.

1030
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,480
Oh, no.

1031
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,480
Oh, no.

1032
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,480
I like Usopp. He's my favorite.

1033
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,480
This is stupid,

1034
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,480
but I always associated myself with Usopp

1035
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,480
just because he has curly hair, and so do I.

1036
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,480
Yeah, no, I didn't see that.

1037
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,480
Somebody asked me,

1038
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,480
what did I say?

1039
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,480
Was it on the PCP that someone asked who was the best?

1040
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,480
No, it was in my Discord.

1041
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,480
Someone asked me, who was the worst straw hat?

1042
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,480
And I said, probably either Nami or Chopper.

1043
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,480
You know, these days, probably Chopper,

1044
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,480
because he has become entirely a mascot

1045
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,480
and with no interesting anything,

1046
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,480
and it sucks to see.

1047
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,480
It's not Chopper's fault, but he's been relegated to a cutesy face

1048
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,480
that does nothing.

1049
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,480
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1050
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,480
So I guess that doesn't change.

1051
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,480
That was the case back where I left off as well.

1052
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,480
I guess Nami does some stuff.

1053
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,480
Nami has like remotes.

1054
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:31,480
Chopper's probably become worse than Nami at this point.

1055
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,480
Nami had her joke,

1056
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,480
well, the straw hats have their joke,

1057
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,480
and Nami's was like, I love money.

1058
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,480
I'll do something for you,

1059
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,480
but you have to pay me a lot of money.

1060
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,480
And that got boring,

1061
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,480
and that seems to have been dropped as a thing she does.

1062
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,480
The other characters have funnier jokes that have stuck,

1063
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,480
like Zoro constantly losing direction.

1064
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,480
And you know,

1065
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,480
I don't even think Chopper does the hiding

1066
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,480
on the wrong side of the door thing anymore,

1067
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,480
which is upsetting.

1068
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
That was like his whole thing.

1069
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,480
It's his best trait.

1070
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,480
I mean, he still does the thing where,

1071
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,480
what's his thing?

1072
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,480
It's that if you compliment him,

1073
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,480
he gets shy, but also gets really rude about it.

1074
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,480
Yeah, he's really aggressively bashful.

1075
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,480
Yeah, aggressively bashful.

1076
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:37,480
Well, I have like a year's worth of one piece to catch up on.

1077
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,480
Is it good? Am I going to enjoy myself?

1078
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,480
Yeah, there's lots to love.

1079
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,480
I'm really enjoying it right now.

1080
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,480
Would it be spoiler to ask, are they still in Wano?

1081
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,480
It depends on where you are in Wano right now, but...

1082
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,480
I was like pretty early on in Wano is where I left off.

1083
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,480
Okay, I mean, Wano was built up to be a big arc,

1084
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,480
and they're still in there.

1085
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,480
Okay, okay, I thought so.

1086
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,480
Oh, I want to catch up on one piece,

1087
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,480
but I want to finish my fucking thing.

1088
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:17,480
But we're finishing my fucking thing is so hard, and I hate it.

1089
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,480
But if I do anything else, I'll hate myself even more.

1090
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,480
Do the thing, Ben.

1091
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,480
Okay, you're right.

1092
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,480
Just got to do the thing.

1093
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:34,480
Next voicemail is called PCP Adjacent Discords.

1094
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,480
Three, two, one, go.

1095
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,480
Hey guys, just wondered if you know of any PCP Adjacent Discord servers

1096
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,480
you could tell me about that aren't Endless War,

1097
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,480
and that I don't even care if they're hidden behind a paywall.

1098
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:54,480
I joined this art community because it had a really active voice chat,

1099
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,480
but everybody always treats me like I'm crazy.

1100
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:00,480
Like I ask like, hey, do you guys think Loomis is a meme?

1101
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,480
And like a roomful artist just sound baffled.

1102
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,480
Like what the fuck is Loomis? You mean the truck company?

1103
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,480
No, the construction method.

1104
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,480
Like I'm sure Ben knows what Loomis is.

1105
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,480
Of course they know Loomis.

1106
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,480
Yeah, I need friends who know what I talk about.

1107
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,480
That's well, okay.

1108
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,480
A good one there for art specifically is the Quickdraw server.

1109
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,480
That's pretty active.

1110
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,480
The Quickdraw Saloon.

1111
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,480
I mean, I haven't looked at it in a while.

1112
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,480
Is it still active?

1113
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,480
Yeah, people post their art and respond.

1114
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,480
Tom posted something quite recently actually, that's pretty cool.

1115
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,480
A little 3D model.

1116
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,480
But yeah, it's a pretty thriving community of artists

1117
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,480
who can talk to each other about cool shit,

1118
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,480
and it came from the PCP drawcast.

1119
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,480
Yeah, yeah.

1120
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:54,480
I mean, that seems probably like exactly what this guy is looking for.

1121
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,480
So I guess I'll just second that and say

1122
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:02,480
the Quickdraw Saloon is still around.

1123
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,480
Just being itself.

1124
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,480
Okay, here's the one I'm dreading.

1125
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,480
Next one is Sniper King 2 Damage Control.

1126
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,480
Let's do it.

1127
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,480
Three, two, one, go.

1128
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:22,480
I realize my last voicemail may have been too hasty, too harsh for what this was.

1129
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,480
It's been a rough year for my people, you feel?

1130
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,480
Shit is touchy.

1131
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,480
If a character is in black or black coded,

1132
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,480
it is reasonable to say that even if they have those same features

1133
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,480
that are reminiscent of black caricatures,

1134
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,480
they are divorced enough from that context.

1135
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,480
That's whatever.

1136
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,480
I still think with a character like Usopp,

1137
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,480
it should be on anyone who draws them to know that that shit isn't right.

1138
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,480
I don't care if that's his canon appearance,

1139
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,480
people should be smarter than them to draw his lips like that.

1140
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,480
I love listening to you guys, keep just being cool.

1141
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,480
Hello, my favorite podcast.

1142
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,480
Right after the Pizza Party podcast.

1143
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,480
Nice.

1144
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:06,480
Okay, I guess I'm just curious then.

1145
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:13,480
I don't even disagree that the way that Usopp looks is kind of racist.

1146
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,480
I think that, yeah, it probably is and it makes sense.

1147
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:24,480
But I mean, I'm assuming that if you don't want people to draw him that way,

1148
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,480
that would it also be good if Oda stopped drawing him that way?

1149
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,480
If Oda redesigned him, maybe that would be good.

1150
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,480
But also, I know it won't happen.

1151
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:41,480
So, I don't know.

1152
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,480
Maybe that's what people should...

1153
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:54,480
Okay, like I said, I don't feel like I was completely justified in getting all huffy about it.

1154
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,480
I feel, you know what?

1155
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,480
It's very awfully, awfully considerate, awfully considerate of this guy

1156
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,480
to even be like, hmm, maybe I was too hard on Ben.

1157
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,480
I don't think you were.

1158
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,480
I don't think you were too hard on me, my guy.

1159
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,480
But thanks.

1160
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,480
Yeah, it's touchy.

1161
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:24,480
You know, Twitter drama aside, the idea of fan artists drawing characters that are inspired from a artistic style that is racist

1162
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:29,480
is an interesting question because it's not an obvious like, just don't draw them.

1163
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:33,480
Because like, I don't know if I see a fan art of Usopp.

1164
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:41,480
There's nothing about that that leads me to the conclusion that the artist is a racist person in any way.

1165
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:46,480
And I don't know whether like, one piece is overwhelmingly popular.

1166
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,480
But it's not about the artist.

1167
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,480
It's about like, you know, if this...

1168
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,480
It's about the depiction.

1169
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,480
And if the depiction is based in this like stereotype.

1170
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,480
Okay, well, I guess...

1171
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,480
Well, that's why it's an interesting question because like, one piece is extremely popular anyway.

1172
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:14,480
I don't know if people, like there's that much of a backlash against Usopp in general by people who read one piece.

1173
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,480
There's some.

1174
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,480
Maybe.

1175
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,480
I mean, obviously there's some.

1176
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,480
I don't know.

1177
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:32,480
Like, you can understand the racist roots of that, the lips and stuff and still like, I don't know, talk about it.

1178
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:38,480
Not that anyone who was getting mad at you was like in the wrong for getting mad at you.

1179
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,480
But like, there's a, I don't know.

1180
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:47,480
I feel like there's more than just a don't draw Usopp conclusion to this.

1181
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,480
The original post.

1182
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:57,480
I mean, the original post went even further and said like, don't even draw like Japanese characters with lips like that.

1183
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:05,480
Because it's like still based in the same like depiction, which I mean, I don't know if that's true or not.

1184
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,480
I don't know the history there.

1185
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,480
And then they also said like, but it's okay if the character isn't human.

1186
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,480
And then they showed like Feebas, the Pokemon who has big lips.

1187
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,480
Yeah.

1188
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:23,480
I was a little confused about that because like drawing lips that have a like an outline.

1189
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:31,480
I think the understandable way to describe it is like a lips that have a consistently thick outline all the way around.

1190
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:38,480
Like they're not like, they're very cartoony and not realistic because lips have like a in the middle.

1191
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,480
They're the thickest and the edges that thinner.

1192
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:49,480
Like that doesn't necessarily have to come from a racist black character caricature place.

1193
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,480
Just because that did exist.

1194
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:58,480
Like not everybody who draws the that lip on like a Pokemon necessarily thinks of that as the way to draw things.

1195
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:06,480
You know, it's like maybe it's it's more complex, but like I totally respect anyone who just doesn't like looking at that.

1196
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,480
It makes me it makes me sad.

1197
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:17,480
It probably makes lots of people sad that like Usopp has this like his depiction has this kind of like sort of connotation to him.

1198
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,480
Like that's a real that's a real drag.

1199
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,480
Yeah.

1200
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,480
I don't like it.

1201
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,480
Yeah.

1202
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:31,480
Oh, it makes me want to just makes me want to just makes you want to do a colonialism.

1203
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,480
Real bad.

1204
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:36,480
Just like a lot of realism.

1205
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,480
You should finish.

1206
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,480
Psychologials.

1207
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,480
I want to talk about Psychologials.

1208
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,480
Yeah.

1209
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,480
I'll get put up.

1210
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,480
I don't know if I have that much to say about it.

1211
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:55,480
Other than just that I like it and I'm looking forward to more of it and I'm not sure where the story is going.

1212
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:08,480
There are some things that I are funny that I would like to point out with interest and go haha did you notice this later.

1213
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,480
But I don't know your own chapter one I think it gets pretty cool from there.

1214
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:23,480
I was I mean I was already into it by chapter one at the end I was like end of chapter one I was like oh I didn't expect to go here.

1215
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,480
But it did.

1216
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:40,480
I've told people that I'm reading it and I get a lot of a lot of skeptical replies that are like oh how's he thinks he's going to tell a story now after what he did I don't think so.

1217
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,480
You're like oh there's no way that how's he can keep up with a release schedule.

1218
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:51,480
And I'm like I said that you weren't the only one though you weren't the only one.

1219
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,480
But I think I think he can.

1220
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,480
I think he can do it.

1221
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:02,480
Well definitely now seeing it being like oh this is just like like very low key like.

1222
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,480
Like I feel like he probably put together the entire thing himself aside from the music.

1223
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,480
Yeah.

1224
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:13,480
Like coding it and everything because it's very simple looking very simple feeling.

1225
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,480
Yeah.

1226
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,480
But it's it's writing and he's good at that.

1227
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,480
Yeah.

1228
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:31,480
Oh you know one thing one thing about it that I noticed is that Z is she looks like punk because she wears a purple dress and she has black hair.

1229
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,480
And she does look a lot like punk actually.

1230
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
Yeah.

1231
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:43,480
She I feel like this is this is like maybe it was definitely an irrational thing because it doesn't matter at all really.

1232
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:50,480
But every time somebody has a character design that is even similar to one of mine that I've already made.

1233
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,480
I'm like shit.

1234
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:56,480
I call my lawyer I get my lawyer on the phone and I say how much can we squeeze them for.

1235
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:04,480
It's not it's not that sort of angle it's like shit I've I've I've sat on this character design for too long I didn't become famous yet.

1236
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:12,480
Now people are going to think they came up with that idea first and I'm a copycat they're going to think that I'm copying this Z character.

1237
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,480
You.

1238
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,480
Okay.

1239
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,480
All right.

1240
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,480
Here's what you do.

1241
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,480
Here's what you do.

1242
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,480
You get screenshots.

1243
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,480
You get receipts.

1244
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,480
Right.

1245
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:27,480
You show like oh I posted I posted bail jpe in you know summer of 2019 or whatever it was.

1246
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,480
A year.

1247
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,480
17.

1248
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,480
It was a while ago.

1249
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,480
Maybe actually no no.

1250
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,480
2018 probably.

1251
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,480
So it's like I posted it before.

1252
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,480
And you know.

1253
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:44,480
Cycloneos is clearly just a bail jpe rip off and I want my fucking royalties.

1254
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,480
It's it's like I don't know.

1255
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:57,480
It's not that it's worth like bringing up but if any people see see this first and then find like if I don't know bail jpe gets big.

1256
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,480
I use punk again.

1257
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:08,480
Then they'll be like this reminds me of that thing and I will have to be like either explain like actually I could have thought of it first.

1258
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,480
I thought of purple.

1259
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:14,480
I thought of putting I thought of putting a girl in a purple shirt first actually so.

1260
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:18,480
It was a purple dress with like black tights which punk has.

1261
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,480
It's the case.

1262
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,480
It just is the case.

1263
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:28,480
They're going to say you just are.

1264
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:36,480
I had a girl in purple back in 2018.

1265
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,480
You're insane.

1266
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,480
You're crazy.

1267
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:43,480
You don't you can't you can't remember the past.

1268
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,480
Let me gaslight you over it now.

1269
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,480
There was never there was never a girl with a pumpkin head.

1270
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,480
That's ridiculous.

1271
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,480
Like who would even I don't remember any such thing.

1272
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,480
You imagined all that.

1273
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:54,480
No.

1274
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,480
I made bail jpe.

1275
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,480
No.

1276
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,480
And then and then you post that one fan art you did.

1277
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,480
Yeah.

1278
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,480
And I was like this came out like years before you were born.

1279
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:11,480
I was like no this can't be the truth.

1280
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,480
But yet it is.

1281
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,480
Okay.

1282
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:22,480
Next voice mail is called your name is spades slick three two one go.

1283
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,480
I hate to moral coward one who lacks a manly spark.

1284
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,480
I just detest a man afraid to go home in the dark.

1285
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,480
I always spend my evening where there's women wine and song.

1286
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,480
But like a man I always bring my little wife along.

1287
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:42,480
I'm a member of the midnight crew.

1288
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:48,480
I'm a night out and a wise bird to home with the milk in the

1289
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,480
morning singing the same old song.

1290
01:20:54,480 --> 01:21:01,480
With the sun early to bed and you miss all the fun.

1291
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:05,480
Bring your wife and trouble it will never trouble you.

1292
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,480
Make her a member of the midnight crew.

1293
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,480
Thanks for the voicemail.

1294
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,480
I like that.

1295
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,480
I've never been singing it though.

1296
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,480
Eleazar make those all line up so it doesn't sound like shit.

1297
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,480
Thank you.

1298
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,480
Please.

1299
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:30,480
Next one is called Lou three two one go.

1300
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,480
In my talents I shaped me.

1301
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,480
Fucking him as I.

1302
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,480
Around me is a burgeoning empire of silicone.

1303
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,480
For my phone lines have come Korean into the skies of her.

1304
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:49,480
My winds will become lightning bolts that devastate me.

1305
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:56,480
Out of the chaos he will run and whimper praying for me to end his.

1306
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,480
Anarcho capitalism.

1307
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,480
I'm drunk with this vision made me fucker.

1308
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:08,480
The title suits me well.

1309
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,480
Yeah.

1310
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,480
Nice.

1311
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:15,480
There should be an earthbound about the Nate fuckers.

1312
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,480
Like.

1313
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:24,480
Like you play as a group of four Nate fuckers on your way from region to region to fuck every Nate.

1314
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,480
No, no, no.

1315
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:31,480
You play as a group of Nates and the Nate fuckers are all the enemies.

1316
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,480
Yeah.

1317
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,480
Yeah.

1318
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,480
Okay.

1319
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,480
All right.

1320
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,480
I feel you.

1321
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,480
I feel you.

1322
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,480
It's like Yoshi's.

1323
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:43,480
Yoshi's Island with all the Yoshi's, but there's just Nates instead.

1324
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:49,480
What's the Nintendo 60 like Yoshi's story where you can lose the Yoshi's and you can't get them back?

1325
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,480
Yeah.

1326
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:54,480
The one where you collect fruit and it goes in like the border all around the screen.

1327
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,480
Yeah.

1328
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,480
It'll be like that except when you lose a Nate, the Nate gets fucked.

1329
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,480
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,480
Oh, yeah.

1331
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,480
So really just want to lose all the Nates as fast as possible.

1332
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,480
That's how I thought you won.

1333
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,480
Next voicemail is called meaningfully content.

1334
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,480
Three, two, one, go.

1335
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,480
Okay.

1336
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,480
So I've...

1337
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,480
Voice Grail.

1338
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,480
Voice Grail.

1339
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,480
Wait.

1340
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,480
He can't voice grail something just because it was surprisingly terrible.

1341
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,480
He fucked it up so bad.

1342
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,480
Okay.

1343
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,480
Okay.

1344
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,480
Okay.

1345
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,480
Okay.

1346
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,480
Next one is called name my...

1347
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,480
Name my poo poo fart noise.

1348
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,480
Okay.

1349
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,480
Three, two, one, go.

1350
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,480
Hello.

1351
01:23:54,480 --> 01:24:04,480
Regarding Golden Witch's new name, I got to say Digi rolled up the tongue really well because it was like a nice little two syllable thing.

1352
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:15,480
And while just mumbling the name, my brain came up with G Witch.

1353
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,480
G-Wee.

1354
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,480
G-Wee.

1355
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:23,480
Doesn't that sound like a lot more...

1356
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:31,480
I mean, she's got Trixie for the short and sweet way to say it.

1357
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,480
We've been saying Trixie.

1358
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:41,480
Like, I mean, yeah, if she'd always been Trixie and she changed her name to Digi, you'd say, oh, but Trixie just rolls off the tongue more.

1359
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,480
Oh, this new name is so awkward.

1360
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,480
G-Wee.

1361
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,480
No, I'm sorry.

1362
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:52,480
No, it was a good try, but in the trash.

1363
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,480
Yeah.

1364
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,480
Trixie or Bee.

1365
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
I don't...

1366
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,480
Those are easy to say.

1367
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,480
Beatrice Bee.

1368
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,480
Yeah, they're fine.

1369
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,480
Yeah, they're fine.

1370
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,480
Okay.

1371
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,480
Next one is called League of Blankfuckers, Incorporated.

1372
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,480
What could it be?

1373
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,480
Three, two, one, go.

1374
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:20,480
Please, please, please suck my dick.

1375
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,480
Okay, I will.

1376
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,480
You know what?

1377
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,480
I fucking will.

1378
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,480
Yeah, it doesn't say Nate, and there's only three S tricks.

1379
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,480
It could be Benfuckers.

1380
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,480
Oh, they're...

1381
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,480
Oh my God, you're right.

1382
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,480
There is three Asterisks.

1383
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,480
No, there can't be.

1384
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,480
There can't be another League.

1385
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,480
That's too fucked.

1386
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,480
There's only room for one League of Fuckers in this town.

1387
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,480
The Rowdy Fuckers.

1388
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,480
That's right, the Rowdy Fuckers.

1389
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:56,480
The next voicemail is from youtube.com slash user slash DG Valentine, who...

1390
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,480
I don't know who that is.

1391
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,480
Three, two, one, go.

1392
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:04,480
No, that the era basically is over.

1393
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:10,480
I've been wanting to ask about DG slash Trixie, sorry.

1394
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,480
Yeah.

1395
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,480
What did the...

1396
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,480
Did you ever heard of DG Valentine?

1397
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,480
And he has a YouTube channel.

1398
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,480
He also did like video games and anime and whatever.

1399
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,480
You heard of him?

1400
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,480
No, never.

1401
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,480
Okay, I'll go kill myself now.

1402
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,480
Okay.

1403
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,480
Okay.

1404
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:36,480
I have started up a video.

1405
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:41,480
Okay, talking about nights into dreams.

1406
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,480
Looks like the last upload was like five months ago.

1407
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,480
So this is a real Nate.

1408
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:54,480
This is a real Nate style YouTuber you might say doesn't upload.

1409
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,480
No, I don't know.

1410
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,480
Whatever, similar names.

1411
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,480
Haha.

1412
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,480
Okay.

1413
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,480
Next voicemail is called Mingus...

1414
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,480
Mingus Sweepgus.

1415
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,480
Three, two, one, go.

1416
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,480
Hello and welcome to video games.

1417
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,480
I have one million hours in mind.

1418
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,480
I've played it all throughout university.

1419
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,480
My first shitty job and my second slightly better job.

1420
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,480
90 to 98% of the time.

1421
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,480
The game gives you perfect information to progress unhindered.

1422
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:28,480
It's just a game of attention span and slight logic work.

1423
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,480
Each number represents the amount of minds around it.

1424
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,480
Nothing more, nothing less.

1425
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,480
I'm going to boot up a game right now.

1426
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,480
It was very cringy to hear you talk without authority and criticise.

1427
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
I admitted it.

1428
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,480
I said this as much last episode.

1429
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,480
There will be moments where you're forced to do a 50% shot,

1430
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,480
but it's a minority of the time in the long run.

1431
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,480
Those are versions of the game that eliminate that entirely.

1432
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,480
My personal favourite version is the one on mobile phones called Polish Minesweeper.

1433
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:57,480
It's icon is a nice little slick mine on a soft black background.

1434
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:01,480
It's got satisfying animation and that's nice. Goodbye.

1435
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,480
Does it have ads though?

1436
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,480
I don't like mobile apps that are free that have ads.

1437
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,480
I delete them immediately when as soon as I see an ad.

1438
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:16,480
Oh god, I just started up a game and I don't want to play it.

1439
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,480
Oh god, I hit a mine.

1440
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:24,480
Why would you play this game if you just leave hitting mines?

1441
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,480
We should definitely do that thing.

1442
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,480
I can't remember.

1443
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:33,480
Like a Minesweeper race or competition to see who can...

1444
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,480
Oh bonus episode?

1445
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,480
Yeah, that was the bonus episode idea.

1446
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,480
You're right. We should.

1447
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,480
How do we know who wins? What are the rules?

1448
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:53,480
We'll play Minesweeper and whoever wins is a base and whoever loses is cream.

1449
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,480
Okay.

1450
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,480
It scores you, right?

1451
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,480
Like, yeah.

1452
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:01,480
Oh no, there's a timer.

1453
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:06,480
Yeah, like how fast you can do it and then how correctly you do it, I guess.

1454
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:13,480
I feel like it should keep track of how many spaces you clear

1455
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,480
because the winner should be the one who clears the most spaces before dying, right?

1456
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:18,480
That seems...

1457
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:23,480
Maybe. I haven't looked into it, but we should definitely do something like that.

1458
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:30,480
But it doesn't say... it doesn't keep track of that.

1459
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:34,480
It seems like the easiest way to judge who's the best Minesweeper.

1460
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,480
Yeah, we should do that.

1461
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:40,480
Okay, next one is called Trixie.

1462
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:44,480
Hey, by the way, I want to say Persona 5 is great.

1463
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,480
Three, two, one, go.

1464
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,480
Lol.

1465
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,480
Is he like running away from a dog?

1466
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,480
I don't know, maybe.

1467
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,480
Whispering like running away from a dog.

1468
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,480
Okay.

1469
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,480
It's too late. It's too late.

1470
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,480
The videos are private. The views are gone.

1471
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,480
Comments are gone.

1472
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,480
It's all been said in motion.

1473
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,480
Next voicemail.

1474
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,480
I'll email you my suicide note after.

1475
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,480
Three, two, one, go.

1476
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,480
Hello, my name is Jebediah Brickinson.

1477
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:39,480
I will kill myself if BGNA slash Trixie will remove her channel.

1478
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,480
Goodbye.

1479
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,480
Well, I mean, the channel's still there.

1480
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,480
It's just called something different.

1481
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,480
Yeah, sorry.

1482
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,480
And the videos are gone.

1483
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,480
You can't do it on a technical...

1484
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,480
Sorry, you technically can't kill yourself.

1485
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,480
Whoops.

1486
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,480
Next voicemail is called Knock Knock Joke.

1487
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,480
Please play along.

1488
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,480
Okay.

1489
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,480
Three, two, one, go.

1490
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:06,480
Hey.

1491
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,480
Okay.

1492
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,480
So you saw the name of the voicemail.

1493
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,480
I'm going to tell a knock-knock joke.

1494
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,480
And old boys for you guys to respond.

1495
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:19,480
And it's going to be really cool because it's going to sound seamless-ish.

1496
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,480
And it's all going to come together.

1497
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,480
And it's going to be really good.

1498
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,480
Knock knock.

1499
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,480
Who's there?

1500
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,480
Who's there?

1501
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,480
Sam.

1502
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,480
Sam who?

1503
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,480
Konnichiwa.

1504
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,480
Samurai.

1505
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,480
Faka-yu.

1506
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,480
Meno-shintou-san.

1507
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,480
Samurai-6.

1508
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,480
Beno-san-0.

1509
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,480
Faka-yu.

1510
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,480
Okay.

1511
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,480
Until next time.

1512
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,480
Sayonara.

1513
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:59,480
I, well, I've been, I've been got, I've got that one.

1514
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:05,480
Oh no, the tricky, tricky Samurai has...

1515
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:13,480
The war, the war continues and the weapons only get more technologically advanced.

1516
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,480
Yeah.

1517
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,480
Devious even.

1518
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,480
Next one is called Bill.

1519
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:22,480
Three, two, one, go.

1520
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,480
Based, based on what?

1521
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,480
Yeah.

1522
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:31,480
Nice.

1523
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,480
Based on, on like science, you know, like acids and bases.

1524
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:40,480
Based in reality.

1525
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,480
Oops, there goes gravity.

1526
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,480
Based on alkaline.

1527
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,480
Won't not get mad at you.

1528
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:56,480
The liquids and the test tubes and the phosphorus pipettes and titrations.

1529
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,480
Yeah.

1530
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:02,480
Next voicemail is called Hey Quick Question.

1531
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,480
Three, two, one, go.

1532
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:09,480
Hey, so I barely graduated high school because of my math grade.

1533
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,480
I became a custodian about three years ago.

1534
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,480
I cleaned toilets at a fucking elementary school.

1535
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:20,480
I work 12 hours shifts regularly to keep up with bills and other payments.

1536
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,480
Sure.

1537
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,480
I don't know how I will ever move out of my parents' house.

1538
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,480
I want to make comics, but I'm not going to drawing yet.

1539
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,480
I have very little free time.

1540
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:38,480
I have a turn to edibles and alcohol as a form of escapism.

1541
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,480
Am I missing something?

1542
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,480
Or do you think this is my lot in life?

1543
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,480
Thanks.

1544
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,480
Why do you have bills if you live with your parents?

1545
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,480
Maybe they're asking for rent.

1546
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,480
I guess so, sure.

1547
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,480
I mean, you sound young, so I wouldn't say that's it.

1548
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:05,480
And if you have an idea to, you want to make comics, it'll just be a matter of time.

1549
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,480
If you put the time in to learn how to draw.

1550
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:16,480
Yeah, I mean, that's what I would start doing if that's what you want to do.

1551
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:22,480
I mean, I hope you're practicing if you're thinking of doing something like that.

1552
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:32,480
The definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.

1553
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,480
I don't know, man.

1554
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:41,480
I can't tell you what's going to do it for you, but you got to try mixing your life up in various ways.

1555
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:47,480
And just see what happens until something sticks that is maybe a little better than what you got going on right now.

1556
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:51,480
Sorry, I can't be any more specific than that.

1557
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,480
Everyone's journey is their own.

1558
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,480
Everyone's journey.

1559
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:01,480
If you don't have a lot of time, you don't have no time.

1560
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:06,480
So you should just allocate time to the practicing.

1561
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:13,480
And over time, you will get to a point where you can maybe make comics.

1562
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:18,480
It really is like, you know, the pathway is always the same.

1563
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:22,480
It's just like difficult depending on your situation.

1564
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:30,480
And if you have no time to do it, it's more difficult than if you did it when you were at school, but you can still do it.

1565
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:41,480
In the meantime, try and, I don't know, I'm surprised that you have to work 12 hour days to pay your bills while living with your parents.

1566
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:47,480
I don't know, maybe you could find like a roommate situation that would be cheaper and then you could have more free time.

1567
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,480
I don't know.

1568
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:55,480
Think about how to keep costs down so that you can get away with doing less labor.

1569
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:00,480
Maybe you already, maybe, maybe you already did that.

1570
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,480
But if you haven't thought about it, I'm sure you have.

1571
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:04,480
Never mind.

1572
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,480
Fuck.

1573
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,480
No.

1574
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,480
And no, actually, you know what?

1575
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,480
Give up.

1576
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:10,480
No, just give up.

1577
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,480
That's that's what I would say.

1578
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,480
Okay.

1579
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:20,480
Next one is called Oreno Sad Stonks Monogatari.

1580
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,480
Three, two, one, go.

1581
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:28,480
Since we're all still talking about our stupid stock stories, I guess I'll talk about my own.

1582
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,480
Please.

1583
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:39,480
A couple of years back, I started investing in this company called Billy Billy, which is the parent company that owns a game called Azure Lane, which is basically just another mobile fap game.

1584
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:44,480
And I wanted to invest because I knew they were going to make gangbusters someday.

1585
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:49,480
But then I saw some others thought called Aurora cannabis and they were really cheap.

1586
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:52,480
So I was like, yeah, let's let's put my money in there instead.

1587
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,480
And so you can guess what happened.

1588
01:36:54,480 --> 01:37:00,480
Billy Billy is now like 120 something dollars last I checked when it was like 17.

1589
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:06,480
I was going to go in and meanwhile my weed money is just floundering and not doing anything.

1590
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,480
So stocks are fucking stupid.

1591
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,480
Just don't do it.

1592
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,480
Why did you change course so much?

1593
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,480
You could have diversified instead.

1594
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,480
You you went all the way in on someone else.

1595
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,480
I guess maybe you didn't have a lot of money to throw around.

1596
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,480
Yeah.

1597
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,480
Yeah, like buying.

1598
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:32,480
If you keep if you keep buying and selling, like you're more likely to come out behind because like.

1599
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:36,480
Like every transaction has fees associated with it.

1600
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:40,480
Like, you're more likely to do well buying and holding.

1601
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:50,480
I mean, unless the stock you've got is just like, you're sure that it's going to tank and then sell sell sell sell.

1602
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:55,480
This from this reminds me the talking about the FAP games reminds me.

1603
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:59,480
Did you see, do you know Grums?

1604
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,480
Nope.

1605
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:06,480
Grums is a guy I I guess he worked on World of Warcraft.

1606
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:14,480
I don't know what his deal is, but I see him on Twitter every now and then saying some really stupid shit about the culture war.

1607
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:24,480
And this week he made a tweet that was like, you could never sell you could never sell Conker's bad for a day today.

1608
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,480
Like they just it couldn't make it today.

1609
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:35,480
Totally oblivious to the fact that literally you can buy it right now.

1610
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,480
And I hate it.

1611
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:43,480
You couldn't sell that today because nobody plays platform games.

1612
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:48,480
I mean, people bought ukulele.

1613
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,480
Well, not that many people.

1614
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,480
It was a Kickstarter hype thing.

1615
01:38:52,480 --> 01:39:00,480
And then oh, I just looked again and now two hours ago he tweets three days later and people are still upset at me for making a video game tweet.

1616
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,480
Get over it.

1617
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:03,480
I fucking hate this guy.

1618
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:07,480
I fucking hate him so much.

1619
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,480
You should just admit you were wrong.

1620
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:11,480
You said a thing and it was wrong.

1621
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:15,480
And you come back and you're like, huh, people are mad at me because I said something that was wrong.

1622
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,480
Get over it.

1623
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:20,480
I hate you.

1624
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,480
I fucking hate people like this.

1625
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,480
What a piece of shit.

1626
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,480
Oh my God.

1627
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:28,480
I don't know, but like, I don't know.

1628
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:33,480
A lot of people commented like, you can like, what do you mean you couldn't sell Conker's bad for a day?

1629
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,480
You can you can buy porn.

1630
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,480
You can buy porn games on steam.

1631
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:40,480
Like shit hasn't been censored.

1632
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,480
It just hasn't.

1633
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,480
I don't know.

1634
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:44,480
Yeah.

1635
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,480
I don't know.

1636
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,480
I don't get it.

1637
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,480
I should stop looking at Twitter.

1638
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:55,480
I've probably said that every week for like two years now.

1639
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,480
But maybe this week I'll do it.

1640
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:00,480
Maybe this week I'll finally quit looking at Twitter.

1641
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:05,480
Maybe you could make maybe you could make like a stupid game of it and see like every week.

1642
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:09,480
We'll check in on Ben saying see if you've been on Twitter.

1643
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:14,480
There'll be a corner of the show has been saying tweeted.

1644
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,480
Has he been on that Twitter?

1645
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:23,480
If you see me tweeting or liking on Twitter, send a voicemail saying.

1646
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:28,480
Fuck you saying, oh, you fucked up saying, oh, you're an idiot.

1647
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,480
Don't actually do that.

1648
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:34,480
That would be really annoying.

1649
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:35,480
Okay.

1650
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,480
Next voicemail is called hi Ben.

1651
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:40,480
Three, two, one, go.

1652
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:45,480
We need to get Nate to go into Trixie's computer.

1653
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:49,480
Hack it with his elite programming skills.

1654
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:53,480
That baby release the lecture.

1655
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,480
I agree.

1656
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,480
I agree.

1657
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,480
Nate should go on a fucking secret mission.

1658
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,480
Nate should go on a matrix.

1659
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,480
You should get the he's got the sunglasses.

1660
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,480
He just needs the trench coat.

1661
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:10,480
Nate should send Michelle in as a secret operative to distract the residents of the Trixie house.

1662
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:26,480
And then sneak in behind the scenes and extract the data on a disk drive and upload it into directly into the main frame is what I think is what I think should happen in my opinion.

1663
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:32,480
Next voicemail is called hi Ben two, three, two, one, go.

1664
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:37,480
Also is Davoo still alive?

1665
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,480
Yeah, Davoo's still alive.

1666
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,480
Yeah.

1667
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:45,480
Do you not follow her on Twitter or davoo.com?

1668
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,480
She has a website.

1669
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,480
Yeah.

1670
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,480
She's had one for years.

1671
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:54,480
She's been making posts on it occasionally about her games and stuff.

1672
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,480
I think she made, yeah, she did.

1673
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,480
She made a video game instead of a vlog.

1674
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,480
It was like a blog.

1675
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:08,480
She called it, which is an update, but in the form of a interactive experience.

1676
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:12,480
So if you want to know what Davoo's going on about, check that out.

1677
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,480
This is not.

1678
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,480
I don't think it's Davoo.com.

1679
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:24,480
Okay, there is a website called Davoo.com and it is a game developers website, but it's like definitely not.

1680
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:28,480
Yeah, I remember typing Davoo.com and getting that.

1681
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,480
I was confused.

1682
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,480
Whatever it's the Davoo.com.

1683
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,480
Yeah, this is it.

1684
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:44,480
Last updated February 9th.

1685
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,480
Okay.

1686
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:51,480
Yeah, I didn't know what they were working on.

1687
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,480
I guess they're making a new game.

1688
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:55,480
That's kind of cool.

1689
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:59,480
The last one, did you play the one that was like a little puzzler?

1690
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,480
I did.

1691
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:01,480
Yeah.

1692
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,480
That was pretty good.

1693
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,480
That was a purple one.

1694
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,480
Yeah, it was pretty good.

1695
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:06,480
It's pretty short.

1696
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,480
Hex game.

1697
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:10,480
Yeah, that was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1698
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,480
Oh, Chamber of Hex.

1699
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:12,480
Chamber of Hex.

1700
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,480
Hex game is completely different.

1701
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,480
Autonomous was really good.

1702
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:20,480
Chamber of Hex was fine, small.

1703
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,480
I'm okay.

1704
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:30,480
I guess the new game is called Chiro?

1705
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,480
Chiro?

1706
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:36,480
It looks like another walk around.

1707
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:41,480
I don't know what genre you would call adventure game.

1708
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,480
Wait, what are you?

1709
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,480
Where are you looking?

1710
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,480
I'm looking at thedivu.com.

1711
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,480
Oh, yeah.

1712
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,480
Finally, I asked the game Chiro, Chiro.

1713
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,480
I've been working on.

1714
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:51,480
Did it.

1715
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,480
Played a trailer.

1716
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,480
Oh, yeah.

1717
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:54,480
It's called something.

1718
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,480
No, wait.

1719
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:58,480
Something stuff about the game is called something city.

1720
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,480
Oh, this is Chamber of Hex.

1721
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,480
It's going to be top down adventure game.

1722
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:08,480
You must explore two realms one peaceful realm of colorful losers and another dangerous realm of chaos and madness.

1723
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,480
Why does this look so awesome?

1724
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:13,480
I love it.

1725
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,480
I like the vu style.

1726
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:17,480
Yeah, me too.

1727
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:24,480
I've always liked the funny little drawings she would put in Digi's videos.

1728
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,480
Yeah.

1729
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:31,480
Hang out in my house, Glog number one.

1730
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:38,480
Free to download on itch.io at thedivu.itch.io slash Glog dash one.

1731
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,480
Okay.

1732
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:44,480
Well, I won't watch any more of that right now.

1733
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,480
I might check that out later.

1734
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:50,480
Next voicemail is from Ritsu Zizix.

1735
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:53,480
Three, two, one, go.

1736
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,480
Hey, PCP.

1737
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:05,480
I wanted to know your guys's thoughts about NFT and crypto art, because you've been talking a lot about Bitcoin and Ethereum and stuff.

1738
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:09,480
And NFTs have been really big lately.

1739
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,480
So what do you think?

1740
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,480
Will you sell any?

1741
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:16,480
Thanks.

1742
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:32,480
Those are, as far as I know, NFT non fungible token and crypto art is it's like a token that is a token of authenticity.

1743
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:35,480
It's the only one of these that can exist.

1744
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:42,480
And they are assigned to things to give them a seal of this is the image.

1745
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:45,480
And if you copy paste it will not have this token.

1746
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:51,480
So if you want the genuine article, then you have to buy it from me.

1747
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,480
You can't copy paste it.

1748
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,480
I think that's the idea.

1749
01:45:55,480 --> 01:46:02,480
And people are making a lot of money selling things art, I guess.

1750
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,480
But an image is just data.

1751
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,480
Can't you just copy the data?

1752
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,480
Well, I don't know.

1753
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:14,480
I think the token doesn't allow for you to just copy it.

1754
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:18,480
That's why it's like that.

1755
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,480
Okay.

1756
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:21,480
Some sort of technical wizardry.

1757
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,480
I'm just saying.

1758
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:37,480
I mean, I can kind of understand how you could make a token that is linked to something like an image say that is, you know, non fungible, I guess.

1759
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:45,480
But like if it's linked to an image, like to display an image, the computer has to be able to access its data.

1760
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:50,480
And therefore that data could be copied.

1761
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:55,480
So I don't know, it just seems like a stupid gimmick.

1762
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:58,480
It is a stupid gimmick.

1763
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:05,480
Like you could absolutely just copy whatever it is and you could display it and it would look exactly the same.

1764
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:09,480
But if somebody checked the metadata for that thing, it would not have the token.

1765
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,480
It wouldn't be fungible.

1766
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,480
Yeah, yeah.

1767
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,480
Awful.

1768
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:16,480
I think it's just terrible.

1769
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:24,480
I don't know about, I've been hearing that crypto, I guess, is really terrible for the environment.

1770
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:33,480
And I guess it's because like the mining process now is complicated enough that mining a new Bitcoin takes like astronomical amounts of energy.

1771
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,480
Yeah.

1772
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,480
In computing power.

1773
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,480
I've heard that as well.

1774
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:45,480
And so this, I don't know whether this, like, I guess it must, if it's making people upset about that.

1775
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:56,480
It must be generating additional, like aside from cryptocurrency, it will be creating additional waste of energy just to make this stuff, these tokens.

1776
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,480
I guess so.

1777
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,480
I guess so.

1778
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:02,480
So yeah, I despise it.

1779
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,480
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

1780
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:14,480
And if it's bad for the environment, then there's all the more reason to not like entertain anyone who has these things.

1781
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,480
But people are stupid.

1782
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:20,480
So that is not a surprise that is making money.

1783
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,480
Okay.

1784
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:25,480
But I mean, crypto would be okay for the environment.

1785
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:30,480
It's just that our sources of energy are bad for the environment, right?

1786
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:37,480
Like it's because we rely, it's that we rely on like non replenishable like fossil fuel that makes it bad.

1787
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:38,480
Yeah.

1788
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:43,480
Screen house guesses are the end result bad reason for using energy.

1789
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:44,480
Yeah.

1790
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:50,480
But yeah, we're not at a stage where we're totally carbon neutral.

1791
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,480
Yeah.

1792
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:59,480
But if we were carbon neutral, then crypto wouldn't be any worse for the environment than anything else, I think.

1793
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:00,480
No.

1794
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:10,480
Like if we could just harness the power of the sun, like we could put a cryptocurrency machine on the sun just uses the heat energy of that somehow.

1795
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,480
Dyson sphere.

1796
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,480
Yeah.

1797
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,480
Hell yeah.

1798
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:18,480
Just get the bitcoins sent through space to us.

1799
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,480
That would be the day.

1800
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:24,480
Imagine all the bitcoins we could mine if we could harness the sun.

1801
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:30,480
Harnessing the sun and all you do with it is just mine bitcoins.

1802
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:44,480
You put like solar panels all the way around the sun encasing it completely blocking out the energy for everyone else and light and everything and the entire solar systems becomes dark.

1803
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,480
But you're rich.

1804
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,480
Nice.

1805
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,480
I mean, that's that's what it's all about, right?

1806
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:55,480
That's that's what I'm in it for.

1807
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,480
Oh, someone just told me.

1808
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:03,480
Someone just told me to stop being racist on Twitter.

1809
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:06,480
But it wasn't in response to that other thing.

1810
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,480
What else did you do?

1811
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:21,480
It was because someone was complaining that it's a what the fuck it's someone said that it's gross to call.

1812
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:29,480
It's gross to call Senator cinema a bitch just because she voted against the minimum wage.

1813
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:31,480
And I called them a piss rag.

1814
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:34,480
I called them a sopping wet piss rag.

1815
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:38,480
And then someone replied to me to say stop being racist.

1816
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:42,480
Which, you know what?

1817
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:48,480
I don't I don't know if I can take this person entirely seriously.

1818
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,480
Lol, because that was a white person.

1819
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:53,480
That was a fucking white person that I call the piss rag.

1820
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,480
So I'm good.

1821
01:50:54,480 --> 01:51:00,480
I'm solid based.

1822
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:04,480
Next voicemail is called there is a spider in my rectum.

1823
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,480
Hee hee.

1824
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:08,480
Three, two, one, go.

1825
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:12,480
Previously on the procrastinators podcast.

1826
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,480
Fuck you.

1827
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,480
Ben no sentosa.

1828
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:21,480
And now it's really conclusion.

1829
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,480
Fuck you.

1830
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:25,480
Ben no sentosa.

1831
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:28,480
Okay, until next time.

1832
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:29,480
Sayonara.

1833
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:31,480
Thank you.

1834
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:33,480
Wow.

1835
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:34,480
Wow.

1836
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,480
True.

1837
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,480
True.

1838
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:38,480
Sad but true.

1839
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:41,480
Next one is called sincere engineer.

1840
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:44,480
Three, two, one, go.

1841
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:49,480
Hey, if you like girl emo music.

1842
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:52,480
Check out the band sincere engineer.

1843
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,480
They're pretty new and super cool.

1844
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:57,480
Okay, I will.

1845
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:59,480
Okay.

1846
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:03,480
Wait, I'm going to Google them.

1847
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:04,480
Oh, no, they're cringe.

1848
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:05,480
Sorry.

1849
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:06,480
What?

1850
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,480
How'd you know?

1851
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:14,480
No, I, if you, if you don't know, then I can't explain it to you.

1852
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:15,480
I'm sorry.

1853
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:20,480
I went on on Spotify to look them up.

1854
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:26,480
Oh, so if you saw an image, I didn't see it.

1855
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:33,480
I see some images of a girl who I guess is the band.

1856
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,480
So there we go.

1857
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,480
Cringe though.

1858
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,480
Cringe though.

1859
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:41,480
Should I reply to this guy?

1860
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:45,480
She's got a Dave Grohl smile.

1861
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,480
Dave Grohl?

1862
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,480
I don't know why.

1863
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:55,480
Something about that cheek combination makes me, reminds me of Dave Grohl smiling.

1864
01:52:55,480 --> 01:53:02,480
I kind of see it a little bit.

1865
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:12,480
Should I, is it worth responding to this guy with a bunch of question marks?

1866
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,480
I'm going to do it.

1867
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,480
This guy told me to stop being racist.

1868
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,480
I'm going to do it.

1869
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:18,480
I'm engaging.

1870
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,480
I'm going to give him six question marks in a row.

1871
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,480
Oh my God.

1872
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,480
There we go.

1873
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,480
Yeah.

1874
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,480
Deal with it.

1875
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:27,480
How could you do something so controversial yet so brave?

1876
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:28,480
Deal with it.

1877
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:33,480
Good sucker.

1878
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,480
Okay.

1879
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:36,480
Very based.

1880
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,480
Next voicemail.

1881
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,480
Okay.

1882
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,480
Error Array.

1883
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:44,480
Bear and the Cluster Punk Orchestra present.

1884
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,480
Hashtag rip RIPCP.

1885
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,480
Three, two, one, go.

1886
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:25,480
I am supposed to be drowning right now.

1887
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:26,480
I forget.

1888
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,480
Was that like the theme?

1889
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,480
I think I heard the theme in there.

1890
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,480
I guess so.

1891
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:37,480
Did, did we leave off where they were, cyborg was drowning?

1892
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:38,480
I don't, I don't remember.

1893
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,480
Someone give me a refresher.

1894
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:45,480
Someone give me the cliff's notes for the bear versus cyborg saga.

1895
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:51,480
Next one is called Error Array and Bear's Missile Maelstrom Catastrophe.

1896
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:54,480
Three, two, one, go.

1897
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,480
Konichiwa, guys.

1898
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:01,480
I'm supposed to be drowning right now.

1899
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:07,480
But I'm not drowning because I'm floating.

1900
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:11,480
Bear and I are currently stranded at sea.

1901
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:15,480
Someone from the voicemails left us here, Teehee.

1902
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,480
Join us for a PCV mystery.

1903
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:31,480
Because when we find them, it will be a Cluster Punk Missile Maelstrom Monopoly.

1904
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:33,480
Uh, yeah.

1905
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:38,480
Hey, you heard Doft Punk is, is exploded.

1906
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,480
Doft Punk ended.

1907
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:49,480
I heard that, that goodbye video they made was actually, uh, like from something.

1908
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:53,480
Like it wasn't an original Doft Punk.

1909
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:58,480
Like, like it was, it existed before the, the announcement.

1910
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,480
I didn't know that.

1911
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:05,480
I was just saying this guy could probably do the voice of Doft Punk.

1912
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:07,480
He could bring him back.

1913
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:12,480
We could, we could, we could weekend at Bernie's, we could weekend at Bernie's Doft Punk.

1914
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:21,480
If we were dedicated enough, but we're not based.

1915
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:26,480
Next voicemail is called ETFs and index funds.

1916
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:29,480
Three, two, one, go.

1917
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:40,480
So an index fund is just a pool of money that follows an arbitrarily defined index, which can be the S&P 500.

1918
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:41,480
It could be wheat stocks.

1919
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,480
It could be cryptocurrencies.

1920
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,480
It could be just about anything.

1921
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:55,480
So when people tell you to invest in index funds, they usually are telling you to invest in indexed S&P 500 ETFs.

1922
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:59,480
Right. So an ETF is an exchange traded fund.

1923
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:03,480
So that's something you can trade as if it were a stock.

1924
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:04,480
Right.

1925
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:15,480
So, you know, just keep in mind, like you could, you could be a part of like a mutual fund and you could be putting money into your mutual fund and that could just be an S&P 500 index.

1926
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:22,480
That's, that's not good because mutual funds tend to have very high fees relative to ETFs.

1927
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,480
Boring.

1928
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:38,480
So if you want to be like a very conservative long-term investor, you usually just want to make sure you put your money in, in those low fee ETFs since they're going to give you the best long-term rate of return if you're just like a passive investor.

1929
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:45,480
It sounds like this doesn't even have any like, any like non-fungible tokens attached to it.

1930
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:48,480
Yeah, where's the funny coin at?

1931
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:51,480
Where, where's the silly, where's the silly number?

1932
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:56,480
Where's the memes? Where's the memes at? I can't do it unless there's a meme attached.

1933
01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:02,480
I don't, I don't even want to make profit unless it's, unless it's either funny or edgy.

1934
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:06,480
I don't want to make profit unless it's funny. Okay.

1935
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:13,480
It's like, if, if, if at the end of the day, if I can't laugh about it, then, then, then what was the point?

1936
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:18,480
I say throwing my money into the sea. Yes.

1937
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:31,480
Maybe I'll listen to this again after the show when I don't have to pretend to be too cool for financial information.

1938
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:37,480
Next voicemail is called more like what the fuck bang three, two, one, go.

1939
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:42,480
I know mukbang is a loanword from Korean, but why do we have to keep it in English?

1940
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:48,480
It occupies like the same space in my brain as bukkake. It sounds like a gross porn word.

1941
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:52,480
It's about like eating. It's supposed to be about eating food on the stream.

1942
01:58:52,480 --> 01:59:01,480
Oh, it's cool. But no, it has to have a word that makes me think of like the Pokemon muk and come at the same time.

1943
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:07,480
And it's just gross. Just stop. Why just come say eat food stream.

1944
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:16,480
Um, I don't think of when I think of the word bang, but I can see why you would.

1945
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:22,480
Mukbang definitely sounds dirty in more ways than one.

1946
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:31,480
I agree. I kind of agree. I don't see why we couldn't just have our own word for it. That's like less, I don't know, ugly.

1947
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:36,480
I only recently learned what it was, actually.

1948
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:45,480
I didn't know until I happened to click on the right opinion video about that guy, that one guy who does it.

1949
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:50,480
The never ending nightmare of Nico Avocado, I think.

1950
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:55,480
I don't know. Maybe you've seen that one floating around the recommends.

1951
01:59:55,480 --> 02:00:03,480
The only one, I don't even know if this counts as mukbang, but it's one munchy as posted multiple times because it's really funny.

1952
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:11,480
It's this guy, extremely fat white guy eating a like a sloppily eating like an entire chicken.

1953
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:16,480
That is not mukbang. That's some weird fetish shit.

1954
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:21,480
It's very, very gross and he puts it in rhythm all the time.

1955
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:28,480
Mukbang is like, I mean, people are eating, but it's mostly about talking, right?

1956
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:35,480
It's people talking and eating, either they're talking to each other or they're talking to you or something, almost like an ASMR video, right?

1957
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:39,480
I thought it was mostly about the eating.

1958
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:44,480
I feel, I don't know. I thought that the eating was sort of like incidental.

1959
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:55,480
Maybe you'd show up and it'd be like, hey, I'm going to eat all these tacos or something, but like, yeah, they're eating the tacos, but they're like, it's not just them eating the tacos.

1960
02:00:55,480 --> 02:01:01,480
They're also like engaging you, talking to you, having a conversation or whatever.

1961
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:07,480
Do you mean that the primary thing is just like a feeling like there's a person that you're hanging out with?

1962
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:10,480
Because I feel like that's basically all streaming.

1963
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:11,480
I guess so.

1964
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:22,480
Like, I mean, it seems like the Nico Avocado video made it seem like all of his mukbangs are like, it's him like dishing.

1965
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:28,480
It's him basically dishing the drama about all the other mukbangers.

1966
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:31,480
Mukbangers.

1967
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:35,480
Like, it's like, come for the food, stay for the-

1968
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:36,480
The cum.

1969
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,480
Stay for the cum.

1970
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:43,480
Exactly.

1971
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:45,480
Yeah.

1972
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:49,480
Yeah, it's a weird word. I don't like it either.

1973
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:50,480
Okay.

1974
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:55,480
Next one is, it cut me off at the end, but I made my point also was drunk.

1975
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:57,480
Three, two, one, go.

1976
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:06,480
So I'm here replying to a previous voicemail I heard before regarding how one should measure their recipes.

1977
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:13,480
And while I agree that weighing by mass as opposed to volume is the superior method.

1978
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:14,480
It's going to be more accurate.

1979
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:22,480
A lot of American recipes seem to be piecemealed out via a volume instead of mass.

1980
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,480
Yeah.

1981
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:27,480
Which creates kind of a catch-22 situation, right?

1982
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:35,480
Like, if they are measuring my volume and giving you instructions by volume.

1983
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:39,480
How can you accurately measure by mass?

1984
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:43,480
Most recipes that I find online do measure in volume.

1985
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:45,480
How do you know the volume they have is accurate?

1986
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:48,480
How do you know?

1987
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:51,480
It seems like it's imprecise and dumb.

1988
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:52,480
Okay.

1989
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:57,480
And it's a weird thing that we shouldn't have.

1990
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:06,480
But at the same time, historically, cookbooks aren't like perfect things you just follow.

1991
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:12,480
You know, if you go and you do some research into the cultural context of historic cookbooks,

1992
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:21,480
you'll see that a lot of them were kind of assuming you had a base level ideas and they were to give you inspiration or alternatives or various things.

1993
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:26,480
You know, they weren't expecting you to know everything.

1994
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:28,480
Yeah.

1995
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:35,480
I feel like I've noticed when I look up for a recipe online for something, if it's an American website,

1996
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:38,480
it'll be confusing to me because they say things like cups.

1997
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:40,480
And I don't know what the fuck a cup is.

1998
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:42,480
Do you not use cups?

1999
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:43,480
Well, no.

2000
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:46,480
We use accurate measurements like grams and stuff.

2001
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,480
Cups are perfectly accurate.

2002
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:54,480
Sometimes there's like, use a teaspoon of this because it's not that necessary to be super accurate.

2003
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,480
But like, I don't know what a cup is.

2004
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:58,480
What is a cup?

2005
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,480
I mean, it's a conversion.

2006
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:04,480
There's a simple conversion from cups to milliliters.

2007
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:07,480
What's a cup and a jug and a mug?

2008
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:12,480
A cup and a jug and a mug and a like a tanker.

2009
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,480
Okay.

2010
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:20,480
It's true that most recipes that I find online are measured in volume.

2011
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:22,480
That's no excuse for me.

2012
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:27,480
That's really no excuse for me because I'm like, I was making up the gummy recipe on my own.

2013
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:34,480
I could have been using mass if I wanted to and I just was sloppy about it.

2014
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:47,480
The cup is, I don't know, it's like if you like, if you like cup your hands together and you kind of scoop.

2015
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:50,480
What if you got really big or small hands?

2016
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:52,480
Then you're going to want to drink more.

2017
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,480
So it works out.

2018
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:57,480
Large hands doesn't equal large stomach fluid.

2019
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:58,480
It does.

2020
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:00,480
It does, actually.

2021
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:01,480
Statistically speaking.

2022
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:04,480
Small hands doesn't.

2023
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:06,480
What if you have small hands and a big appetite?

2024
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:07,480
What do you do then?

2025
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:08,480
You just starve?

2026
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,480
Yes.

2027
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:13,480
You just, you weren't, you weren't designed to survive in this world.

2028
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:17,480
It's funny that they mention like historical recipes.

2029
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:27,480
I feel like I watch, I watch the occasional like old food recipe from the old and I watch, sometimes I'll watch a Townsend's video.

2030
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:32,480
And sometimes I'll watch a tasting history with Max Miller.

2031
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:40,480
And it's really funny that old recipes like don't even like say what you're fucking doing.

2032
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:50,480
Some of them are just like, they'll just say like, yeah, take some milk and like mix it with some flour and like squeeze it until it becomes goo.

2033
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,480
And like, that's it.

2034
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:54,480
Like that's all you get.

2035
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:55,480
Yeah.

2036
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:58,480
Like just throw enough sugar on it that like you think it looks good.

2037
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:02,480
And it's like, okay, I guess I will.

2038
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:07,480
They use rumors from the time that only they would have known.

2039
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:08,480
Yeah.

2040
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:19,480
Like, you know, like Jerry down the road, like, like if you could like, if you cut him in like to 32 pieces, like that's how much milk you put in.

2041
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:23,480
They don't even, they don't even specify though.

2042
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:27,480
They'll literally just say like, yeah, take some stuff, like add some.

2043
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:33,480
A pinch of this, a punch of that, a slap of this, a scrape of this.

2044
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:44,480
Fuck, a fuck of a fuck of ooze and a dollop of tea, a stir and a sip of gravy.

2045
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,480
I don't know.

2046
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:50,480
Just put everything in a bowl and hope.

2047
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:51,480
Boil it.

2048
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,480
Put it in a pot.

2049
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:54,480
Boil it.

2050
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:56,480
Drink.

2051
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,480
Doesn't matter what it is.

2052
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:00,480
That's just every recipe.

2053
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:07,480
That's how you make sure, that's how you get optimal nutrition and you make sure that you don't waste anything.

2054
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:11,480
Because then it all goes into flavoring the broth.

2055
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:16,480
And then you're good as gold.

2056
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,480
What did I try to do?

2057
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:21,480
I tried to make some, oh, I tried to make a cucumber, not cucumber.

2058
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:24,480
I tried to make zucchini chips.

2059
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:27,480
And I tried to like, sort of brine them a little bit.

2060
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:33,480
Like I cut a cucumber and I put salt and water in a vat.

2061
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:38,480
And I just kind of slosh the cucumber slices around in this, in this salt water.

2062
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:42,480
Then I bake them and it was too salty.

2063
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:44,480
It was way too much.

2064
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:51,480
And I crunched it and I said, but then I ate all of them anyway.

2065
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,480
Yup.

2066
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:59,480
Because I had to use my zucchinis because they were starting to get moldy.

2067
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:07,480
Anyway, last voicemail is called P Court P Prologue.

2068
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:10,480
Three, two, one, go.

2069
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:16,480
Please remain seated because we couldn't afford the sound effects for the honorable judge-judge.

2070
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:19,480
Case 69, nice.

2071
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:23,480
The PC people versus the shipy.

2072
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:28,480
He has been charged with impersonating a voice graver.

2073
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:33,480
Impersonating a voice graver is a serious claim to shipy.

2074
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:40,480
I have to send you to Tommy J.B.O.

2075
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:43,480
However, this is a court draft order.

2076
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:46,480
The court is with PC people.

2077
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:51,480
The morning meeting of jail voice mailers shall be given a court.

2078
02:08:51,480 --> 02:09:08,600
This

2079
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:10,480
could you understand that?

2080
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:14,480
No, also tear down the wall.

2081
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:16,480
Tear down the wall?

2082
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:17,680
Was there a wall mentioned?

2083
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,680
I was-

2084
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:23,160
No, no, it's it's, you know, the the ending of Pink Floyd's The Wall.

2085
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:24,800
You know, that's the album.

2086
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:27,160
Oh, by Doug Walker.

2087
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:36,040
No, yeah, I've never seen either the original or the Doug Walker version.

2088
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:39,680
Well, you listen to it because it's an album.

2089
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:41,520
Yeah, but there's a movie.

2090
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,160
Sure, I've never seen the movie.

2091
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:44,960
I've seen bits of it.

2092
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,760
No, I've never listened to the album.

2093
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:50,000
I mean, I've heard songs from it.

2094
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,480
But yeah, the the end of the court and there's the big fat guy and he's like,

2095
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:59,560
I am the big fucking judge and I say tear down the wall.

2096
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,840
That is, you know, the thematic wall from the album.

2097
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:05,000
And it's like, everyone's like, oh, we should do that.

2098
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:08,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.

2099
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:10,760
And chat goes wild and they tear down the wall.

2100
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:18,480
It's it's it's the Twitch chat went went crazy when that album dropped.

2101
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:24,640
Boy, OK.

2102
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:29,680
Well, I'm sure whatever decision this fucking too deep

2103
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:32,480
to understand Judge Maid was great.

2104
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:38,640
He's it was it was the the emperor from 300 Spartans.

2105
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:43,280
But that guy Persian Empire, man.

2106
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:49,720
Xerxes, Leonidas said, this is Sparta, but you didn't say to that guy.

2107
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:55,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's like, you are the perfect man.

2108
02:10:55,960 --> 02:11:01,200
Oh, Leonidas, I will fuck you and your men.

2109
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:07,040
And I said, not today, not today, foreigner shot him.

2110
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,760
I remember that, I remember.

2111
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:17,760
OK. That was the last voicemail.

2112
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:20,400
The end. We're free.

2113
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:26,120
We should do the fucking bonus.

2114
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:27,280
