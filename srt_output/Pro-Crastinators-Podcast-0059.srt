00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:03,800
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

110
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:13,800
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

111
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:24,800
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

112
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,800
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

113
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I have a story about all the sex toys I received during my monkey mail bag thing where I made

114
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,800
the great decision to open up a peel box and let my loving, adoring fans send me, you know,

115
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:24,800
fan mail, books, games, but no, they sent me like fucking tanga eggs and dildos and shit,

116
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,800
naturally, but I made a rule with myself that whatever I get in this funky mail bag I will

117
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
keep and use as props in future videos just so like people can see them and be like, oh

118
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,800
yeah, I remember when I got that, that's funny, so I'm at a point where my bedroom closet,

119
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm still living with my parents, is full of sex eggs and dildos and adult diapers and

120
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:51,800
all this weird kinky shit and like, of course my parents don't watch the videos or know

121
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,800
anything about it, so they just like, one day I just suddenly have all this weird shit in

122
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,800
my closet and like, you know, mom, it's for the monkey shit, you don't need to understand,

123
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,800
don't even question it, but then I was doing the Vietnamese crystal nuzlocke and I reached

124
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,800
a point, I think at the seventh gym where the game froze and I couldn't continue so I had

125
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,800
to quit the series, but then I had a fan on Snapchat named Julian who said, hey, I'll

126
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,800
play a new file and I'll catch you back up to where you were and I'll redo everything

127
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,800
and I said, oh yeah, that'd be great, thank you so much and he says, all I want for payment

128
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,800
is for you to send me one of those tanga eggs in the mail.

129
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,800
So I was like, okay, there we go.

130
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
So you did it.

131
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
And Julian saved the let's play.

132
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
What a hero, what a hero.

133
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I don't know why he wanted it.

134
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Oh, I can't imagine why.

135
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
What a weird request.

136
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Just fucking order your own, why did you want one of mine?

137
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,800
He wants it with your taint on it, you know, with your corruption, that's what he wants.

138
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
So that's my story.

139
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,800
There you go, Julian, nobody knew that, but now that's out there.

140
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Congrats.

141
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Well, I only have need for one toy and that is Lego.

142
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:13,800
And when I'm in the mood, when I'm in the mood, I make for myself a little penis prism out of Lego.

143
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Right.

144
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,800
I just, I just just build it and keep adding bricks until it's completely crushed.

145
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
And then, you know, I attack people with it.

146
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
It's not a joke.

147
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm not, I don't actually do that.

148
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Oh, I have this fetish where I get off on accidentally stepping on a Lego and hurting

149
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
my foot really bad.

150
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I like that.

151
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
It's very specific.

152
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
It makes me cum every time.

153
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Yeah.

154
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Hey, speaking of that, I don't get that.

155
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I do not get that.

156
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
I've stood in Lego boxes.

157
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Oh, come on.

158
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
They're hurting like a motherfucker, dude.

159
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
They don't hurt more than nails.

160
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,800
People make them out like, oh my God, it's the worst.

161
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,800
If you get about a nail, if you step on it, it usually isn't sticking out.

162
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
They don't hurt more than nails.

163
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Guys, look at all the ways I can hurt myself more than a Lego.

164
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
What's the big deal?

165
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Just watch me.

166
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,800
I mean, it's not like lighting your face on fire.

167
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
All right.

168
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,800
I get that it's funny to over exaggerate something to be like, oh, it's funny how

169
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,800
much I'm scared of spiders or I hate Lego or, you know, how much I'm willing to

170
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
kill myself, you know, stuff like that.

171
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
You wouldn't actually do it.

172
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
You wouldn't actually go that far.

173
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
You say you do and it's funny.

174
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,800
But I've never, ever hurt myself standing on a Lego except when I was like three.

175
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Like I can stand on Legos right now.

176
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
And it's fine.

177
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,800
It happens to people when they're like eight.

178
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Yeah.

179
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,800
It traumatizes them from a young age and that's why it has that stigma.

180
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,800
I just don't like the idea that it's cool to be an adult and saying, oh man, I still

181
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,800
step on Legos and I'm still getting hurt and I'm still a pansy about it.

182
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
It hurts, dude.

183
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
It doesn't hurt.

184
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
It really does hurt that bad.

185
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Yeah, it does.

186
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
It does not.

187
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Okay.

188
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Your thing is you're a weirdo British hobbit man with hobbit feet.

189
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
So you can take this kind of punishments.

190
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
It only weighs like 90 pounds.

191
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Yeah.

192
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Yeah.

193
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,800
I used to eat Legos all the time so they don't scare me anymore.

194
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
That's fair.

195
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I don't like this podcast at all.

196
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I want to run away.

197
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I want to run away and I want to delete my audio.

198
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
I don't like it.

199
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I don't like what's been going on.

200
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Incidentally, here's a question about that.

201
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,800
When is the, okay, it's by at Levy Jevy says, when is the PCB going to cross over with

202
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
the Inseparable Social Media podcast?

203
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Never.

204
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Never have, we hate those guys.

205
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Don't ever fucking ever say that again.

206
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Yeah.

207
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
That's off the table.

208
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Don't even, all right, new question.

209
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm trying to think of anything I can say that'd be funny, but nothing is coming to

210
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
mind.

211
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Terry Dactyl says, what species has more value?

212
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Mimes or clowns?

213
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
You fucking know, baby.

214
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,800
It's fucking clowns.

215
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Mimes have actual superpowers though.

216
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Yeah.

217
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
And mimes have never made shitty rap songs.

218
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,800
My favorite mime is, my favorite mime is Pee Pee the Frog.

219
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Pee Pee is very nice.

220
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
He's a funny Mimee, yes.

221
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Le Epic Mime, XD.

222
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Here's what we have to know.

223
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Mr. Mime, Marxist influenced moon enemy.

224
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Mime.

225
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Yeah.

226
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,800
He's fucking communist from space.

227
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Can't trust him.

228
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Clowns, homegrown, homegrown, American, Land of the Free, American First, Nationalist Party,

229
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,800
German Workers' Party, taking back the state, giving the tower back to the people, taking

230
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,800
over the government, annexing the places where they did that.

231
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Poland, yeah.

232
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
You know what?

233
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Munchie, Munchie, listen up.

234
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
I need you to answer this seriously.

235
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Who wins in a fight?

236
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Well, 45, Mr. Mime are three ICP juggalos.

237
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Who wins?

238
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Who can use thunderbolt?

239
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Who can use thunderbolt in those two groups?

240
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Juggalos are poison type, probably.

241
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,800
They're both poison and dark type.

242
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,800
So they normally would be, but they'll have a dark voice, so they'll lean.

243
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Because they go to the dark carnival, because they live in the darkest world.

244
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
They live in it.

245
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
They live with the dark carnival.

246
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,800
They're going to know about all the miracles and the magic of the fucking world through

247
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
the dark carnival.

248
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,800
The dark carnival is your inspiration to witness that without explanation.

249
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Just take a look at this fine creation and enjoy a band with appreciation.

250
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Ghosts, ghosts, the midnight ghosts, mysteries of the world, magic at the most.

251
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
I'm fucking gay.

252
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm a juggal.

253
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Mr. Mime is a fucking communist.

254
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:50,800
He's a Soviet black state puppet regime set up by Stalin to be a tank of egg salesman

255
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
for his personal use.

256
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
It's not real, okay?

257
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Snap out of it.

258
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
We're breaking the social conditioning.

259
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Breaking the globalist.

260
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Mr. Mime is a globalist.

261
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Get him out.

262
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Oh, yeah?

263
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Well, guess what, Munchy?

264
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Mr. Mime can use reflex.

265
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
All that shit just went right back to you.

266
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Shit, fuck.

267
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Yeah, you're right.

268
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Shit.

269
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
You didn't see that coming.

270
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
You can't beat Mr. Mime.

271
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
He's too good in the OU, dude.

272
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
What about the insane Mime posse?

273
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,800
That would be our sign language.

274
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Yeah.

275
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Completely silent raps.

276
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
It's a rap group for deaf people.

277
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Just, just, yeah.

278
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
They're lesser known.

279
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
They're lesser known, yeah.

280
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Wait, how are they for deaf people?

281
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Because they only do sign language because they're Mimes.

282
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Well, you know what you can do?

283
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Oh, right, deaf people.

284
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
I confuse that with blind.

285
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Like, I just imagine like blind people would listen to Mime rap.

286
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Because they don't know.

287
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Okay, what do you think about this?

288
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Okay, this is my idea for music for deaf people.

289
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,800
We sort of encase them in a full, like, rubber suit, right?

290
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Okay, so their whole body is, like, surrounded by this.

291
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,800
And then, like, that surface is the speaker.

292
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,800
And you know, like, because people, you know, music is like sound waves in the air.

293
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,800
And then you blast the beats into that surrounding film on their whole body.

294
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
And you crack their bones.

295
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
And they can experience the music.

296
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Break the music.

297
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,800
And then you buy, like, a pack of mechanical pencil from CVS.

298
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Right.

299
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
You pick up the eraser.

300
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Then you pour out the little, like, individual, like, mechanical pencil, like, parts.

301
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Then you put the leg in down your lemon pipe.

302
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
And then you push in there so small.

303
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Then it can fit right in.

304
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,800
And then it gets to the point where it has a little bit of resistance to what breaks.

305
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,800
And now there's a ton of layers, like, five or so pieces of mechanical pencil lead

306
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
inside your lemon pipe.

307
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
And you squeeze it around.

308
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
And that's what you have to live with for the rest of your life.

309
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Is that it?

310
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Is that it, Nate?

311
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Yeah, God, I guess that's it.

312
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
That's one way to think about it.

313
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,800
The BotFlyz will use the lead in their Minecraft expeditions.

314
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Yes.

315
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Have any of you guys ever been to, like, a real musical production, like, an off-Broadway

316
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
show or something?

317
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Yeah.

318
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Yeah.

319
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
I've been to a real Broadway show.

320
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
What's they're dealing with?

321
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,800
They always have somebody off to the side of the stage doing sign language.

322
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Like, who is that for?

323
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Stage directions.

324
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
No.

325
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
No, no, it's for the audience.

326
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
It's for the audience.

327
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah, but, like, why would you go to a musical if you're deaf?

328
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Because you can't watch the show if you're reading the sign language and you can't hear

329
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
the music.

330
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
So what's the point?

331
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,800
It's the same with, like, I guess, subtitles and anime, I guess.

332
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Yeah, like, you know, you kind of have to look away briefly.

333
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,800
But in this case, you literally can only watch the sign language person.

334
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
You can't watch the people on the stage dancing.

335
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
You can't hear the music.

336
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,800
I don't know why you would go to that show if it's $300 a ticket.

337
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Sometimes you just want to go out on the town, you know?

338
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
You want to, even if you're deaf, you want to look pretty.

339
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
You want to go out with all your fam.

340
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Some people are, like, partially deaf.

341
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Like, they can't understand things, but it's sort of muffled.

342
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,800
So they can still hear, like, beats and shit.

343
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,800
There's a lot to enjoy about the experience in addition to hearing it, I guess, so...

344
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,800
May I just want to be the presence of other wizards, you know?

345
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
That's right. That's right.

346
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Okay, well, I guess that's their choice, but it sounds retarded to me.

347
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Off the record, off the record.

348
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
This is terrible.

349
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Can we have this be the bonus episode instead?

350
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
I don't want this to actually come out.

351
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
What's wrong with it?

352
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
This is perfectly fine.

353
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm very embarrassed that this has happened.

354
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
I'm really sorry, everybody.

355
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Dude, we'll edit it out.

356
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
We'll cut this part out, too.

357
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
No.

358
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
No, cut this part in. Double it.

359
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Double it right now.

360
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Like, overlay it.

361
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Like, echo and reverb it.

362
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Yeah, crunchy.

363
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Crunchy, you should edit the episode.

364
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
I do.

365
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Okay, here's a question that I've been thinking about, sort of, for a while.

366
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,800
So, at Ice Killer 159, what a badass, with that sick escavalier icon that I love so dearly,

367
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,800
says, what are each of you guys' Myers Briggs type?

368
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,800
And the reason I bring that up is because I think this is retarded, and I hate those,

369
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
and I don't know why people like them.

370
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
My Myers Briggs type is.

371
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Oh, God.

372
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Isis.

373
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Yeah!

374
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,800
I was going to say, I was going to say ICPC.

375
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
That's my, uh...

376
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Introverted Socialist, uh...

377
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
E-Bills.

378
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Islamist.

379
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Sexham.

380
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Islamist.

381
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Sexham.

382
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
Inferior.

383
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Stupid.

384
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Oh, that's what they're called.

385
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Those losers.

386
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:20,800
I would classify myself as a supreme nihilist, deep-cover Republican.

387
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Deep-cover as in, like, you're deep in the blue pill trenches?

388
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Possible deep-cover Republican.

389
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
I don't know yet.

390
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Okay.

391
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
We're going to pull back some layers.

392
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Does anyone here have any sort of defense of why I should give a shit about these Myers Briggs

393
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
types?

394
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Tell me why they aren't just masturbatory things.

395
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
We can be like, I'm a this.

396
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Oh, my God, you're a that.

397
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
I don't think anyone here cares about them.

398
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
It's literally the same shit as fucking...

399
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
It's the same shit as fucking astrological science.

400
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
They mean nothing.

401
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
They're fucking retarded.

402
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
I don't give a shit about them.

403
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Oh, like Star Science?

404
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
They're fun.

405
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
They're kind of fun.

406
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Star Science.

407
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Yeah, so that's the reason.

408
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
So the question is, do I like fun?

409
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
No, I hate fun.

410
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
But it's not fun.

411
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
It's so like they can feel superior.

412
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Like, oh, you think you're cool.

413
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,800
I have the same personality type as BBC Sherlock.

414
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Look how fucking cool and smart I am.

415
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
Oh, yeah.

416
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
You're like, yeah, you're so cool.

417
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,800
I have fucking Hitler's DNA and Gandhi's DNA.

418
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Fuck that bitch.

419
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Yeah, I think it's bullshit and those tumblr fucks who like that shit need to fuck up.

420
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
But that's a weird thing.

421
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,800
I am an ENFP bitch.

422
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Is that a real?

423
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Is that real?

424
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Yeah, I tested it when I was in like kindergarten.

425
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Well, you're extroverted?

426
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Somebody in the PCPS and extroverted personality.

427
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Yeah.

428
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Imagine that.

429
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Much should be the one.

430
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Okay, but here the thing about this that creeps me out is that it's like some like it seems

431
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
like a lot of smart people get into this.

432
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,800
And like they, I don't know, like people really care about this.

433
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
So like, is there something I'm missing?

434
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
No, they're actually not smart people.

435
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
They think they're proving that they're smart by doing this.

436
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Yeah, I think I think what it is like, like with the star sign stuff, the star sign stuff,

437
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,800
there's not enough different variables that go into that.

438
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,800
It's just when you were born and people are like initially like, oh, well, that doesn't

439
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
mean anything.

440
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,800
But when it's like, oh, I took a test and now, now I have a thing that I can attribute

441
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,800
to a celebrity that like, like now I'm like that guy, you know, it's, it's more legitimate

442
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
in their eyes.

443
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
And I guess they like it.

444
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
I mean, I didn't know it.

445
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Yeah, I didn't know IQ score aren't the people who are probably that smart.

446
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,300
Yeah, I didn't know that it was even like not real.

447
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,800
I just did it once and I was like, well, and then I forgot it like a week later.

448
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
So yeah.

449
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,640
Well, it's interesting you bring up IQ because a lot of people think that IQ is like a totally

450
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,080
bullshit thing that doesn't actually have any impact on life.

451
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,120
But it is pretty well proven that IQ does have a direct correlation to like life success.

452
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,880
Like it's not all the time, but it does, it doesn't matter.

453
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,440
I'm saying the type of people who actually care about it and talk about it.

454
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Yeah.

455
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Yeah.

456
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,440
I think about IQ so little because I'm the smartest you see that makes sense to me.

457
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,880
That makes sense to me.

458
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,840
I don't even know what a high IQ is.

459
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Is it 50?

460
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Is it two?

461
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,520
Here's why Malcolm on Malcolm in the middle is a great character because he is so cool

462
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,960
because he's fucking black and you want to be like him because you just love black people

463
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
so much.

464
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Yes.

465
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
As having an IQ of 160.

466
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,800
But instead of going around telling people his IQ, he proves that he's smart by being

467
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
a fucking smart person.

468
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Yeah.

469
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Malcolm's great.

470
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Uh, monkey.

471
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Cut this little bin.

472
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,640
Cut this part out of the gas.

473
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
We should both, you should talk about Malcolm from the Malcolm in the middle and I should

474
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
talk about Malcolm.

475
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
Malcolm's at the same time.

476
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
Go.

477
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
Malcolm's at the same time.

478
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640

Malcolm's at the same time.

549
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

550
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

551
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

552
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640

554
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

555
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

556
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

557
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

558
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

559
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

560
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

561
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640

Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

566
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Timmy Turner went into each other's worlds.

567
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,640
That was very attractive.

568
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
I don't remember that ever.

569
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Maybe it's just never had a childhood.

570
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Oh boo boo boo.

571
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
Oh yeah well have you played Jimmy Neutron

572
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
Attack of the Tonkeys on PS2.

573
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
He becomes the nihilist trying to make the millennials feel bad.

574
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
The best video game ever.

575
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Is that true?

576
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
I'm serious.

577
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
Fucking Jimmy Neutron Attack of the Tonkeys on PS2

578
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
is actually my favorite PS2 game.

579
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
I've never talked about it because I'm saving

580
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
like a 20 hour like analysis.

581
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Would that constantly be better than Shadow the Hedgehog?

582
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,640
I just don't know.

583
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
I just don't know.

584
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,640
It's marginally worse.

585
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
What about Will Ville off the rails?

586
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,640
That's pretty good.

587
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
You ever play that one?

588
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
We carnival dude?

589
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
We carnival?

590
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,640
That's the height of an artistic American spirit.

591
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
That was for PS3 you idiot.

592
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
What are we doing?

593
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,640
What is this?

594
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Nate's going to find another question.

595
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
I sure am.

596
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
I sure am.

597
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
You're not the bossamino.

598
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
I've been scrolling for some.

599
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
You're not the bossamino.

600
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
And I'm a baby.

601
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
This is what I was saying.

602
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
This is what I was saying.

603
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
This is what I was saying.

604
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
When I was said I'm truly embarrassed

605
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
and I'm really sorry.

606
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,640
I was the one who made the piece of it.

607
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
This is the best.

608
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
This is the best.

609
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Okay.

610
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
All right.

611
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
Here's another one.

612
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
My extreme distaste is part of why it's the best.

613
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
That's probably true.

614
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
Okay.

615
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Here's a question.

616
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Okay.

617
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Here we go.

618
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,640
IkloneIKLone asks, what's the best console of all time?

619
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
And why is it the GameCube?

620
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
And why is it the GameCube?

621
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
The PS2.

622
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
I said PS2 before you said GameCube.

623
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Bitch.

624
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
I win.

625
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
That's true.

626
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,640
I think I would go with the original Nintendo DS.

627
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Actually.

628
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
I would go with the Nintendo DS.

629
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Why?

630
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
Yeah, you're right.

631
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
Yeah, that's right.

632
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Why is the original?

633
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
The original original broke instantly.

634
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
Okay.

635
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Well, to be fair, I guess my favorite was the, you know, like the slightly smaller one

636
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
that came out with.

637
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
The DS Lite.

638
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
Yeah, the DS Lite.

639
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Exactly.

640
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
The DS Lite.

641
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
It's that one because it had.

642
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,640
You could play Pokemon Platinum.

643
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Oh, man.

644
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
I can't.

645
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Diamond, dude.

646
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Diamond.

647
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
No.

648
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
Okay.

649
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
I've gotten like the most joy out of my DS than I did.

650
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Yeah, there it is.

651
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
There's the one.

652
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
You liar.

653
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
You're a fake gamer because it's a Game Boy.

654
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
A Game Boy.

655
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
I tricked you.

656
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,640
I just seemed to like to make sure that you knew that they was a girl.

657
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
Oh, shit.

658
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
I know that's a Game Boy.

659
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,640
I've heard that jingle more times than I've heard my own voice.

660
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Yeah, I got goofed.

661
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,640
Well, I felt tricked out of the way.

662
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,640
Oh, wait, because the DS starts up with that.

663
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
Yeah, that's the one.

664
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Okay.

665
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
See, I'm a real gamer girl.

666
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Anyway, the DS I played in my bed.

667
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,640
My favorite way to play video games is sitting up with a bunch of pillows behind me reclining

668
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,640
in my bed all tucked in and cozy with my fucking console in my head.

669
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,640
And I figured out how to hack my DS so I had literally every game for free on the entire

670
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
console.

671
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
I'm a genius.

672
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Oh, yeah.

673
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
I mean, nobody didn't do that.

674
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
I had.

675
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Well, you did too?

676
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Okay.

677
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Well, anyway.

678
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
My brother was a hacker genius and he got the R4 thing and he gave me like every single

679
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
video game.

680
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,640
I played all Professor Layton's, all the Phoenix Wright games, all the Mario Kart DS, fucking

681
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
everything.

682
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,640
The DS, the DS for real, has like the greatest game library of all time.

683
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,640
I would say, yes.

684
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
You know, there's like a couple of okay games.

685
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,640
I hear this is Final Fantasy games okay, but it's shit compared to...

686
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,640
There's Club Penguin on that one, that console.

687
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
There's Club Penguin.

688
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
There's Club Penguin games.

689
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
There you go.

690
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Club Penguin Jump Ultimate Stars, all the Layton games.

691
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,640
I think something really good about the DS was when like your parents would drag you

692
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
to the high school football game and you don't want to watch it.

693
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
So you go into the...

694
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
You could chat with people on the fucking pic-toe chat.

695
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Oh my fucking god.

696
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
Yes.

697
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,640
And you just harass people because they can't prove who you are and you just talk shit

698
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
and make everybody mad.

699
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Who else had the DS long before?

700
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,640
They actually had a game for it or I had like, I think I had Mario 64 and I would spend

701
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,640
way more time pic-toe chatting with people on that thing.

702
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,640
And you play that game when you draw like the top half of a picture and then the next person

703
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,640
could draw the bottom half and it would look like they're all one picture.

704
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,640
You know, I've never really experienced DS with strangers or people because bringing

705
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,640
like a DS to school wasn't something people did enough to be a cool thing.

706
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,640
So, you know, I'd never experienced that sort of element of it.

707
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
We have to go back.

708
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,640
We have to go back.

709
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,640
We have to bring all our DSs and just go to a room and then just...

710
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Yes.

711
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Radcon 3, bro.

712
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Radcon 3, the pic-toe chat experience.

713
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
Let's do it.

714
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Radcon 3DS.

715
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Let's do it.

716
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Radcon 3DS.

717
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Yes.

718
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,640
By the way, my most tragic experience while playing any video game ever in my entire

719
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,640
life was thus.

720
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
I went into GameStop.

721
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
I bought a copy.

722
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
I already had.

723
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,640
I already fucking had a copy of Kirby Superstar Ultra.

724
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,640
I just bought another one because who gives a fuck?

725
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Oh my God.

726
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:34,640
So, I bought another one, pre-owned, and then I 100%ed all three files two times over the

727
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,640
course of one day and then brought it back at the end of the night to return and get my

728
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
money back.

729
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
Holy shit.

730
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Yeah.

731
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Is that even possible in that kind of timeline?

732
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Oh, it's possible, mate.

733
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
It's possible.

734
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
It's more than possible.

735
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Holy shit.

736
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
Fucking juggalo.

737
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Guys, press one in the comments if we should do a Kirby race in the PCP.

738
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Press one.

739
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Press one.

740
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,640
It might be cheap in the comments if you want to see us cheap over the game race.

741
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
Hippo is not invited.

742
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,640
I would rather do that because we can do that quickly.

743
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
I'm goat.

744
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
I'm a new character.

745
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
I'm goat.

746
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Hey.

747
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
Hey.

748
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
Oh, this is a good question.

749
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
I'm nervous.

750
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,640
This is good because it's at Jenny's Makudomaru, our old friend, asked, guys, just got a PS4

751
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
and I have Dark Souls 3.

752
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
What should I name a character?

753
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
So, I'm going to respond to this one.

754
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
What should we name their character?

755
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Undertale of 589.

756
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
I mean, 587.

757
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
How about...

758
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Naming characters is not difficult for other people.

759
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,640
It's difficult for other people.

760
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
I don't know.

761
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
Give.

762
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,640
Give me something.

763
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
You're a pun man.

764
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,640
I don't know what to base the pun on.

765
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
I don't know who this person is.

766
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,640
I don't know how they play.

767
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
I don't know what they like.

768
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Dark Souls.

769
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
How about Black Guy?

770
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,640
Okay.

771
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Black Guy.

772
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,640
I'm responding with Black Guy.

773
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,640
Classic character name.

774
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Capital A, U, M, A, K, U, A.

775
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Amua Kua.

776
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
That's you, bitch.

777
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Amua Kua.

778
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
That's a Ua.

779
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Okay.

780
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
I'm going to put Black Guy or Amua Kua.

781
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
There we go.

782
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
There.

783
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Responded.

784
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
You type that to them?

785
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
Of course.

786
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
I just responded to them.

787
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
Now you all listen to the podcast.

788
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
You follow.

789
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
That's true.

790
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
We lost that whole view because of you, Nate.

791
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
God damn it.

792
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
Nah, I got to watch.

793
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
They know.

794
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,640
How about...

795
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
Okay.

796
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Here we go.

797
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,640
Is there anything...

798
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
I want to get someone.

799
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640
I want to do someone.

800
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Okay.

801
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
Hey, dude.

802
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Go for it.

803
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Okay.

804
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Okay.

805
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,640
From an untitled abridged...

806
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
What would you do?

807
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Lock up the Jews.

808
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Just kidding.

809
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
I would never do that to my brother.

810
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Wait.

811
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
I'm actually really tolerant and I love all Jewish people.

812
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
The one thing that I would do...

813
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
Yeah, don't lock up men.

814
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
...was lock up all the neo-nazis.

815
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,640
Yeah.

816
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,640
Actually, I would never do that because I'm actually an extreme racist and...

817
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,640
I'm really not happy about it.

818
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,640
So the thing that I actually would do is I would just take some antidepressants.

819
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,640
Please.

820
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Please let me...

821
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
Please.

822
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
Was the question, what would you do?

823
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Yeah, I think it was what would you do.

824
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,640
That's a good question.

825
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,640
Good question.

826
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,640
Wait, who asked that?

827
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,640
I think you said that.

828
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,640
I would continue to be on the podcast right now, I guess.

829
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,640
That's good.

830
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,640
That's good.

831
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,640
You bring the whole...

832
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Just filling them out on the disc.

833
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,640
He's got a real sound board situation going on.

834
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,640
He's probably surrounded by various different materials and substances that he crank a lot of moments notice.

835
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
Yeah, he's the Folly Effect's king.

836
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,640
In my blue pills.

837
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,640
There you go.

838
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,640
I don't even know how he achieves these sounds, but I...

839
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,640
Amuakua...

840
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,640
He broke!

841
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
He literally broke!

842
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
Did you break Amuakua?

843
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,640
Yeah!

844
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,640
Oh, no.

845
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,640
His Dark Souls 3 player is ruined.

846
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,640
God, this question is shit.

847
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,640
Bobby, I'm going to call it at BobKevin101.

848
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,640
Your question fucking sucks.

849
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,640
Best waifus and or favorite video games?

850
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,640
Dude, what the fuck kind of question is that?

851
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
I'm bored as shit.

852
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Never come to my house.

853
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,640
Riska and Homestuck.

854
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Is the joke both that we've done those episodes and that you've made videos on those subjects this month, Nate?

855
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Yeah, something along those lines.

856
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
Bobby, you're a basic bitch.

857
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,640
Sometimes people just don't know anything in the ACO tweet.

858
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,640
I'm just kidding around, dude.

859
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,640
I'm just kidding.

860
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
What was the question?

861
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,640
It was best waifus and or favorite video games.

862
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
Why and or?

863
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Why is that an and or sort of situation?

864
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
I don't know.

865
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,640
You can only like one.

866
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,640
You can only...

867
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,640
You like video games or anime waifu people?

868
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,640
I think you guys might have done this one last week, but...

869
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,640
Did you guys do what is your least favorite creation that you've made?

870
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,640
The universe.

871
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,640
I don't fucking remember.

872
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,640
I'm going to answer it now anyway, though.

873
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
My least favorite creation I've made, honestly...

874
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,640
And that's from Geifi McGee.

875
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,640
Oh, cool.

876
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,640
I would have to go with and I...

877
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,640
It's kind of silly, but I honestly cannot even really look at my Undertale video anymore.

878
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,640
Oh, shit.

879
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,640
Yeah, I agree.

880
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
I completely agree.

881
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,640
It's because like...

882
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,640
I don't know, like there's a lot of reasons why, but it's...

883
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,640
At the time, I was like...

884
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,640
It feels too much like a game theory.

885
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,640
Well, I don't actually think it's that much like...

886
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,640
I think it's much better than the game theory.

887
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,640
But like...

888
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,640
Okay, so it's obvious that I put way too much effort into it.

889
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,640
So when I look at it now, all I see is like wasted time that I achieved...

890
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,640
And like, what did I get out of it?

891
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,640
You know, like 30,000 views on a video that...

892
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,640
Yeah.

893
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,640
In my opinion, is without a doubt like the most...

894
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,640
It has the most to say about Undertale of any video I've seen, but like...

895
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
At what cost, you know?

896
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,640
Yeah, it's unfortunate because like Undertale was like so...

897
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,640
Overdone by everyone, but nobody did it like properly.

898
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,640
And so when you come along and say all these things...

899
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,640
By the time you got it out, like the basic idea of what you were saying had already been said in various other places.

900
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,640
Just not in a cool enough way.

901
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,640
But it felt like really old and very flashy for no reason.

902
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,640
It's unfortunate.

903
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,640
It's honestly kind of why I don't really have as many warm feelings about Undertale anymore,

904
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,640
even though it is a objectively fantastic game.

905
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,640
I'm just sour about the whole thing and it comes me out.

906
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,640
It's my own fault.

907
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,640
Except for Sam's.

908
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,640
A few weeks ago, me and Ben were watching I Love Impossible a lot as we do all the time.

909
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,640
And I remarked how it's literally best game ever Undertale.

910
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,640
All of our videos are literally best game ever Undertale.

911
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,640
How do you figure, sports fan?

912
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,640
You are I Love Impossible a lot.

913
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,640
There's just shit constantly.

914
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
Okay, I see what you're saying.

915
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,640
I worked way too hard to try to make like everything that happened really cool and flashy and poppy.

916
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,640
Don't do it kids, don't put it on the road.

917
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,640
I Love Impossible a lot.

918
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,640
You.

919
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,640
Same person.

920
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,640
Thank you KP.

921
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,640
A while ago, probably almost, it's probably over a year ago,

922
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,640
there was a lot of subreddit drama going on at the great A under A subreddit.

923
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Oh really?

924
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,640
And I didn't like his videos in the first place so I thought,

925
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,640
okay, I'm gonna take advantage of this drama before anybody else.

926
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,640
And I'll make an anime review of great A under A baby.

927
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,640
Oh, I'm gonna put him in his place and make him look like an idiot.

928
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,640
And the video's dumb and gay and whatever, nobody cares.

929
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,640
I don't know if I saw that one.

930
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,640
That's okay, don't watch it.

931
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,640
I was trying to catch up to speed on the monkey anime reviews because this is what I first found out about you.

932
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,640
And I get to that and it's sort of like weird and not like anything else.

933
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,640
And I also talked very, very slow.

934
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,640
In my old videos, I do talk pretty slow and people always complain about it.

935
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,640
But in that one, it was like I was trying to talk to a group of retarded people,

936
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,640
which I guess would be the great A under A fan base.

937
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,640
So it kind of fits.

938
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,640
I don't actually remember what was in that video that was so bad about it.

939
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,640
It was just like, he doesn't like these band people.

940
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:09,640
He was on a stream talking about how a 14 year old girl in his moderation of his subreddit was like a whore

941
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,640
and was like saying mean stuff about her and stuff.

942
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,640
Yeah, but what was your video about it?

943
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
What did you do?

944
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,640
I was just pointing it out and that's it.

945
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,640
But that's just a theory.

946
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,640
A great A under A theory.

947
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,640
This is good, I like this.

948
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,640
Gabe, what do you hate about yourself?

949
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,640
Wow, what a question.

950
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,640
I guess sometimes I say things without actually understanding whether or not I actually agree with myself.

951
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,640
I just feel like I need to say something.

952
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,640
So sometimes in podcasts, this is like a specific moment.

953
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,640
But I think earlier in the podcast when I was talking about something, I forget.

954
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
I think I know what you mean.

955
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,640
Yeah, it was fame.

956
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,640
I just had a visceral reaction about fame probably being bad

957
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,640
and I don't really want to be recognized on the street.

958
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:08,640
And sometimes I regret certain things I say and I don't like that I can't take it back.

959
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,640
I can't take it back, but it's now recorded and it's part of a thing.

960
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,640
And there's various moments in podcasts and stuff I just don't like what I say and I'm like,

961
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,640
oh wait, you're trying too hard or you're silly, then you're not supposed to.

962
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,640
It's a bad time.

963
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,640
I fucking...

964
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,640
I know what you mean.

965
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,640
You can always state a retraction.

966
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,640
I think that's something not enough people do.

967
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,640
People never like to admit when they were wrong or when they changed their opinion

968
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,640
and they'll just hold on to stupid ideas for no reason.

969
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,640
No, no, no.

970
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,640
I mean, I would retract it, but I need to think about it before.

971
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,640
I know whether I actually disagree with it now.

972
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,640
I just know that you're all against me and I'm like, oh, maybe I'm stupid.

973
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,640
Maybe I'm being an idiot.

974
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,640
It's okay to have an unpopular opinion.

975
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,640
Well, no, I mean, I think I know what Gibbs is getting at.

976
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,640
Because once you say something, even if you set it off the cuff and you didn't really mean it,

977
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,640
once you put it out there in any form, people just latch onto that

978
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,640
and even if you make a correction, people are resistant to change the impression that they've already formed.

979
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,640
So yeah, that should happen since it's annoying.

980
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,640
I think about that too.

981
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,640
Yeah, I mean, I've always been scared of podcasts.

982
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,640
I do them because they're a challenge to...

983
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,640
I mean, they're not really a challenge anymore.

984
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,640
I can just hop on and say, oh, fucking, I'm here.

985
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:29,640
But they used to be like, oh, no, oh, no the whole time in my head

986
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,640
and everything was like, I was tensing up and I was sweating and I was shaking.

987
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,640
Like, no, I can't, I'm not saying anything.

988
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,640
I gotta be saying something.

989
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,640
Any podcast I've been in, I feel like I haven't been like...

990
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,640
I mean, no, that's not true.

991
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,640
See, I'm doing a thing where I say something that's not even real.

992
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,640
Not even actually what I think.

993
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
I'll just shut up.

994
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,640
That's the thing where it happens, the thing that you're talking about.

995
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,640
Isn't there a word for that?

996
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,640
Gay?

997
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,640
Yeah, I think that's the one.

998
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,640
Yeah, yeah.

999
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,640
God damn it.

1000
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,640
Ash Rock Relab asks...

1001
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Is there any type of you guys that you're super into and it's so weird

1002
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,640
you don't even bother recommending it to other people?

1003
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,640
Oh, yeah.

1004
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,640
What the fuck was that question?

1005
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,640
I didn't even understand that.

1006
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,640
Is there anything...

1007
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,640
It's so weird that you like it, but you don't want to recommend it.

1008
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,640
Well, it depends who I'm recommending it to.

1009
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,640
Weird things are inherently good to me.

1010
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,640
If you show me something that's weird, I will like it.

1011
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,640
No questions asked.

1012
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
I want to feel slime.

1013
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
I want to feel sludge.

1014
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,640
And I want to feel most of all ooze.

1015
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,640
Well, what if I just watched the new Taylor Swift music video and I'm like,

1016
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,640
you know who'd be into this shit?

1017
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,640
I'm Munchy.

1018
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,640
My buddy Munchy would love it.

1019
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,640
I love Taylor Swift.

1020
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,640
She used to go on beat and I love my beat bros.

1021
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,640
I love Debbie the Frog.

1022
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Dude.

1023
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,640
Dude.

1024
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,640
Dude.

1025
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,640
The Taylor Swift Taylor.

1026
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,640
That's a good one.

1027
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,640
The Taylor Swift Taylor.

1028
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,640
I love you, Hillary.

1029
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,640
You're my favorite.

1030
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,640
But yeah.

1031
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,640
I know with her.

1032
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,640
I mean, I like a lot of vaguely weird things.

1033
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,640
Sometimes I post them in here where I feel like in the PCP chat that is,

1034
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:10,640
when I feel like people in the chat would understand it.

1035
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,640
It's usually just YouTube poop things that sometimes there's one that's like,

1036
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,640
can be appreciated despite not really being into YouTube poop.

1037
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Because I don't think any of us, aside from me, are really into that sort of

1038
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,640
YouTube stuff.

1039
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,640
So, I don't know.

1040
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,640
That's generally what I don't recommend, even though I love it.

1041
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,640
It's just, it's one of those things that's like, you know, if you like it,

1042
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,640
then we can have a conversation.

1043
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,640
You tell your suggestions.

1044
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,640
Yeah.

1045
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,640
You tell your recommendations to like the audience you're talking to.

1046
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,640
So like, I don't know, I wouldn't come on here and recommend the same things

1047
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,640
to watch that I recommend to you guys.

1048
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,640
It just depends.

1049
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Yeah.

1050
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,640
I've found a lot of people, especially in these online communities,

1051
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,640
have a predisposition about all reality TV and assume that it's all shit.

1052
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,640
So, even though Survivor and Big Brother are two of my favorite shows,

1053
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,640
I never want to recommend them because people would just write that off

1054
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,640
as being something that they think it is.

1055
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,640
So, I just gave up a long time ago.

1056
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,640
You know what I'm just realizing is that people, you know,

1057
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,640
normal people generally just recommend things because they like them

1058
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,640
and not really thinking about who they're recommending it to.

1059
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,640
They just want people to like things.

1060
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,640
Whereas us, like we do like reviews or we talk about media a lot.

1061
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,640
So, the idea of like recommending something on like a platform is different

1062
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,640
from just saying something to a friend.

1063
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,640
Yeah.

1064
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,640
Like you're talking to an audience that, you know, like it's not worth your time

1065
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,640
to talk about something that they may not already be into

1066
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,640
if you know what they're like.

1067
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,640
I'm with you, dude.

1068
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,640
George, where are we?

1069
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,640
We're in Undertale, Homer.

1070
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,640
Undertale, what's that?

1071
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,640
Skeletons and monsters?

1072
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,640
Love and shit, you know?

1073
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,640
Like sands and papyrus.

1074
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,640
Oh, shit.

1075
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,640
We got to get the fuck out of here, bro.

1076
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,640
Okay, here's a question.

1077
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,640
This is just a fun one.

1078
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,640
Hey, we've got our red pills and we've got our blue pills, but what's your pill?

1079
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,640
So, let's decide a PCP official pill that we can, you know, distribute.

1080
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,640
Oh, a pill for the mascot.

1081
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,640
What pill is he?

1082
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,640
For that guy?

1083
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,640
I mean, he's kind of gray.

1084
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,640
Gray pill?

1085
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,640
That's already taken, isn't it?

1086
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,640
Plus that sounds shitty as fuck.

1087
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,640
What about mage-pilled?

1088
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,640
We could all get mage-pilled.

1089
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,640
I'd like to get mage-pilled, but that's a specific, you know.

1090
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,640
What is involved in being mage-pilled?

1091
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:42,640
You know, just like a nice, you know, nice soft-spoken guy who likes to talk about anime in video games, you know.

1092
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,640
Unless you play MMOs with your friends on the internet.

1093
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,640
Yeah.

1094
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,640
Yeah, okay.

1095
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,640
And you're a really tall girl.

1096
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,640
It's a pretty wholesome pill.

1097
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,640
Germ pill.

1098
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,640
I'm just going to round some off here.

1099
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,640
Germ pill, antidepressant pill.

1100
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,640
Empire pill, saturation pill.

1101
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,640
Crushed blacks and whites pill.

1102
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,640
High saturation pill.

1103
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,640
Wait, wait, wait.

1104
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,640
Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff pill.

1105
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,640
Sabrage pill and that.

1106
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,640
Sabrage.

1107
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,640
What about pill-pilled?

1108
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,640
Sabrage.

1109
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
Pill-pilled.

1110
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,640
I think, I mean, our conversation right now is pretty pill-pilled.

1111
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,640
Yeah, I think so.

1112
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,640
I don't know the pill thing.

1113
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,640
The red and the blue makes enough sense, but what the fuck is all those other ones?

1114
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,640
We agree.

1115
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,640
The green one is if you're fucking blissed so hard, you're going to fucking turn over and die.

1116
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,640
There's a whole big image, like, of a hundred different types of pills, a billion different types of pills, and I'm like,

1117
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,640
I don't have time to read all this pill knowledge.

1118
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,640
I don't want to get it wrong, though.

1119
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,640
Guys, I've got a good question.

1120
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,640
Wait, you don't.

1121
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,640
It's not good.

1122
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,640
No, I'm super into the expanded pill lore, and you guys are always just on the mainstream bullshit.

1123
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,640
No, me too.

1124
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,640
Me too, dude.

1125
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,640
You guys are just so pill-pilled.

1126
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,640
I just kind of hate it.

1127
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,640
I know, I know.

1128
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,640
All right, boys.

1129
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,640
He's got to get that expanded.

1130
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,640
Yeah, go, go, go, go.

1131
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,640
Since we've got, you know, an even number, ten people in the PCP right now, sort of.

1132
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,640
We don't need to go into it.

1133
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,640
Right.

1134
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,640
We may not have left the chat today, only to come back probably tomorrow.

1135
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,640
If you had to ship all the PCP members with each other with no repeats and no one left out, who would be with who?

1136
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,640
Who is that from?

1137
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,640
That's from KZSNIP.

1138
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,640
She's getting a lot of questions today.

1139
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,640
I can already tell, there's going to be a lot of demand for Gibb in this situation.

1140
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,640
No.

1141
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,640
Fighting is going to be a lot.

1142
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,640
We don't get to pick who you want.

1143
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,640
I think the canon ship is me and Jesse, because people have drawn us together before.

1144
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,640
Yeah.

1145
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,640
See, people are going to write that.

1146
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,640
On a ship.

1147
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,640
On a ship in the pony cast.

1148
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,640
Yeah.

1149
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,640
God damn it.

1150
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,640
Me and Gibb were on a ship before anybody.

1151
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
God damn it.

1152
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,640
We've been on the poddy cast for over a fucking year.

1153
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,640
Everyone hates the poddy cast.

1154
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
It's just arbitrary.

1155
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,640
No.

1156
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,640
Shut up.

1157
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,640
Fuck you.

1158
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,640
Now, would I be with Ben or with Digi?

1159
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,640
I would say, I would automatically put Jesse and Digi.

1160
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,640
Jesse and Digi, I would put together.

1161
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,640
That just seems like, that just seems like.

1162
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,640
Guys, they were the original.

1163
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,640
They were your little sister.

1164
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,640
They were the original, I mean, I know Tom and Digi were actually the original.

1165
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,640
But Digi is so invested in like his Digi friendship that-

1166
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,640
Wait.

1167
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,640
I feel like Digi and Monkey would be a good ship.

1168
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,640
I'm going to say Digi is invested in his Jesse friendship.

1169
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,640
That's what he is all about.

1170
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,640
Wait, guys, we can't just focus on love.

1171
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,640
We need all the quadrants.

1172
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,640
Oh no.

1173
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,640
So so so.

1174
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,640
So Monk would definitely be in Kismis.

1175
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,640
Kismis with Ben.

1176
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,640
No doubt.

1177
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,640
No doubt.

1178
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,640
Yes.

1179
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:31,560
What a colleague yeah, I'd probably go with that. It's cuz it's like a love-hate thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's fits. It's cute

1180
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,360
How about Ben?

1181
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,800
Yeah

1182
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:41,240
Gibbon would be like more rails with fucking Jesse. I would think probably

1183
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:47,480
Yeah, they're not that bad as a medicine. They're on their super pirate ship or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1184
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,680
The first ones to ever be on the ship. Yeah, and then Tom and Digi would go together cuz they're like the old boys

1185
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,380
Um, yeah, they haven't fucked in a long time though. Yeah, I don't know whether

1186
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,760
He's like he's so ethereal he needs to become like corporeal again, you know

1187
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,200
We have like Nate

1188
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,880
I should probably be with mage, but then again mage is like asexual so oh, you know what you know

1189
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:24,780
The perfect pairing mage and Tom because mage is asexual and Tom is bisexual. So he's gay that works

1190
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:29,920
I could be gay so that'd be like perfect that works out. Wait, so who is Nate with the munchie? Who's left?

1191
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:37,880
If you're not actually bisexual, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that nice. Yes. Yeah, he's okay. Good cut that out

1192
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,320
Just because he's vegetarian

1193
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,160
I'm just like, you know, I'm a man and I have needs and you will satisfy those needs

1194
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,480
You much we both the only women can be fat we know we know this yeah

1195
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,960
I think Nate should wear a pearl costume and then fuck Steven universe. That's a good idea

1196
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,960
Yeah

1197
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,840
Oh Peter, okay, so that's everybody

1198
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,320
There you go. That's official. Yeah, that's pretty good. Oh

1199
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,080
Dear, here's another one the KZ again KZ snap

1200
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:33,880
KZ is the fucking VIP with decent questions about it's because these are like specific and they're fun to answer

1201
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,280
So here we go at KZ snap says, uh, would you ever get a tattoo? And if so, what would it be?

1202
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,540
I bet you guys have all thought about that. Yeah chakras and all of my chakras

1203
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,480
64 points

1204
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:54,720
And he do you of course use the you know the ancient Hindu was the manji, you know the the swastika would be on all chakra points

1205
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,920
I've always been a very anti tattoo

1206
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:04,880
But I think I would get one as a joke if I lost some crazy bed and I had to get like digibro's face on my ass or something

1207
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,280
But otherwise I'm not just planning on it. Yeah. Yeah, that's just a fun story

1208
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,480
I would I would get an emoji movie ad on the tip of my penis

1209
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:21,120
So that yes, yes, that's great so that every vagina will go by the oh, you know for the movie dudes for the movie

1210
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,200
The the the water splash one probably

1211
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,680
That's a good one

1212
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,200
You know, I'm pretty spiritual so I would get a star of David on one nipple and a swastika on the other

1213
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,320
Yeah, I have actually thought about this and for many years now everyone's gonna think I'm a fucking sellout piece of shit

1214
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,520
But I've wanted to get the the joe star star on like my my upper left back

1215
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,120
But I've wanted that for like 15 years. Okay, so it's like I first read Jojo

1216
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:03,200
I'm not one of these fucking anime new joys. I hate people who like the things I like only I'm allowed to like it

1217
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
You guys are Joe Joe reference. Oh

1218
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,720
God, I'll probably never do it though

1219
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:13,720
It's literally it's become so normie that I probably just won't ever do it because they don't like you know

1220
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,920
What I've never really thought about having like an actual tattoo like I'm thinking well

1221
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,440
It's kind of painful and it's permanent like I'm probably gonna regret it

1222
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,320
But as a joke as a as a hilarious joke and as long as it's on my back

1223
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,600
So I don't have to look at it all the time

1224
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:33,200
I would put like a like a like a like a as if I was married to brisker like a like a weird love thing

1225
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,560
Yeah, or maybe just a symbol something like really retired in her now and hilarious

1226
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,880
But by the way brisker shit will never die. She's real forever. She's real forever

1227
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,920
But by the way that that just just to increase my indie credentials

1228
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,560
It I wanted that tattoo after I read part six of Jojo

1229
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:54,840
And it was after Joleen did her epic fight with guard Westwood during the survivor battle

1230
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,000
That was the most maybe want to do it and find the entire fucking. Yes. Thank you

1231
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,240
It is the best fight in the entire series. God somebody gets it

1232
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
And and it's

1233
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,880
Every single panel

1234
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,680
Yeah, sorry what I've got a topic for discussion

1235
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,400
Okay, go on go on this one comes to us from mum key underscore Jones who wants to know

1236
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:33,360
Was Nate the best guy ever justified in stealing a picture of some bitch dressed up and she's like fat and ugly

1237
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,880
Oh this one, huh? I think we should talk about it, and we haven't talked about it. You know, that's totally fine with that

1238
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,260
Okay, well, let me give you the backstory real quick. So in my

1239
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,720
video about how

1240
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:50,120
Communist glasses are not fucking orange for me a mouthful. I I used a cosplayers photo and full disclosure

1241
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:55,480
What I did was I just googled like female coming to cosplayer like I had actually used this image before in my

1242
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:01,440
Gurren login review. So, you know the criticism would be equally valid that I used it there as well and to my

1243
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:09,300
Discredit I did not credit anybody who was in it, which I I agree was and worse like not not like

1244
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:15,340
Was rude I guess like I don't think I actually need to have any responsibility to do that if I had to give credit

1245
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:20,140
To every single Google image I put in my videos the whole description would be nothing, but that shit, okay?

1246
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:20,620
Well, here's the thing

1247
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:25,700
I think that it is possible like we say that like but the argument you're kind of making and I think about this myself

1248
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,820
Because I do this a lot too is like that's really just us being lazy whether or not we're actually allowed to do it

1249
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,300
That's just a saying like it would be too much work. So obviously I'm allowed to do it

1250
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,300
I don't know if that's actually true, you know

1251
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,420
Well, I don't think Google you don't own it anymore. I don't think that's accurate

1252
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:48,460
I think I think I think I think I think what it is is it's it's not illegal, but it's just it's it's a nice

1253
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:51,820
It's a nice gesture to link to something. Well, okay using it

1254
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,580
Let's separate is though that if you're using a lot of images

1255
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:58,820
You're not gonna go through nobody's gonna go through the the the rigmarole of

1256
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:03,540
Getting links to all the specific different sources, but that that's completely insane

1257
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:10,340
But that's like saying that like if you do like many crimes like they all become less important cuz like you've

1258
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,060
Let me separate this into two things, okay

1259
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,020
We can I think we can deal with one immediately then we can just talk about the second

1260
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:24,340
I don't want to confuse the two so there's the legal issue and then like the moral issue

1261
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,100
So legally what I did was 100% fair use. Yeah, absolutely

1262
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:32,180
Nothing wrong with just using someone's image because all I was doing was commenting on it

1263
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:36,300
I wasn't like saying it was mine. This is just me describing a picture 100% totally fine

1264
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,660
Yeah, there is the like the more moral issue like is it good to do that?

1265
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,460
Especially considering I didn't give by the way by the way give I have amended

1266
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:46,780
So I have added links to those things in the description because I agree, okay

1267
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,140
You know, I did think like okay

1268
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,740
It was this person specifically commented like hey not cool

1269
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:54,980
You should you know at least let people know who I am and I agree if someone goes out of their way to say like

1270
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:58,100
Hey, let me do this it would it would be merely spiked to be like no

1271
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,180
I'm not gonna fucking do that and I am not a spiteful person. I don't want to do that

1272
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:07,480
So now has she acknowledged this because she she like suck her goons onto your video to like attack it and down

1273
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,420
You know post comments like she was being a huge cunt about it. What she wants. I actually disagree

1274
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,460
I actually people were saying that she was being quite rude

1275
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:19,740
I don't really think that that's the case like she in her comments. She complained like

1276
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,580
You know, hey, you didn't give me credit not cool

1277
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:28,900
Way to just use my picture, you know without my permission and and also like it said like especially in like in this kind of light

1278
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:32,140
Like because I was insulting her for not having like the perfect glasses color

1279
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:37,580
So let me say first of all, I don't it's fine. Your customs customs fine. Don't worry about it. I thought it was ugly

1280
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,260
Well

1281
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,020
I think she could have done a lot better

1282
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,020
We all could do we could all do a lot better

1283
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,620
Well, okay, I have I have okay some some

1284
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:54,780
Viewpoint on this cuz sometimes I'm too lazy

1285
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:00,980
And I don't want to play a whole game to get a specific clip right in in a video game review or anything like that

1286
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,300
you know and

1287
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:09,260
When I do that I download the video and then since the video has the name of like the YouTube link

1288
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,700
You know that the YouTube title later

1289
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:16,580
I can just copy paste and find the link and then put that in the description and I generally do that sometimes

1290
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:22,860
I forget sometimes I'm just like it's like nobody's gonna notice like I'm but if it's like

1291
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:29,020
Like for the Kingdom Hearts grpj. I didn't play that game. I didn't record that game for all the grpgs

1292
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,540
I don't record the footage because that's too much. That's too big

1293
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,860
So I go around and I you know

1294
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:40,260
I find people who have played through the whole game and I get certain things from the videos and I linked to them and

1295
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:47,060
I make sure to say I stole this content from these people just so that nobody's accusing me of being like

1296
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:52,820
It's subtle about it like I'm saying I took you say that in the video or in the description in the description

1297
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,860
I said content a game footage stolen from and a bunch of links

1298
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:02,300
So okay, I feel that I don't feel the need to do that all the time

1299
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:06,940
But when it's like a lot, you know when it's something that could potentially be noticed

1300
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:13,580
I mean what I feel I feel like it's it's just customary to just if you have an easy way to put the link in there

1301
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,580
You may as well. There's nothing really wrong

1302
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:22,060
What if somebody went to gibbo Gibbon gaming and they write use some of your footage for review?

1303
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:27,660
Would you care personally? I wouldn't give a shit. I couldn't care less of a shit about that at all

1304
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,740
It means if somebody went to

1305
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,860
Took something out of one of my streams

1306
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:39,140
If I was notified of it if somebody somehow noticed that it was my play through and they put it on their video

1307
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:46,700
And I went to look at it. I I guess it would depend on how much well, let's use like I like on a baseline

1308
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,340
Let's just say it's just a clip from one of my streams

1309
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:52,620
They're not using the audio. They just need footage of the game that they're yeah, yeah

1310
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:56,100
Then I wouldn't give a shit, but I feel like gives it yeah

1311
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,660
But I I mean what I feel like doesn't necessarily but guys

1312
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,340
I'd rather have no altercations happen if somebody's gonna get mad

1313
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:08,580
I'd rather than never get mad or not have a reason to get mad if there's a link to the thing in the description

1314
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:12,620
So what what you guys are talking about is just people's feelings, right? Like that's what's in consideration

1315
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:15,460
Yeah, that thing that I never care about right

1316
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:19,620
Well, you know, I I mean I have thought about this

1317
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,860
You know, I did some reflecting on this issue and I thought about like what if someone

1318
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:28,620
Use one of my videos like you know put a fucking weaponized thickness clip or something into their videos

1319
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:34,140
Like what if they did that and they didn't credit me and you know like it's just the joke like it's not like they're saying

1320
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:38,020
It's theirs, but in the exact same sort of situation they put a clip of mine

1321
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:44,900
You know, it's totally fair use legally. There's no problem with it, but like I think I would really like a link there

1322
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:51,500
I think I would sort of be be miffed if there wasn't a link to to me. I yeah, I think well

1323
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,780
I think with that

1324
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:55,300
I would agree that I would be miffed as well

1325
01:09:55,300 --> 01:10:00,700
But it's also kind of already become a meme and it's like you ever hear

1326
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,940
Okay, okay, you try to copyright memes that just means be something being a meme does not

1327
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:10,940
Invalidate like ownership of of like the image it simply does not it doesn't do that immediately

1328
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:16,820
And I'm not saying I like own the intellectual rights to this phrase or anything. I'm talking about you know, like yeah

1329
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:23,940
Yeah, I know I know but I wouldn't I wouldn't blame somebody for having heard a meme that I originated and not

1330
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:28,340
Going to figure out where it comes from like if somebody did that I wouldn't be mad

1331
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:32,660
I wouldn't care because I understand that if it's out there and it's all over the place

1332
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:37,060
Right can't really do anything. Okay. I'm with you on that if someone like stumbles upon it and uses it on that basis

1333
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,700
Absolutely because like I do I mean I do that all the time

1334
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:44,620
I tons of the images I get in fact most the ones I use my videos are stuff that I've collected from 4chan over the

1335
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:49,700
Years that I don't give any source for and I couldn't even if I wanted to I've just found them and I've saved them

1336
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:54,060
And I just throw them up there. So I mean maybe that is morally not

1337
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:59,500
Flawless, you know, I would like to give credit to every single person who has made these things over the years

1338
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:04,680
But you know, you just got it. You just got to think a bit of like like what's what's realistic?

1339
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:10,160
Realistically, you know, nobody's really gonna give too much of a shit if

1340
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,640
somebody's like if

1341
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:18,760
Somebody I took a video game clip from finds it and they notice it they might say hey, could you link to my thing?

1342
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,760
Like that's the least that's the most that could happen

1343
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,080
It's not really gonna be a big deal, but I put the link there anyway

1344
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:30,080
Just just because like it's unnecessary, but I feel like you know, why not it doesn't take it

1345
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,760
It takes like a minute to do that

1346
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:38,440
So like realistically what what sort of effort do you would you expect people to go to to link to something?

1347
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,800
If it's if it's just something in a Google search, you would have you know, you click on it

1348
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,880
You can get the image right there. You don't need to go to the source of the image on DeviantArt, right?

1349
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,760
It's it's a it's a bit more effort. It's I don't expect people to do that. I don't do that

1350
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,680
Okay, but you know, I'm totally with you on that

1351
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,840
But I would say if that person were to come to you and say like hey, dude

1352
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,280
I notice you use my video or my my image or whatever, you know, that's cool. Not the biggest deal

1353
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,080
Maybe I wouldn't I don't know whatever it doesn't matter how I feel

1354
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:08,920
But would you give me credit? I'd really like credit if you don't like do that

1355
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,000
Well, that's like, okay

1356
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,520
I'm just saying like it's easy to like not worry about it like whatever

1357
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,960
I'll just use the image who gives a fuck but to then ignore someone who comes to you and like request it

1358
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:22,200
I'm not saying that makes you like a monster. I'm just saying like that's not cool. It's not a cool thing to do

1359
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:26,680
Oh, yeah, obviously like if somebody went out of their way to tell me I would yeah, of course

1360
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,400
Because then they've given their link to to me

1361
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,800
You know their name like I can easily find it

1362
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,000
Like if I have to go if they expect me to go searching for it

1363
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,920
Because if I if I don't remember where I got it from then I might not do it

1364
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:48,760
I don't think but I mean if there were any legal issues. I don't remember or it's too much work

1365
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,600
Those are not actual legal defenses. So I'm just saying if this were a little thing

1366
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:58,240
We've decided that the legal stuff is like it's mostly fair use basically all the time

1367
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,160
So what's the moral standpoint Nate? We all know that it's legal

1368
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:06,320
But why do you kind of have a shaky moral standing on it? Well, you say it's shaky, but I think I've been pretty clear

1369
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:10,720
It's that no, I mean, why do you think it's not morals when I'm asking? Oh, well really

1370
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,000
It's because I've consulted how I think I would feel about it

1371
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,680
And I think if someone used my work without crediting it. I would not like it and I would want the credit

1372
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:23,320
So somebody took a snapshot of one of your videos because this was you didn't steal her cosplay

1373
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:26,880
You used a photo of the cosplay so if somebody steals your well

1374
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,800
That's different than if somebody takes a screen cap of your clip and uses it

1375
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,880
I don't think that's that bad

1376
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:37,240
Well, I mean you got to put the full context in because the the whole picture was like you could tell this had been photoshopped

1377
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:43,040
So like someone had worked on this image after a picture had been taken and so there's the cosplayer involved as well as the photographer

1378
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,640
And I'm assuming that's the person who also like did the photo editing because you could see like the background had

1379
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,720
been darkened to make this person like pop out more

1380
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:57,800
You know like that's work and in a perfect world. Yeah, I think everyone who does any work on something like that should should get credit

1381
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,080
And get so if the person who designed the character came to her and said hey, can you delete that?

1382
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:06,040
That's my character. Please don't cosplay is that you think she would delete it? She's a well

1383
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,080
Well, but again, I'm not saying anyone should ever have to delete it because I think this is totally

1384
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,680
It's just an issue of you know, is it a cool thing to do or not?

1385
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:17,000
And I think if the character designer for Kamina came out and was like hey, dude

1386
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,360
You're using my shit without crediting me. You got to credit me

1387
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:25,040
I I would say that yeah, like she should credit just be like by the way this character was designed by whoever on wherever

1388
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,920
They're not

1389
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,880
It just to ignore like the imagine if fucking I don't know

1390
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,800
Imagine if Elliot came up to you and was just like monkey, you know by the way, dude

1391
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:44,040
I'd appreciate if you would just put links to my videos for all the clips you use and just like imagine imagine looking at

1392
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,720
I'm saying no like no, I'm not gonna do that like you can do it

1393
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:51,560
I mean in person you would say it online and I can just ignore the email and move on

1394
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,360
Well, yes, you can if you came in person you'd probably have a gun and then of course I would do what I think I think I think what this is

1395
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,040
Is that it's it's the fact that somebody got upset about it and right?

1396
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:08,360
It's a deviant art thing because like I get my images from Google. I don't usually pick fan art

1397
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:15,000
I usually go for like official art because it's less hassle as it's more recognized see I use a ton of fan art personally and get it

1398
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,200
all from 4chan

1399
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:23,280
Yeah, so if you use an artwork, let's say I drew an image of something

1400
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:28,400
Or I took a picture on Instagram or something and I find it in a video by someone else

1401
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:34,720
I would be like, oh, okay. This person knows me. That's my first thought. Mm-hmm, or they they found my image somehow

1402
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:41,000
I wouldn't immediately be annoyed that they hadn't linked to what I had made because

1403
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,780
Well, actually, I don't know cuz yeah, you might right by trade. Yeah

1404
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:51,640
Okay, but you know I generally generally generally I I wouldn't care so much

1405
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:59,280
Unless it was like a they were just stealing a huge amount of something I've made I I have a position on this and it's it's

1406
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,200
It's exactly where I was before just I don't know with all that other shit

1407
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:06,680
It's that I'm going to continue doing exactly what I've been doing up to this point of using the images

1408
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,240
I've collected and not really worrying too much about giving proper credit to people

1409
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,260
But if anyone requests it, I will certainly add it if they are like, hey dude use my thing

1410
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:19,720
Appreciate credit. I'll be happy to put it and I won't go like out of my way to not put credit if I can easily do it

1411
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:26,000
But it's just it's kind of excessive. I mean, I was in this position when I made my quarry in the house review

1412
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,680
I I needed a thumbnail

1413
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:31,800
So I just googled quarry in the house HD picture and that took the first thing I found

1414
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:37,040
But it turns out that was the thumbnail for somebody else who made a similar quarry in the house review

1415
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,360
And he sent me a message on YouTube said hey, monkey. I love the video, but I made that thumbnail

1416
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,920
Can you switch it? And I was like, yeah, yeah, okay sure thing buddy. So I switch the thumbnail

1417
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,400
So yeah, I guess I see where you're coming from. Mm-hmm, but I didn't have to and that's the point

1418
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,520
Yeah, you didn't have to legally have to great great review by mother's base. I love that card now. Yeah

1419
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:01,520
Actually mine. I think mine came out before his did so fucking great mother's basement video

1420
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,760
Speaking of mother's basement mother's basement asks, why do you kill me?

1421
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,880
Yeah

1422
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,720
Here's a real question

1423
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,400
Jeron I guess I've been thinking about this at Gergerad asks

1424
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,040
a PCP guys, why

1425
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:32,320
Why don't you tell us the topic of the episode when you asked for questions? I don't know

1426
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,520
I don't know dude. Is that something we should do?

1427
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,000
I think no, no, no, no, it's it's something we shouldn't do because if

1428
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,360
Say if it wasn't like a stupid episode like this

1429
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:47,320
Yeah, we would have been talking about that topic the whole time and then questions would be something else if they ask questions about it

1430
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,720
And it's just like well, we already talked about that. We're already talked about that

1431
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:55,360
We're already brought up different. I agree. That's okay. That's a good answer. There you go, Jergerad

1432
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,080
Yeah, okay. Let's say here's a here's a shitty last question

1433
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:04,840
At dr. Sand shrew I like a good name asks pancakes or waffles

1434
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,960
Okay, when I was a little boy, I used to be super into waffles

1435
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,000
I was like a super like like like well like

1436
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,560
Champions like like yeah, I was like a waffle nationalist

1437
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,480
I wouldn't like have any pancakes bullshit. I used to always eat them

1438
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,960
I would I used to always eat chicken and waffles. That was that was that was what I ate

1439
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,520
That was the only wall dude. Are you like African-american or something Lamau come on now

1440
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Oh

1441
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,600
Okay, um, but yeah, but then later fucking delicious

1442
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,960
Munchie laughing a Nate's joke was funnier than Nate's joke. Of course. It was my jokes are shit

1443
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,120
Then I discovered something amazing

1444
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,240
Pancakes with

1445
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,960
Wow grand reveal even though it's the only other option. Yeah, yeah, yeah pancakes

1446
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,320
And I was like what I ate next will make your dick blow off

1447
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:02,660
If I eat the pancakes and sit the waffles then I will have a different taste than the waffles

1448
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,840
But see munchie I especially like I especially like how you specifically said

1449
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:17,800
Pancakes with just butter because a lot of people will drown their pancakes and syrup all the time

1450
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:23,080
But I I'm in agreement that I think that just pancakes and butter is kind of better

1451
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,280
It's kind of like the most delicious thing in the world

1452
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,520
Here's the best thing you'll ever eat in your life

1453
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:34,160
Yeah, you get two frozen egg waffles that were probably in there like eight months ago

1454
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,240
Right you fry those fuckers up in the toaster

1455
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:41,600
Then you put peanut butter on them you make a little sandwich then you douse it in syrup and then you eat that

1456
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,600
That's way better than any pancake

1457
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,000
Sounds like a glory hole, but like better

1458
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:54,440
Then let's know in the chat what topic are we doing? He's listening better. We're not doing any topic. What do you mean?

1459
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:59,680
This is laziness. We covered laziness thoroughly. They're only guys guys. Okay, fucking

1460
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,680
This episode clickbait

1461
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,360
Yes, I think it might be clickbait. No

1462
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:13,120
Pancakes the only time I've eaten pancakes was only time

1463
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,200
Well, yeah, they don't have it's not it's not a thing

1464
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,000
Pancakes pancakes for breakfast is not at all a thing

1465
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:33,040
We don't eat pancakes. It's just not a thing. Do you waffles literally fucking treason? What about what what are waffles?

1466
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,880
They're building waffles for a reason cuz they're from Europe and all Europe is the exact same

1467
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,760
Uh

1468
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:49,000
Waffle all right. I think is it just like a grid pancake? Yeah, it's like we're crispy. It's crispy. Yes thicker and crispier

1469
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,040
Yeah, I've never really had a waffle either. What I have had like put I have had like potato waffles

1470
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,760
Which are waffle shaped potatoes and they I love those okay?

1471
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:58,720
I

1472
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:04,640
Know it's that's what I associated waffles was because that with because that's the only thing I'd ever had that was called a

1473
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:10,120
Waffle is of a little potato thing and I was always confused when when people in America would talk about having waffles

1474
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:13,640
I'm like, wait a minute. That's not a waffle. That's not that's not it. That's not what it is

1475
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,880
Anyway, the only time I had pancakes was at rad con 2

1476
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:24,400
During one one of the times we went to breakfast and we had them. I was like, huh? Yeah, I get I get I get it

1477
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,920
Was the time. Oh man, that's nuts. I had no idea. That was your first time having pancakes

1478
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,600
I think it might have not been the exact first time

1479
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,880
But it's the first time I had like an American pancake with syrup on it. I've never had never had syrup on

1480
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:41,280
I don't know guys. We've we've we've we've we've we're running kind of long here. You know, we've been going for a while

1481
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,280
Shall we get to the topic?

1482
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:49,900
Yeah, no, I was gonna do that, but I'm glad you did because laziness is like

1483
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,920
You know, it's

1484
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:58,400
You know, I get it. Whatever like laziness is like I do it

1485
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:05,880
But you know, like I know I shouldn't but you know, like whatever, you know, like sometimes sometimes they're just sort of I

1486
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,320
Can't think of the word. I mean you should do a series. Yeah, okay, okay, man. Do it

1487
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,720
No, it was a joke. Oh, hey

1488
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,240
It's a joke. I was too lazy to find the word

1489
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:22,720
If we in the episode maybe Nate can record the fucking audio for my Pokemon tournament that hippos in that's true
