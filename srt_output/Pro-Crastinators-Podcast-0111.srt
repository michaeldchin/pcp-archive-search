00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,480
anal hernia ever. Today we're joined by Ben Saint.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
No you're not.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,480
You're right. Ben has that title for sure.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,480
And name only or name only. His spirit is left.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,520
Munchy, defend your existence.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Kid power, kid power, kid pride worldwide, kid pride worldwide.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
Rise up against your oppressors.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Oh, you guys remember VHS?

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
No.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
The Davoo is here.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,520
I've been in so many podcasts lately that I feel a little bit of bad about being in a giant, empty,

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,520
furniture-less room with such a strong echo. So right now I'm in the closet. I don't...

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,520
I admire your minimalist lifestyle.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Davoo's never been out of the closet.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Oh, shit. Mage of the lethal variety.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Hello, Mage here, and I'm speaking from my childhood home right now.

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Oh, excellent.

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Boo to childhood.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,520
You're such a fucking grump today. What's going on, Scrooge?

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Shut the hell up, Digibro's here.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I love you.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
Gross.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
Oh, there's Mage for a second.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
This is deeply uncomfortable.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,520
Is that what it used to sound like? Holy shit.

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,520
That's what we all used to sound like.

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,520
That's awful.

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,520
This was the worst entry.

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Everyone, look upon your screen, gaze your eyeballs for one split-half of a fucking second,

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
and look at the number of this episode. This is episode...

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,520
One. One. One.

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Of the procrastinator's podcast.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Smash one. Smash one in the comments.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Smash that one.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,520
I mean, you know, if you could spare a few, it would really help me out.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,520
If you could find it in yourself to give this old partner a few ones, then you know.

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,520
I mean, I would like...

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,520
I know where I'll feel, you know, the economy's down and inflation is up, but it's worth it.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,520
To walk down your local vans, you gotta have a bushel or a barrel full of ones,

41
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,520
but you know what, you get to buy your fucking loaf of bread and your apple,

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,520
but if you could just spare a one or two, I wouldn't be able to have...

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,520
There would be a lot of Patreon percentages and numbers right now.

44
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Do we need to talk about that right now as well?

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
What?

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
What about them? What about them?

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Isn't, like, aren't we, like, at a very specific number on Patreon?

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Is that true?

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
No, I'm thinking of Twitter.

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
We've made one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Oh, yeah, right.

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
On Twitter.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Guys, it would really do me a big favor if you would all please pledge to our Patreon

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
so we could get one, one, one, one on there.

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
That would be great.

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
That would be great.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:55,520
But we are at 111 tweets on the PCP, and we're also following 11 people, which is nice.

58
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Excellent. Excellent. Well, there it is.

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I haven't gotten past the fact that it's been 11 weeks since Radcon.

60
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,520
If 3,568 people could unfollow us, please, so we could have 11 followers, that would be pretty nice, too.

61
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
What'd you say, Digi? It's been so long since Radcon.

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,520
I can't believe it's been 11 weeks since Radcon 3, and we've only edited like half the shit.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Episode 100 was there. If we're on 11, then it's been 11 weeks.

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
It's been 11 episodes.

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Oh, right. It's been 11. Is that another?

66
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
It's okay. All right.

67
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,520
It's all down to the ones. The ones are the DNA.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,520
If you look down like a microscope down at your DNA, then you'll realize it's actually not a bunch of dots as it's represented in Jurassic Park.

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
It's actually a bunch of ones.

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,520
You know, they say that the world, they say that everything in the world can be represented by ones and zeros,

71
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,520
but no, ones will do just fine. Thank you very much.

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Slightly elongated ones will be the zeroes.

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,520
I wanted to be with the one that the one could not stare back at me like I stared at it, drove me to madness.

74
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,520
They call me the weird one hermit now.

75
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,520
That weird one hermit.

76
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
One weird old hermit.

77
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Contrary to your belief, this is not actually the make ones joke episode. This is the kids episode.

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,520
This is childhood kids boyhood took 11 years to make.

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,520
Specifically boyhood. Not childhood.

80
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,520
If you can only respond if you're a boy.

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,520
If only boyhood took 11 years to make, this joke would work way better.

82
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
There you go. Red line is that.

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,520
All right. So here we go, everyone. Childhood, being a child, being small and weak and cowardly.

84
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
What do you know? What do you say, Ben? What do you say?

85
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
It's wrong and it's a sin.

86
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Are there any redeeming qualities to children?

87
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
No.

88
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Any.

89
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
No.

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
They're just humans but words.

91
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Jesus Christ.

92
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm coming in.

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
I'm coming in with a fucking wrecking ball.

94
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
That's who I'm talking about.

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm here to beat the shit out of the establishment.

96
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,520
I'm here to shake the ground like a fucking earthquake.

97
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,520
I'm coming in. Hashtag kid power.

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I want to see all these tweets tweeting the procrastination with some sort of funny image or relatable quote from a teenager.

99
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Hashtag kid power.

100
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Why don't you grow a fucking brain already?

101
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Why don't you just fucking get your neurons all set up and get set in your ways like the rest of us?

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,520
When I was growing up, I mean, we can get into this later.

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,520
But when I was growing up, I was always trying to become like a cool ass adult and be mature and like pay taxes and shit.

104
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
And now I realize that's stupid.

105
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,520
But not for the usual like, oh, I don't have any, you know, you don't have any responsibilities as a kid.

106
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
You don't have to wake up and be like, oh no.

107
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,520
But because adults are fucking lame and they're always pissy baby fucker fappers who shit their fucking diapers.

108
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,520
And as lame and nihilistic as hell, the optimism of the youth is the only valid outlook in the entire world.

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Yeah.

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
That's a strong argument.

111
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,520
It's like basically the kids next door argument, right?

112
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
You know what? You're right.

113
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Talk about them all at the moment.

114
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
You've changed my mind.

115
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,520
I feel as though this is like, I mean, I know as many, like isn't the stereotype that nihilistic teenagers are the thing.

116
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
And then when you grow up, you get past that.

117
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I don't care what the world is outside of my vision.

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,520
Teenagers are known adult sympathizers.

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,520
That's for sure.

120
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,520
The reputation of adults being boring and cynical comes from the fact that most adults, i.e. most people, are failures.

121
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
It's the failure that makes them uninteresting.

122
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Childhood is where childhood is before you've had an opportunity to fail or succeed.

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Most people fail, so therefore you can only fail or succeed in adulthood.

124
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Davoo, you're right.

125
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,520
But that's why I don't like children, because like while adults have risen or have failed or succeeded life,

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,520
children haven't even put their cards on the table yet.

127
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,520
They're in the waiting room waiting to even give life a try.

128
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:43,520
The thing about kids generally is that I see him as like not quite cooked chicken.

129
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Like you put them in the oven and you're like, okay, that could do with a few more years.

130
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
I'm not going to talk to him.

131
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
He's just being a kid. I don't mind.

132
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
He's just doing his kid thing and he's not very interesting.

133
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,520
But I'll let him just sit in the oven for a little longer before I go up and try to treat him as a human being.

134
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
That's what an oven neighbor did.

135
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,520
All Hitler tried to do was put that childish race in the oven for a little longer,

136
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,520
but he can't catch no breaks for that activity.

137
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,520
That's sort of like, oh, just a kid, I'll let him run around and smear shut on the walls.

138
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,520
That's the reason why kids are bad is because adults won't just treat kids like adults,

139
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
which you just said.

140
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Enough of this bullshit. Children are literally worthless.

141
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
They rely on adults for everything.

142
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Everything a child is doing has been done by the effort of an adult.

143
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
I feel both the way that Munchie and Davoo feel here because on the one hand,

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,520
I feel like I take Davoo's stance because I believe what Munchie says,

145
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:46,520
that you should be really hands-on with a kid because you really need to educate children

146
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,520
in order to make them understand the world around them.

147
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Don't let them just run around and be a dumbass kid.

148
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Try to make them not a kid anymore.

149
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,520
The goal of every kid is to eventually beat the kid out of them and make them a functional human.

150
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,520
But when you see a kid who's not really your business,

151
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
and when I see some dumb, bratty kid out and about,

152
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,520
I think of that Boondocks moment where granddad just beats that kid in the grocery store for the lady

153
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
and everyone treats him like a hero.

154
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
I wouldn't have probably used the same technique,

155
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,520
but I do feel that sense when I see a dumbass kid where I'm like,

156
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,520
man, someone should do something about that,

157
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,520
but I know that if I tried to, it would just get me in trouble.

158
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,520
So I'm just going to be like, you know what, this kid's just not worth worrying about.

159
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
They're like fucking dogs.

160
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,520
They're like fucking dogs in the sense that everyone wants a dog,

161
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,520
and then when you have a dog, you're not trained enough to be able to know what to do with it.

162
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,520
You don't want to be like, oh, I don't want to have to spray it with a bottle of water.

163
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
That's so fucking cruel.

164
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
You only should buy a dog.

165
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
You should have to teach it.

166
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
You have to be a parent.

167
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
You have to teach them what the world is like.

168
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
You have to be a parent and be there.

169
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Sorry, but before you get a dog or you get a child,

170
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,520
you should have to sign a contract saying you're willing to put it down if it goes against you.

171
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
If it goes against you.

172
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
If it goes against you.

173
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,520
You should have to play a game of ski ball

174
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,520
or sign a couple of waivers backwards to be able to legally own it.

175
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Sign waivers backwards?

176
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
It's the Ned Stark rule.

177
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,520
This is simultaneously a breathalyzer test and a literacy test at the same time, basically.

178
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
Also, it's ski ball.

179
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Listen, when I was a child, I didn't do anything good.

180
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
The only things I did that were good.

181
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
It's on you, dude. It's on you and your parents.

182
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,520
This is a celebration of Munchie's last gasp of childhood because very soon,

183
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,520
he will be taking that thing they do in Kids Next Door where they brain blast you so you're not a child anymore.

184
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
That's literally true.

185
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
That's what happens. You forget all the secrets and joy of youth.

186
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,520
That happens when they turn 13, but never mind that.

187
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Is that true?

188
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Yeah, because teens are their own faction.

189
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
It's not just Jimmy Neutron.

190
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Jimmy Neutron has a brain blast.

191
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Is it from Johnny Quasar, his lesser-known cousin?

192
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Everyone look up Johnny Quasar.

193
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Do you remember in that one episode, though, here's my counterargument where Santa was proved to just be a super genius

194
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,520
just like Jimmy Neutron and also got brain blasts? Do you remember that?

195
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,520
What? That's so fucking lit, dude. Holy shit.

196
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,520
It's like the next evolution of humanity is those people of the brain blast.

197
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Digi, I know the next podcast we should do.

198
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Jimmy Neutron.

199
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Let's fucking podcast every Jimmy Neutron episode and all the movies.

200
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,520
That's going to be my upcoming podcast. Is it Fleek or is it Gay?

201
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
And Santa Claus is definitely going to be Fleek.

202
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Fleek or Gay?

203
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
Oh, that's excellent.

204
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Like in Jimmy Newtype.

205
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Jimmy Newtype?

206
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Dude, that's like, is anime now. Incredible, incredible.

207
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,520
You're going to see like transformation from like men to beasts over the course of Chibbaka.

208
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
You're going to see us like turn into cavemen.

209
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Dude, you guys should definitely do a Gundam Chibbaka so that I can learn anything about Gundam.

210
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
That would be really helpful for me.

211
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
I don't want to watch mecha shows. I don't care.

212
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
But they're, why?

213
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I don't like robots.

214
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,520
That is inconsequential and ignorant. It has nothing to do with the genre of mecha.

215
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Guren Logan being a mecha.

216
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
The name that the robots do is what it says.

217
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Okay.

218
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,520
There's a huge movement going on on any Twitter right now of mecha fans being like,

219
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
it's always been about the characters. It's not about the robots.

220
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
People are stupid. Nobody understands mecha.

221
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
It's a big deal.

222
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Gigi, could you please forgive me because the genre is named mecha?

223
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,520
It's like in the room when Lisa's mom says like marriage has nothing to do with love.

224
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,520
But like put a Naruto headband on her and she said mecha has nothing to do with robots.

225
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Here's the thing about genre labels, right?

226
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Let's say that with metal music, you might like one, like there might be one really great metal band who everyone appreciates.

227
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:05,520
But then there's like a thousand shitty metal bands and some people will just, because they are categorically a metal fan, listen to all of it.

228
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
Mecha's the same way.

229
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,520
There are great mecha anime like Gundam that are not really about Gundam, about robots.

230
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Every good story is about human characters.

231
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Exactly.

232
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
There was going to be no good mecha.

233
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Speaking about mecha and the human heart conflict with itself.

234
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Give, save us, save us, give.

235
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Speaking about childhood now, because that's the thing, and mecha, I had robot toys.

236
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Which toys did we have and what did we do?

237
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,520
I was post-toy. I'm so young that I was post-toy.

238
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Feeling that too, that's interesting.

239
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Toys are not really, nobody gives a fuck, because you had more advanced things.

240
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Speaking of mechas, Ben and I did have all the megazords that we got for all the years that we cared, and I had a ton of transformers.

241
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
I never had that many transformers.

242
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I had the exact same toys as you guys. I also was Power Rangers and then Beast Wars.

243
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I guess the only transforming toy I had was a Digimon toy that evolved quote-unquote.

244
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Which Digimon was that?

245
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,520
In Lithuania, they only had go-bots.

246
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Who was? I want to know.

247
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,520
I think it's called Hawkmon and it evolved into the Armored Digivolution of it.

248
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Oh, I think I had that.

249
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,520
You flipped up a skull and then you turned it upside down and it became like a metal skull.

250
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,520
You put a thing on it and then you expanded its wings and into the wings you put in legs.

251
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:48,520
It also opened up and you had a little mini world inside of it with a little mini Digimon.

252
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
That was really cool.

253
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Speaking of Digimon and childhood, is Digimon still good?

254
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Some people have told me that it got good again or something.

255
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Digimon Tri was good.

256
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,520
A couple of them have their defenders.

257
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Nate, here's what you have to do. You have to Google search Digimon, look at the monster designs.

258
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Do you like them? Digimon is good.

259
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,520
I couldn't tell if he was asking, is the new show good?

260
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,520
And the question is, look at any screenshot of it and you'll be like, I'm not watching that.

261
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
That's how I felt about it.

262
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Is it the one with the mobile one?

263
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
It looks really bad.

264
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
It's one of the mobiles.

265
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
No, not that one.

266
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,520
That was an actual child Digimon show.

267
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
This is a different thing.

268
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Whatever, we don't need to get a good Digimon thing.

269
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Digimon sucks.

270
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Let me tell you an anecdote from my childhood.

271
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:50,520
I remember one time, I don't remember why this happened but I got sent to the school guidance counselor

272
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,520
because I was in distress about something.

273
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
And who cares?

274
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,520
And I remember going to the guidance and she sat me down and was talking to me

275
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,520
and I remember in hindsight that I ended up just sitting down and talking to my guidance counselor

276
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,520
for a long time about how hard it was for me to decide whether I liked Pokemon or Digimon better.

277
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:20,520
I remember I did a school write whatever kind of essay that you want.

278
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Not an essay, but a short story in 6th grade or whatever.

279
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,520
And I wrote mine in the style of Homestuck and I had to explain to my teacher what Homestuck was.

280
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I can't believe Homestuck was Munchies childhood.

281
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
You know what?

282
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
That is weird.

283
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
It makes sense though, doesn't it?

284
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Think about Homestuck and look at me.

285
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,520
There is definitely one thing about being a child that is a huge advantage over being an adult

286
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,520
is that adults will never get it.

287
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Children, they get it.

288
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,520
That's literally true, that's literally what I believe that is true.

289
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I feel very much so that occasionally a new thing will come up and people are saying like a word

290
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,520
and I'm like well now I guess I'm an adult because I don't get it.

291
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,520
When Munchies said fleek before, I had a fucking crisis.

292
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I know, I don't say fleek, I said it because it's retarded.

293
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,520
The funny thing about that Ben is that fleek is an old ass slang too.

294
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,520
It's not even in anymore, it's like already out.

295
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,520
I said in the context of a podcast being called is it fleek or is it gay?

296
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
I don't actually use the term fleek to describe things.

297
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,520
That was what made it so funny to me is that it's like an already dead slang

298
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,520
but it's funny that Ben had never even heard of it.

299
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
My girlfriend is five years younger than me.

300
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,520
But I don't get it because I'm an adult and adults will never get it.

301
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,520
My girlfriend is five years younger than me and she continually refers to hitting the whip

302
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,520
and I have no fucking idea what she's talking about.

303
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,520
What does this mean?

304
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,520
A car is a whip so she probably means go to the car.

305
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Does it mean go for a drive?

306
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,520
No, it's like a dance move or something that I don't understand or comprehend.

307
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Well I don't know anything about dance moves.

308
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,520
This is a bunch of white dudes trying to talk about what is probably an urban dance culture.

309
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,520
An urban dance culture is an urban one.

310
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Come right out and say it, coward.

311
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Alright guys, let's get down to brass tacks here.

312
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,520
I want to hear retarded stories of how you fucked up as children.

313
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
That's what I want to hear about.

314
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
I've never done it before.

315
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,520
The only time I've ever fucked up is never.

316
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I was trying to think about it but I couldn't do it.

317
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,520
I remember when you fucked up when you didn't carry the monsters podcast.

318
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
That's true.

319
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,520
I didn't carry it.

320
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I have a better question for everybody.

321
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,520
I want to know, when you were kids, did you want to grow up?

322
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,520
No.

323
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
I have a big story about that.

324
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
It's a good question.

325
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,520
I want to hear Monty's big story but me and Nate you go first and then I'll go.

326
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I was just going to say yes.

327
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,520
I reached that at a certain point because of the deep frustration.

328
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Teenagers just want to be able to drive.

329
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
They want to be able to do stuff.

330
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
That's not true.

331
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,520
It took me years before I fucking got the motivation.

332
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Even Millennial Childs are post-cards.

333
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Millennial Childs are post-cards.

334
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,520
I wanted to be an adult because I wanted to be able to do stuff and seize control of the destiny of my life.

335
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:35,520
The reason I wanted to be a kid is that I wanted to relinquish control and not have to think about anything.

336
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
I just wanted to not be responsible.

337
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Who wants to be responsible for stuff?

338
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I do so I can run my life and win at life.

339
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:55,520
A lot of my relationship with seeing myself as not wanting to grow up was that I really hated this idea that everyone supposedly was going to grow up.

340
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,520
People would always tell me you're not going to care about toys when you're an adult.

341
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,520
You're going to care about girls once you're an adult.

342
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,520
All those things would piss me off because I was like you can't tell me.

343
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Literally all of them happened.

344
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,520
I remember the day when I could not bring myself to care about toys anymore.

345
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:21,520
They said you won't care about toys but then I look up from my computer and I see more anime figurines.

346
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
I'm already over anime figurines.

347
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I don't even like them.

348
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,520
I keep them somewhere else in the house where I don't have to look at them.

349
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:35,520
I had a similar attitude of whenever people told me when you're this age you're going to be like this.

350
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Maybe you're not going to fucking decide.

351
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
I will decide what I would like.

352
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
I will make those decisions.

353
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Thank you very much.

354
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,520
I had similar experiences.

355
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,520
When I was younger I had people tell me when you grow up you're going to grow out of those Pokemon.

356
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,520
You're going to get a job and not draw anymore.

357
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,520
You're going to start caring about things, other things.

358
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
And I'm like no.

359
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,520
And there I am liking Pokemon and drawing pretty equal split.

360
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,520
It's always a pretty equal split of things that you have grown out of and also things that you've retained interest in.

361
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Like a lot of the shit that like I wasn't really told that I would grind a lot of things other than the fact that I would probably mellow out.

362
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Which I think a lot of it.

363
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,520
For what it's worth you have mellowed out considerably.

364
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
It's true.

365
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:38,520
It's just that Munchy has mellowed out from like Christ consciousness levels way above like human comprehension to something we can see on the visible spectrum.

366
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Oh you're making me sad dude.

367
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
No, no Munchy.

368
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Don't be sad.

369
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,520
It's like Munchy is like a prism that light of the universe is shining through.

370
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,520
But you've refined yourself to be a more focused beam.

371
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
Yeah I would say that.

372
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,520
I would give my take on you to say something around the same time I did I think.

373
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
MLP reviewer give and take?

374
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Please tell us.

375
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
I had to hurry and be called that in full.

376
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Oh sorry.

377
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
It's in my head I was supposed to give.

378
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,520
No one told you that name.

379
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
I haven't been called.

380
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
I haven't heard that name in years.

381
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:21,520
I've been trying to think of my childhood and it's strange that I can't really remember what people were talking about like to me.

383
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Like you know I don't remember things that I was told as a kid necessarily.

384
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,520
I just remember like general feelings of stuff that it was good.

385
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,520
It was good when stuff happened and I want to have that again.

386
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,520
But then you know I guess I just have a bad memory.

387
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm not coming up with it.

388
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I'm coming up with like brands like Bionicle and Beyblade and fucking Bugslide.

389
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,520
I define myself exclusively with brands.

390
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I just want to slam back my total quality.

391
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I don't remember what like I was like as a kid and whether I wanted to grow up or not.

392
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I distinctly remember as a teenager looking around at people like getting driving licenses and cars and being still teenagers you know at school but like acting adults and they had suits.

393
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:20,520
I mean they had school uniforms but they would like you know like I'm cool because I wear this suit thing.

394
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
It's kind of like a suit.

395
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,520
It's like I being a creative person.

396
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Yes I don't know what that means.

397
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,520
I distinctly remember feeling an aversion to being an adult in the way that they were doing it.

398
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Like I believe you could be an adult and still be a kid because it's more fun that way.

399
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Like just to be into stupid shit because even if it doesn't mean you're popular it's still cool because you like it.

400
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,520
That's all I can really remember about like childhood yearnings of adulthood.

401
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:02,520
I remember a lot of cartoons at the time for female specifically were all about fashion and makeup and stuff.

402
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,520
And I had like a very sort of distinctive version to them because I never got into makeup and fashion.

403
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I still haven't and it's always bothered me.

404
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,520
I sort of tolerated the ones that had something else to do like as ashamed as I admit it.

405
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,520
I did like Winx because it had magic not just like fashion and stuff.

406
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Winx was lit yo.

407
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
I didn't like the pressure.

408
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Like one of the reasons I didn't want to grow up as well.

409
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,520
I didn't like the pressure of having to dress nice and put on makeup and think about all those things.

410
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
I just got damn patriarch.

411
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
He's trying to keep you down.

412
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Fuck that.

413
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,520
But before I get into, I should get into my big old story about how it became the boy that you see before you.

414
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
The big baby boy.

415
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Himself, right.

416
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,520
I would like to say to Mage, is it true that being a woman is awful?

417
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Not in the sense like it's bad, but in the sense like you do so much shit just like on the reg.

418
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
That does seem to be true.

419
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
That would seem awful.

420
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
I don't.

421
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
I don't do it.

422
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I'm purple.

423
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm not a female.

424
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Well that's tough.

425
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Mage has taken the Ben approach of just shirking all societal expectations.

426
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
You live in the alternative lifestyle.

427
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Yeah, if you just live an alternative lifestyle and become a weird hermit, no one expects anything of you and you don't have to do anything.

428
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,520
I want to see fan art of Ben living his alternative lifestyle.

429
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Just in whatever way you imagine that, please.

430
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
That could mean any number of things.

431
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
It could mean anything.

432
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,520
There's no definition for what that means.

433
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
It could be literally anything.

434
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
You have a question though guys.

435
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,520
How are you different from your child self?

436
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,520
I was pretty similar as a child.

437
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I was a little more of a spaz and I cared about things more and I'm embarrassed of that in hindsight.

438
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
You care about things very, very slightly.

439
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,520
I cared about what was going on around me and that was a mistake.

440
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Oh yeah.

441
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
You've turned into a fucking adult, dude.

442
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,520
You've turned into an adult and you're no longer hashtag relatable to me, a child.

443
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,520
We walk around and things happen around me and I'm going to turn around.

444
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Oh, look at that.

445
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Who cares?

446
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Now the bombs drop around Ben everywhere and he doesn't even deign to look at it.

447
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,520
When Donald goes drunk, Ben's not even going to realize.

448
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,520
He's going to be living in a Trump-style society, not realizing it's gone full drunk on him.

449
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Being straight, white, cis, male, I won't even notice the difference, no.

450
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:36,520
When the bombs fucking drop, his pristine, pasty, white condition will make him immune to all radiation.

451
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,520
So regarding the question of difference between childhood and desire to grow up,

452
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,520
for me, I can answer both with one line.

453
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,520
I am 100% goal focused since my conception.

454
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
I can remember what you...

455
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Please continue.

456
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,520
I've never heard that exact sentence before.

457
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm sorry.

458
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
I don't.

459
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
I don't, but what do you mean?

460
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Many of my earliest memories is me thinking what will be my...

461
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:16,520
All I would do as a kid is just think of overarching lifetime plans for something, right?

462
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,520
I imagine if I had grown up in an engineer family or had an inventor dad and mom,

463
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
I probably would have gotten into engineering.

464
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,520
Like if I had an actual social life, you know?

465
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,520
If I had been the fucking child of some sort of internet content creator or some shit,

466
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I would have just gotten onto YouTube way earlier, right?

467
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,520
So I didn't really care about growing up or not growing up.

468
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
I just wanted to have a purpose.

469
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,520
And so the difference between myself then and now is that I do have a purpose and plenty of goals.

470
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,520
Before that, I was just totally aimless not knowing what to do with myself.

471
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,520
I also had no purpose or goal in life as a kid.

472
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
That's pretty much what I was going to say too, for mine.

473
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,520
I'm way more disciplined now when I do what I want to do.

474
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,520
I guess in college I had a vague idea that I was going to go to grad school and become a physicist.

475
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,520
So I guess I had a goal at some point.

476
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Like personality-wise, were you similar or different from how you are now?

477
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,520
I think right now the me that exists now is more like my self as a child

478
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,520
than the me that existed as a teenager in my early 20s.

479
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Completely dependent on others around you.

480
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,520
You're very much like yourself as a teenager in certain specific ways.

481
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,520
You're an absolutist is what you are and you always have.

482
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
I am now, that's for sure.

483
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
Well, fair enough.

484
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,520
You've expressed it in different ways before.

485
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,520
The biggest difference between me as a kid and now is that

486
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,520
really the biggest difference for me, I don't think I was very different from childhood through adulthood.

487
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,520
It's more like after becoming a brony celebrity I changed

488
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
because I became able to talk to people and be social.

489
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I think that I act very differently now from how I did in 2012.

490
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,520
But 2012 me was almost exactly the same person as 2-year-old.

491
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
I remember videos of you in 2012 saying,

492
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Man, I was never knowing how to talk to people until the last couple of years.

493
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,520
I'm just expecting another update to this in 3 years saying,

494
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,520
I wasn't able to talk to people until 2017.

495
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,520
I would say that my perception of what I meant by a sentence like that changed a lot.

496
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,520
When I said able to talk to people then I probably meant at all.

497
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Whereas now I mean I can socially go out and start conversations with strangers.

498
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Becoming a very mildly successful internet art person.

499
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Achieving a little bit of success in that arena has changed me.

500
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Went straight to Ben's head. He's a broken man.

501
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Yeah, well basically. It has changed me in ways that are probably net negatives.

502
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Because I have found ways to survive and to buy without interacting with anyone.

503
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
And I have leaned into that.

504
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,520
And I think I need to choose. Am I going to get my life on track and find a balance?

505
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Or am I just going to get my life on track and find a balance?

506
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Or am I just going to lean into it and completely become a hermit, a hermit, nothing master?

507
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,520
As we all know, as much as I already was going to do my thing right after him.

508
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I still want to answer the question myself.

509
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,520
I just think it's funny that Ben would accuse himself of not interacting with people.

510
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,520
Because the way that you do your career involves extensive social networking.

511
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Twitter doesn't count.

512
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,520
What about Discord? You run several of them.

513
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,520
It's all baby shit. It's literal baby shit compared to talking to people in person.

514
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,520
We all know that internet friends aren't real friends, am I right?

515
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Of course.

516
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Growing up, this is also, again, I'm post toys and I'm also post friends.

517
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Because growing up, I basically only had internet friends.

518
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
So there's no real distinction to me.

519
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,520
There's no difference really between me going down the street and talking to someone online,

520
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
like emotional wise.

521
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
I don't feel any differently.

522
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
I feel the same as how you described.

523
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
The lines of the meat and the wired, bro.

524
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
I have to back up.

525
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
I do interact with people.

526
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
What? No.

527
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
She said her audacity crashed.

528
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
What? Oh, oh.

529
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Oh no, technical difficulties.

530
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
Mage fucked up.

531
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,520
But it's okay. We came back.

532
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,520
Okay, Ben was saying something. Feel free to pick it up.

533
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Was I?

534
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Alright, if you can't remember, who cares?

535
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,520
The thing we were on, the thing we were on currently was how do you feel different

536
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
between being a child and being an adult?

537
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
And I haven't gone yet and Mage hasn't gone yet.

538
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Okay, well if you guys just want to grab it, I mean, go for it.

539
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Yeah, I wanted to say that the difference between me as a child and me now is mostly,

540
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,520
like my sense of humor is basically exactly the same.

541
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,520
And all of the things I like are like, you know, I still love all the things I liked as a kid.

542
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
YouTube poops.

543
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
Yeah, fuck it. I love YouTube poops.

544
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Pooping while watching YouTube, you know.

545
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
They're very, very good.

546
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,520
But like the difference is like, I've become more confident, which is obviously good.

547
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:47,520
And like being able to get over depression is another thing that I've just, through like the amount of times it's happened.

548
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,520
The amount of times he's died in Dark Souls is really hard to give to getting over depression.

549
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,520
But like, in terms of like not having like a focus as a kid, like I never knew what I wanted to do.

550
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:06,520
I always had multiple passions and multiple skills that were good and people would praise me at multiple skills.

551
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
What a humble brain.

552
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Which one?

553
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Yes. No, no, no, this is a good thing, but it's like it causes a problem because when you are good as a kid at multiple things

554
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,520
and you're praised equally, you don't know what you should do.

555
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,520
And I had like no focus and I would never actually got like very good at any one thing.

556
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Hippo was like Ebony Darkness Dimension Raven Way. He was too talented and everyone hated him.

557
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:40,520
I was too talented to succeed. But the thing I've learned, the thing that changed like a few years ago

558
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,520
is that I just realized you don't fucking need a focus. You don't need to know what you're doing.

559
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:53,520
You just need to do stuff and then you'll die and then people will pre-sit together for you.

560
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
You just have to start doing stuff.

561
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
I didn't die.

562
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Is that what you're getting at?

563
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Yeah.

564
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
No, just kill yourself.

565
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,520
I didn't mean it like that.

566
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
You'll die.

567
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:10,520
I think what you're saying is that like you don't, even if you don't know what your end goal is,

568
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,520
you can't like wait until you know what it is.

569
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
Yeah.

570
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Oh yeah.

571
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
The best thing is just to not...

572
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
You are dying right now.

573
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Yeah.

574
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,520
If you don't know what you're doing, like I didn't know what I was doing and I was agonizing over what I should get into,

575
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,520
what I should forge ahead with.

576
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,520
I just realized that it's just a big waste of time and anxiety, right?

577
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
Just to even think about it.

578
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,520
It's like people that are like, I'm going to start writing my book.

579
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm going to start drawing my comic or whatever, but I'm going to like flesh out the world.

580
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I'm going to spend like weeks and months and years just like writing notes,

581
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,520
fleshing out the world and it has to be complete before I actually start.

582
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
This is even worse.

583
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,520
This is the tip that you hear when I talk about...

584
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,520
I was just going to say my webcomic site, apsadventures.site,

585
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,520
is like exactly this whole like, it doesn't matter how good it is.

586
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
I'm just happy that I'm making it and it's cool.

587
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,520
That's what Beast Capades was.

588
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
I just started it with no real plan.

589
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
That's great.

590
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
And the plan developed.

591
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Giv, could you please explain to me the origin of Pumpk?

592
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Is it just like your avatar was the pumpkin?

593
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:25,520
In fucking Inktober 2016, I think, I was just like, I'll just draw because I wanted to get...

594
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
I always want to get better at drawing.

595
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
Inktober is an excuse.

596
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,520
I drew like one thing on the first day and then on the second day I drew a pumpkin girl

597
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,520
and I was like, dude, fucking sick.

598
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
And I really like...

599
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
More like Plumpk.

600
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Got him.

601
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Got him.

602
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Good.

603
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Please draw Plumpk, everyone.

604
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
We need Plumpk to fan art.

605
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
No, we do.

606
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:58,520
I'm really happy, by the way, that I invented the pun Gordjus, because she's a Gordjus.

607
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Yeah, she's gorgeous.

608
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Anyway, yeah, that was the origin.

609
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,520
I just drew it and then I took it into a comic.

610
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
You don't need to start off with a grand plan for your whole life.

611
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,520
And that's actually one of the good things about adulthood, if you can get yourself functional,

612
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,520
is that you either have to get a job or you're allowed to be in need, which is depressing in itself.

613
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,520
So let that be the motivation for your first initial goal.

614
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Make yourself, at least relatively independent,

615
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,520
you know, by funding your life through some form of art, any form of art.

616
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
I would not have gotten onto YouTube, by the way,

617
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,520
if I could have made just as much money doing anything else within the same timeframe.

618
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,520
But I got onto YouTube because it was the thing I liked the most

619
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,520
that I felt most plausible in being able to make money from.

620
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
I feel like there's something there. I feel like there's something there into that,

621
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,520
because I, too, I felt like my approach to, like, YouTube content specifically...

622
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,520
I still want to go ahead and answer the question, by the way.

623
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
You certainly will get one, mate. Just let me...

624
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
I just want to respond to this point directly.

625
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,520
It was just, like, there's something there of, like, when you're a child,

626
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,520
it's like you live in sort of a fantasy world of possibilities.

627
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,520
And, like, for me, that was, like, making big, like, best anime ever and, like, nothing else

628
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
and just taking as long as it took to get those done.

629
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,520
But adulthood is more of, like, you selectively cut off avenues

630
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,520
that are not practical and, like, you intentionally limit yourself

631
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,520
or you give yourself a more pragmatic way to survive,

632
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,520
which is what I've done with, like, Miyamafa and Wiago and stuff.

633
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,520
It's just an excuse to make content as kind of an acceptance that, like,

634
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,520
okay, it's true, like, I can't actually survive

635
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,520
just making crazy, big old projects every six months.

636
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
It won't work.

637
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
So, Michelle...

638
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,520
I just had the same reaction.

639
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,520
I assume people who just heard about Pearl Harbor being bombed had.

640
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,520
So you're saying that Wiago is going to be, like, your only content now?

641
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
Like, that's what's gonna happen?

642
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Absolutely not.

643
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Okay.

644
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Wiago has always been.

645
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
Wiago is a means to an end.

646
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,520
It is a support structure, a scaffolding,

647
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,520
upon which I can build my more complex projects.

648
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
That's what it is.

649
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,520
Do not fear, people. Do not fear.

650
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Go to Michelle eventually.

651
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
Okay.

652
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
2030.

653
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Okay, okay, wait.

654
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,520
As for me, I feel like in some ways I'm sort of the same person,

655
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,520
but there's definitely a big difference of how I used to be as a kid

656
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
and how I am now.

657
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,520
I'm specifically talking about my preteen years,

658
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,520
so, like, legit a kid, like, 11, 12, 11, and younger.

659
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,520
So we're illegitimately a kid in faith.

660
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
No, no, like, you know, when you say a kid,

661
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,520
sometimes people, you know, think 14, 16 and stuff.

662
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,520
I mean, I'm talking about, like, a childhood deer, you know, like a kid, like an animal.

663
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Everyone under 30 is a kid to me.

664
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Yeah.

665
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Well, I mean, you're just 29, but I'm wicked and nihilistic and cool and under.

666
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
I turn 30 in April, you cuck.

667
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
That's right, I forgot.

668
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Ben is gay.

669
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Ben says cuck now, guys.

670
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,520
Let Mage go so I can make fun of Ben more after she's done,

671
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
and I won't feel bad about cucking off Mage.

672
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Indeed.

673
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Yes, okay.

674
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,520
So, yeah, when I was a kid, I was very extroverted, I'd say.

675
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,520
I, my mom had to lay, for years, she had to teach me not to greet strangers,

676
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
because in my mind, I was like,

677
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
oh, hey, a person, I should greet them,

678
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
because that's the polite thing to do.

679
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,520
So I would greet people, even random strangers on the street,

680
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,520
and she had to teach it out of me for several years,

681
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
because I refused, because that was rude.

682
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
How can you not greet someone when you see them,

683
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
when you make eye contact?

684
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
You must greet them.

685
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Break that curiosity and friendliness out of your child right now,

686
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
beat that shit out of them,

687
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
make sure they're scared to communicate with other humans.

688
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
That's the way to go.

689
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Yeah.

690
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,520
I wasn't scared of people like at all.

691
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,520
I, like I said, I'd greet them,

692
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
and I would fight other kids as well.

693
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Like Dragon Ball Z was a big thing,

694
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,520
but even before Dragon Ball Z, I would like fight people,

695
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
either for fun or just...

696
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Majors fighting people before Dragon Ball Z made it cool, you guys.

697
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
The thing is, I'm gonna, I'm getting to it,

698
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,520
but yeah, like Dragon Ball Z did, did make fighting cool.

699
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,520
We had like the sort of like, I'd say like,

700
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
it's almost like a roleplay.

701
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
We all assigned names of the characters,

702
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,520
and I was, was it K-18, I think?

703
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,520
The girl, the cyborg, the girl one, the blonde one.

704
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
Android 18.

705
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Yeah.

706
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
She was called K-18, I think.

707
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
But yeah.

708
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Oh, okay.

709
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Yeah, so I was assigned that name,

710
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
and we would like sort of play fight,

711
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
but the fighting was, I mean...

712
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
But the fighting was real,

713
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,520
and the bruises were all too real.

714
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Yes, yes, and we would legit fight.

715
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,520
I would, I would take on the guys,

716
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
the guys stronger than me, like bigger than me.

717
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Oh, yeah.

718
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,520
I once almost won against like a teenager,

719
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
when I was like, I think 10,

720
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,520
but he cheated, he had to cheat to win against me,

721
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
to win against a little girl.

722
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
I'm sorry about that, but I'll wait till you're done.

723
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
Bring it back to team fighting,

724
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
because this is a big thing.

725
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Yeah, it was snowing, he used snow against me,

726
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
and that's how he was.

727
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
That's not true.

728
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
That's not true.

729
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Pocket sand is real sanction.

730
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
I want to like, acknowledge the like,

731
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,520
weird like cultural prejudice I have,

732
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,520
because we're just like, what do you call it?

733
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
The privilege goggles.

734
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Whenever you talk about being a childhood

735
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
in your home country,

736
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
I just imagine Lithuania is like,

737
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
this like bombed out third world nation

738
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
with like maybe like two streets,

739
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
and it's all color coded,

740
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
just like mage's avatar, it's all purple.

741
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
I just imagine that every time.

742
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
And everyone's fighting on this town.

743
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Think of cop kill town, look at that.

744
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Yeah, exactly like it.

745
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
Cathedral's everywhere.

746
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
I mean, you're not completely wrong.

747
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
It's very popular.

748
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,520
No, it's terrible.

749
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
I mean, I grew up.

750
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,520
A lot of dead cops in Lithuania, a lot of dead cops.

751
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
I grew up in post USSR.

752
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,520
Lithuania, there were like a lot of Russians

753
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,520
around a lot of chaos, I'd say.

754
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
Oh, God.

755
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I grew up with like, sometimes no electricity

756
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
and brown running water and stuff.

757
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
Oh, God.

758
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,520
I thought you were going to be like,

759
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,520
no, it wasn't that bad.

760
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
Yeah, me too.

761
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Mage is a feral child.

762
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
I know.

763
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
I was.

764
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
I would run around barefoot.

765
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
And your anime wasn't even dubbed right.

766
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Yeah.

767
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,520
When I was a kid, I ran around barefooted

768
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
and wielding knives.

769
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,520
It's like cop kill town.

770
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
It's like Neo Milwaukee.

771
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Just kids running around with like weapons.

772
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,520
You would feel right at home in Slime City.

773
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
You would feel right at home.

774
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,520
I have to say, for years, up until this very moment,

775
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
anytime we talked about Lithuania,

776
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
that was the picture I was getting,

777
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
but I thought that's clearly me projecting like,

778
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
oh, God.

779
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
It's a lot better now.

780
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Okay.

781
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Only adults run around the streets naked with knives.

782
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
That's the only way.

783
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
My neighborhood was terrible as well.

784
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
I heard rumors.

785
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Okay, I did see drunk people stumbling about,

786
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,520
but I did hear rumors about people using drugs

787
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
and stuff and selling drugs around.

788
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
I was disgusted.

789
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
I saw some weird nasty people,

790
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,520
but I never really saw them and thank goodness I didn't.

791
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
I did see discarded needles here and there,

792
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,520
but that's beside the point.

793
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
Anywho.

794
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
Nice.

795
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah, back to happy childhood times when I was a good kid.

796
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Yeah, so, yeah, like I would fight.

797
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Silence.

798
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Yeah, I would fight people.

799
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
I wasn't scared to pick fights with people.

800
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,520
I think my record is like two bloody noses.

801
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Wow.

802
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,520
What about now, mate?

803
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,520
You looking to start some shit?

804
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
I feel like you got shortchanged in the Royal Rumble.

805
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Yeah, I was going to say, yeah.

806
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,520
I would like to put a call out to the fan artists.

807
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
I want somebody to draw feral little mage

808
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
with dual-wielding knives in the purple streets.

809
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
Yeah, wait.

810
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
Bomb down to the streets.

811
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,520
How would you become the funny,

812
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,520
like girl-like,

813
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
girl-like,

814
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
girl-like,

815
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,520
girl-like,

816
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,520
the funny,

817
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,520
girl-timid,

818
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
draw-fan-art girl.

819
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
That's the power of fucking artistic expression.

820
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
We're all speaking the same language of

821
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,520
fluffy tumblr shit,

822
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,520
but then we have

823
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,520
totally different people from totally different fucking worlds.

824
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,520
It kind of blows my mind every time I hear shit like that.

825
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,520
You were always kicking people's asses,

826
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,520
but you were still like this?

827
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,520
No.

828
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
I was still generally good natured.

829
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Like,

830
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
the very first job that I wanted to have

831
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,520
that I remember was a veterinarian,

832
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,520
but then I learned what a veterinarian had to do

833
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,520
and then I was like,

834
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,520
my stomach's weak. I almost fainted the first time

835
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
we took our cat to the veterinarian.

836
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,520
So that dream died quick.

837
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,520
And

838
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,520
whenever me and my friends were bored,

839
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
I would get these schemes on how to help

840
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,520
the environment and nature and stuff.

841
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
It wasn't because the TV told me so.

842
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,520
Hey, you know what would be fun?

843
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
If we would take these brooms and take these rakes

844
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,520
and clean up the neighborhood.

845
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
That'd be a fun project for the day.

846
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
You know, Mage, that reminds me.

847
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
There's a story my mom tells me about

848
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
me as a child.

849
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,520
She was taking me to

850
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,520
summer camp and I was like,

851
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
oh, I don't want to go.

852
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,520
I'm going to be sad and I don't know anybody there.

853
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,520
And so she drops me off

854
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,520
and then this is from her perspective.

855
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,520
She comes by to pick me up.

856
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,520
And at the end of the day,

857
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
she's like, Nate, come here.

858
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,520
I crawl out of the woods

859
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,520
and I have my belt stuffed with pine cones.

860
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,520
And I'm like,

861
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,520
I've got four sticks strapped to my back

862
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,520
and I'm dual wielding these big ol' limbs.

863
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,520
And I'm like, Mom,

864
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
I'm in the middle of something.

865
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
I need to come back later. We're dueling right now.

866
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,520
The shit is real.

867
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,520
Go away.

868
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,520
That's what happens.

869
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,520
Stick duels in the woods.

870
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
Stick duels are the best.

871
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,520
Stick duels were a major part of my whole childhood,

872
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,520
where me and my friends

873
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
would go out into the woods

874
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,520
and just try to find

875
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
sticks that are about the size of

876
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
swords and

877
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
come back to the house and fight with them.

878
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,520
We would have a pretty sizable collection

879
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
because if they were good, you'd hold on to them until they break.

880
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,520
So we'd keep a pile

881
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
of all our really good sticks by the side of the house.

882
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,520
And then my friend

883
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,520
Marcus, who is like a

884
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,520
like a fucking built

885
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
action guy, he just loved to play around

886
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,520
with stuff like this anyways.

887
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,520
He would just film videos of himself

888
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,520
doing kung fu and shit in high school.

889
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,520
And so

890
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,520
we would just go into the backyard when he came over

891
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,520
and because he was really quiet and literally

892
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,520
just wouldn't talk or say anything, we'd be like

893
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,520
I guess we're just gonna fight with sticks.

894
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,520
That's what we'll do when he comes over.

895
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,520
So every time he came over, we'd just fight with

896
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,520
sticks until one of us got hurt

897
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,520
and didn't want to do it anymore.

898
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,520
My friend that I had in high school

899
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,520
told this story.

900
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,520
He would tell the story like it was true

901
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,520
and no one believed it, so it was really funny.

902
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,520
He said that some

903
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,520
like

904
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
dojo master

905
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,520
stick fighter had like

906
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
come to his house one day and knocked on his door

907
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
looking for him specifically

908
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
and challenged

909
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,520
Who was this? Which one was this been?

910
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Started with a J.

911
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,520
Okay, okay, I got you.

912
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,520
And then he had challenged him just specifically

913
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,520
and he had dueled him in his backyard at stick fighting

914
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,520
and he had won.

915
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,520
So, you know.

916
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,520
Damn J.

917
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,520
This is unrelatable to me.

918
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,520
This stick wielding experience, not only because

919
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
I don't live next to a forge, but also

920
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,520
like again, I'm post going outside.

921
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Going outside was not an option when I was growing up.

922
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Like you couldn't do it anymore.

923
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
Was it dangerous or something?

924
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,520
Well, it was a combination.

925
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,520
It was really hot in California.

926
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,520
It was a combination of it being drilled into.

927
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,520
It was like don't go outside, there are strangers there

928
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,520
and also there are video games now.

929
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,520
I mean, Munchy, that was a thing when I was a kid

930
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,520
right before I was a kid as well.

931
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,520
It's like what, the late 80s at least?

932
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,520
I just got to very briefly mention

933
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,520
my brother got big into stick fighting.

934
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
What he would specifically do is go to the hardware store

935
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,520
get a big old plank and then sand it down

936
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,520
to where it becomes like an actual weapon

937
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,520
and I think like if you

938
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,520
honored him in battle in combat with a regular stick,

939
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,520
he would eventually like get one for you

940
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,520
and help you make your own.

941
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,520
So I ended up getting one, but yeah.

942
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,520
I think I need to take a step back to point out

943
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,520
that the ages that I would have stick fought

944
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,520
would have been ages like

945
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,520
12 to 17, which is the period

946
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,520
of time I have known Munchy.

947
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,520
So I know what Munchy's been doing

948
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,520
as opposed to stick fighting.

949
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
He's been in the PCP and drawing fan art

950
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
and sending me pickup lines on Tumblr.

951
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,520
Those are the fucking days, dude.

952
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
Those are the fucking days.

953
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,520
I still like reminisce and think about

954
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,520
how that's how we met.

955
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
That's how all of this happened

956
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,520
was I sent you, hey are you an archaeologist

957
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,520
because I've got a bone for you to pick.

958
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Bone to pick for you to examine.

959
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,520
I love it.

960
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,520
We have a whole section of this podcast

961
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,520
talking about the death of toys,

962
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,520
the death of going outside and the rise of video games.

963
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,520
That needs to be something we talk about in depth.

964
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,520
Instead of doing stick fighting

965
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,520
all that I do with my friends

966
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,520
was just play Smash Bros.

967
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Which is the same amount of pain

968
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
and shit talking.

969
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,520
I did that at the same time, too, though.

970
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,520
I could play Smash Bros. since I was 8

971
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,520
because I had the N64.

972
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,520
It's just whismical.

973
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Stick fighting was a younger man's game for me.

974
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
Video games are an old man's game

975
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,520
in my mind.

976
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,520
When I was 9

977
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,520
and younger at summer camp,

978
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,520
maybe between 9 and 12 or something,

979
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,520
those were peak stick fighting years

980
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,520
as I recall them.

981
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,520
But hey, I've got a story

982
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,520
which is relevant to this question

983
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,520
of what we like as a child versus an adult

984
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,520
only this is how I was exactly the same.

985
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,520
I know I've told similar stories

986
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,520
but I don't believe I've ever told this one

987
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,520
and I think everyone will appreciate it greatly.

988
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,520
I don't remember exactly

989
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,520
what was going through my mind at the time

990
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,520
but I was around

991
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,520
between 12 and 15 at this time.

992
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,520
Something in that range.

993
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,520
It was nighttime and it was summertime.

994
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,520
I don't know what was going on

995
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
but my parents went up to bed

996
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
and they were like, Nate, walk our dog

997
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
which was Buddy at the time, I think.

998
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,520
Yeah, Buddy was my muse.

999
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,520
And he...

1000
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,520
Three quarters peak and he's one quarter poodle

1001
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
for those wondering.

1002
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,520
I'm sure the audience was just dying to know.

1003
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,520
I'm adding richness to the scene.

1004
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,520
So imagine me with this little dog emperor

1005
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,520
on the leash taking a shit

1006
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,520
and here I stand.

1007
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,520
So the way that my parents

1008
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,520
are back yard was set up

1009
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
my parents' room is kind of up

1010
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,520
really high on the house

1011
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,520
and there's three layers down

1012
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,520
is where the grass is behind the house.

1013
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,520
Jesus Christ, what kind of house did you live in?

1014
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,520
I mean, there's the basement

1015
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,520
then the first floor, then the second floor

1016
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,520
and there's an attic

1017
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,520
but they're in the second floor, not the attic.

1018
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,520
There's a hill in the front of the house

1019
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,520
that doesn't go to the back so it gets lower.

1020
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,520
The basement was exposed in the back.

1021
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,520
Yeah, that's right.

1022
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,520
But whatever.

1023
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,520
Incidentally, my parents are selling that soon but whatever.

1024
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
So the point was...

1025
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,520
This is the point.

1026
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,520
I'm walking buddy and I don't know

1027
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,520
I don't know what was going through my mind.

1028
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,520
I think it had been a late night of watching anime.

1029
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,520
That's how all terrible ideas started.

1030
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
That's right, that's right.

1031
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,520
Was it Adult Swim?

1032
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,520
It was definitely Adult Swim.

1033
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,520
Or maybe Toonami or something.

1034
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,520
One of my stories was on

1035
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,520
and I don't know what was going through my mind

1036
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,520
but I was thinking about the future

1037
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,520
and I was thinking about what I was going to do with myself

1038
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,520
as life went on and I wasn't talking to buddy

1039
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,520
or anything, I was talking to myself

1040
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
and I'm just like...

1041
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,520
I'm not.

1042
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,520
I'm not going to be a cog in the machine.

1043
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,520
I'm not

1044
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,520
going to be a cog in the machine.

1045
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,520
I'm going to achieve my destiny.

1046
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,520
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

1047
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,520
I'm going to make it in this world and be important.

1048
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,520
So I was just talking to myself loudly

1049
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,520
just repeating these mantras

1050
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,520
to myself based on, like, I don't know,

1051
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,520
a tri-gun episode I just watched

1052
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,520
or a couple of bebop or something.

1053
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,520
Like you do.

1054
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,520
That's what was going on.

1055
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,520
Were you wearing your entire HD hat while you did this?

1056
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,520
You know, I should have been.

1057
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,520
If I thought to gather it, I would have.

1058
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,520
Not much happened in that story.

1059
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,520
Not much happened in that story.

1060
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,520
Okay, well this is the important part.

1061
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,520
It's that afterward, so the next day

1062
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,520
I'm just at breakfast,

1063
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,520
whatever, and I'm sitting there,

1064
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,520
I'm eating breakfast, and then mom,

1065
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,520
my mom just leans down over the countertop,

1066
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,520
looks at me with her big eyes

1067
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,520
the way they look at an oncoming train

1068
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,520
and says, uh, so,

1069
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,520
not going to be a cog in the machine, huh?

1070
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,520
No!

1071
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,520
No!

1072
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
Get the fuck in there.

1073
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,520
They had heard everything.

1074
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,520
That's so terrible.

1075
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,520
My words.

1076
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,520
How could you do that to someone?

1077
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,520
How could you do that to your son?

1078
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,520
I would have died right on the spot.

1079
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,520
I would have died right there.

1080
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,520
Speaking of embarrassing Nate's stories,

1081
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,520
will you tell us about

1082
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,520
the story of the, um...

1083
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,520
The talent show?

1084
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,520
Is that the one? Okay, yes.

1085
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,520
I don't know if I've ever told this,

1086
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,520
so I'll tell this one quicker than that one.

1087
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
So it was just, in high school,

1088
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,520
I thought I was the shit, and this was like, um...

1089
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,520
Which you were, evidently.

1090
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,520
Which I was. It was either freshman or sophomore year.

1091
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,520
Whatever, it doesn't matter. The point was,

1092
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,520
oh god, I'm still hurting.

1093
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,520
I'm still hurting from the climax.

1094
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,520
It was absolutely devastating.

1095
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,520
And I'm sure dad had heard it too,

1096
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,520
and they just colored their...

1097
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,520
Imagine them up there.

1098
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,520
Imagine they're up in their room.

1099
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,520
They heard you, and then they talked about it,

1100
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,520
like, when they were in bed again.

1101
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,520
They were up there.

1102
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,520
I'm upset with them.

1103
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,520
It was cruel.

1104
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,520
I mean, there's nothing they could have said,

1105
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,520
like, Nate, we can hear you.

1106
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,520
Shut the hell up.

1107
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,520
They could have just not said anything.

1108
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,520
Well, they didn't have to.

1109
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,520
That story reminded me of a very short one

1110
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,520
from when I was like 12 or 13,

1111
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
maybe a little older.

1112
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,520
Somewhere in the early teens,

1113
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,520
and I had woken up,

1114
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,520
jacked off,

1115
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,520
and I was like,

1116
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,520
I was about to leave my bedroom.

1117
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,520
He started off the day,

1118
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,520
groggy, like, I don't want to leave the bedroom,

1119
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,520
but I was younger.

1120
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,520
I had to look out to make sure that nobody was around

1121
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
before I left my bedroom.

1122
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,520
I didn't want to be bothered until I had time

1123
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
to wake up and be able to talk to people.

1124
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,520
So I was listening in

1125
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,520
to the downstairs to see what was going on,

1126
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,520
and I could hear my grandma talking to my mom,

1127
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,520
and she's like,

1128
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,520
well, why don't you go wake him up?

1129
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,520
Because that's how she sounds.

1130
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,520
And my mom's like, well, he sleeps naked,

1131
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,520
and I don't want to sleep naked.

1132
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,520
She goes, he just does that so he can touch himself.

1133
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
And I was like, oh my god.

1134
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
And literally,

1135
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,520
I was just like, well, I mean,

1136
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,520
yeah.

1137
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
I think that says more about your grandma

1138
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,520
than about you.

1139
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,520
It does.

1140
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,520
Well, that's interesting nonetheless.

1141
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,520
It says the same about both of us, actually,

1142
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,520
because she was right.

1143
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,520
There's things to be learned.

1144
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,520
Obviously, that's true,

1145
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,520
but I think it speaks something

1146
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,520
that she felt the need to point it out.

1147
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,520
Your grandma's logic doesn't make sense.

1148
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,520
Well, don't mind the fact that he's naked.

1149
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,520
He does that for purposes of masturbation.

1150
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,520
That means there's no reason to not go to the room.

1151
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,520
That's really refute.

1152
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,520
Yeah, it doesn't.

1153
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,520
Guys, quick question.

1154
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,520
When you were a kid,

1155
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,520
did you ever worry about secret cameras

1156
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,520
in your house?

1157
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,520
No.

1158
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,520
Well, I didn't grow up in a former Soviet Union country.

1159
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,520
Well, as a matter of fact,

1160
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,520
our dad did set up a camera

1161
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,520
in the basement at one point,

1162
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,520
which was most likely to keep it.

1163
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,520
Oh, I forgot. I thought it was on the outside,

1164
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,520
but no, there was one on the inside for a while.

1165
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,520
Wait, are you sure? I remember being outside,

1166
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
but he could look in with it.

1167
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,520
That's what I remember.

1168
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,520
I remember him saying knowingly,

1169
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,520
when you had some friends over,

1170
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,520
I'll just be keeping an eye on the outside,

1171
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,520
but maybe I'll take a look on the inside.

1172
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,520
I'll just be watching through my surveillance camera.

1173
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,520
Yeah, don't worry. Our dad's a fucking creep.

1174
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,520
Oh, he didn't think

1175
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,520
of the consequences of how we'd feel.

1176
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,520
The consequences.

1177
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,520
He's a silly man.

1178
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,520
The consequences that I was unsettled by him

1179
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,520
generally.

1180
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,520
Help me ruminate on this.

1181
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,520
Because this is a real thing of thought that I have.

1182
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
I think that hiding stuff from your parents

1183
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,520
is literally like a good healthy thing to do.

1184
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,520
Yes.

1185
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,520
It will help breed individualism

1186
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,520
and make you more independent as a person.

1187
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,520
An adult does not need to know

1188
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,520
when you start whacking off.

1189
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,520
It's just like what?

1190
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
I don't necessarily agree with you, Munchy,

1191
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,520
but I think that the problem,

1192
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,520
the reason I don't agree with you,

1193
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,520
is that ideally you wouldn't have

1194
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,520
to hide things from your parents,

1195
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,520
because your parents would have a better understanding of you.

1196
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,520
The only reason I did this is because

1197
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,520
I think it's a fundamental question

1198
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,520
of human nature as opposed to a good

1199
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,520
relationship with your children.

1200
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,520
I straight up don't think a child

1201
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,520
ever should pass along the information

1202
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,520
as to whether or not they jack off.

1203
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,520
Okay, you don't have to tell me.

1204
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,520
I will know that.

1205
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Yeah.

1206
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,520
The reason you have to hide from your...

1207
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,520
Sorry.

1208
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,520
I have to say this.

1209
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,520
The reason you have to hide from your parents

1210
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,520
is that they refuse

1211
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,520
to be in the reality

1212
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,520
you are actually in.

1213
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,520
I don't want to be in the reality

1214
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,520
when my son is jacking off.

1215
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,520
Your son is going to jack off.

1216
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,520
That happens. They all do it.

1217
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,520
If your son is like

1218
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,520
13, 14,

1219
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
you should just know.

1220
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,520
He's probably jacking off.

1221
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,520
You should know better.

1222
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,520
A lot of parents just try to

1223
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,520
live in the universe in their own mind

1224
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,520
where you don't do the things

1225
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,520
that they don't want you to do.

1226
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,520
A lot of the time it's not a matter of

1227
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,520
not wanting to accept it.

1228
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
It's just not wanting to believe

1229
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
in the sense that you don't have

1230
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,520
the attention to it.

1231
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,520
Why would they not want that?

1232
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,520
Because

1233
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,520
it makes

1234
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,520
for a society that

1235
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,520
can change.

1236
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
Nobody wants a kid that is just obedient.

1237
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,520
Because

1238
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,520
they need to rebel in some way.

1239
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,520
It's not about the parents knowing.

1240
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,520
No, because leadership.

1241
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,520
It's about the kid taking the initiative

1242
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,520
to not tell them certain things.

1243
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,520
I think that

1244
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,520
the way that we often...

1245
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,520
the systems in which discipline is instilled

1246
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,520
in the military

1247
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,520
is that you have

1248
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,520
an extreme authoritarian figure

1249
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,520
grinding you into the ground

1250
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,520
and they are also

1251
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,520
they have total control over you.

1252
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,520
That can make you

1253
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,520
experience ego death

1254
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,520
in a similar kind of way where

1255
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,520
you can gain maturity

1256
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,520
by looking past yourself.

1257
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,520
I do think there's also

1258
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,520
good reasons, good things you can learn

1259
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,520
by learning to deceive

1260
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,520
people who are wrong.

1261
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,520
The reason you should lie to your parents

1262
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,520
is that they're probably wrong.

1263
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,520
But if your parents are

1264
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,520
communicating with you

1265
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,520
and you have a good relationship

1266
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,520
what are you going to hide from them?

1267
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,520
You can't just make up shit to hide from your parents

1268
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,520
just to learn that lesson.

1269
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,520
Your parents can just teach you

1270
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,520
that lesson.

1271
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,520
There will be differences.

1272
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,520
I'm going to teach my kids to hide a lot of things from school.

1273
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,520
I'm going to teach them to hide a lot of things from...

1274
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,520
How much you are going to have in common with your kids?

1275
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,520
You are way overestimating.

1276
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
I am not saying that I am going to do

1277
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,520
a perfect job raising my kids

1278
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,520
and go through all... I'm just saying that in an ideal...

1279
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,520
I'm saying philosophically why your point is incorrect

1280
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,520
because no parent alive

1281
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,520
should ever know everything their children do.

1282
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
I can't imagine any of us having children.

1283
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,520
Why do you need to know?

1284
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,520
There's a huge difference between knowing everything

1285
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,520
they do and hiding

1286
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,520
things from your parents.

1287
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,520
If someone goes and takes a dump

1288
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,520
and you don't tell me that you went to take a dump

1289
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,520
you're not hiding it from me.

1290
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
That's a good example

1291
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
because taking a shit

1292
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,520
is an embarrassing thing to do

1293
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,520
just as a human being.

1294
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,520
It just is. People don't really want to talk about it.

1295
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,520
If you're stupid...

1296
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,520
But what if it's a really impressive shit?

1297
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,520
That's one of the base...

1298
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,520
literally everyone does it

1299
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,520
and yet we're kind of embarrassed about it.

1300
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
It's just...

1301
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,520
I'm embarrassed about it because

1302
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,520
I think there are legitimate reasons

1303
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,520
to be embarrassed about shit

1304
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,520
and those are the reasons that I am.

1305
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,520
I don't want you to smell my shit because it smells bad.

1306
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,520
And I don't want to look at it

1307
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,520
because it looks gross.

1308
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,520
But the fact that someone takes a shit

1309
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,520
there are people out there

1310
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,520
there are women out there for instance

1311
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,520
who will not acknowledge the fact that they shit.

1312
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,520
I know them.

1313
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,520
Or they won't acknowledge that they fart

1314
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,520
and I'm like I don't give a fuck

1315
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,520
that you shit or fart because I do the same things

1316
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,520
and I'm not going to hold that against you

1317
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,520
but some people feel like they are expected

1318
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,520
to think those things are embarrassing

1319
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,520
and so they find them embarrassing.

1320
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,520
They're not using logic, they're using expectations.

1321
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,520
So I'm saying that

1322
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,520
in my idea of a perfect society

1323
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,520
it's one where

1324
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,520
we don't have to tell everyone

1325
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,520
everything that's going on

1326
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,520
because we should all have a level of understanding

1327
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,520
and trust in one another

1328
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
that we trust you to be doing something good.

1329
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,520
The reason that people come into contact with their parents

1330
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,520
is that those trust relationships break down

1331
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,520
because your parents do not

1332
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,520
set reasonable expectations for you.

1333
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,520
They want you to be perfect instead of being human

1334
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,520
even though they made you

1335
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,520
while being imperfect

1336
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,520
and being human and they don't understand

1337
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,520
how to be perfect.

1338
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,520
If you want to truly be

1339
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,520
on the level with your kids

1340
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
you have to be employing as much of an open mind

1341
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,520
and critical thinking as the child themselves

1342
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,520
is growing up.

1343
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,520
When I think of kids I'm thinking

1344
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,520
what is the most

1345
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,520
difficult and hard to relate to?

1346
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,520
Imagine if I, Ben St,

1347
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,520
were capable of the titanic feet

1348
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,520
of employing the level

1349
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,520
of critical thinking as a child.

1350
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,520
Imagine if you had the capability

1351
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,520
of listening

1352
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,520
instead of jutting in and interrupting

1353
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,520
to do in the middle of a statement.

1354
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,520
So the thing is

1355
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,520
the thing is

1356
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,520
I think my dad in particular

1357
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,520
never saw coming how little

1358
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,520
of a shit me and my siblings would care

1359
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,520
about Christianity because

1360
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,520
my dad came from a broken fucking house

1361
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,520
broken fucking family, broken fucking world

1362
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,520
so he needs this

1363
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,520
theological backbone

1364
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,520
but then he made the mistake of raising his children

1365
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,520
to be happy with life

1366
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,520
so it's like why the hell do I need

1367
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,520
a diadol narrative to back up

1368
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,520
conscious

1369
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,520
ability to make up a warning?

1370
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,520
I used to love Christianity up until

1371
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,520
someone told me that people actually believe

1372
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,520
the stories

1373
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,520
whoa!

1374
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,520
that's pretty bad

1375
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,520
that's post-soviet

1376
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,520
we're not just like

1377
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,520
we're not just role playing

1378
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,520
what I liked

1379
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,520
about it is just like

1380
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,520
it sounded to me like fairy tales

1381
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,520
and like oh it's just

1382
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,520
stories to teach a moral

1383
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,520
that's what I thought about it

1384
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,520
yeah it's a story time

1385
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,520
I used to take

1386
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,520
a class that he would teach

1387
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,520
Christianity

1388
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,520
I think wrote Roman Catholicism

1389
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,520
specifically

1390
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,520
basically in that class

1391
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,520
they just would tell the stories and I'd get to draw

1392
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,520
so it was like the perfect class

1393
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,520
once a month

1394
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,520
we have grape juice and crackers

1395
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,520
it's pretty good

1396
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,520
Catholicism is like the jock Christianity

1397
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,520
branch

1398
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,520
whereas the more Protestant

1399
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,520
particular education oriented

1400
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,520
actually like really seriously

1401
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,520
following the Bible to the letter is definitely

1402
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,520
the nerd group of Christianity

1403
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,520
it's like what Ted Cruz is all like

1404
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,520
I put it more in terms of

1405
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,520
the virgin Protestant

1406
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,520
versus the Chad Catholic

1407
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,520
someone make that shit

1408
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,520
it really is though

1409
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,520
actually fucking hilarious

1410
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,520
the Catholics are all about image

1411
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,520
and looking good and being popular

1412
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,520
whereas the

1413
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,520
Protestants and especially Baptists

1414
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,520
following the rules and being faithful

1415
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,520
correctly

1416
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,520
someone should draw

1417
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,520
the virgin Martin Luther

1418
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,520
the Chad Chad

1419
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,520
because someone making like the

1420
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,520
imagine if someone made the Chad Protestant

1421
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,520
it would come off as totally

1422
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,520
unironic and they really believe

1423
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,520
that they're cool

1424
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,520
the Chad

1425
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,520
the Catholic needs to

1426
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,520
have like eight names at least

1427
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,520
he needs to have like the name of

1428
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,520
every Baptist in his

1429
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,520
Virgil, Sanctius, Augustine

1430
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,520
the 14th

1431
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,520
do we?

1432
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,520
as people? yeah

1433
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,520
don't you get like the middle names from

1434
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,520
being like baptizer or whatever

1435
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,520
oh some no

1436
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,520
maybe Catholics do, I mean we were

1437
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,520
Protestant so like

1438
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,520
or someone like chooses like a given name

1439
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,520
like they choose like a biblical name

1440
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,520
when they get confirmed or something

1441
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,520
when I was young and getting confirmed

1442
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,520
I was mad at Catholics

1443
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,520
and I expressed this very autistically

1444
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,520
that I didn't get to choose like my own new name

1445
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,520
I really wanted the name Gabriel

1446
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,520
I thought it'd be cool but

1447
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,520
I was asking my dad what percentage of devoted Catholics

1448
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,520
do you think are going to go to heaven

1449
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,520
he said 25%

1450
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,520
wait but doesn't your dad believe in heaven

1451
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,520
and stuff though? yeah well my dad's just like

1452
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,520
basically one time

1453
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,520
me and my dad were talking about the idea of cult

1454
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,520
like people who take Christianity and then like

1455
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,520
have their own stupid idea of what it means

1456
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,520
and they take it too far and he's like oh well

1457
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,520
the whole Catholic Church is basically a cult

1458
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,520
and I said what percentage of them

1459
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,520
in spite of following Catholicism correctly

1460
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,520
are still like believing in God

1461
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,520
correctly he's like probably 25%

1462
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,520
those are the ones you're going to get to heaven

1463
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,520
why wouldn't it be zero?

1464
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,520
there's a lot of looseness

1465
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,520
because you're a Protestant you've already

1466
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,520
deviated majorly like from the codified

1467
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,520
original Catholic shit

1468
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,520
so like it's loosey goosey out here

1469
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,520
Catholicism also deviates from Judaism

1470
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,520
so you know

1471
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,520
well I mean because Jesus

1472
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,520
well I imagine the number for Jews

1473
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,520
is 0%

1474
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,520
oh I probably

1475
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,520
whatever what the fuck was I even talking about

1476
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,520
talking about my dad, talking about relating to your kids

1477
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,520
so I'm thinking okay I need to be prepared

1478
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,520
because my parents also like

1479
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,520
projected the fact that when they wanted to

1480
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,520
homeschool their kids onto the fact that

1481
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,520
they would have done really good that they suddenly had to do homeschool

1482
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,520
because going to public schools

1483
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,520
is a much bigger pain in the ass

1484
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,520
the thing about homeschool is if you're fucking disciplined

1485
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,520
you can just get all your work done immediately

1486
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,520
and like the light world is your oyster

1487
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,520
the problem is it's so easy

1488
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,520
it's such a much more efficient way of doing it

1489
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,520
that it's really fucking boring and hard to like pay attention

1490
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,520
right? so like we just barely

1491
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,520
squeaked our way through it but my parents didn't

1492
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,520
get why it would be hard

1493
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,520
for that reason they couldn't relate

1494
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,520
so I need to be prepared I need to like basically

1495
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,520
hope that my kids are as

1496
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,520
unrelatable to me as possible so I'm imagining them like

1497
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,520
not being into video games at all

1498
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,520
or art just being fucking chads

1499
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,520
they want to do sports I need to prepare for that

1500
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,520
also political views

1501
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,520
like how the world is

1502
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,520
because we think oh old people are so stupid

1503
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,520
for not understanding

1504
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,520
every color is the same level of human

1505
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,520
no like fucking racism is bad

1506
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,520
but in a

1507
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,520
generation or two who knows where it could

1508
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,520
evolve into a degree that we now are

1509
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,520
fuddy duddy so I'm just basically going to

1510
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,520
assume that being a fucking

1511
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,520
anti-SJW racist is gonna be

1512
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,520
popular in like 2020

1513
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,520
or like 2030 or so

1514
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,520
it's already getting pretty hot

1515
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,520
it's already getting pretty hot

1516
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,520
and also like respecting

1517
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,520
things are heating up

1518
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,520
having a respect

1519
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,520
will be seen as wrong

1520
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,520
there'll be all these like woke like fucking

1521
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,520
parables about how

1522
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,520
having a listening to the other side is wrong

1523
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,520
trying to be respectful to someone over

1524
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,520
disagreement is like all like it's lies

1525
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,520
right? I need to be prepared

1526
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,520
for my kids to have that ideology

1527
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,520
that I think is just completely wrong

1528
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,520
so that I could be prepared

1529
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,520
and act cool about it be like uh huh

1530
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,520
that's your belief?

1531
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,520
oh really? you believe that?

1532
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,520
you don't understand

1533
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,520
just like any parent

1534
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,520
what if you act all like

1535
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,520
befuddled about it?

1536
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,520
I've never heard of a person who actually blows up

1537
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,520
and says what you're doing something

1538
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,520
new get out of here

1539
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,520
I've never heard of a person has a parent like that

1540
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,520
oh I know

1541
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,520
I have friends who have parents

1542
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,520
who are just like

1543
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,520
I mean it's like

1544
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,520
if you're a parent and like for whatever reason

1545
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,520
if your world view comes

1546
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,520
majorly in conflict with like what your child

1547
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,520
chooses to do with their life

1548
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,520
like it has to be in a serious major way

1549
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,520
that's really the only way I can see it

1550
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,520
I'll just give you some perspective

1551
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,520
I have a friend who's mom

1552
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,520
this was when Pokemon Go was first coming out

1553
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,520
possibly one of the only

1554
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,520
old people in existence who was still

1555
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,520
writing the Pokemon's demonic line

1556
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,520
even when Pokemon Go made a popular movie

1557
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,520
whoa that's retro

1558
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,520
I know right?

1559
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,520
she found a fake article

1560
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,520
in which there was a fake interview

1561
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,520
with the guy who created Pokemon

1562
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,520
who in this fake interview says

1563
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,520
that he made Pokemon specifically to convert

1564
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,520
Western children to Satanism

1565
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,520
and she thought it was real

1566
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,520
and sent it to my friend

1567
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,520
her daughter saying this is why you shouldn't play Pokemon

1568
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,520
she thought it was real

1569
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,520
does her dad work at Nintendo?

1570
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,520
is that how she knew?

1571
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,520
we interviewed a Japanese entrepreneur

1572
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,520
Ken Pokemon

1573
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,520
we asked him why

1574
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,520
my friend told her

1575
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,520
that's a fake article and she's like

1576
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,520
it might be but what it's saying

1577
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,520
is ultimately true

1578
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,520
dare we take that chance?

1579
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,520
it's enlightening that her answer

1580
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,520
does not hinge at all

1581
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,520
on whether it is fake

1582
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,520
she's the kind of parent

1583
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,520
who will be like that

1584
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,520
she will actually do a gasp

1585
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,520
my friend said it was really hard

1586
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,520
drop her monocle

1587
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,520
what's the rule we established

1588
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,520
one person says one thing

1589
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,520
and another person says the same thing

1590
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,520
it must be true

1591
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,520
my friend said it was really hard

1592
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,520
for her to learn how to drive

1593
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,520
and her mom

1594
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,520
if anything might be dangerous

1595
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,520
happening in the car

1596
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,520
I would gasp and freak my friend

1597
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,520
be like

1598
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,520
there are definitely parents

1599
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,520
you will go

1600
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,520
juggling knives in the car

1601
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,520
that's slightly dangerous

1602
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,520
I would gasp if I was in danger of automobile

1603
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,520
more like

1604
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,520
it's time for you to slow down at the stop sign

1605
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,520
and you are in no way

1606
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,520
you're not taking too long

1607
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,520
to slow down but I'm worried you might not

1608
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,520
so I'm going to gasp

1609
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,520
I kind of know what that's like

1610
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,520
to drive these days is pretty terrifying

1611
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,520
when you're not in control

1612
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,520
indeed

1613
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,520
what would you guys do at school like

1614
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,520
would you guys be happy in school

1615
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,520
insert the entire school

1616
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,520
podcast here please

1617
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,520
is there really anyone

1618
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,520
on earth that was unironically happy

1619
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,520
in school

1620
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,520
when I was a kid I loved school

1621
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,520
when I was a teenager I hated school

1622
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,520
I mean

1623
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,520
it could have been good at school

1624
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,520
I was happy at school

1625
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,520
if you look at me now

1626
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,520
you would probably think

1627
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,520
we didn't really have bullies

1628
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,520
in my school

1629
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,520
that didn't really go on

1630
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,520
nobody got beat up or anything

1631
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,520
I felt

1632
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,520
everyone was way too high to worry about that

1633
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,520
I felt ostracized

1634
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,520
and I felt like a nerd

1635
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,520
and a social pariah

1636
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,520
but looking back I had a clicker too

1637
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,520
that I was pretty tight with

1638
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,520
jokes in class and people would laugh

1639
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,520
and stuff

1640
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,520
I remember a cracked article

1641
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,520
and any time I said a cracked article

1642
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,520
I always want to say it because I don't trust cracked

1643
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,520
that much but they said

1644
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,520
there was an article that mentioned

1645
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,520
that the kids who shot up Columbine

1646
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,520
they were not bullied

1647
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,520
they just have a huge victim complex

1648
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,520
yeah

1649
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,520
I mean

1650
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,520
same goes for Elliott

1651
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,520
Roger

1652
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,520
he actually got turned down by any women

1653
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,520
he just

1654
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,520
never got offered

1655
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,520
he got turned down

1656
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,520
at least once

1657
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,520
not enough

1658
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,520
the fault lies

1659
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,520
most of it was just him from afar

1660
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,520
looking at women and being like they would never accept me

1661
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,520
what was Gib saying though

1662
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,520
he was chiming in

1663
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,520
do you love

1664
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,520
Elliott Roger as much as we

1665
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,520
the conversation changed

1666
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,520
and I forgot what I was going to say

1667
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,520
the topic is childhood

1668
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,520
my whole experience

1669
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,520
of school was the first day of school

1670
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,520
I got on the bus and I distinctly

1671
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,520
remember that like

1672
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,520
I cried because I had to let go of my mom

1673
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,520
I had never been like outside

1674
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,520
of like eyesight of my mom basically

1675
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,520
by this point

1676
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,520
when I get on the bus and I go like right to the back

1677
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,520
and I'm looking out her through the back window

1678
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,520
and she's waving and I'm crying

1679
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,520
and it was misery for

1680
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,520
like 12 years

1681
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,520
I want to quickly say

1682
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,520
it's weird like did she say like that's the

1683
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,520
the first time he you know

1684
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,520
he wasn't with an eye shut of his mom

1685
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,520
like remember my wild days

1686
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,520
when I was a kid like around five years or so

1687
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,520
like my parents would just let me go

1688
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,520
into the neighborhood and I was not

1689
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,520
supervised five years old

1690
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,520
yeah well mage it's different when you're raised

1691
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,520
by wolves it's a different sort of

1692
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,520
dynamic you know there

1693
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,520
yeah it's interesting like

1694
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,520
right now it's dangerous and probably

1695
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,520
no one would let their kids go off

1696
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,520
it's actually safer than it's ever been

1697
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,520
statistically it's just

1698
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,520
it had nothing to do with it being dangerous

1699
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,520
where my parents are not allowing me

1700
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,520
I had no interest in being outside

1701
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,520
the eyesight of my mom so

1702
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,520
yeah and I'm just saying in general

1703
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,520
like nowadays like no

1704
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,520
no self-respecting

1705
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,520
the perception the what are they called

1706
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,520
hover parents or whatever the hovercraft

1707
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,520
whatever

1708
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,520
all parents are beta orbiters of their children

1709
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,520
beta orbiters

1710
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,520
that's a problem

1711
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,520
all parents have been

1712
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,520
totally friends

1713
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,520
totally fucking talking about this now

1714
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,520
let's talk about the death of going outside

1715
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,520
let's not talk about that right now

1716
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,520
because I was walking around my old childhood

1717
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,520
ruins for devious reasons

1718
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,520
that will not disclose

1719
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,520
I was walking around like like old schoolyards

1720
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,520
and stuff like that and I've noticed that I still

1721
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,520
have the feeling two this day like years after

1722
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,520
I moved out of like my elementary middle school and stuff

1723
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,520
where when I'm in the car

1724
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,520
and like we turn in

1725
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,520
to go to school and we turn in the same

1726
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,520
turn that I've been like I went to

1727
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,520
when I was in school I still get the

1728
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,520
pit of anxiety and like

1729
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,520
oh god it's really happening like I'm going

1730
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,520
to school today like it's like

1731
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,520
I'm ready I'm ready to go into homeroom

1732
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,520
oh god like years like

1733
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,520
even I was going to my kindergarten elementary

1734
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,520
school and I turned

1735
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,520
into the complex and I felt a pit

1736
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,520
of despair growing my stomach

1737
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,520
and I felt I was going to go

1738
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,520
to school that day

1739
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,520
you know it's interesting like

1740
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,520
having not gone to school

1741
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,520
there's an interesting perception

1742
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,520
I get from people right

1743
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,520
whenever a new school a new fresh shooting

1744
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,520
happens right and we count up the

1745
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,520
bodies one two

1746
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,520
twelve bodies

1747
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,520
and so then you know the people

1748
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,520
have their opinions

1749
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,520
and what's funny is that there's something

1750
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,520
like both sides always agree on

1751
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,520
but they never like talk about this part

1752
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,520
so basically one

1753
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,520
side always goes so

1754
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,520
okay you know how we keep some

1755
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,520
a bunch of kids keep getting shot up and some

1756
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,520
kids decide to like grab guns and shoot kids

1757
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,520
in these giant prisons that we locked them

1758
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,520
up in for nine hours a day that they're all miserable

1759
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,520
and depressed in I think it's probably

1760
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,520
because of the video games they

1761
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,520
relaxed with when they come home that's

1762
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,520
what caused it right and then other people

1763
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,520
are like hey you know those giant buildings

1764
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,520
were like kids locked up for nine hours

1765
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,520
a day and feel miserable and depressed and anxious

1766
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,520
like their entire youths I think

1767
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,520
it's actually the fact that they have a weapon

1768
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,520
to shoot kids within the first place we should

1769
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,520
get rid of the weapon and I'm like hold on

1770
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,520
why are we addressing the fact that we're locking everyone

1771
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,520
up in these nine hour prisons for their entire

1772
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,520
youths that they're all terrified and depressed in

1773
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,520
like why not address that part of the issue

1774
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,520
excuse me I mean I

1775
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,520
yeah I mean you collect all the all the

1776
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,520
delicate exploding hundred point bonus

1777
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,520
you know bullet sponges in one place

1778
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,520
that I'm gonna want to get the high score

1779
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,520
we're not saying that you all deserve to lose

1780
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,520
your kids for help making us participate

1781
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,520
in this system just that maybe I don't feel as bad

1782
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,520
my favorite is the hot diggity demon

1783
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
tweet which was um

1784
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,520
new school gets shot up people

1785
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,520
ban guns me ban schools

1786
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,520
I think I retweeted that that was a great one

1787
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,520
when I went to college in the UK

1788
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,520
this is a slow down topic but I just want to

1789
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,520
quickly say Munchie let mage finish she's been

1790
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,520
tramming in die die

1791
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,520
when I went to college in the UK

1792
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,520
we had like first of

1793
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,520
all we had like lanyards so we wouldn't

1794
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,520
be able to access the

1795
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,520
the buildings unless we were allowed

1796
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,520
to and we also had metal detectors

1797
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,520
so we couldn't bring anything

1798
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,520
metal in them and UK doesn't even

1799
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,520
have guns so I think that's

1800
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,520
an interesting practice that made should

1801
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,520
be considered maybe

1802
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,520
it's an interesting

1803
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,520
thing I completely agree that schools need

1804
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,520
to be banned get rid of them now

1805
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,520
yeah I had a

1806
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,520
point and I forgot so continue and I'll think about it

1807
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,520
alright I have the thing about

1808
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,520
school I don't

1809
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,520
remember being on the school podcast I remember

1810
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,520
I think I missed it

1811
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,520
I wanted to be on it I don't want to go on to

1812
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,520
like a huge spiel but my basic

1813
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,520
thoughts on school is that

1814
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,520
I used to hate it

1815
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,520
obviously because that's what you're supposed to do

1816
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,520
um but like

1817
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,520
after checking my privilege after

1818
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,520
going through and remembering that

1819
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,520
I'm I'm actually

1820
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,520
like I'm a white boy

1821
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,520
and it was a pretty good school and it was pretty

1822
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,520
good and there were lots of nice people there

1823
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,520
I didn't actually have a terrible time I had

1824
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,520
a lot of like good like

1825
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,520
like um like the art department

1826
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,520
at my school was quite nice

1827
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,520
and the teachers were chill and they

1828
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,520
would let me stay behind like after

1829
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,520
school to just work on the teachers were

1830
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,520
chill the school was lit the cafeteria

1831
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,520
was on the

1832
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,520
like like the average

1833
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,520
places to chill at

1834
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,520
so the obvious things about school were like

1835
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,520
uh yeah that some people it's

1836
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,520
social structures are shit

1837
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,520
a lot of teenagers are terrible and

1838
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,520
cliques are gay um

1839
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,520
and I was shy so like

1840
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,520
says member of the pcp hypocrite

1841
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,520
got him

1842
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,520
it was a good it was a good time

1843
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,520
if it wasn't the greatest but like

1844
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,520
I I appreciate school

1845
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,520
like when it's done right it's pretty

1846
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,520
good

1847
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,520
well school gave me the chance

1848
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,520
to rise the highest I have in my life

1849
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,520
and fall to my lowest point

1850
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,520
and that is the story that I was

1851
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,520
telling before and allow me to share

1852
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,520
it briefly now it was

1853
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,520
it was just um so when I was

1854
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,520
I think I was um everyone knows that

1855
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,520
I was a god as a young child

1856
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,520
I was the ultimate dodgeball champion

1857
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,520
I was I could do 50 pull-ups in high school

1858
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,520
I uh I just I

1859
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,520
I had hair down to my waist I was just

1860
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,520
a god just in every possible way

1861
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,520
um I wore those

1862
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,520
in Kingdom Hearts wristbands every day

1863
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,520
um

1864
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,520
that's how you know that's how you know

1865
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,520
that's how you know I wore weighted

1866
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,520
leg braces because I wanted to fucking be Goku

1867
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,520
okay but anyway the point is um

1868
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,520
I actually developed a bit of a fan

1869
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,520
club in uh

1870
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,520
in high school there was like three girls

1871
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,520
who would call themselves this

1872
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,520
and I I occasionally get creepy

1873
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,520
Facebook messages from them up until

1874
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,520
last year um really

1875
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,520
yeah it's true I just

1876
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,520
had to check uh I got back into Facebook

1877
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,520
and I yeah yeah last year I got another one

1878
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,520
but anyway the point is

1879
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,520
because I like

1880
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,520
one time okay one time

1881
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,520
I mean there's that one time

1882
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,520
a friend of mine walked up to me

1883
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,520
and said hey Nate that's my friend

1884
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,520
Jessica she wants to date you I looked up

1885
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,520
I saw her and I said that's nice and went

1886
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,520
back to reading like one piece or

1887
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,520
or two or something that's

1888
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,520
that's why did

1889
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,520
why did you say that sense why was that your response

1890
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,520
was like nervous or like you know

1891
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,520
did you not like or were you just not

1892
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,520
interested in the entire endeavor

1893
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,520
at this point in my life I just had like

1894
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,520
no interest in girls really

1895
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,520
I mean I did have a crush on a girl but

1896
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,520
I don't know it was like it was more like platonic

1897
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,520
I guess like I wasn't thinking about fucking or anything

1898
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,520
I don't know Jesus how I get

1899
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,520
it I didn't want to fucking go back

1900
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,520
I didn't want to go back to school either

1901
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,520
well I did a little bit but I would have

1902
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,520
been nervous about like when I was young I was

1903
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,520
like legit scared of alcohol and I think I was

1904
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,520
the same way kind of scared of sex because

1905
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,520
like I didn't understand it was like a foreign world

1906
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,520
I was like ah what does this mean

1907
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,520
I thought that sex was like bad and something

1908
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,520
that only like the bad kids did because

1909
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,520
people weren't supposed to and I was like

1910
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,520
I'm better than them because I'm not

1911
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,520
doing that bad thing and I mean I was

1912
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,520
a kissless virgin up until like my fucking

1913
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,520
twenties so you know that was

1914
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,520
weird um anyway

1915
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,520
anyway so the story goes that

1916
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,520
I believe it was sophomore year and

1917
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,520
the talent show is coming up and I thought

1918
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,520
I'm gonna fucking ace this like I ace everything

1919
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,520
um and maybe

1920
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,520
whatever I like

1921
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,520
and just to paint the picture I took

1922
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,520
all AP classes I could

1923
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,520
take even when I wasn't good enough

1924
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,520
to handle like I never got lower than like I don't know like a C

1925
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,520
or you know the B's

1926
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,520
and C's I was a student but I took all

1927
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,520
AP classes because I

1928
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,520
would not it would hurt me too deeply

1929
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,520
in my pride to not take

1930
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,520
the hardest possible classes that were available

1931
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,520
even though the valedictorian herself like

1932
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,520
just did not do that because there was no point

1933
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,520
the point is

1934
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,520
I'm characterizing myself as an asshole

1935
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,520
egomaniac okay but the point is

1936
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,520
uh there's a talent show

1937
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,520
the talent show comes up

1938
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,520
and I've decided I'm going

1939
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,520
to choreograph my own dancing thing

1940
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,520
and I'm gonna dance to another one bites the dust

1941
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,520
and sing with Freddie Mercury and so I do that

1942
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,520
I choreograph it and I get up there

1943
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,520
and I sing and dance uh

1944
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,520
and I they they count down

1945
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,520
the who are the winners and I just think to myself

1946
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,520
oh of course I'm gonna win this

1947
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,520
but then I don't and it was humiliating

1948
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,520
and I didn't make any sense to me and it was the worst

1949
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,520
time of my life that's it

1950
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,520
that's it that's it terrible

1951
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,520
I thought it would give you like everyone booed you or like you made a fool of yourself

1952
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,520
you didn't you know everyone well you don't understand

1953
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,520
I don't care what other people think of me

1954
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,520
it's only what I think other people think of me

1955
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,520
that matters to me wait that doesn't make any fucking

1956
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,520
sense um anyway

1957
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,520
that's hard that's hard

1958
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,520
it was 80% build up and and like

1959
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,520
2% like oh here's

1960
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,520
as all my stories are

1961
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,520
like half to nothing

1962
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,520
have I told the story about

1963
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,520
have I told the story about thinking that I got

1964
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,520
the role that I wanted to in the school play

1965
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,520
but then it was actually his wife

1966
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,520
that's right

1967
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,520
I won't repeat it then

1968
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,520
uh

1969
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,520
if I could go back to talking like at the very beginning

1970
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,520
oh wait mage hasn't heard it

1971
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,520
okay let me say but the audience has

1972
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,520
let me say it real quick real quick

1973
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,520
I

1974
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,520
I auditioned for a play

1975
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,520
even mage doesn't want to hear it

1976
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,520
no no no I do want to hear it

1977
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
I just don't want to take up everyone's time

1978
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,520
no you're not my friend anymore

1979
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,520
every small audience member was probably like

1980
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,520
oh you forgot about this to say

1981
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,520
there are like a thousand like loose threads

1982
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,520
in this podcast

1983
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,520
the reason I rushed through that one because I thought

1984
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,520
I had totally dropped off

1985
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,520
whatever

1986
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,520
I want to go back to one of the very first questions was

1987
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,520
did you want to know how I became

1988
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,520
the mature and by mature

1989
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,520
I mean insane person you say

1990
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,520
for you

1991
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,520
this is where I reveal the fact that I am actually

1992
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,520
the main girl from Karakana

1993
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,520
but instead of being beautiful and elegant

1994
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,520
I'm actually inconceivable and a maniac

1995
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,520
so

1996
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,520
when I was like a little kid

1997
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,520
all I cared about was having like the approval

1998
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,520
of like adults I didn't care about the other kids

1999
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,520
that liked me I didn't care about any of that

2000
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,520
all I wanted was like the praise

2001
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,520
oh wow like Anthony

2002
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,520
like thank you for helping me take out the trash

2003
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,520
you're so responsible

2004
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,520
you're so nice

2005
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,520
you're such a mature kid and I'm like

2006
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,520
fuck man I spent a couple of years

2007
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,520
all the time I've known you you've never docked your name to me

2008
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,520
now I can't be undone

2009
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,520
I've said this before on the podcast

2010
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
did you not know his name

2011
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,520
no

2012
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,520
I guess we know what level of friendship we're at

2013
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,520
DeVu

2014
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,520
anyway

2015
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,520
I was so hopped up on compliments

2016
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,520
I was straight up sniffing those

2017
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,520
that praise day in day out

2018
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,520
and so I wanted to like modify

2019
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,520
my behavior so I could maximize

2020
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,520
the compliments that I got

2021
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,520
so I talked about this a little bit on the sitcoms episode

2022
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,520
but it goes farther than this

2023
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,520
I basically like there was an age at like 10 or something

2024
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,520
I was like alright cartoons are kids shit

2025
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,520
like I can't do cartoons anymore

2026
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,520
it's all about sitcoms and like daytime television

2027
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,520
that's where all the mature adults are doing

2028
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,520
that's what that's what that's the new show

2029
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,520
that I was hooked up on

2030
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,520
I was watching Golden Girls

2031
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,520
I feel like this is good because you went through this so young

2032
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,520
that you got to like figure out that

2033
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,520
adults were dumb before you even were one

2034
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,520
yeah exactly

2035
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,520
yeah how do you get out of that arc

2036
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,520
that's what I want to know

2037
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,520
well a funny thing

2038
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,520
I found this little thing called the horseshoe crew

2039
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,520
that were just like talking like

2040
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,520
in like my little pony and shit

2041
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,520
so I was in that like whole scene

2042
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,520
and eventually I was realizing you know I quite like

2043
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,520
when things were like drawn

2044
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,520
and it's that sort of like

2045
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,520
metamorphicized into me being okay

2046
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,520
with the fact that I am a child

2047
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,520
and I was like completely like reversed

2048
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,520
where like a long time of my life

2049
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,520
where like I was like from like 8 until like

2050
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,520
I don't know like 12 or 13

2051
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,520
where I was really dedicated to trying to become

2052
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,520
like not necessarily a mature person

2053
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,520
in the sense that like I'm like

2054
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,520
you know like like a serious all tax person

2055
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,520
in the sense that like I'm you know

2056
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,520
I'm the cream of the crop of kids like wow

2057
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,520
is that part of why you were so

2058
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,520
into homestuck because it was like

2059
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,520
all cartoony and kitty but also like

2060
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,520
really cerebral and literary

2061
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,520
a little bit yeah

2062
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,520
anyway it went full circle to the point where now

2063
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,520
I'm like full like

2064
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,520
kid power and I reject

2065
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,520
all sense of the adult world

2066
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,520
I just want to go back

2067
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,520
not like I just want to go back to like being

2068
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,520
like nice and like looking

2069
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,520
with optimism to the world and not being

2070
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,520
nihilistic and not being like oh like

2071
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,520
life shit now question mark

2072
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,520
I don't want to be reflecting like oh how good

2073
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,520
things used to be I want to have things be good

2074
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,520
now I don't want to be thinking about how

2075
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,520
like oh YouTube so bad oh I'm just

2076
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,520

like yeah talking about

2106
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,520
being rebellious against what

2107
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,520
people want you to be when you're older

2108
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,520
oh you'll get over this you'll get over that

2109
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,520
the number one thing that I wanted to be

2110
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,520
rebellious against was thinking that my

2111
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,520
childhood was better right like

2112
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,520
there was a time when I was like 17

2113
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,520
and an older person said oh yeah I remember

2114
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,520
when I was your age that was the best years of

2115
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,520
my life and I'm thinking gross

2116
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,520
one I'm I was thinking one

2117
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,520
I've just been sitting around doing nothing with

2118
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,520
my life being completely miserable two

2119
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,520
how old were you how old were you 17 or 16

2120
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,520
Jesus fucking Christ two

2121
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,520
uh this guy

2122
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,520
in like his late 50s is

2123
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,520
fucking handing me the free sample at a

2124
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,520
grocery store obviously

2125
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,520
this guy yeah well

2126
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,520
when when when when you peak

2127
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,520
at 17 when you're the kind of person who

2128
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,520
peaked at 17 and it never got any better past

2129
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,520
that that's not a good sign what do you think

2130
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,520
he was handing me the fucking free sample

2131
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,520
at price chopper so

2132
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,520
I was thinking yeah it's like clearly

2133
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,520
people who just were not fit for this

2134
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,520
earth like they should have died they should have died young

2135
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,520
that was been the only way right

2136
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,520
yeah yeah that was the only way

2137
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,520
and they missed they missed their chance that's the two

2138
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,520
things I still want to talk about is like life

2139
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,520
getting better or worse when you become old and

2140
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,520
also the death of going outside which I guess

2141
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,520
actually need that much elaboration but those

2142
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,520
are the two subtopics I'm still particularly

2143
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,520
interested in

2144
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,520
I just like to say

2145
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,520
that I'm deeply sorry about how much I

2146
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,520
fucked up my story because I told it like

2147
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,520
shit yeah I

2148
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,520
thought I had not I thought I told

2149
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,520
it on episode so I rushed to the ending I just

2150
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,520
want everyone to know it was really good when

2151
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,520
I told it in private

2152
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,520
for you maybe as you said yeah

2153
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,520
in the call and you did say and it was

2154
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,520
like a really like fun story that like wow

2155
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,520
yeah you know I'm glad that you're my friend

2156
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,520
like I'm really glad that I but not anymore

2157
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,520
yeah you really

2158
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,520
now I see how you handle it under

2159
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,520
pressure I'm not confident

2160
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,520
it's actual quality

2161
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,520
I'm told it on the episode before

2162
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,520
right

2163
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,520
yeah yeah there was a little hype

2164
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,520
as to the reveal of that

2165
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,520
I had lost that that was what made it good

2166
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,520
if you had actually been performed

2167
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,520
the same thing you played the song

2168
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,520
you sang it we had to sit there be like yep you

2169
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,520
definitely lost it

2170
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,520
if I did it on the episode yeah that

2171
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,520
we should do that I mean it was a dance thing

2172
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,520
we would just hear a foot shuffle

2173
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,520
yeah I did moonwalk did moonwalk

2174
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,520
you haven't seen Fuli Kuli yet have you

2175
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,520
no I would like to request you watch that

2176
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,520
and we could maybe do like a whole fucking

2177
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,520
because everybody else has seen it we could do a whole thing

2178
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,520
it's good for me that's true

2179
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,520
me on Chibi Bakas Fuli Kuli

2180
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,520
the arc of the main character of Fuli Kuli

2181
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,520
is that he basically

2182
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,520
like is trying to grow up

2183
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,520
like he wants to be an adult

2184
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,520
and he wants to he sees the adults around

2185
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,520
him as like failing because they're all

2186
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,520
like kind of immature and he's like

2187
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,520
oh you're supposed to act like this like this is what

2188
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,520
it means to be an adult and then it's kind of about him

2189
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,520
realizing that you don't need to do

2190
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,520
that and that adults generally

2191
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,520
being an adult does not mean you're like a radically different

2192
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,520
person it just means that you have like a lot

2193
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,520
more responsibilities basically he tries to be

2194
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,520
cool but instead he's a fool

2195
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,520
that's the title

2196
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,520
exactly my life where I was super

2197
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,520
like it was super inspired by all the

2198
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,520
like adults around me and not like in the sense that

2199
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,520
like I really like liked what they were doing

2200
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,520
but just in the sense that they were authority figures

2201
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,520
and so by default I looked up

2202
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,520
and I felt that that's what they were doing

2203
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,520
was the correct thing to do

2204
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,520
like I didn't have any role models

2205
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,520
like my dad is a very good

2206
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,520
mature person and he's like

2207
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,520
cool in his own way but like he's not the kind of cool that

2208
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,520
I look up to in a way if you know what I mean

2209
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,520
so like I remember specifically

2210
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,520
as a child thinking I remember

2211
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,520
specifically out loud thinking this

2212
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,520
like you thinking it out loud like not subconsciously

2213
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,520
like this was something that actually went through my head

2214
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,520
sitting there thinking I have

2215
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,520
I look up to no one there's no one

2216
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,520
who I respect until I found the internet

2217
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,520
then only on the internet did I start

2218
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,520
finding things I respect and then learning

2219
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,520
things about people who aren't on the internet

2220
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:08,520
like a reverse MC mat

2221
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,520
I never sort of looked up to any adult either

2222
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,520
like people my friends had

2223
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,520
idols and stuff like Britney Spears was super popular

2224
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,520
back then I remember specifically

2225
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,520
thinking to myself like

2226
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,520
why would I want to be like someone else

2227
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,520
when I can just be me you know

2228
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,520
it's just that you never made sense to me

2229
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,520
to try and be like someone else

2230
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,520
that seemed like hard and what's the point

2231
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,520
if there's nothing missing in my life

2232
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,520
I only admired fictional characters

2233
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,520
I want to

2234
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,520
I want to express deeply that this is

2235
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,520
this is a very shameful praise

2236
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,520
this is a very shameful inspiration

2237
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,520
because I don't like actually

2238
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,520
like feel like I want to follow

2239
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,520
the footsteps or like believe in

2240
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,520
the qualities of the adults around me

2241
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,520
like like no the adults around me

2242
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,520
I'm really like you know what like I want to take up that mental

2243
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,520
I want to do what you're doing I'm not like inspired

2244
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,520
in the same way that I'm inspired like people online

2245
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,520
it's just because they were like the adults

2246
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,520
around me and because they're adults

2247
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,520
they know what they're doing

2248
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,520
it's instilled in me

2249
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,520
I'm really curious about this

2250
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,520
because you are a big lad

2251
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,520
and I'm wondering like

2252
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,520
how being like maybe

2253
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,520
as tall as the adults

2254
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,520
around you affected the way

2255
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,520
you look up to them metaphorically

2256
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,520
because I have

2257
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,520
as a small boy

2258
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,520
like knowing that people like obviously

2259
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,520
you're a kid people who are bigger than you

2260
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,520
are in charge and that's how you

2261
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,520
understand it and

2262
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,520
but like I've noticed like a couple

2263
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,520
times even though there's like a kid who's like

2264
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,520
clearly he's like a young teenager

2265
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,520
but he's taller than me I feel like

2266
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,520
this inherent like

2267
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,520
oh he's in charge

2268
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,520
not that I actually act on that in any way

2269
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,520
but I'm like it's like for a brief moment

2270
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,520
I'm like oh

2271
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,520
wait no he's a kid he's a kid

2272
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,520
I'm cooler than him

2273
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,520
I don't really get that

2274
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,520
I kind of feel like once you are tall

2275
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,520
like that power dynamic of tall

2276
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,520
versus small kind of disappears

2277
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,520
because I really like even when I'm talking to

2278
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,520
someone who's significantly shorter than me

2279
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,520
I don't like think about it or like even

2280
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,520
realize it most of the time

2281
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,520
that's your tall privilege

2282
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,520
that's your tall privilege talking

2283
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,520
that's tall privilege you have the privilege

2284
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,520
of not noticing

2285
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,520
us manlets have to notice

2286
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,520
where it's forced upon us

2287
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,520
being tall is not what it's all cracked up to be

2288
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,520
what I hated about being

2289
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,520
taller than everyone else

2290
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,520
it's just practical and I like

2291
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,520
I mean there's some good points but what I really hated

2292
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,520
when I was a kid I was usually

2293
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,520
the tallest kid in any friend group

2294
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,520
or even among like boys

2295
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,520
and stuff

2296
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,520
so whenever we hung out and whenever people

2297
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,520
got in trouble I usually got the brunt

2298
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,520
of the blame because people assumed I'm the oldest

2299
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,520
and the most responsible because I was the tallest

2300
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,520
even though that wasn't the case

2301
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,520
I was once hanging out with

2302
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,520
like two other boys

2303
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,520
and they were throwing rocks

2304
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,520
at a sign and they were

2305
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,520
throwing rocks at a sign and

2306
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,520
this old dude he went up

2307
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,520
to us like he sneaked up on us and he

2308
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,520
grabbed my arm and like

2309
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,520
the two guys scattered

2310
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,520
that's grounds for salt

2311
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,520
and the two boys just completely

2312
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,520
ran for their lives

2313
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,520
and I got a big lecture and I was like

2314
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,520
oh you're the oldest you should be more responsible

2315
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,520
to set example and stuff like that

2316
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,520
and I was the youngest of the group

2317
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,520
and I was so pissed

2318
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,520
he still is cognizant of this

2319
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,520
sort of like bestial, fucking

2320
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,520
primal power dynamic just from height

2321
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,520
and physical stature but like you can be aware

2322
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,520
of it and then like not let it affect you

2323
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,520
much but especially over the course of your development

2324
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,520
it can put you into a feedback

2325
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,520
loop and I

2326
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,520
based on how people treat me

2327
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,520
and talk to me I think most people think

2328
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,520
I'm usually three to five years

2329
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,520
younger than I am and it was only in the

2330
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,520
last couple of years I've started like

2331
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,520
getting people treating me like I'm definitely

2332
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,520
an adult like after

2333
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,520
I spent like a solid year driving and

2334
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,520
having a full-time job and like being

2335
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,520
completely independent only then

2336
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,520
did I seem to have enough swagger

2337
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,520
where like people think okay this is like an actual

2338
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,520
fucking person like at a store

2339
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,520
not like they're with their parents you know what I mean

2340
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,520
it's catch-de-vous swaggering

2341
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,520
the fuck out of the grocery store

2342
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,520
yeah yeah

2343
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,520
even up until like my like early

2344
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,520
20s even when I was like 21

2345
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,520
people would still talk to me like I was in high school

2346
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,520
or even say like oh

2347
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,520
like think I was in high school right

2348
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,520
and when people treat you like that it affects

2349
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,520
yourself image so Munchie

2350
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,520
meanwhile who's passed for an adult for a long

2351
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,520
fucking time and creates this fucking feedback loop

2352
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,520
and I think it's a good one

2353
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,520
if people think you're an adult unless you're just

2354
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,520
nothing but slapped with blame for throwing rocks at you

2355
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,520
Munchie's a trans he's a trans adult

2356
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,520
he passes

2357
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,520
here's the best thing in life and here's

2358
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,520
like the thing that like I'm gonna be turning 18 soon

2359
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,520
and this is gonna that's gonna be like

2360
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,520
the death of my actual life like everything

2361
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,520
after that will be nothing because I define

2362
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,520
my life as the following

2363
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,520
as long as

2364
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,520
I can walk up to a cashier

2365
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,520
or you know where or my mom

2366
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,520
my mom can introduce me to someone

2367
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,520
and she can say how old

2368
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,520
do you think he is and she can gesture to him

2369
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,520
words at me and they can be like

2370
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:08,520
um 22 some guy said

2371
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,520
like 28 like everyone has

2372
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,520
like like the

2373
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,520
gap between my actual age

2374
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,520
and uh my

2375
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,520
like what people think my age is as long as

2376
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,520
that is at least 10 years plus

2377
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,520
I'm in the prime of my life as long as

2378
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,520
people think that I'm

2379
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,520
older than I actually am that's when I know

2380
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,520
that I'm like wherever I can walk up to a fucking cashier

2381
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,520
or just the other fucking day

2382
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,520
when I was getting my passport done

2383
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,520
uh the uh the receptionist

2384
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,520
the receptionist was like oh

2385
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,520
what are you like 22 I'm like

2386
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,520
some people get upset some people get upset

2387
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,520
because they get older and people stop

2388
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,520
carding them at liquor stores

2389
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,520
Munchie never got carded

2390
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,520
I'll get offered alcohol

2391
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,520
all the time and I'll have that

2392
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,520
fucking moment I praise this I live

2393
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,520
for this I wake up specifically for

2394
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,520
this they'll come by and like

2395
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,520
would you like a drink and I'm like

2396
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,520
I want to know

2397
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,520
I'm underage I'm not

2398
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,520
allowed to drink alcohol

2399
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,520
the sadistic glee that

2400
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,520
he says that

2401
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,520
he's been waiting to

2402
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:14,520
say this I was surprised Munchie that you're still

2403
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,520
against sex that'd be the ultimate the ultimate

2404
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,520
prank like after she gets up it's like

2405
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,520
I have to let you know something

2406
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,520
criminal

2407
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,520
I'm underage

2408
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,520
that's terrible

2409
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,520
that's a great party trick

2410
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,520
Munchie's story reminded me

2411
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,520
like a little bit what my parents

2412
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,520
like to do like whenever they have

2413
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,520
used to whenever they used

2414
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,520
to have like friends over

2415
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,520
the ones they haven't seen in years

2416
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,520
so I have a sister older sister by the

2417
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,520
way so like

2418
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,520
when these

2419
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,520
friends would be had been over

2420
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,520
I used to be like a little baby and stuff like

2421
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,520
that so like my parents

2422
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,520
would go like this like let me introduce you to

2423
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,520
my littlest one and I was

2424
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,520
the tallest person in the room

2425
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,520
it was pretty fun

2426
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,520
nice

2427
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,520
it's fucking beautiful

2428
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,520
before we wrap up here

2429
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,520
I feel like that's what could happen

2430
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,520
I just want to like clarify my

2431
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,520
transition here so you can

2432
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,520
understand my growing pains

2433
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,520
when I say

2434
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,520
that I was trying to be mature as like a kid

2435
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,520
you may think but Munchie you're so fucking

2436
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,520
inconceivable you're just

2437
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,520
unfathomable the way that you are

2438
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,520
in the sense that you're fucking autistic and retarded

2439
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,520
and I hate you like all you do is scream

2440
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,520
and thank you viewer like good job

2441
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,520
and like thumbs up and thank you

2442
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,520
but what I mean is I don't mean like particularly like I was trying to be like

2443
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,520
really like serious in the sense

2444
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,520
that like real world like

2445
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,520
adults would recognize me as an adult

2446
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,520
I would like play you know

2447
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,520
I would play along and I wouldn't be like a weird

2448
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,520
autistic person in real life but I just

2449
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,520
mean that I wanted to have the praise of adults

2450
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,520
in any scenario so when I was around

2451
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,520
people online I would you know

2452
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,520
I would act mature in the sense that I would

2453
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,520
make funny jokes that's really what it

2454
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,520
translate to was I would make funny jokes

2455
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,520
and it would be as Steve puts it

2456
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,520
on point

2457
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,520
so I wouldn't

2458
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,520
be fucking like I wouldn't be like a fucking

2459
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,520
spur lord but I would be autistic

2460
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,520
is what I'm trying to say

2461
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,520
and he is to this very day

2462
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,520
you guys get it am I explaining myself well

2463
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,520
I'm not I'm not I'm not being a

2464
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,520
weird like uh like faggot

2465
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,520
who only like like dresses in suits

2466
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,520
I'm just being I'm just being the kind of guy

2467
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,520
that people would unironically praise

2468
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,520
for being cool that's what I was

2469
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,520
that's what I was like chasing after my life

2470
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,520
and I felt the way to do that was to try and be like

2471
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,520
mature in the context of whatever

2472
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,520
scenario that I was in be it like an actual

2473
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,520
like real adult or a funny

2474
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,520
person online I can only imagine

2475
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,520
munchy in that hamburger onesie

2476
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,520
that's that's that's all he

2477
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,520
whatever that was still

2478
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,520
me trying to be cool whatever my teeth is like

2479
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,520
I go to the store I just imagine munchy

2480
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,520
with that hamburger onesie in a store

2481
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,520
yes I am an adult

2482
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,520
I wear the out of the house not in conceivable

2483
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,520
amount of time like I wear that like pretty regularly

2484
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,520
outside the house like like downtown

2485
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,520
incidentally it's a it's a pizza onesie

2486
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,520
with the burger like jacket

2487
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:06,520
thing but by the way I'm so

2488
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,520
upset with you did you like I'm

2489
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,520
so distraught every time I remember

2490
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,520
that like okay

2491
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,520
here's what my intention was I don't think everybody

2492
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,520
can use you but I want this to be the case

2493
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,520
when I left like on accident

2494
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,520
the burger burger was

2495
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,520
right there and I gave it to you like

2496
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,520
I didn't want you to ship it I wanted to be

2497
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,520
that to be like little Cal from Homestuck

2498
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,520
like I passed it to you then you used it

2499
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,520
and then like you threw it away but you just

2500
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,520
have that you threw it away into a trash can

2501
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,520
that was that was going directly to a landfill in

2502
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,520
Chicago and then Nate while surfing

2503
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,520
on the web aka the trash can

2504
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,520
to find some sick pumps

2505
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,520
he would find it and would just like transfer

2506
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,520
from PCP member to PCP member

2507
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,520
appearing the background of videos until the end

2508
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,520
of time and have its own narrative arc until

2509
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,520
finally you returned to me at the end of like

2510
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,520
a conclusion of an art but tragically the

2511
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,520
only thing that gets transferred around here is

2512
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,520
YouTube wait so who does

2513
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,520

2514
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,520

it's iconic

2519
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,520
you should never have trusted digit hold on

2520
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,520
to that this is your mistake I mean it's

2521
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,520
possible to say in my house somewhere

2522
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,520
I don't please you had it

2523
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,520
when you were going around the country

2524
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,520
oh god in that

2525
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,520
period I had returned it to you

2526
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,520

at anime expo I had oh no

2529
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,520
you did not give it to me well

2530
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,520
I'll have to either find it or find

2531
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,520
out who has it

2532
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,520
wear it you have to wear it maybe it's currently

2533
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,520
going on its own like little cow

2534
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,520
it's very let's hope so

2535
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,520
let's hope so if it somehow

2536
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,520
found its way into the giant

2537
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,520
goodwill throw away all the clothes

2538
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,520
I think that

2539
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,520
happened like a year ago then that would

2540
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,520
be where it is but okay great

2541
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,520

2542
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,520

what people are still talking about

2562
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,520

2563
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,520
us to do that so that we can be

2564
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,520

and we can be fucking timely with this stuff

2567
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,520

2568
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,520

2569
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,520

no way

2575
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,520

2577
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,520
possibly including this one I don't know

2578
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,520
I'd be speaking of

2579
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,520
shit from last episode on fitness

2580
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,520
that came out

2581
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,520
there was a huge response

2582
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,520
to hashtag PCP fit life

2583
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,520
and we got a ton of fucking people

2584
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,520
working out and going to the gym and taking a walk

2585
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,520
there was one guy that was just like in the woods

2586
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,520
just hanging out just hanging out in the fucking woods

2587
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,520
yeah

2588
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,520
simply beautiful

2589
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,520
we're gonna have to make some like merch

2590
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,520
like a PCP tank top

2591
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,520
so we can get people in there

2592
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,520
dude I would love to go to the gym with a PCP

2593
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,520
fit life tank top or something

2594
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,520
that'd be fucking sick

2595
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,520
we'll fucking do something like that

2596
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,520
we should definitely do that

2597
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,520
I don't know if they have tank tops on redbubble

2598
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,520
but we could definitely figure something out

2599
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,520
PCP fit life is the way the truth and the light though

2600
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,520
we need to make this real

2601
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:54,520
and revisit it

2602
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,520
by the way I mean I guess on the subject of the PCP fit life

2603
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,520
I've been working out

2604
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,520
things have been going good

2605
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,520
I've been lowering my sugar intake

2606
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,520
I'm still avoiding all sugar

2607
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,520
and life is good

2608
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,520
I'm doing uh... I'm going keto

2609
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,520
I'm going keto

2610
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,520
really, really

2611
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,520
I gotta lose like 20 pounds

2612
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,520
I gained like 20 pounds

2613
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,520
I'm mad about it

2614
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,520
go load it up

2615
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,520
this is a diet right Ben?

2616
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,520
yeah, yeah

2617
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:26,520
is that real?

2618
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,520
you just go

2619
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,520
really low carb for a while

2620
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,520
that's pretty much all this

2621
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,520
do your raccoon tendencies

2622
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,520
I give this a week

2623
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,520
no

2624
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,520
no, I think this is pretty easy

2625
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,520
I think this will actually be pretty easy

2626
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,520
it's not difficult to do keto

2627
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,520
especially for someone like Ben who can live off of like

2628
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,520
peanuts for 10 days

2629
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,520
just only eat meat

2630
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,520
digi, yesterday

2631
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,520
the only thing I ate was a bag of peanuts

2632
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,520
no way, no fucking way

2633
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,520
do you not still have any carbs do they?

2634
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,520
they have a bit

2635
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,520
but Ben, what about your, I mean they do have protein

2636
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,520
but what of your

2637
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,520
omega-3's? what of your vitamins?

2638
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:08,520
oh wait, I have a jar

2639
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,520
I have a jar of fish oil pills somewhere

2640
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,520
ah, perfect

2641
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:14,520
I'll eat the entire jar

2642
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:16,520
as one puck, what was it?

2643
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,520
it melts them together

2644
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,520
didn't we name that something last episode?

2645
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,520
it was like the

2646
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,520
Ben C or something

2647
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,520
no, wait, it was the so ugly

2648
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,520
it was the so ugly

2649
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,520
the log of

2650
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,520
it was worth it, I don't even regret doing that

2651
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,520
I recommend, in fact I recommend it

2652
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,520
excellent

2653
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,520
I mean, that's really it

2654
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,520
we just wanted to talk about how awesome it was

2655
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,520
that people were actually sticking with this fit life

2656
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,520
we got a bunch of, so many pictures

2657
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,520
and shit, people were tweeting me

2658
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:48,520
people were tweeting the pcp itself

2659
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,520
we retweeted a lot of them, so keep tweeting

2660
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,520
at tpcrasnators with their hashtag

2661
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,520
pcpfitlife and we'll

2662
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:56,520
fucking retweet them, we'll start a

2663
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,520
sensation and save the world from

2664
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,520
obesity and being gross

2665
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,520
oh my god, all the questions are

2666
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,520
actually relevant to the topic

2667
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,520
in this episode, the questions are good

2668
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,520
they're not bad, and they're pretty decent

2669
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,520
but before we get to that, we got other shit to do

2670
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,520
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

2671
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,520
okay, fine, whatever, I'll talk about it

2672
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,520
when we get through it

2673
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,520
so the next up is, it's the pcp

2674
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,520
theme contest everybody, that's

2675
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,520
still going, it's real

2676
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,520
and last episode, there were two entries

2677
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,520
now that we got like fucking six this time

2678
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,520
we got a whole bunch of fucking pcp themes

2679
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,520
I want to see what the retention weight for the

2680
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,520
pcp is, because I guarantee you

2681
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,520
and now on to like

2682
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,520
90% viewers click off

2683
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,520
well that's fine, we can totally gauge that

2684
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,520
and if we know

2685
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,520
then so be it, but

2686
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,520
we won't change anything

2687
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,520
we won't change a thing, why do you think that

2688
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,520
because I've always listened

2689
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,520
I've never thought the question section was any worse than

2690
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,520
the show itself

2691
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,520
I always love the question section

2692
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,520
I agree, I don't see why anyone, I mean maybe

2693
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,520
at the very end when we say like

2694
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,520
I mean the show is just random

2695
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,520
discussion, like it's never like

2696
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,520
a completely on topic or a

2697
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,520
complete view of the topic

2698
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,520
most of the time the questions are just like

2699
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,520
these questions suck, oh here's

2700
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,520
what's your favorite anime and then all of us grow

2701
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,520
and be like oh yeah we usually just don't

2702
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,520
answer any of the bad questions

2703
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,520
and just find the good ones

2704
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,520
isn't that what we usually do

2705
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,520
I don't think it's ever had like a real

2706
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,520
problem

2707
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,520
other than not having enough good questions

2708
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:28,520
well in any

2709
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,520
case that is dead and irrelevant

2710
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,520
because it's time to talk about pcp themes

2711
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,520
now, we're all going to fucking listen

2712
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,520
so get your asses into the pcp themes chat

2713
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,520
we're going to listen to all of them

2714
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,520
thank you for sending us a link

2715
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,520
to twitter, we can't fucking play this

2716
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,520
with our music box, we literally said

2717
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,520
to make it soundcloud and youtube

2718
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,520
you have fucked up, I don't know

2719
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,520
how you did it this bad, what made you think

2720
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,520
that we could, like that we were going to watch

2721
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,520
a video on twitter, who

2722
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,520
post videos on twitter

2723
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,520
for the first one I guess we'll all just have to hit play

2724
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,520
at the same time, jeez Christ

2725
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,520
is this the one from

2726
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,520
Gavin Watkins?

2727
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:06,520
that's right, that's right

2728
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,520
alright, here we go

2729
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,520
remember everybody tweet us

2730
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,520
hashtag pcp

2731
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,520
you need to read the part where he says

2732
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,520
this is an indirect recording

2733
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,520
of the theme

2734
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,520
if you like, I can give you a direct

2735
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,520
file so the sound quality is much better

2736
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,520
what? oh fucking

2737
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,520
wait a minute, if I remember correctly

2738
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,520
I listened to this earlier and it sounds like

2739
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,520
it was like a cell phone

2740
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,520
recording out of the speakers playing

2741
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,520
that's so stupid

2742
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,520
let's not even listen to this one

2743
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,520
what a terrible

2744
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,520
dude, you gotta put that on

2745
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,520
soundcloud or youtube or something

2746
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,520
wait, stop

2747
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,520
let's think about this for a second

2748
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:48,520
he has a music file

2749
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,520
a computer file

2750
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,520
which he then decides to

2751
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,520
record digitally

2752
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,520
with a microphone

2753
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,520
and then upload that file

2754
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,520
I actually have a development

2755
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,520
on this developing story

2756
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:04,520
because I actually did communicate with this guy

2757
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,520
and get him to send me a file

2758
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:08,520
but here's the thing

2759
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,520
the file that he sent

2760
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,520
I gotta pull up this

2761
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,520
email that he sent because it was fucking fascinating

2762
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,520
listen to this

2763
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,520
ok, so he said hey guys

2764
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,520
you retweet my song, that's cool

2765
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,520
ok, sorry, so he attached a file

2766
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,520
to this, it says sorry if I accidentally

2767
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,520
sent you the wrong file

2768
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,520
I'm in a setup stage for my computer

2769
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,520
and I haven't set up the sound yet

2770
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,520
but I'm pretty sure this is the right file

2771
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,520
I also, listen to this

2772
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,520
actually accidentally

2773
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,520
deleted the one from twitter

2774
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,520
so I spent a while trying to recreate it

2775
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,520
as best I could

2776
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,520
while changing some things

2777
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,520
how many things went wrong

2778
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,520
in this process

2779
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,520
he made the song in whatever

2780
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,520
program, saved it

2781
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,520
uploaded it to twitter, deleted the

2782
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,520
master file and all other files

2783
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,520
and the only form that existed

2784
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:00,520
was the one on twitter

2785
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,520
and then it was deleted from twitter

2786
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,520
it's like that time that digi deleted every piece

2787
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,520
of his video, so he couldn't recreate it

2788
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,520
before the fucking

2789
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,520
you know, before the video was upload

2790
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,520
are we gonna listen to it?

2791
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,520
I am downloading an AIF file

2792
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,520
that was attached to it right now

2793
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,520
upload it to soundcloud or youtube

2794
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:20,520
we have to be strict, we're gonna get people

2795
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,520
sending it on fucking crazy shit

2796
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,520
we're gonna get people on mega upload

2797
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,520
okay, I can hear sound from this

2798
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,520
but no one else can hear it put me

2799
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,520
so you gotta fix this buddy

2800
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:32,520
you gotta put this on twitter

2801
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,520
or fucking whatever, I apologize

2802
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,520
cause I told him just to send it to us

2803
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:38,520
no, you gotta put it on youtube or soundcloud

2804
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,520
or something, the end

2805
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,520
alright, now we're gonna play fucking one

2806
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,520
by Eric Seabass

2807
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:46,520
it's called Crazy

2808
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,520
alright, shit this is alright

2809
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,520
oh my god

2810
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,520
I know

2811
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,520
okay, that was pretty dope

2812
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,520
that was really cool

2813
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,520
it's pretty dope, but it's not

2814
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,520
this is the aesthetic of the pc

2815
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,520
this could be a jingle for

2816
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,520
literally anything

2817
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,520
it was a little long

2818
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,520
I think it was a little redundant at the end

2819
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,520
for a theme song

2820
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,520
this is entirely

2821
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,520
misguided section

2822
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,520
I don't understand

2823
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:36,520
okay, no one is going

2824
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,520
all the ones that we've had so far

2825
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,520
are not like

2826
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,520
PCP matching tonally

2827
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,520
stylistically or anything

2828
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,520
we should have just made our own

2829
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,520
fucking theme song

2830
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,520
who's gonna fucking do that

2831
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,520
we already have one

2832
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,520
I don't understand why we're even

2833
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,520
like why not just use the one

2834
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,520
we already have

2835
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,520
because you fucking cowards were saying how you

2836
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,520
didn't kick it match the tone

2837
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,520
I said that the

2838
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,520
using it as an opening

2839
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,520
was a bad idea, it was perfectly fine

2840
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,520
as the ending, it just doesn't make sense

2841
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,520
as an opening song

2842
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,520
that's the point, we're looking for an opening

2843
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,520
we decided we didn't want to do the intros

2844
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,520
so I took it upon myself to put a clip

2845
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,520
of the theme song at the beginning

2846
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:22,520
and did you found it offensive that it would play the song

2847
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,520
at the beginning of the podcast

2848
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,520
at no point

2849
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,520
was my encouragement that we create

2850
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,520
a new intro song

2851
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,520
I don't like the idea of an intro song on a podcast

2852
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,520
it works out like the dick show

2853
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,520
if it's super iconic

2854
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,520
just like the worst podcast in the world, the dick show

2855
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,520
thank god they don't have an opening song

2856
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,520
but their opening song is like

2857
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,520
not only is it extremely unique

2858
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,520
but the fact that he yells yeah over it

2859
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,520
whoa, so you're telling me there's like a good way

2860
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,520
to do an opening song

2861
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,520
no way, no way

2862
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,520
if only we could

2863
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,520
have some sort of competition to like do that

2864
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,520
I should get residuals every time you use that

2865
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:00,520
oh there he is

2866
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,520
oh my god

2867
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,520
your residuals were getting paid for being on episode

2868
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,520
Jesse you're residuals

2869
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,520
I'm owed money for my song

2870
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,520
Jesse if you don't want us to edit

2871
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,520
you're gonna have to sync with us at the end

2872
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,520
anyway to get off the lofty

2873
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,520
philosophical abstraction

2874
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,520
remember the last time Davoo tried to kick Jesse

2875
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,520
from the PCP episode

2876
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,520
to make it funny I'm leaving

2877
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:24,520
wait please get us your audio we need it

2878
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,520
yeah that'd be good

2879
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,520
that'd be helpful

2880
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,520
listen

2881
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,520
next song

2882
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,520
what do people want

2883
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,520
like what kind of

2884
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,520
what do we want out of this

2885
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,520
yeah I am actually

2886
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,520
I've been trying to

2887
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,520
shut up I would like some funny

2888
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,520
like a couple of funny

2889
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,520
joke lyric lines

2890
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,520
that are about the PCP

2891
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,520
no that's exactly the opposite of what I would want

2892
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,520
thanks man

2893
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,520
I like having a unique opening

2894
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,520
on every video

2895
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,520
why are we not doing that anymore

2896
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,520
that was voted down

2897
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,520
the reason why we stopped doing it

2898
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,520
is because the intros were

2899
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,520
shit like for the past like 30 episodes

2900
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,520
of intros it was just like

2901
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,520
google search the word of what the episode is

2902
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,520
ok well then let's not do

2903
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,520
a shitty low effort version

2904
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,520
and just do the good ones we used to do then

2905
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,520
no one will do that

2906
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,520
the editors don't want to do that

2907
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,520
you guys make a shit load of money editing this thing

2908
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,520
I don't care what you want to do

2909
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:28,520
make the show good

2910
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,520
when the intros were forced

2911
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,520
when they were obligatory

2912
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,520
they were uninspired and bad

2913
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,520
that's what happened

2914
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,520
luckily we found a solution

2915
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,520
to make a good theme song

2916
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,520
like here we are

2917
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,520
doing the solution

2918
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,520
let's just keep going shall we

2919
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,520
here's the fucking next one

2920
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,520
I'm not done talking about this one guys

2921
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,520
I just don't think this is a good solution to the problem

2922
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:54,520
god I have to pee so much

2923
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,520
I want to talk about the one we already listened to

2924
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,520
the one we already listened to

2925
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,520
not into generic rock

2926
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:02,520
guitar shredding even if it's good

2927
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,520
shredding playing whatever the fuck word I'm supposed to use

2928
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:06,520
even if it's well mixed

2929
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,520
I know most podcasts

2930
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,520
they think that's the standard

2931
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,520
basically have basic instrumentation

2932
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,520
and it's well mixed

2933
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,520
I want something more particular and original

2934
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,520
I already have zero punctuation in my life

2935
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,520
I watch lots of the other escapist shows

2936
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,520
and I also listen to the biggest problem

2937
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:24,520
I'm completely full

2938
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,520
of

2939
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,520
competent guitar playing

2940
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,520
but listen to this though

2941
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:32,520
this is an important fact you should know

2942
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,520
no one here has veto power

2943
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,520
it likes to accept one person

2944
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,520
it could definitely be used

2945
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:40,520
this is a group decision

2946
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,520
it's a democratic process

2947
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,520
if everyone wants to have bad taste and pick a bad song

2948
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,520
me and digi are both

2949
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,520
against generic guitar pieces

2950
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,520
that last one was absolute no

2951
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:52,520
for me because it literally sounds like

2952
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,520
every other podcast intro

2953
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,520
and it was not distinctive

2954
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,520
there's no melody that's going to stick in your head

2955
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,520
I definitely want something more distinct

2956
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,520
it has some sort of strong

2957
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,520
melodic

2958
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,520
easily chordable thing that you could burst in the song

2959
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,520
almost like if you had a cool outro

2960
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,520
like I'm supposed to

2961
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,520
it is a great outro

2962
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,520
this is not about

2963
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,520
an outro

2964
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,520
this is about an intro

2965
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,520
we shouldn't have an opening

2966
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,520
we shouldn't have an opening

2967
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,520
the show should not have an opening

2968
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,520
it should either just start

2969
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,520
I've literally been

2970
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,520
against this

2971
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,520
against the beginning of this idea

2972
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,520
that is fucking bullshit

2973
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,520
you never said shit

2974
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:38,520
at the very beginning of this being an idea

2975
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:40,520
I said I will not be a part of this

2976
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,520
I will go along with the group

2977
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,520
but I have not been on board

2978
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,520
that may be true

2979
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,520
but I don't believe it

2980
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,520
I'm somewhere in the middle on this

2981
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,520
I'm willing

2982
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,520
I'm more cooperative with the synth idea

2983
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,520
I'm optimistic to see what they can come up with

2984
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,520
but

2985
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,520
even at the beginning if they're all bad

2986
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,520
that's what I'm saying

2987
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,520
I am prepared to say no to all of them

2988
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,520
because I know making a good song is damn near impossible

2989
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:08,520
even for highly talented individuals

2990
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,520
no offense

2991
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,520
do we want to see if one of these guys

2992
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,520
is somehow not going to part

2993
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,520
it's my dank lord

2994
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,520
here we go

2995
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,520
hahahaha

2996
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,520
whoa

2997
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,520
I actually like this one a lot

2998
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,520
okay

2999
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,520
I don't want this

3000
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,520
for the intro

3001
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,520
but I do want it

3002
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,520
wait

3003
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,520
if you leave a comment before the video

3004
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,520
and please kill yourself

3005
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,520
yeah

3006
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,520
there is no such thing

3007
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,520
as objective criticism

3008
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,520
yeah

3009
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,520
I know why

3010
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,520
anime is a Japanese colloquialism

3011
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,520
what will we see

3012
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,520
dude

3013
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,520
dictionary

3014
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,520
if you want to make your cries

3015
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,520
consciousness high

3016
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,520
then you should try

3017
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,520
pcb pcb

3018
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,520
yeah

3019
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,520
okay

3020
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,520
pcb pcb

3021
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,520
now they're here to fight for me and you

3022
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,520
pcb pcb

3023
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,520
pcb pcb

3024
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,520
the best guy ever met some other people

3025
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,520
too

3026
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,520
hahahaha

3027
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,520
hahahaha

3028
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,520
hahahaha

3029
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,520
oh man

3030
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:30,520
she has weaponized thickness

3031
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,520
so much

3032
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,520
that was lame

3033
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,520
it's nothing but trash

3034
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:38,520
whoa those tits

3035
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,520
I love those tits so much

3036
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,520
use that homestuck fuck with that homestuck suck

3037
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,520
page and death is the piece

3038
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,520
welcome

3039
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,520
free pcb

3040
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,520
pcb pcb

3041
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,520
this is long enough

3042
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,520
this is an actual pcb

3043
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,520
theme song

3044
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,520
it's not so incredible

3045
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:00,520
I loved it though

3046
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,520
dude

3047
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,520
I have some thoughts

3048
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,520
well it's great and it's funny

3049
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,520
that was the best one by far

3050
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,520
so far

3051
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,520
I kinda think

3052
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,520
we could shrink it

3053
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,520
we could shrink it for our opening

3054
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:18,520
it's always possible

3055
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,520
I don't know if I'll love

3056
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,520
the pcb

3057
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,520
I don't know if that's gonna be fresh forever

3058
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,520
I think that the problem is the song

3059
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,520
does not have the best production quality

3060
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,520
and it is really funny

3061
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,520
as a joke song that we play on the

3062
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,520
podcast

3063
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,520
I don't know if it has staying

3064
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,520
I meant just now

3065
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,520
I'm already exhausted the full breadth of that

3066
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,520
joke

3067
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,520
I can't

3068
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,520
give it an emphatic

3069
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,520
I wanna hear that to intro every episode thumbs up

3070
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,520
as I said in the last time we did the contest

3071
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,520
I don't know if this

3072
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,520
I'm not terribly into

3073
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,520
the song where the lyrics are all a bunch of

3074
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,520
references to the shit

3075
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,520
I don't know

3076
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,520
so do you want it to be pcb themed

3077
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,520
or do you want it not

3078
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:06,520
pcb themed

3079
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,520
like generic or something

3080
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,520
when I say, when we talk about having a theme

3081
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,520
that fits the tone of the show

3082
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,520
I don't mean one that makes references to the show

3083
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,520
it doesn't have to do that

3084
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,520
it's really funny having this conversation

3085
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,520
because me and munchy just recently

3086
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,520
constructed a perfect intro

3087
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,520
for our

3088
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,520
show

3089
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:28,520
why don't we just do the same thing we did there

3090
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,520
what show is that

3091
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,520
the one for

3092
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,520
stealing your dad's opening

3093
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,520
it's like 20 seconds

3094
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,520
a fun rap song with some goofy lyrics

3095
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,520
that explain the point in brief

3096
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,520
and like

3097
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,520
it's basically the same thing as the isma one

3098
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,520
to me that's like

3099
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,520
if you were gonna do an intro it should just be

3100
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,520
20 seconds and explains the

3101
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,520
point of the podcast in a funny way

3102
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,520
the intro for stealing your dad's

3103
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:56,520
beautiful and it will be out in the next episode

3104
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,520
that will be live so get hyped for that shit

3105
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,520
everyone

3106
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,520
that seems like reasonable advice

3107
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,520
it should be like relatively short and punchy

3108
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,520
short and punchy

3109
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,520
and then it has a strong melody

3110
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,520
and B about the PCP but also still

3111
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,520
I literally get the list

3112
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,520
this guy's got a heart though

3113
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,520
I love how smile

3114
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,520
you could tell he was smiling during the whole recording

3115
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,520
like a big giant autism smile

3116
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,520
you know what I mean

3117
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,520
I do want to say

3118
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,520
I will always

3119
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
I will always be more likely to give the thumbs up

3120
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,520
to a song that doesn't have lyrics

3121
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,520
verse one that does just because

3122
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,520
again podcast intro I do think

3123
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,520
20 seconds is about right

3124
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,520
alright this is

3125
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,520
this is by mostly midi

3126
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,520
this is a video on youtube and

3127
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,520
he did the thing that we said not to and like

3128
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:46,520
had like a video in the background

3129
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:48,520
it just has a bunch of like images

3130
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,520
I just want to say about the song

3131
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:52,520
too late

3132
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,520
really

3133
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:56,520
you can see in your voice

3134
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:58,520
okay

3135
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:00,520
this is just literally

3136
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:02,520
the final fantasy intro

3137
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,520
it's similar

3138
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:06,520
it's pretty chill

3139
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,520
it's not as though

3140
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,520
it's a little too chill

3141
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:12,520
it does sound like he was made on

3142
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,520
like chiptune

3143
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,520
again

3144
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,520
these people have put in hours to like

3145
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:20,520
do this like futile song

3146
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,520
now when they get on all we do is just shit on them

3147
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:24,520
like oh no we don't want to do it

3148
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,520
that was nice but again

3149
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,520
it was generic

3150
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,520
think of it this way none of these people

3151
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:32,520
could have even spent more than like

3152
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:34,520
a week or two on this right

3153
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:36,520
like we only announced the contest so long

3154
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:38,520
ago so it's not like we're burning down their

3155
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,520
fucking masterpiece

3156
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,520
alright they're entering a contest

3157
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,520
and here they are facing the fucking fire

3158
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,520
I release songs better than this every day

3159
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:48,520
alright so I'm going to be a harsh on these people

3160
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:50,520
if I could make the intro for the

3161
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:52,520
show myself there's no reason we need

3162
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,520
a contest

3163
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,520
cause the reason we didn't like the outro song

3164
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,520
for the intro was that it wasn't hype

3165
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,520
it was just kind of like a silly

3166
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,520
possible

3167
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,520
but I'm sure that there's some people out there

3168
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:06,520
who were working on a song anyway

3169
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,520
who were just like I don't know let's fucking enter this

3170
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,520
you know that's what the first one and this one

3171
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:12,520
feel like

3172
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,520
I can't prove it and maybe I'm wrong but it could

3173
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:16,520
have been the case they just made a song

3174
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,520
that's pretty good

3175
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,520
I would say this intro is closer

3176
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:22,520
than the ones I've heard so far but not in a good

3177
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,520
way if that makes any sense

3178
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:26,520
it at least

3179
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:28,520
feels like sitting down to hear people talk

3180
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:30,520
but we do want

3181
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:32,520
one that's more energetic so I guess that is another thing

3182
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,520
it's like we're sort of using these as the

3183
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:36,520
initial wave of pawns to churn

3184
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,520
through to then analyze like

3185
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,520
here's what you did wrong

3186
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,520
and as we analyze and destroy these

3187
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,520
people's lives and dreams we're like understanding

3188
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,520
slowly what we actually want

3189
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:48,520
we're getting more and more specific each time

3190
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:50,520
that's how you become like a content creator

3191
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,520
you just make shit that sucks and then you just figure out

3192
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,520
what you did wrong and then you fix it as you go so whatever

3193
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:56,520
alright let's go to the next one what's the next one

3194
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,520
this is by Alex C. Biel

3195
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:00,520
oh

3196
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:02,520
I know that guy

3197
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:04,520
oh I don't want to do

3198
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:06,520
anything

3199
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:08,520
to

3200
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,520
do

3201
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,520
that's fucking called sleep in a good way

3202
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:14,520
what pcp

3203
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,520
episode

3204
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,520

3205
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:20,520
have

3206
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,520
replay

3207
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:24,520
go

3208
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:26,520
to the school

3209
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,520
of college

3210
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,520
cause it's

3211
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:32,520
I

3212
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,520
am

3213
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,520
so

3214
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:38,520
all the time in the world

3215
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:40,520
to listen to

3216
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,520
my favorite

3217
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,520
pop

3218
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,520
what a guy

3219
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,520
we should play this in one of our

3220
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,520
funerals

3221
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:54,520
yeah my face

3222
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:06,520
wow

3223
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,520
that's it that's it

3224
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,520
that's the one guy

3225
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,520
yeah that wins

3226
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:14,520
there should be a good like the rotation of ending

3227
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:16,520
like you can always have the same one

3228
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:18,520
if you want to like

3229
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:20,520
have right now

3230
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,520
yes

3231
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,520
listen to the song

3232
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:26,520
fuck off

3233
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,520
a bit like good

3234
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,520
this is okay this is like a good song

3235
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,520
not a good show

3236
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:36,520
shut up mate I'm trying to listen to the god damn song

3237
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,520
alright keep passing the book

3238
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:42,520
okay reference to the page

3239
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,520
yeah

3240
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,520
hey that was great

3241
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,520
it's a terrible theme

3242
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:56,520
it's terrible

3243
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:58,520
that's like

3244
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:00,520
that's like

3245
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,520
it's not hype and it's also very long

3246
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:04,520
that's like when you're watching the anime

3247
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:06,520
when you're watching a season of an anime

3248
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:08,520
and then like one of the episodes has like a really sad

3249
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:10,520
like part of the narrative ending

3250
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:12,520
the different ending theme song

3251
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,520
for that episode

3252
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,520
that's what that one is that's good

3253
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,520
okay let's clarify real quick

3254
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:20,520
do we want to be hype or just upbeat

3255
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,520
I don't know

3256
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:24,520
I just want it to sound like it would be

3257
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,520
what you want to hear before a pcp podcast

3258
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,520
I won't know it until I hear it

3259
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:30,520
that's what's important

3260
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:32,520
we could just have like a happy version

3261
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,520
of the normal song

3262
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:36,520
I think we could clearly say that that song

3263
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:38,520
did not suit the tone

3264
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,520
right

3265
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:42,520
think about the way that we open our show

3266
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,520
for any dickheads who think about how dick always opens

3267
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,520
the show and how his theme plays

3268
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:48,520
into that real well right that's good

3269
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,520
so think about how we start our show

3270
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,520
which is usually with Nate like busting and saying the shit

3271
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,520
or munchy you know and then we introduce

3272
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:56,520
each and every one of us

3273
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:58,520
and like what's the right mood you want to be in

3274
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,520
I mean traditionally with the intros

3275
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:02,520
I would just have them fade whatever song

3276
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,520
is playing underneath

3277
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,520
yeah I mean that's the right thing to do

3278
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:08,520
and I mean like I don't know like if we're struck

3279
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,520
with like some great song

3280
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:12,520
and we just like think that like oh if we just do

3281
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:14,520
something slightly different as an opening

3282
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,520
we can like work that like hey man

3283
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:18,520
it's all I'm hoping to experiment and do all kinds

3284
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:20,520
of crazy shit here

3285
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,520
next one is

3286
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,520
by

3287
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,520
Groundless Slash

3288
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:28,520
Garbage Burner

3289
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:30,520
this is PCP punk rock anarchy

3290
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:38,520
okay okay

3291
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,520
I like this part

3292
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,520
good song

3293
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:44,520
look at that song

3294
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,520
wow

3295
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,520
reference

3296
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,520
this

3297
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,520
this is like an AMV song

3298
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:54,520
cause these people screaming over it

3299
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:56,520
yeah

3300
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,520
oh I do I do

3301
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,520
IT'S AMV

3302
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:02,520
this episode

3303
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,520
that's what it is

3304
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:06,520
PROCESSED

3305
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,520
oh it's soft already I was gonna sing it

3306
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,520
I really liked it so much

3307
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:12,520
not for the PCP necessarily

3308
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,520
but I like it a lot

3309
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,520
I can't

3310
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:18,520
I find it hard

3311
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:20,520
okay I think tonally it was about right

3312
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,520
but I find I can't I don't know if I can sign off

3313
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,520
on a theme song that is like

3314
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:26,520
that could be the opening to

3315
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:28,520
any podcast

3316
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:30,520
I generally agree

3317
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,520
since we're doing a contest I'm shooting for the stars

3318
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,520
you know

3319
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,520
and that's it

3320
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:38,520
wait wasn't there

3321
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,520
we already played it last episode

3322
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:42,520
oh we did

3323
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:44,520
I'll have to listen later

3324
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,520
I didn't even know this contest was happening

3325
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:48,520
until I came into this episode

3326
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:50,520
and that's why you know

3327
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:52,520
that's why we voted you out of the PCP

3328
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,520
digi

3329
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:56,520
we were waiting to tell you

3330
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,520
well that was good alright just take that feedback

3331
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:00,520
listen to that whole section and for what you can from it

3332
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:02,520
I wanted everybody

3333
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,520
I mean should we have people in the comments

3334
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:06,520
like comment on like

3335
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:08,520
what you think about the submissions

3336
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,520
feel free but I don't care what they think

3337
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:12,520
yeah okay alright

3338
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:14,520
that's fair

3339
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,520
none of us know what we want

3340
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:18,520
and some of us don't even want to

3341
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,520
I know exactly what I want

3342
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:22,520
I want no theme song

3343
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:24,520
I want individual intros on every episode

3344
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:26,520
well we can't very well do that

3345
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,520
but after we've done this contest

3346
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:30,520
at first and I was voted down

3347
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,520
so frankly shut the fuck up

3348
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,520
and get on board with the program

3349
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:36,520
because that's what's happening now

3350
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:38,520
we don't even want to do it anymore

3351
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,520
I'm in this now

3352
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:42,520
we're contractually obligated to carry this contest

3353
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:44,520
I'm interested I'm invested now

3354
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,520
I like this and I want to keep doing it

3355
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,520
I mean I think it's

3356
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,520
getting all these submissions is great

3357
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,520
there you go

3358
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:54,520
there you go

3359
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,520
there you go

3360
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:58,520
our criteria are all massively contradictory

3361
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:00,520
we should just let the fans vote

3362
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:02,520
that's the worst thing I ever wanted

3363
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,520
no absolutely not

3364
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,520
we should just let the fans vote

3365
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:08,520
I am at least curious of their input

3366
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,520
like they're

3367
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:12,520
oh yeah I want to hear their input

3368
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:14,520
I want them to vote on whether or not

3369
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,520
they think we should have a theme song

3370
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:18,520
whether or not they think

3371
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,520
because personally

3372
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,520
when we started putting the opening

3373
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:24,520
on the show

3374
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:26,520
I didn't know at first because I wasn't listening back to the shows

3375
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:28,520
I had missed a bunch of episodes

3376
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,520
but May listens to all of them

3377
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:32,520
and she was like yeah I skip it every time

3378
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,520
it's a huge pain in the ass

3379
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,520
so I was like well obviously everyone's doing that

3380
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:38,520
because nobody wants to hear this song for the thousandth time

3381
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:40,520
for 30 whole seconds at the start of the episode

3382
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:42,520
so like unless it's

3383
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:44,520
insanely short

3384
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,520
that happened like one time

3385
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,520
that happened one time

3386
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:50,520
it was the one time I saw it

3387
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,520
and I was like this is horrifying

3388
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,520
it was too long one time

3389
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,520
Jesus

3390
02:09:56,520 --> 02:09:58,520
this is what's happening it's over

3391
02:09:58,520 --> 02:10:00,520
we're doing a PCB theme

3392
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:02,520
there's no debate now we're in it

3393
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:04,520
there's no challenging this

3394
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:06,520
this is great

3395
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:08,520
get excited

3396
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:10,520
this is trumps America

3397
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:12,520
this is trumps America

3398
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:14,520
it's sad to have to debate this because I like

3399
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,520
I really like these songs

3400
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:18,520
I really like that they're being made

3401
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:20,520
so I like the contest for that reason

3402
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:22,520
but now it's so fraught

3403
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,520
it's so fraught

3404
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:26,520
okay so the thing is we keep saying all these criteria

3405
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:28,520
but speaking only for myself

3406
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:30,520
if you just make a great song

3407
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:32,520
it makes me hype just because it's great

3408
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:34,520
you might be able to give a thumbs up for me

3409
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,520
just being like you know what

3410
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:38,520
maybe this doesn't fit my preconceived notions

3411
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,520
of what the shows tone should be

3412
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:42,520
but the song is great

3413
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:44,520
on it's own

3414
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:46,520
you gotta get the Beyblade

3415
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,520
animated TV

3416
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:50,520
you gotta change the thing that they say

3417
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:52,520
at the end they say let's Beyblade

3418
02:10:52,520 --> 02:10:54,520
you gotta change that to PCP

3419
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:56,520
and that's what you gotta do

3420
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:58,520
that's what I'll get my vote in the general election

3421
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:00,520
vote for that

3422
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:02,520
I wanted to be

3423
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,520
acapella

3424
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:06,520
of Ocarina of Time songs

3425
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:08,520
that's the PCP intro

3426
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:10,520
alright

3427
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,520
let's go home

3428
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:14,520
alright let's go to questions

3429
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,520
oh god no

3430
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,520
let it end

3431
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:20,520
let the show be over

3432
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:22,520
no we have to

3433
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:24,520
what are all these weird

3434
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:26,520
why are we obligating ourselves to random things

3435
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,520
we've said we're going to do all the time

3436
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,520
can we not make decisions that

3437
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,520
change and evolve based on the situation

3438
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:34,520
that is obviously in front of us

3439
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:36,520
when things are bad don't let them keep being bad

3440
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:38,520
we told people

3441
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:40,520
that we were going to read questions

3442
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:42,520
and people have asked questions

3443
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,520
do they even really care

3444
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:46,520
look look we can bust through the questions

3445
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:48,520
in like three minutes

3446
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:50,520
this is a simple

3447
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:52,520
issue

3448
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:54,520
when the episode goes long we do less questions

3449
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:56,520
so let's just do less questions

3450
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:58,520
here it is

3451
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:00,520
here's the pity question

3452
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:02,520
here it is

3453
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,520
this is a question that is answered

3454
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,520
by another question in this thing

3455
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:08,520
this is from at biscuit meep

3456
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,520
are there any episodes of the PCP

3457
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:12,520
that you wish were never made

3458
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:14,520
from iclone that says

3459
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,520
can you do another show similar to the monster episode

3460
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,520
it was everyone's favorite

3461
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:20,520
there's the joke everybody

3462
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:22,520
monsters 2 literally went

3463
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:24,520
that's what I want

3464
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:26,520
immediately great question

3465
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,520
there it is that's the pity questions done

3466
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,520
onto the bonus lounge

3467
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:32,520
what do they got

3468
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:34,520
someone just says driving is gay

3469
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,520
no question mark

3470
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:38,520
alright let's talk about that

3471
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,520
that is not the question

3472
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,520
I mean

3473
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:44,520
is there anything that you did in your childhood

3474
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:46,520
that really makes you cringe now

3475
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,520
a cringe scene is stupid

3476
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,520
and childhoods are great

3477
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:52,520
and if you did something stupid as a kid

3478
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:54,520
it's not like oh my god I'm fucking so stupid

3479
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:56,520
it's just like wow you did something wrong

3480
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,520
well everyone's done something wrong

3481
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:00,520
I remember Jimmy Newtide

3482
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:02,520
he said one cares not to acknowledge the mistakes of one's youth

3483
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:04,520
Johnny

3484
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:06,520
Neutron also said God of Blast

3485
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,520
do we listen to him do we blast

3486
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:10,520
do we have a holocaust every day of our life

3487
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:12,520
do we do G-Hodges because Johnny Neutron wants us to

3488
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:14,520
no we live our own lives

3489
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:16,520
we're autonomous we're not

3490
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:18,520
ISIS bombers like you

3491
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:20,520
and Johnny Neutron

3492
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:22,520
feeling the emotion of cringe

3493
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:24,520
and thinking that it's a bad thing

3494
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:26,520
that's the first mistake

3495
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,520
that's the first clue that you're not mature

3496
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:30,520
that's what they mean

3497
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:32,520
cringe is bad and it's not true

3498
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,520
yeah

3499
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,520
cringe goes to like chibi bakas

3500
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:38,520
literally we are

3501
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:40,520
bringing chibi back

3502
02:13:40,520 --> 02:13:42,520
mean hippo are in the process of

3503
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:44,520
reviving chibi

3504
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:46,520
this is the point of chibi bakas

3505
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:48,520
okay next question

3506
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:50,520
drawing like yaoi is not cool

3507
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,520
you should be proud of what you've done

3508
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:54,520
actually I haven't answered that question

3509
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:56,520
next question

3510
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:58,520
next question

3511
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:00,520
how much rape bro

3512
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:02,520
question mark

3513
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,520
how much rape bro

3514
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:06,520
next question

3515
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:08,520
next question

3516
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,520
all of these are just

3517
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:12,520
terrible

3518
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:14,520
the problem with this is that

3519
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,520
when you tell people the topic

3520
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,520
sometimes they're all like the same question and suck

3521
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:20,520
what was your favorite anime as a child

3522
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:22,520
there you go

3523
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:24,520
that's the same question but the child

3524
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:26,520
exactly that's what I'm saying

3525
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:28,520
excellent

3526
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:30,520
wait was that a real question

3527
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:32,520
that was a real question

3528
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:34,520
wait who asked that

3529
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:36,520
someone says what were your dreams and ambitions

3530
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:38,520
do you have anything

3531
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,520
it was R U guy

3532
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:42,520
when you were kid what was your favorite anime

3533
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:44,520
my dream and ambition as a kid

3534
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:46,520
was to make a fucking

3535
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:48,520
manga

3536
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:50,520
because I liked dragon ball

3537
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:52,520
I had one volume of dragon ball

3538
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:54,520
just dragon ball

3539
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:56,520
in the library and I would read it and reread it over and over again

3540
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:58,520
I'd be like I want to do this

3541
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:00,520
right

3542
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:02,520
I'm a veterinarian as I already said in the episode

3543
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:04,520
my dream as a little kid

3544
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:06,520
was to trick a digi bro into talking to me

3545
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:08,520
dude same

3546
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,520
what a mistake

3547
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:12,520
when I was young I wanted to be really ripped

3548
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:14,520
that was my as a result of watching

3549
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:16,520
dragon ball z and later one piece

3550
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:18,520
I just wanted to be an anime character

3551
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:20,520
didn't really care which one

3552
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,520
my dream was just to be some sort of artist

3553
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:24,520
professionally so yeah

3554
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,520
my dream was to be 2 million dollars

3555
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:28,520
and it's still my dream right now

3556
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:30,520
we have fan art too

3557
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,520
we have a fan art section

3558
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,520
god no

3559
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,520
the fan art it'll just be on screen

3560
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:38,520
here's all of it right now

3561
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,520
here's all of the fan art on the screen right now

3562
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,520
time for the time for the fan art which we were supposed to do before

3563
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:44,520
question but who gives a shit

3564
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,520
look at this first one

3565
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:48,520
hey thanks parron unit 01

3566
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:50,520
the cool drawing of me

3567
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,520
Adam desu

3568
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:54,520
wait no no this one's good

3569
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,520
I feel like

3570
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:58,520
the spite

3571
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:00,520
that we're like spitting right now

3572
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:02,520
at just like people's like hard work

3573
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:04,520
trying to make us feel like

3574
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:06,520
it's not even funny

3575
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:08,520
it's not even funny

3576
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:10,520
people that worked really hard

3577
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:12,520
to express their sincere admiration of us

3578
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:14,520
fuck you

3579
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:16,520
yo this one in Nate was good

3580
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:18,520
except my eyes are bright

3581
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:20,520
the one that was pointing at the city with his fucking

3582
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:22,520
all of his hair bulging out and everything

3583
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:24,520
let's get to that

3584
02:16:24,520 --> 02:16:26,520
back start for this is Ethan

3585
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:28,520
said in chat

3586
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:30,520
actually

3587
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:32,520
complex backstory here

3588
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:34,520
usually for every questions

3589
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:36,520
we announce we're doing questions and then at the end

3590
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:38,520
Nate will say oh we're done

3591
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:40,520
we're done doing questions now

3592
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:42,520
but last time he didn't say

3593
02:16:42,520 --> 02:16:44,520
we're done doing questions and so for the past week

3594
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:46,520
I've been occasionally going to chat and saying guys

3595
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:48,520
we're still going we need more questions

3596
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,520
so we've been doing that for like the past week

3597
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:52,520
and then eventually I was in a call with Ethan

3598
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:54,520
and he said like he asked a question

3599
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:56,520
and he said hey Munchie how do I throw my best for that at him knowing

3600
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:58,520
and then I said this

3601
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:00,520
by stuffing a bar of soap in your mouth

3602
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:02,520
and walking your football field away

3603
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:04,520
also I'll be kicking you double that son

3604
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:06,520
and then someone will be better

3605
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,520
wait wait wait going back

3606
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:10,520
going back to the urban dictionary one

3607
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:12,520
look at the way that it's shaded

3608
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:14,520
look at the way that shadows are

3609
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:16,520
it's baffling

3610
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:18,520
like the shading technique employed here is baffling

3611
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:20,520
I don't think this person is an expert

3612
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,520
well it's weird because like he did it right

3613
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:24,520
in certain places but then he like

3614
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:26,520
like look at the folds on your robe like that makes sense

3615
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:28,520
like down at the bottom

3616
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:30,520
but then over it there's just these big thick

3617
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:32,520
fucking bars

3618
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:34,520
those are anime blush lines

3619
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:36,520
yeah we were all grilled

3620
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:38,520
yeah we were all grilled

3621
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:40,520
I think the point of that is that the light is at his back

3622
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:42,520
so he was trying to make it like he was darker in the front

3623
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:44,520
oh no I get what he was going for

3624
02:17:44,520 --> 02:17:46,520
he just put his technique as bizarre

3625
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:48,520
is all I'm saying

3626
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:50,520
there's a face on the bottom left there

3627
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:52,520
who cares about this fan art of a lot of us

3628
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:54,520
how about this fan art of only me

3629
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:56,520
how about that

3630
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,520
Lane Slimes

3631
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,520
that one down there

3632
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:02,520
I like that me and Nate are directly

3633
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:04,520
in front of each other

3634
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:06,520
like we're Nemesis

3635
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:08,520
that's true

3636
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:10,520
I'm the only one not making a comment

3637
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,520
I'm just giving a death stare

3638
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:14,520
it's the angel and the demon

3639
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:16,520
you know Nate and Mage

3640
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:18,520
I have a huge dick in this

3641
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,520
a huge dick

3642
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:22,520
lots of cubes

3643
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:24,520
what was the BD for though

3644
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,520
I have no clue

3645
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:28,520
I'm assuming big dick

3646
02:18:28,520 --> 02:18:30,520
I assumed big dick as well

3647
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:32,520
this was like in the chat

3648
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:34,520
because I saw where this was

3649
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:36,520
it was for a specific reason that BD was there

3650
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:38,520
but I can't fucking remember

3651
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:40,520
back to daddy

3652
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:42,520
then we have another one just of me

3653
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:44,520
because I'm just like a photogenic person

3654
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:46,520
this is my lines line

3655
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,520
this is me eating my ice cream soup

3656
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:50,520
ice cream soup

3657
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:52,520
I love ice cream soup

3658
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:54,520
that's my favorite soup

3659
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:56,520
you fucking animals

3660
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,520
except that I'm on keto now

3661
02:18:58,520 --> 02:19:00,520
wow

3662
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:02,520
what the actual fuck

3663
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:04,520
why

3664
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:06,520
here's my chip

3665
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:08,520
it's just like a digi

3666
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:10,520
my ice cream soup is different from

3667
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:12,520
munchies ice cream soup

3668
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:14,520
probably just

3669
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:16,520
Mage what is your ice cream soup

3670
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:18,520
it's just literally melted ice cream

3671
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,520
I like melting ice cream

3672
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:22,520
unpopular opinion

3673
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:24,520
I really like the expression on this drawing

3674
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:26,520
by the way

3675
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:28,520
it's cute

3676
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,520
let me make a radical proposal

3677
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:32,520
let me make a modest proposal

3678
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:34,520
if I may

3679
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:36,520
maybe

3680
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:38,520
art of one of us doesn't count

3681
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:40,520
I know what you mean

3682
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:42,520
art of you a lot

3683
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:44,520
and you like it a lot and you want to talk about it

3684
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:46,520
what

3685
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,520
I hear what you're saying

3686
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:50,520
and there's definitely some logic to that

3687
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:52,520
like this is not like this is

3688
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:54,520
this first one is Nate fan art

3689
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:56,520
and this second to last one is Munchie fan art

3690
02:19:56,520 --> 02:19:58,520
this is not PCP fan art

3691
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:00,520
and same with digi

3692
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:02,520
maybe we just need to use the smell test

3693
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:04,520
if it seems PCP related or not

3694
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:06,520
I mean

3695
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:08,520
I haven't been given the chance

3696
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:10,520
to use the smell test most of these

3697
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:12,520
would not have

3698
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:14,520
let me say

3699
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:16,520
the Munchies one

3700
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:18,520
aren't they related to what he said

3701
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:20,520
related to the PCP

3702
02:20:20,520 --> 02:20:22,520
they're not just Munchie

3703
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:24,520
like the digi one

3704
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:26,520
I would argue I guess it's just

3705
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:28,520
digi fan art but the rest is

3706
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:30,520
PCP related

3707
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:32,520
okay alright

3708
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:34,520
we should smell test these before

3709
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:36,520
alright here we go

3710
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:38,520
Karabelle I have not seen this

3711
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:40,520
can we play a game until it just hit play at the same time

3712
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:42,520
oh god okay yeah

3713
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:44,520
but you have to click and pause so it would load for you

3714
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:46,520
I will click and pause

3715
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:48,520
alright I'll do that

3716
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:50,520
let's all press play

3717
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:52,520
one, two, three

3718
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:54,520
go

3719
02:20:54,520 --> 02:20:56,520
hello everyone and welcome to another

3720
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:58,520
episode of the pro crastonators

3721
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:00,520
podcast

3722
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:02,520
I am the best guy ever

3723
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:04,520
and today we're joined by an illustrious cast

3724
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:06,520
two scoundrels

3725
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:08,520
first up Ben St

3726
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:10,520
excuse me

3727
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:12,520
I'm so sick because my body

3728
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:14,520
has been neglected

3729
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,520
it's wasted away

3730
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:18,520
there it is

3731
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:20,520
that's why I'm on keto

3732
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:22,520

our art is so funny

3743
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:44,520
that we deserve animations

3744
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:46,520
like are we just like such like a

3745
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:48,520
unique cast of characters

3746
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:50,520
that we're going to play like in an audio clip

3747
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:52,520
of like a part of our show that we've already had

3748
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:54,520

3750
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,520

of all segments to choose one like that

3756
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:10,520

3757
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:12,520

3758
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:14,520

3760
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:18,520
