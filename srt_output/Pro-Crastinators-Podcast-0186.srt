00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,520
Ah, fancy meeting you here. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:18,200
ever. And let's see who we got here. We've got Gibbontake. There you go. In and out. We've

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:28,080
got Ben Saint. Yes, technically correct. Accurate. That's the best kind of correct. Tom Oliver.

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,160
I did it. I'm here. I made it. Just in time. Just in the nick of time. Nobody's ready for

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:46,000
breakfast. Mage, what's up? Apple's motherfucker. And that's it. And that's the last one. Apple.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,880
It's like that Apple Pokemon. Like I do like them apples. I mean, I'd rather... Oh, you

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,120
know what? I love oranges. There was a big debate about oranges versus apples the other

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,320
day, but I gotta tell you, oranges, apples, they're dodging. Let's not revisit the juice,

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,560
debacle. What the hell happened? Let me just tell you, the best thing, one word, grapefruit.

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,240
Grapefruit is the greatest fruit on the planet. You're right. And no one appreciates it. Nobody

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,120
appreciates grapefruit. Literally no one else in the entire world likes grapefruit but me.

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,200
What the fuck? Don't be one of these hoity-toity motherfuckers with your grapefruit scissor

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,400
and your spoon, putting sugar on it. Yes, that makes it like a fucking bowl of sweet

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,880
cereal. No, you peel it like an orange. That's so fucking yucky. That's so fucking gross

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,440
that people will put my fucking juice. Yeah, like a grapefruit's fucking sweet already,

16
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,200
you fucking coward. It stinks of the bourgeoisie and I'll have none of it. It's something fucked

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,640
up's going on here. If you're like, sugar would add something. Pure sugar would add something

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:56,920
to this experience. I fucking hate sugar in most foods. I feel like sugar is like to

19
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,160
have like sweet chili or like sweet and sour food, like sugar in like a savory food, like

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,320
a main course. It just feels wrong. I hate barbecue sauce. It's disgusting. No, I don't

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,640
agree with that. I read a recipe. It's the worst fucking shit in the world. I read a

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,880
recipe on r slash keto recipes. That was for crustless keto pizza. Funny thing about this

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,760
pizza is that you just fucking put cheese on a pan and bake it and the cheese just becomes

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,280
the crust. It's really funny. You know, that's like a weird take on the fact that... Just

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,240
get rid of the middle man. You're only there for the sauce and cheese anyway. That's all

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,400
you really want. Yeah, it's like if you don't do this complicated thing where you use all

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
these alternate almond flour for the crust, call it... No, just no crust. Cheese on the

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,080
pan. Just bake the cheese. Just eat the cheese. But then this guy, who was like, if you want

29
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,000
to do like a fancy sort of sweet pizza, sprinkle a little stevia on top of the crust. Oh yeah,

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,640
stevia. What the fuck? I don't get that. Like are you fucking kidding me? Who on this fucking

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,560
God's green earth has sweet pizza? That sounds like a nightmare. I mean, I understand like

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,880
Hawaiian pizza has pineapple on it. That's not my thing, but like I get it in concept.

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,840
But to just take like some fucking like sugar substitute and just sprinkle it on top of your

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,320
pizza, you must be fucking high, bro. I mean, what's wrong with you? Some places have like

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,560
cinnamon breadsticks. You can get like, and they're very similar to like the normal garlic.

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,720
It's like that just is the crust of the pizza. But we're not talking about making a cinnamon

37
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,880
pizza or like a dessert pizza. This is just a regular pizza made with like cheese and

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,080
fucking pepperoni. Just sprinkle some sugar on top. No. Yeah, the combination. The combination

39
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,880
of sugar and savory is what annoys me the most. Like I love desserts. Everyone can enjoy

40
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,840
a good dessert. But like having a sweet thing in something that is otherwise savory really

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,920
annoys me. I turned my nose up. I'm a savory boy. I'm a spicy boy. I'm a savory spicy

42
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,800
boy. You're being very elitist right now. That's all. Guys. What? Have you ever had chocolate

43
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,680
pizza? That sounds just like a pancake. I've had like Domino's. I've had like the like

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,480
dessert pizza, which is just like an Oreo fucking frosting thing. I had a chocolate ice

45
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,080
cream sandwich where I just got two slices of white bread and put chocolate ice cream

46
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,640
in the middle. It's actually really good. Bread goes well with it. I had I had chocolate

47
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,680
pizza for Mazda and it sucks and I'll never have a chocolate pizza again. There's this

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,280
place nearby that looks like the Buskin Baker or something. They have a food truck outside

49
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,280
that is it's like ice cream donuts and they have they have like these they give you a

50
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,600
warm like freshly cut donuts. They cut it in half and in between they put like a layer

51
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,160
of like pizza. I think I had like raspberry ice cream. It was fine. It was okay. Oh damn

52
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,200
and ice cream and I was not overly impressed. Sounds all right. Yeah. I also made another

53
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,600
recipe from r slash keto recipes. I made keto brownies and I don't know what the fuck is

54
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,880
wrong with them. All right. I don't know. It said it said use xylitol. Use erythritol.

55
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,720
Don't use stevia. I don't understand why you can't make this in the fucking lab and concocting

56
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,440
with magic spells and tinctures. I don't know why you wouldn't be able to use stevia if it's

57
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,400
like it's just as sweet if users are but apparently but I use so I was like that's stupid. I made

58
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,560
it. I used stevia and it's not sweet. It's fucking these brownies are the textures mediocre.

59
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,920
The flavor is fucking like bitter. They're awful. But I can't throw them out because

60
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,880
they're made of fucking butter and almond flour which is too precious and I can't waste it.

61
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,360
So I have to I'm still shocked to this day by the fact that when you like when you what's

62
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,360
the word cook. I don't know when you fry onions they turn sweet which is which is truly stupendous.

63
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,360
I guess so. I guess so but I don't know. I guess I fucked up. I guess I did it wrong.

64
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,640
My brownies are terrible. They're they're a nightmare. Well that's so I took the pizza

65
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:04,160
idea and I sprinkled stevia on top of them and I don't know. It's a little better. Hey

66
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,640
here's a fact. Here's a fact that makes me mad. The main ingredient in stevia the zero

67
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,680
calorie sweetener that's not sugar. Do you know what the first ingredient is bread dextrose

68
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,120
it's sugar. But they remove all the bad strokes and they only leave the decks. Wrong. You're

69
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,760
super speedy. They just use they just use little enough of it that according to the

70
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,120
round serving size which is like a one packet's worth it's under five calories worth so they're

71
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,320
allowed to claim that it's zero. In fact it is. It is almost as bad as this regular sugar.

72
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,760
Don't use the powdered kind. Is it just like the percentage that like they have a large

73
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,040
percentage of nothing on top of the sugar. So it's not it's not even that large but yeah

74
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,640
some of it is just it's just got like bulk ingredients that just like bulk it up and

75
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,600
don't add anything. So what's the difference between the liquid and the sugar. Liquid doesn't

76
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,880
have the bulk. The stevia the stevia liquid is just like the extract from the plant which

77
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,400
you know. Okay. My my friend bought a stevia plant and you can actually like pluck a leaf

78
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,120
off a stevia plant and chew it and you can taste like a sweetness like as though it's

79
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,680
got sugar in it because it just has like a naturally sweet like fucking I don't know

80
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,760
oil or essence or something in it or whatever the fuck. Makes sense. You can just put stevia

81
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,960
leaves in your tea when you're fucking cooking your tea or whatever and it'll sweeten your

82
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,840
tea. Isn't that interesting. I'm interesting. I just thought that was interesting. Yeah that

83
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,680
people die in car crashes all the time. Speaking of things that are interesting. Let's get this

84
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,640
out of the way right now. In fact the Pokemon is out. Right. Okay. There you go. It's out.

85
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,880
Me and Major played it. It's you know. Here's my one minute run down. Wait. Wait. Are you

86
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,480
going to talk about it on content in like a week or two. I think. Okay. I'll close my ears for

87
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,960
now. I don't want to get spoiled on Nate's opinion. You know. Oh okay. Sure. Sure. I will

88
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,600
surely not go into full detail here but here in brief. It's pretty good. It's not like awful.

89
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,800
I kind of feel like I feel bad a little bit because I felt I feel too like I was kind of

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,560
swept up into like wow looks like this game is total shit for reasons I I don't know like there

91
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,000
are technical limitations that do annoy me as I play when I just like actually I mean one of the

92
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,040
annoying the only technical thing that's bothered me so far is that the like render distance of

93
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,880
enemies is of people in the field is very short and you can see them pop invisibly and it like

94
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,160
makes the world feel way less real which is unfortunate but that's that's a technical thing

95
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,160
that you know it's not like they wanted to do that so it's overall when you mean a technical

96
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,200
thing you mean they fucking couldn't do that on to on current hardware I mean there's no way they

97
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,400
like wanted to do that I'm assuming that was a concession for you know I mean it doesn't even

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,600
look that frame rates that like in graphically intensive it looks like a fucking ps3 game well

99
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,720
I mean what's the argument here they like they chose to do this for whatever engine to make the

100
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,240
game whatever engine they've designed was not optimized it's not a well optimized yeah okay

101
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,440
criticism for that but like all this all the oh my god it's like the worst game ever it's like it

102
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,800
doesn't bother me that much no it's not the worst game ever it's just technically unimpressive okay I

103
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,080
don't mean to lump your points in now with the the group anger that I was just like because like I

104
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,400
I have seen a few clips here and there I clicked on an arlo video for like five minutes because he

105
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,640
was talking about it and was like yeah what do you think what are you talking about models models

106
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,160
are the same okay there's controversy whatever it's pokemon well that's the worst like the game the

107
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,040
game just looked sort of like yeah yeah the game it looks like a ds game but on on a bigger screen

108
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,760
the field looks kind of neat the the only someone was telling me on twitter that the field is really

109
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,680
cool the the only thing about the game that I don't think is either a lateral move or shit is the

110
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,680
field um how do you what do you think about the field the fact that pokemon are physically

111
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,440
visible in the field and you run up and hit them I think is a is we have low expectations for pokemon

112
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,720
right but considering that it's a massive jump up it's a it's way better than it used to they already

113
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,320
did it in in this is this is like the closest this is the closest they've ever gotten to a pokemon

114
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,000
mmo and I've always wanted a pokemon mmo so they are they are wow wow we almost got what we wanted

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,160
cool um they already did they already did that in um Pikachu Eevee whatever the fuck well I'm

116
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,400
glad they beta tested it in that game for this one the real one I'm sure I'm talking about like

117
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:47,120
max raids and stuff that's the mmo thing uh because you you you get with friends and you

118
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,600
battle giant pokemon that's I don't care about that at all you haven't tried you don't know you

119
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,320
don't know the joys I've done a couple I mean what I hate organizing things with people I just want

120
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,040
to go do it so you get a bunch on my own so you can like specifically join up with your friends and

121
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:08,240
the people you want to play with I think so or do you just get randomly cued um you're cutting out

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,960
I think you can do either I believe is how it works I'm saying do you get randomly cued and grouped

123
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,480
up with random people or can you be like I want to raid with this guy like my friend I want to

124
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,480
raid with my friends um if you if you have friends uh and you say like a far far fetched possibility

125
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,160
but people can can join uh you quickly but other but but but strangers can join too so you can so

126
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,600
you can choose to do it with your friends if you want to yeah but like I mean okay that's all fine I

127
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,880
appreciate that you're in the past how they do it because I can't I can't go into the uh I can't

128
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,800
I can't cook curry with my friends it's very troublesome uh to to get sort of things I don't

129
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,880
care about at all I I only care about the like main playthrough of the game and then like the

130
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,920
larger meta game uh of like people the I don't do competitive fighting like at all but I am very

131
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,960
disturbed by the fact that so many pokemon and moves are removed which will impact like the

132
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,120
overall scene because I like watching false swipe gaming's review of you know how a pokemon did

133
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,920
through all the ages that's my main connection I haven't I have I have a lot to catch up on

134
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,520
but that guy makes a lot it makes a lot over there uh well there's a lot there's a lot of pokemon

135
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,320
to get through this is a lot of pokemon not as many as there would have been can't wait for 20 20

136
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,480
the year is 2036 and it comes out how was Eternatus competitively really I honestly

137
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,240
am very excited for that video one day I can't wait but uh okay in short this game is a pretty

138
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,480
okay game it's actually better than sun and moon I think I was gonna I was gonna say how to use the

139
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,000
compared to sun and moon the fact that there's no sun and moon all pokemon aren't in is such a

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
massive blow it's it's traumatic and it's very distressing they might extremely maybe that maybe

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,040
when they do the ultra maybe when they do ultra sword and shield they'll fix that I hope so I

142
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,240
because like it's obviously just because it's obviously like a fake a fake limit that they just

143
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,640
made out I heard I heard a rumor why the limit actually exists if anyone cares to hear okay so

144
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,160
like they originally wanted to import the models from like sun and moon and and you know update them

145
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:31,040
what not for for this game but they realized too late uh that like uh whatever they were using to

146
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,520
import models uh failed so they had to recreate the models from scratch to make them like identical

147
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,440
and uh they ran out of time and instead it wasn't gonna let them extend the deadlines so they had

148
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,480
to definitely definitely I am sympathetic I am sympathetic you know I don't know maybe that

149
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,480
yeah they're gonna they're gonna recreate they made every they made fucking 700 pokemon models

150
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,040
for the last gen and they're just like whoops can't use them gotta make them again no well

151
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,080
I mean as the as the only person here who does any 3d at all I can say that is that sounds patently

152
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,760
retarded to me even to someone with like baby level 3d like there's no like there there are it's like

153
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,120
saying oh I started making this game and I realized all these jpegs I made won't import into this

154
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,840
engine it's like it's a fucking jpeg there are 3d equivalents from that export it as an fbx and

155
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,560
import it into literally whatever you're using like nintendo is assumedly like game freak has

156
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,040
probably made their own proprietary game engine to make this game so like they would know what works

157
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:42,000
with it like it's their engine well okay there's no way you can't just export a model and import it

158
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,920
in just because like not only is is there just like standards for models like an fbx and shit like

159
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,520
that but like these models in the game have identical geometry and there's no way you can

160
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,640
recreate a model with literally identical geometry it can be similar you can have like

161
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,360
basically the same topology you know it's not gonna be identical it's like saying that was brought

162
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,040
up and arlo talked about in his video briefly about like the models are literally the same

163
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,440
okay like that seemed to be based on I didn't do further research that seemed to be based on

164
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
the fact that they put up like the mesh models of characters from like sun and moon versus in this

165
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,960
game and they visually look the same to us but I mean I didn't see any kind of like technical

166
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,400
explanation that proved that these weren't recreate well you can just look at them and see that they're

167
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,400
all identical wouldn't it make sense if they recreated they'd look really really similar

168
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,200
because they're the same no they would never they would never look identical all of them no

169
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:42,000
creating a 3d model it's not real life creating a 3d model is not like like you don't type in a

170
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,440
bunch of code and it just makes all the points you have to draw it basically in 3d it's like it's

171
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,240
like saying you draw like a like a picture on like a piece of paper and then you try to draw the

172
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,760
exact same thing it will never look exactly the same right exactly I don't believe you okay well

173
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,120
I've done it if you could just copy paste if you could just fucking copy paste the code to have it

174
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,760
identical that's the same thing as just importing it from this from the last generation like I can

175
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,520
believe guys if they're saying like the reason the models are they had to redo the models was like

176
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:20,000
they had to redo the texturing because they've went from like a qvga display on the 3ds to a 720p

177
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,160
display on the switch and the textures were too low resolution they had to redo them because they

178
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,400
did they redid the textures and they redid the shaders because the shaders and the textures

179
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,120
are higher resolution and look different that's one thing but they definitely from what it looks

180
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,160
like and we're gonna know soon because like now that the game's out people are going to be able to

181
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,840
start ripping all the models from it and do like point for point comparisons but like the models

182
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,840
the geometry like when people are talking about models we're usually talking about the geometry

183
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,440
not the textures and the mapping data the geometry looks completely identical as it was also identical

184
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,120
in let's go Pikachu to the 3ds models because Game Freak themselves had said we're going to use

185
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,440
these models long term that's why we made them as good as we did on the 3ds and why we're running

186
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,680
its performance issues because they're gonna be forward they're forward-facing and then a couple

187
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,600
years later uh we forgot how our own engine works we can't import standard models back into our engine

188
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,720
I agree I agree guys here's the thing like maybe I'd perhaps be willing to hear some of these excuses

189
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,400
but here's the thing it doesn't matter because I'm totally 100% with you I don't care what happened

190
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,080
to them in development I have no interest because the as the kind of person I am playing these games

191
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,960
my number one most important issue for me playing these games is this is top priority get all the

192
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,160
Pokemon okay I don't care that is great that is completely fine and if you were arguing that

193
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,040
point I'd be like fine but you're not arguing that point you're saying I don't believe you and

194
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,080
saying I don't believe you is different than saying I don't care so say I don't care from the start

195
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,600
and we can skip 20 minutes I still don't believe you that it's not possible to recreate a 3d model

196
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,440
no that is fucking impossible to do it identically if you overlay the points you know that you know

197
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,680
that artists make these models right not just like programmers like it's not just about like

198
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,680
punching numbers into a code look we've we can see what the models look we see the mesh why couldn't

199
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,880
you just use that image and like recreate it you can image it's not an it's not a 2d image it's a

200
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,840
3d model that was created by a fucking 3d render modeling artist or whatever the fuck you call him

201
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,840
like someone like like like someone created it someone someone made all the creative decisions

202
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,160
involved in like how does it move where the joints place what is the fucking geometry I'm just

203
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,320
considering all the like versions of these Pokemon that have existed throughout time I just have a

204
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,920
tough time different in every generation uh you slightly yeah I yeah I have no idea how you can

205
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:55,520
like you yeah you're talking to Tom is a person Tom is a 3d model man he's done a lot of this he

206
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,280
would know more than you why can't you just accept that you probably don't know what you're talking

207
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,960
about here I don't accept that I don't accept that okay well you're welcome to be overly ignorant

208
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,760
in a public space it's totally fine anyway anyway this was just a rumor I heard so yeah yeah yeah

209
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,040
it's fine it's fine let's let's let's let's move on let's move on to something else please

210
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,600
well anyway the point was I think this game is not as horrible as everybody was getting all

211
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,440
in a tizzy about but does have many flaws as you sure it's a perfectly serviceable Pokemon

212
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,880
experience I I expect a Pokemon I got Pokemon I'm pretty happy honestly like my standards for

213
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:42,160
Pokemon are quite low so like they didn't surprise me in a bad way and actually like they build the

214
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,520
only real everybody feels it's funny how you guys are you're saying exactly what I expected as though

215
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:56,400
like it's good I like I'm sorry I'm having fun but I am I am not upset that you're having fun

216
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,800
but like I still think everything they did is bad I don't I'm not arguing you're focusing on all

217
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,160
that stuff because you haven't played the game and experienced any of the good stuff so how would

218
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,480
you there's no basic like it's like you can you can say that like there's this is a fun game it's

219
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,160
another good quality Pokemon experience and also be like game freak were kind of cunts for lying

220
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,200
about all this shit yeah like those are two things like I can I can make the wrong decisions and they

221
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,400
have the right priorities and stuff I mean I agree with all of that like I I feel like

222
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,720
that this attempt like I don't think game freak were like oh we can't physically do it I'm sure

223
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,720
they they have the you know the capacity to copy files over I think this was just like Nintendo

224
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,920
and game freak probably realized that the amount of Pokemon there is is too big and they want to

225
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,160
like curb like Pokemon what do you call it creep creep that's exactly what Pokemon creep okay so

226
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,160
like like they just want to in the future they want to set a precedent that not all the Pokemon are

227
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,200
gonna be in every game yeah obviously everybody hates that everybody does not like that that is

228
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,160
a thing but they you know they're just go they're introducing it now and they're probably gonna

229
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,960
do it in the next game it's like we've got new Pokemon we want you to care about these new Pokemon

230
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,600
and um I don't know like I I mean they probably should have just done that from the start I mean

231
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,800
they probably would have saved them because like they they really should have I've been saying ever

232
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,080
since like third gen that they're making too many new Pokemon every generation I think adding

233
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,120
hundreds of new ones every generation was inevitably going to lead to this point I would

234
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,880
rather they add like 20 to 30 each gen and focus on building out features because that's more interesting

235
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,640
yeah I like there's already because every generation we just have functional replacements

236
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,200
we got the bird we got the two bugs we got the fire water I mean that's true but you know what I

237
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,720
heard as they're just do I absolutely agree we have so many Pokemon new Pokemon are fine and all

238
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,360
but like yeah we don't look it's it's the core development decisions that are impacting a

239
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,360
large part of this because another theory I heard as to like one of maybe the main reasons they

240
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,240
didn't do this because there are several Pokemon that have appeared in the game's code uh that

241
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,640
was like the gen one the gen seven starters something like that and uh some of the discussion

242
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,240
that I heard around was that because they didn't want to make specifically Gigantamaxed models

243
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,440
of these and like you know potentially all the Pokemon who aren't in the game it was that

244
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
development decision I mean again this is just one of the competing theories we don't know

245
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,280
Gigantamaxed models are just the same model well not all of them Gigantamaxed models are scaled up

246
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,640
not every Pokemon Gigantamaxes right like some some have a special Gigantamax and

247
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,680
others just Dynamax but Dynamax models are just the same it's like it's like a mega form is that

248
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,840
true I don't know if that's true or not I believe right mage you've done you've done the rates and

249
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,640
stuff you would know the difference right they I mean they're definitely they look the same they

250
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,440
get bigger right I mean when Pikachu doesn't have a Gigantamax model it's just a big Pikachu

251
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,440
isn't yeah well okay Gigantamax it well Pikachu actually does change I've only seen the one uh

252
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,840
the the special boy you get from from let's go Pikachu which becomes the fat Pikachu

253
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,080
yeah so it's like slightly different I mean the tail is definitely different all the all the Gigantamax

254
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,000
Gigamax I don't fucking know which ones wait all the ones I've done have just been the same we've

255
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,760
seen Dynamaxed and Gigantamaxed Gengar and Gigantamaxed Gengar is like the weird one with a big

256
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,800
mouth and then there's Dynamax Gengar who's just Gengar but big and he has like a red texture

257
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,760
overlaid on him yeah as far as I understand it yeah red like specular lighting or whatever right

258
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,200
I haven't seen much of this in the game in any case I I feel like it's it's most likely they're

259
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,560
going to try and like make it so that in the future they don't have to put all the Pokemon in all the

260
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,280
games and people won't be as upset next time because they've expressly stated that's their desire for

261
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:01,760
people to be prepared for that but you know what it feels like it feels like that decision went into

262
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,320
like like laxadaisical designs for these new Pokemon knowing that in the future some of them

263
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,520
they can if they're not popular they can just you know easily not you know continue to use them

264
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,160
some of these designs are very stupid looking they are the new ones I'm just you know I guess

265
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,680
on some level I can sort of understand why they want to set a precedent of not every

266
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,120
past Pokemon is in every new game I don't think that's completely ridiculous I'm just

267
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,760
concerned because I think that like gen one is going to get like super overrepresented

268
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,440
and it already is yeah it's that's going to continue it's just when you consider the full

269
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,880
context where there was much discussion about how in the last gen or whatever they hired a company

270
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,800
to future proof the series by making high quality models that could be reused and now we're learning

271
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,200
like the next generation they've dropped I mean I just think it's not surprising that many of us

272
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,240
would be frustrated really yep yeah um I mean yeah like like what the Tom was saying I would

273
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,240
rather just have a few new Pokemon ever Jenna and focus on the features we don't need fucking we don't

274
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,800
need impudence for fuck's sake hey no actually you know like he grew on me no I won't fucking hear it

275
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,240
it's unacceptable we don't need ice cue for fuck's sake yeah ice you can go but impudence and it's

276
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:32,000
evolution I like them I big grown on me no you don't understand you don't understand I had him I had him

277
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,120
from him when he was a small baby boy I got him in a max rate so I got him early on and he was a

278
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,000
small baby boy and now he's a big big buff boy and and he has like your maternal instincts are blinding

279
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,840
you to raw but you don't understand I don't accept I don't accept his validity he's he's like he's like

280
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:55,280
my two favorite types in one I can't hate him I can't hate the boy what is he's ghosts fairy no dark

281
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:02,720
fairy dark fairy yeah fine that's all fine and I can't I can't prove it but I feel like the dragon

282
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,840
quest monsters models have been like exactly the same since the ps2 era mm-hmm like look they look

283
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,440
like they haven't changed at all through all the games I'm not familiar with the series so I wouldn't

284
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,800
know but it's just because they got like really strong design sense like updating the models

285
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,640
wouldn't make much of a difference anyway but like I don't know it's a different it's a different

286
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,400
thing because it used to be in 2d yeah it doesn't matter I guess dragon quest used to be in 2d as

287
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:36,640
well I want to remind people of a story we're gonna get 4d pokemon look at this horse dude okay

288
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,480
apparently there's only like seven there's eight pokemon that have a gigantamax form

289
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,960
sounds about right eight of them here's the lit oh look at that they're all gen one and and four

290
00:26:50,960 --> 00:27:01,680
okay charizard butterfree pikachu uh meowth eevee eevee corvanite dreadna and alchemy alchemy

291
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,280
this just reminds me of like the the pathetic display of the amount of a lowland pokemon forms that

292
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,040
were there's like 13 or something are there more galarian forms than there were no i feel like

293
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,920
there's more but not well maybe well let me well let's see there might be like nine there's wheezing

294
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,080
there's farfetched there's mr mime i was arguing with um kazi and munchie the other day that like

295
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,240
to me an alolan form is basically a new pokemon and i know and i'm willing i'm willing to give them

296
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,480
that um oh no i mean pathetic and the like the amounts that they didn't change from gen one like

297
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,080
there's so many gen one pokemon in sun and moon oh the alolan pokemon were like they were cool

298
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,040
and there was only like 10 of them forms ivo yeah uh like a lot of them are bad like alolan meowth

299
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:57,440
and is pretty shit i i love alolan puritan puritan with his wide face it's it's better but like

300
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,320
alolan meowth is literally just meowth with fucking a different expression there's a

301
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,760
fucking galarian meowth too oh yeah that was the whole door galarian meowth is better because it's

302
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:15,920
more different yeah i like it like fucking fucking uh snowy volpix is like beautiful like this yeah

303
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,040
yeah i wanted i just wanted more alolan forms i didn't want to see magic herb again i didn't

304
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:29,120
want to see goldine again goldine is back baby i hate her so much why is goldine back we don't

305
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,760
need goldine replace it was just like really fun it was like a red one when you watch the show and

306
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,760
every time misty would throw out goldine would just flap around on the ground she'd get pissed off

307
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,120
yeah goldine is shit okay what if they made like galarian uh goldine and seeking that were like

308
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,360
fucking awesome what if i would love it what if they were like fighting steel type and they were

309
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,480
just like super bad i would love it because it would be it would be new and it would be fresh

310
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,040
and it would be something it would be fucking anything yeah i mean that's kind of what they

311
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:04,320
did with farfetched and maybe meow yeah that's right because like every generation like we said

312
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,680
they have the three birds that's basically piggy but again but like different and like it's it's

313
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:16,160
fine and it's different sometimes the the the bird pokemon of the day is like lame but sometimes

314
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,240
it's really cool i like the galarian was pretty cool yeah i the talent thing was cool i like the

315
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,160
galarian far farfetched because he's like looking down at you like your scum it was funny i love

316
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,760
galarian farfetched man bobapedia doesn't have images up of all the different galarian forms

317
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,120
yet it's kind of disappointing you know what you know what call me when pokemon is like at a point

318
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,600
where goldine isn't there and then i'll buy it immediately of all the pokemon to keep i you

319
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,240
know it's i mean they don't keep miscellaneous forgotten fish actually they do keep some of them

320
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,600
from other like basculin he's in there what does he evolve into i don't know something else

321
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,680
it doesn't it just has like two then why the fuck is he in this game what do you want that

322
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,080
pokemon what do you mean why is he in the game just because he doesn't evolve a lot of pokemon

323
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,520
done sparse does anyone gonna use basculin does anyone want basculin what's basculin okay but

324
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,360
whether or not he's basically a magic problem not well okay okay the evolution true like scarmery's

325
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,360
good scarmery doesn't evolve but i mean that's just one piece of the puzzle here it's that it's a

326
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,520
basculin is uh i mean is basculin's not the most exciting pokemon no it's true

327
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,160
i'd say he's the most exciting pokemon well i've never seen anything that's pretty funny

328
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:36,000
he's better than goldine i get excited about how unexcited i am when i see basculin um i don't

329
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,840
know but at least basculin's got something going on with the red and green it's got the red and

330
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,560
blue forms sort of that don't have any meaningful difference between them whatsoever how exciting

331
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,320
okay i don't want to i don't want to go to bat too hard for basculin

332
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,640
even though we had that's the legendary banana banana if galarian basculin looks like this image

333
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,600
you just link give here that's in the show notes i would be fully on board or maybe evolved into

334
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,920
a basculin form eval fighting fighting water we need we need less less anthro less anthro pokemon

335
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,920
please i want all anthro and the end i want everyone to be my choke

336
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,200
that'd be good okay guys i want i've been wanting to say like uh this whole controversy with pokemon

337
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,240
and i like i'm not people aren't wrong um but uh what it reminds me of um is a little game called

338
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,720
fable and how it absolutely messed up initially at least from what i heard like it made so many

339
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,600
promises that it couldn't keep and people were really angry about it but me when i was when i was

340
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,640
little i didn't know anything about the controversies and i played fable for the first time and i loved

341
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,400
it it was such a good game and it still is and i i have it on my well i'll tell you why i'll i can

342
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,320
tell you why that happened it's because stiff that's a stiff and malin you uh peter peter malin you

343
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,400
he endorsed peter malin yeah pokemon and it was all downhill from there yeah um no peter peter

344
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,000
malin you right the the okay peter peter malin you the guy who made he made all these fucking games

345
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,280
and peter malin you is just like a chronic over promissor and he just hyped up the game and said

346
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,400
like how realistic it was going to be how many features it was going to have what a diversity

347
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,440
famous you can plant a seed and come back like years later and it'll grow into an actual tree

348
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:35,200
crazy shit like that shocking um so it was it was it was it wasn't that the game was bad

349
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,040
it was that it was overhyped and overpromised and the developer made all these promises

350
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,800
didn't keep it's basically the same it's the same thing that happened with no man sky

351
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:48,000
same thing that happened with spore um it's not that the game it's not that the game was like

352
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,040
necessarily horrible it's that it was supposed to be something different the developer set the bar

353
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,680
too high like you have to control your pr or you're fucked like you can make a nine out of 10

354
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,360
but if you promise an 11 out of 10 it's gonna be a two out of 10 in everyone's books because like

355
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,320
fuck you you lied to me yeah it's like i bought this game because i thought i could do x y and i

356
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,480
can only do right because like you're only gonna focus on what isn't there at that point because

357
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,720
it's like oh you hyped up and told me i could do this and now i can't do this so fuck you like

358
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,520
you're just you're just adding extra baggage to your game that doesn't need to be there that was

359
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,920
that was the case that's shit on the dl until you know it's gonna be and peter mollin you apparently

360
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,600
he'd just like he'll do this with every game that he makes so he'll promise the moon and then he'll

361
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,920
the game will come out and everyone will be like where's the fucking moon asshole and he'll be like

362
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,520
and then he'll go silent for a while and come be like hey guys fable two i'm so that was embarrassing

363
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,160
dog shit it was going to put fable three like this is where we're gonna really realize everything

364
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,280
that i said i was gonna do and ten times more but you know that all being the case that's all

365
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,640
even though like while it's being developed be like guys we fucking nailed it like we're fucking

366
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,040
nailing it it's everything i said i don't know why he's everything i said and more and then as soon

367
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,800
as it comes out ah it just not it fucked up a responsible game developer who has like any amount

368
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,280
of information on like how games are made and like what contemporary games can do like should never

369
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,920
have promised the things that peter mollin you promised in fable it's ridiculous to think that

370
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,360
your game would have those features but uh uh considering this game it's just the fact that

371
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:26,240
i know how pokemon is developed lately i.e. disappointingly and with tons of flaws and

372
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,480
just the whole world is talking about all these bad things about the game that are all bad but

373
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,680
slightly less than everybody i don't know seem to be expressing i just feel like there was so much

374
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,400
criticism that now that i'm playing it and i kind of feel like the promise that was given to me by

375
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,400
gamefreak was a new pokemon game it has you know dynamax that's it that's no they definitely

376
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,400
definitely did not over they definitely did not over promise with sword and shield it and that's

377
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,360
why i think i feel relatively satisfied my disappointment is just from the lack of evolution

378
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:07,120
the series has shown perfectly over a million billion years do you think that um uh like uh a

379
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,560
natural a backlash against the backlash is allowing you to enjoy pokemon whereas otherwise you would

380
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,760
be like yeah this is yeah but i mean you're enjoying it exactly as i think it doesn't make

381
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,640
just as much sense as someone being mad at fable for being over promised like is one valid and the

382
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,800
other isn't valid i think i'm not talking about i'm not talking about valid i'm just wondering like

383
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,000
do you think um the backlash like the overwhelming backlash against pokemon is making your mood

384
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,840
playing the game better than it would otherwise be at the start slightly yes because i was expecting

385
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:44,240
it to be so bad uh and it uh wasn't that i've never i've never assumed that pokemon is going to

386
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,320
like the children shield is going to be a bad game i just assumed it's going to be technically

387
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,640
unimpressive and not have my favorite pokemon which is all the outrage really has ever been

388
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,920
not and not do anything too new or interesting i mean the playthrough so far is straight up

389
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,560
better than sun and moon so like and i didn't expect that and so i'm just i'm you know happy

390
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,960
that that is the case it's it has many of the same flaws as sun and moon but it's slightly less

391
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,080
annoying moment by moment and there's like more gems which i'm happy to have back there's eight

392
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,040
instead of you know whatever the weird thing they were doing in elola and uh and yeah i don't know

393
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,240
i mean the everything about the pokemon not being in the game that haunts me i hate that but that's

394
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,240
end game that's after you beat the elite four and i haven't done that yet so it hasn't impacted

395
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,480
the experience yet so just my moment to moment playing is uh yeah i like i like the characters

396
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,360
and i like the story so far they're all just terrible i mean they're not bad it's not it's

397
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:46,080
nothing is there um is there an is there like a team skull like or like an edgy gladeon or whatever

398
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:52,800
his name is uh team yell and bd can you um can you can you ride can you ride on your pokemon

399
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,280
nope no sadly zero out of ten yeah sorry there's no following pokemon there's no i

400
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,000
they literally put that in in fucking go go let's go pikachu or whatever the what

401
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,280
what game am i talking about the one that had the let's go let's go oh i was right yeah they

402
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,920
literally had the ability to ride your pokemon and let's go pikachu and let's go evie and they and

403
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,200
they why why would they make a good feature and then they just throw it away i mean they did the

404
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,120
same thing with heart and they pulled it out so it has always been about i guess like adding great

405
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,560
features that improve the experience and then forgetting about them because they were the

406
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,280
gimmick of that one generation yeah yep i mean that that's the only thing they keep

407
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,480
is pikachu and that's it well i cannot believe that mega forms have just been dropped it is

408
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,360
beyond belief personally so much are they i never like mega forms so well neither did i

409
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,320
but they made it a main thing i was forced to accept them under protest and now they just remove

410
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,720
what are they just completely dropped like you cannot do them that's correct yeah are you sure

411
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,200
because you couldn't do them in alola until end game so like is it an end is it a thing maybe you

412
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,000
can access once you get to the end no i'm pretty sure like there's there's nothing in the game yeah

413
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,200
there's nothing in the game indicating that you would be able to link there's no no now it's all

414
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,360
about the like six pokemon that you can gigantamax look you can dynamax and there's a new mega there's

415
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:25,920
a new form of mega forms and it's just worse and there's less of it but you can dynamax like

416
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,440
literally any pokemon only some of them have fancy and this is talking to somebody who there's like

417
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,720
now godzilla mecha godzilla and mothra essentially in pokemon and even i'm like maybe this was not

418
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,000
the best use of your resources it's literally eight pokemon have a special gigantamax form these are

419
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,320
the things these are all six of the traumatized five of them are gen one five of them are gen one

420
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,040
three of them are gen what nine are we on nine now we you shouldn't even consider the dynamax

421
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,000
thing like like okay mega evolutions functioned as like a new evolutionary form these aren't

422
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
basically not like that at all it's just no they can get big i don't think you understand what a

423
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,720
mega form is because a gigantamax is way more similar to a mega than to a regular evolution

424
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,840
well i mean mega forms were nothing like a regular evolution they were just like a thing you could

425
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,880
activate in battle i'm aware of how they function in battle but they give you like a new form to

426
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,160
the pokemon and like new types and stuff shout out if every pokemon had a like specific

427
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:32,640
changed form if every pokemon had like a specifically changing form when they dynamax

428
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,680
or whatever like then it'd be like kind of like a new form but because only like eight of them

429
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,160
i mean what's butterfree's dynamax or it just gets really big wings and its body stays small

430
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,360
it's not that's nothing bro what are you talking about like literally what are you talking about

431
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:54,160
i'm i'm just trying to compare the the distinction between why i found mega forms to be like like

432
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,200
mawile mawile didn't have an evolution but it got a mega form that basically functioned like

433
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,920
sort of like it was an evolution in how it looks and how it fights and that stuff okay okay where

434
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,280
it doesn't mechanically function that way how is how is gigantamaxing different exactly let me

435
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,640
explain okay so like because no one is a new form yeah like okay let me talk go on then mega forms

436
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,000
so like they change the typing of the poke most most often as i don't remember if there's any that

437
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,080
don't change the typing uh sometimes they get new abilities as well and you know they get like a new

438
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:38,160
a new uh look to them like and so it's almost like a new evolution for them in in in a way

439
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:48,720
it's a temporary one but yeah whereas dynamaxing they just get big and stronger um but like with

440
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,720
the exception of those eight but even those eight that do look different they still have the same

441
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:03,040
abilities and typing and stuff they're just big so is there what's the what's the difference between

442
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,920
dynamaxing and gigantamaxing uh dynamaxing is like everyone gets big like literally any pokemon

443
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,480
can get big that's all yes i understand gigantamaxing they look slightly different when they get big

444
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,440
but it's but it's um like it's visual it's just visual it's only a visual difference as far as i

445
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,560
know i could be wrong but as far as i've observed it's just a visual thing this is the this is

446
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,440
the fucking worst i mean we could all agree it's shit it's it's dumb and whatever whatever it's

447
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,800
but i just i'm such an abused fan i hated megas i thought they were dumb i didn't want them but

448
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,040
you know what eventually i was like hey man we've moved on everybody we were doing megas now it's

449
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,360
time to accept it my argument for megas is that they add they do add some like strategy to like

450
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:58,800
like they do increase the fucking possibility space of like choices you have to make in battle

451
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:07,280
and i think they're defensible in that way so gigantamaxing it's like that it's like megas but

452
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,040
they don't do that well imagine gigantamaxing and pokemon showdown it just fills the screen you

453
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,920
can't see them anymore it does make a difference it's basically just you just power up one pokemon

454
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:25,120
for three turns that's yeah that's the okay that's it yeah so i guess i get i get i get that like

455
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:31,680
yeah like dynamaxing and gigantamaxing um um is uh you you've got to choose when to do it so it's

456
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,000
it's like a mix between a z move it's like a mix between a z move and a mega form

457
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,800
basically yes that's true that's that's true uh do i have to have an item do i need to be holding

458
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,120
an item to do that nope i mean technically but you get it in the game like in a cutscene so like

459
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,240
you don't you don't even know you have it yeah it's not something the pokemon has to be holding

460
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,680
in place of like a leftovers or a no no no no okay what were you saying gabby you were saying

461
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,720
something now it's just like reminiscing on on my favorite gimmick my favorite gimmick of the

462
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,960
fucking pokemon contests which which allowed um like pokemon that are not fit for battle

463
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,280
to still have a role in in the game and you could like you could get a tiny cute thing

464
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,720
and if it knows some cute moves you can win the cute contest and you can get a ribbon

465
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,920
i miss those that's true are they existed i never liked them i thought they were bullshit

466
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,200
wait i'm glad they're dead i have an idea and i don't know i don't know if this is like a good

467
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,960
or a bad thing but what if literally the point of dynamaxing i don't even want to say dynamaxing

468
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,840
and gigantamaxing because they're literally the same thing yeah what if what if the what if the

469
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:56,160
point of dynamaxing is that it is pointless and a a like like non-feature or like like a what if

470
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,800
we made a bad game on purpose guys what if what if the point is that it is like a stupid throwaway

471
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,080
thing that did not require a lot of thought or effort to incorporate into the game specifically

472
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:13,920
because they intend for it to be a throwaway feature that is like specific to this generation

473
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,000
and will never be used again and they're like wait we we worked so hard we made all these like we

474
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,560
put a lot of energy and time and resources into building these new features for these old games

475
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,400
and then we just even though they were good we just threw them away so we know we're gonna

476
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,000
just throw away whatever new features we make for the next game so why don't we just make it some

477
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,400
bullshit i mean i wouldn't blame them for thinking that way it's what's happening well i would almost

478
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,040
not blame them except that obviously it's like they're so close so close to the revelation that

479
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,640
maybe they shouldn't fucking make a good make good features and throw them away but they come to the

480
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,720
opposite conclusions like well let's just make our features worse so that it's not bad when we throw

481
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,640
them away i'm pretty sure they just got inspired by pokemon go when it's success

482
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,920
what the fuck are you fucking high what are you talking about like like like the the raids the

483
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,520
the pokemon are just real big yeah that could fucking be it that could actually be the reason

484
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,640
like people who play pokemon go they used to sing big pokemon we should put that in the new game

485
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,360
that's silly i see and then you go up with friends and you get battle the giant pokemon

486
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:24,720
i don't have any fucking friends mage okay i'm not getting the fucking game sorry it's fine

487
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,200
you don't have to i i literally don't mind people not getting the game maybe you know what maybe it's

488
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,120
maybe at some point i will get the game i'm not taking an ideological stance on like do not buy

489
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:40,720
this game i don't care that much uh but i i don't feel like spending the $60 right well now be the

490
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,840
time where people go as such as myself and seek out those mythical fan games that i've heard so much

491
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:52,160
about that they say it's time i mean yeah i mean to i just have been too lazy yeah i don't know

492
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,720
some some good some good stuff out there just use the fan game known as your imagination

493
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:08,160
i have to go take an angry piss okay i have one small gripe with the game i just very tell you

494
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:14,160
one uh among all the things that people are saying like um i've beaten five gyms so far

495
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:22,000
and like the choices for clothes you can buy is a bismuth so far with at least like sun and moon

496
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,200
you had like like very themed sort of shops throughout the town like oh there's like the

497
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,240
cute shop and then there's like the sporty shop and then there's like the the hipster shop or

498
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,560
something like that for clothes well this one is like do you want this sporty look or that sporty

499
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:45,440
look and i'm like where are my cute frilly dresses god damn it this is an athletic game for athletes

500
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,480
such as myself off i don't want to dress you know mage on this subject though i think that just

501
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,320
touches on kind of one larger point this is this is something people have said in general about it

502
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,480
and i wonder if you wait wait wait the looks are sporty i thought this was like in scotland i thought

503
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,760
you were going to be wearing like winter coats and stuff and mittens not really no like so far

504
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,520
all the gloves that are available uh look very sporty biker like like not biker but like biking

505
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,480
that's so lame gloves i know so far i've only beaten five gyms so i don't know maybe i'll be

506
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,600
proven wrong after the next gym and i'll get my frilly dress and i'll be happy but so far

507
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,280
like i had to i had to beat so much of the game and i still don't have my cute dress i am very

508
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:32,000
disappointed well okay so the issue i feel the boys wear kilts i i don't know i mean that's in there

509
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,760
i don't know uh so the this issue of like not a lot of clothes fair okay perhaps this touches

510
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,400
just into the larger issue that kind of touches all these issues that's like like okay on the this

511
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,400
is on the switch right this is like a console game i don't game for a small company whatever

512
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,720
but like when you just compare when you compare i mean i don't i don't know how many

513
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,640
fucking development staffers they have those those things matter but whatever like when you just

514
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,080
compare the other games that are like on the system i mean it's not hard to just be like wow this

515
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:05,360
game is like you know developed by babies compared to some of the other games that are on there and

516
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,040
then it's just it's reasonable to be like this is like the most profitable franchise in the

517
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:16,320
fucking world ever okay okay that that's not fair because why why is that not fair uh because uh

518
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:22,080
because the small development team game for a bigger team hire more people why doesn't get

519
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:29,680
that much money as people assume it does that's what no issues i okay but but mage mage that even

520
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:36,160
even if that's true the pokemon company does so why is a pokemon company not like hey game freak

521
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,680
here's some money i don't know why they don't do it i don't know okay i don't know which of these

522
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,080
companies is to blame but some combination of these companies should have said to themselves

523
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:52,160
hmm we have probably too few staff members i agree i agree i just don't i don't like people

524
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,520
saying like oh they have millions and millions of dollars they do though mage they do they literally

525
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:04,160
do well game freak is co-owner of the pokemon company someone at some point in the chain failed

526
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,600
to allot the necessary resources to fucking make i mean we can all agree on that they they fucking know

527
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,720
they don't need to though people still buy the game and they sing as praises and they defend it and

528
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:23,600
that's just how it will always be not me uh well i i do wish they would improve well i mean it's

529
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,640
really funny to compare this to like uh like what is it like xeno blade chronicles or some of those

530
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,080
games that just i mean like they look a million times better dragon quest and the render distance

531
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,520
is more than like 20 feet and you know i think things of this nature i still say even town looks

532
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,520
better than than pokemon i believe that aren't uh aren't they coming out with like a another pokemon

533
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,800
mobile app that they're gonna make millions upon billions of dollars already didn't they the uh

534
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,040
what is it like pokemon masters i think yeah masters which is by the way not a good game don't

535
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,800
play it it sucks i i've played it well i got my ham doom i stopped playing there you go

536
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,640
eight pokemon go eight billion can gigantamax

537
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,480
well not gengar is not one of them at least they cut half so it's not less than one percent

538
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,000
not according to bulbopedia well then it's wrong we've seen it's didn't we see it's you literally

539
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,720
saw the giant gengar that's stuck in the ground with its mouth open i mean is do you think is

540
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,880
bulbopedia just not up to date probably it's possible some information is let me all right well

541
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,120
let me let me let me check i mean and and i'm not sure if it was in bulbopedia but in one of those

542
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,160
pokemon uh sites it said like you can only get galarian ponita in pokemon sword which is not

543
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,240
true you can get it only in shield so you know yeah see i feel like there's been some things like that

544
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,200
that are maybe just straight up like incomplete or inaccurate that wait and we'll have a rosier

545
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,320
picture to a degree i don't know the things i'm complaining about but you know oh no okay bulb

546
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,720
i'm sorry bulbapedia is wrong okay the the list is still not that impressive but i'm counting one

547
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,000
two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen

548
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,520
seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five

549
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,440
twenty six twenty six pokemon have gigantic max four so that's something and let me count

550
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:29,120
how many of those are not new pokemon or first gen um zero yes it's literally none yes literally

551
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:35,600
every single one is either a gen one pokemon or a um really but the cake pokemon is new and i know

552
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,840
that's a new one that's what i said either gen one or a new pokemon here's the here's the here's the

562
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:49,760
fuck you know you oh that's life baby read them in weep so all right that's that's that's the

563
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,800
spread this has been an hour of pokemon discussion this number this number actually makes it even

564
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:01,360
makes the uh the gen one bias like even worse and even more agree well do you not think going

565
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,760
forward it's going to be gen one plus whatever we made for this game and that's going to be the

566
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,840
focus like that seems like definitely sure fire away to make the box yes and then every and then

567
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,480
each one of those features that only include so don't get attached to any new pokemon and sword

568
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,760
and shield because they will be gone next yeah the next next generation all the special features

569
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,800
none of them will get none of them will get anything but luckily it's shit and i won't miss

570
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:32,400
gigantamaxing so i feel blessed luckily we made the features bad on purpose so you won't miss them

571
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,400
when they're gone wouldn't it be interesting if they made a game that actually had like a huge

572
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,080
amount of scope for some console like the switch i'm like you could go to all the regions in each

573
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,640
region had its gimmick but it only worked in that region that would be cool i mean that could happen

574
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:50,720
you know it it won't fucking happen it won't happen but someone could make that potentially

575
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:56,400
oh 100 it could be done pixel on minecraft oh yeah that's right page you're gonna have

576
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,400
page giant imagine to to to fucking pixel mon not not yet but i'm sure you already kind of have

577
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,400
that with pokemons having various sizes i suppose oh yeah you know we can gigantamax our uh or you

578
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,520
know our big our boofalons and we can also min max them by making them so very small you can't

579
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,120
even see them down there so really minimize minimize we've got the we've got the gutch coming in going

580
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,080
on the peace be minecraft server so here you go what happens if a gigantamaxed muck uses minimize

581
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:29,280
he just turned back to regularity that's a fascinating question it's a small but red

582
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,400
we'll see that happen i don't know like i because well i mean just when you're dynamaxed or whatever

583
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,600
like your moves change so i wonder if you don't have access to minimize when that happens to like

584
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:47,120
change the thought of it ahead of time they may have they may well have man imagine if

585
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:53,200
fucking mucks in real life could minimize then we wouldn't have so much pollution oh that's how

586
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,920
we get rid of pollution we just you know um we sent in ties tm minimize sentinize the the

587
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,880
landfills it turns into little pokemon we have to just bombard landfills with radiation in hopes

588
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,040
that they evolve into muck and don't do more damage to the environment we need we need to go there

589
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:15,360
and wheezing because yeah we do oh that's true that's what we really need yeah yeah that's um it

590
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:23,360
which is basically carbon tax the pokemon i feel i feel like i feel like um like this gen

591
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:30,000
has has something to say about about like global warming because of like that stupid penguin

592
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,240
and then like the dead corsela and uh the wheezing well hang on you know i heard that was a little

593
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,920
bit of fake news about that corsela wasn't that like a isn't bleached coral just like a natural thing

594
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:49,040
or was i wrong is that it's ghost type i yeah i could be wrong so what what's this what's the

595
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:57,600
relevant implications it's dead yeah uh there's a variant that's a ghost oh maybe okay maybe i

596
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,880
kind of need a little more than that if the point is just the the coral's dying okay cool got it

597
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:09,920
but uh i don't know yeah like i i i could be wrong i don't mind being wrong i i'm just if i may i

598
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:17,280
would like if i may i would like to change the subject permanently please okay let's do it and uh

599
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,320
and uh to elia czar please at the beginning as soon as we start talking about pokemon put on screen

600
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:28,400
click that click this timestamp to skip from the pokemon discussion to the politics discussion

601
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:38,160
yes yeah change my mind let's go back to pokemon i want to follow up on on the thing i was i was

602
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:47,440
looking into yeah or talking about like a labor and general election in the uk please uh the bbc

603
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,400
website has this little thing the the manifestos aren't out yet which is annoying this i really

604
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,440
want to read up and see what the fuck they're actually talking about but the things they've

605
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,840
all been saying on their campaigns have been like tallied up and and put into like little a little

606
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:08,480
drop down menu so you click on what party and it will tell you like based on health and economy

607
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,640
and education like what their policies have been like spoken okay and i was looking around and you

608
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:21,520
know uh labor seems to be the one for me um conservatives are you know i policy i'm not

609
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,080
really going to talk about but the one thing i wanted to mention is that i checked out the brexit

610
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:33,760
party and obviously they are like generally not for me but there was one thing that really annoyed me

611
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,720
yeah it's that break the brexit party want to abolish the first pass the post voting system

612
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:46,160
and implement majority or you know the the better alternative the one that everyone wants that

613
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:53,360
wouldn't make democracy a lot more fairer okay so like so like and labor and conservatives the most

614
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,920
likely parties to win don't promise that at all so it's just sort of reinforces the idea that the

615
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,120
better voting system is not encouraged by the parties who win all the time because they know

616
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,920
that if they allow that to happen they would stop being in power and it would stop being a two-party

617
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,960
system and i hate the idea that if i want that fucking thing i need to vote brexit party i i'm

618
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:22,800
not going to do that it sucks you know who want you know who wants voting reform

619
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,760
bernie sanders but also yang and i think a couple of the other democrats in i mean okay like in

620
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,880
america we vote for a congressman obviously like separately from the executive branch and stuff

621
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,840
whereas okay actually to be fair i don't actually know how it works who are you you in english you

622
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:44,400
vote for the party you want right and then they get x number of representatives in the parliament

623
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,800
is that there's there's the country is split up into constituencies and you have members of parliament

624
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:57,440
people who stand to become members of parliament and you vote for them in your local area they get

625
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,400
elected and then they represent the the party that part of okay so that's pretty much like it works

626
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,720
it's the same okay yeah i'm sorry i just missed so are you voting for a person are you voting for

627
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,520
a party you're voting for a person okay um and who rep who is part of a party yes okay got it got it

628
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,680
i assume it's the same in the the u.s but with senators or something like that yeah the senate

629
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:26,080
and uh the house representatives someone okay this guy um i was talking about lula the the

630
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:32,480
brazilian uh former president who uh got uh who was put in jail on like a lot of people

631
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,760
say they were trumped up charges of corruption we got it again that we're taking down the brazilians

632
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,960
these were trumped up charges he this is how i get my legacy like the supreme court voted that

633
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,520
that was that he shouldn't he doesn't have to be in jail anymore um so he's out and uh bernie's happy

634
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:55,200
about it and this uh this guy tom tom thanks tom tom for this heads up let me fucking read he said

635
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:01,360
he he he messaged me on discord like tom but there's two of them he said to tell me about like dude uh

636
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:07,120
hell yeah lula uh and he said i think this is impossible for me to try this is just too funny

637
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:12,000
i had to read it i think it's impossible for me to translate this to you but lula is not only cool

638
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,680
because of what he represents he is absolute peak commie swagger he got a new girlfriend while in

639
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,760
jail and on one of his first videos out of jail he said quote i am this is a translation i am a

640
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,680
74 year old man with the energy of a 30 year old and the hard on of a 20 year old i want to fight

641
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:39,120
um pretty cool if true i mean you know death to commies but that's pretty funny

642
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,360
that's funny it's a funny joke um okay so that's all i have to say about politics other than that

643
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,000
it depressed congratulations lulu i loved your appearance in final fantasy 10 it was a great

644
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,120
uh it was a great time yeah so who you voted for hippo you voted you voted in labor um well

645
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,840
my constituency is just based on the name of the party i feel like labor is probably the one for me

646
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,200
but that's really all we need to know at the end of the day that's not what i that's the opposite of

647
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:14,720
what i was gonna say i mean yeah labor is jeremy corbin is seems like in a many ways a bernie sanders

648
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,400
sort of guy which is why everyone hates him yeah uh that's my impression they don't want to him

649
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:27,440
they don't want him to give money to people who need it no so what the fuck yeah so uh i'm

650
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:34,240
probably voting for him hopefully like the the the moment my constituency is conservative but

651
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,840
it's only by a small number of people so hopefully that can be switched we can fucking we can really

652
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:46,000
don't i really i really have doubts for like labor having a large enough majority to make

653
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,720
a serious like difference that they can actually implement the policies that they want to yeah

654
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:58,160
like it no matter what happens everyone is still like split in the country nobody's

655
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:05,360
really talking and and and you know caring about each other and each other's problems i went to

656
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:11,680
i went to tasty burger uh with kazi and munchie on friday or i don't know whenever i went i went

657
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,200
the other day and uh i went and i got the i was drinking my i was drinking my bullshit piss water

658
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:23,440
light beers low carb ha ha i was i drank i was drinking at the bar and there was this guy this

659
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,920
guy next to me was talking to the bartender and i realized they were talking about politics

660
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:35,200
and this guy next to me he was like he was like a he was a good boy bernie bro and i and i my

661
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:40,640
heart bled for him he was talking to the bartender and the bartender was just like the bartender

662
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,440
was arguing for why we were for why we should keep trump in office and his argument was like

663
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,920
politicians all lie the government is corrupt and trump is the worst of them all he's the biggest

664
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:59,920
liar and the most corrupt of them all but like that's good because it'll expose the bad things

665
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,520
that was his argument and he like i mean he's he's steadfastly stood by it he would not be

666
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:11,360
just waited from this government is totally evil then i suppose putting an incompetent at the

667
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:17,120
head of it as a way of dismantling it is not the craziest idea as opposed to someone who's it

668
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:22,160
good right at perpetuating that you're correct you're correct nate accelerationists are psychotic

669
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,240
freaks and shouldn't be allowed to vote well his argument supposed to be that because trump is

670
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:32,640
outside of like the system that his the reason for his corruption is for exposing the bullshit

671
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,480
or just that he's operating for his own gain and not the the system's gain so therefore

672
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:45,920
like his motives are different no i just wanted to think of a way to say trump is all right i think

673
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,040
he didn't i mean maybe if i'd gotten more of a more of his take he might have elaborated but

674
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:57,040
all i heard him say was that like trump is it seemed to be the idea that trump is the most corrupt

675
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:04,160
and the worst and therefore like having him in power will mobilize people against the government

676
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:10,000
i think me or or will like expose or will will like it was me my impression is that it's basically

677
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,040
uh let's make things let's just make things as worse as they can be things if like they'll make

678
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,600
things really bad like things are bad now but they can really bad and then people will have to get

679
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:25,120
angry and do something about it or yeah it's like it's it's like i kind of see where he's coming from

680
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:30,880
but it's just it doesn't make sense because when obama was in office all of the you know the other

681
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:37,360
side were like trying to get rid of him the whole time here's my question and they didn't do anything

682
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,880
here's here's my question is like well okay if you think that trump being a thing is gonna like be so

683
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:49,840
bad and so upsetting that it will inspire like a counter movement then like okay so here like

684
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,640
for example we are we somewhat like an opposing party comes along as like hey let's swing the

685
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:00,400
pendulum the other way and do something different why would you then be like nah though keep trump

686
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,120
like shouldn't you be in favor of the counter movement well i think i think the the again i'm

687
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,880
just putting words in this guy's mouth obviously but if you if you think the entire system needs to

688
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,600
be torn down like a party solution obviously is not going to fix anything like this guy clearly

689
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:19,760
wants like violent action i guess that's true um i don't want violent action personally i don't know

690
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,000
about but he might just want i mean this based on the little detail we have it sounds like he

691
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,680
probably wants smaller government if i had to guess this guy's desires for how the world should be

692
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,280
maybe violent actions putting too many words but clearly he wants a solution that's not government

693
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,920
based because it sounds like the entire system is not he has no faith in it anymore yeah i guess so

694
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:49,120
yeah like it's like even if trump like being the president people aren't gonna think you know

695
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:54,960
because trump was a bad president therefore presidents are like a bad idea and then if the

696
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,160
democrat comes in next they're not going to be thinking that for them because they're a different

697
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,040
person yeah if it's not it's not going to dismantle anything i mean if any like the the

698
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:11,120
attitude is bad because it like people hate trump so much that they'll fucking be happy with some

699
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,400
fucking idiot like joe biden just because he's not trump and it's very distressing very depressing

700
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,640
i'm very upset i can't even think straight uh i can't abide by that i just found out that devolve

701
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,960
patrick's apparently gonna run now too yeah that's right our old governor of massachusetts are more

702
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:36,640
people declaring oh yeah yeah hurry any day now man any day now no oh yeah oh yeah it's her turn ben

703
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,360
and i want to have you mansplain her out of the race stop it's too late the fucking debates are

704
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:47,120
already going are you kidding me well i guess i guess the crackpot theory right now with devolve

705
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,360
patrick is that because these friends with obama he's gonna have obama basically backstab biden

706
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:56,640
and like come out and support devolve because devolve patrick was basically died obama here in

707
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:02,160
massachusetts he like had basically the exact same kind of like leanings you know what you know what

708
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:08,240
him as obama too to have to have obama withdraw his support from biden and back someone else and

709
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,520
split up biden's constituency sounds wonderful so a change i take back everything i said i love

710
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,800
you devolve patrick thank you for running thank you for doing this are you at all concerned that

711
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:22,080
devolve patrick could theoretically be worse than biden in some way that i don't um well i mean i

712
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:28,800
have no i mean okay fair enough but probably not i mean probably not if he's if he's he's probably

713
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:34,560
just he's probably similar he's probably similar to biden he's probably similar to biden if obama

714
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:41,200
is gonna back him um but also like not senile and also just we gotta split that voting block

715
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:47,280
by the way just slightly here um uh gib on the on the subject of you uh you know in your your

716
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,600
discussion of labor i was just curious because i had heard recently everybody's favorite political

717
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:59,120
commentator sargon i heard him say the other day that labor expects to take a some some some

718
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:04,480
serious hits something like losing many many of their boys and i have no idea i don't know

719
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,640
british politics at all but i'm wondering if you are is that is that do you know of this is this

720
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,920
something happening or is it foolishness what do you mean hits like i mean like half of them will

721
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:19,680
be voted out of office in the upcoming election is what is what the fear was sargon would say that

722
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:26,720
i mean i haven't heard that i've been watching mostly bbc news and this liberal media back at it

723
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:34,080
again like well bbc is generally impartial but they they do skew to the left um but uh i think

724
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:41,200
that the people have been like saying that labor has like thrown out so many big numbers like i'm

725
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:46,000
going to do this and this and this and all this money is going to come from uh taxing the giant

726
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,520
corporations and the super wealthy and it's like yeah but if you do that the amazon and google will

727
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:57,600
leave you can't you can't expect them to actually give the money um so it's like oh how could you

728
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:06,000
possibly like he said the other day um by 2030 we're going to have superfast fiber optic broadband

729
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,160
cables uh uh like owned by the the people rather than a company and it's going to be called british

730
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,240
broadband and we're going to give it to the the entire country and it's like that's going to cost

731
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:21,840
a lot of money um but it would be nice but like people were like hmm how are you going to do that

732
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,600
it's like i don't know money i don't know economics or like what the amount of money we

733
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,240
have at the moment is in order to spend on that and of course brexit is going to change things like

734
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:38,880
with trade deals and all that stuff so yeah i don't actually know much about how how feasible

735
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:45,120
most of these things that are being said by any party are all i do know is that the conservatives

736
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,080
have been running the country for a long time like a decade and they fucked it up in many many

737
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:57,200
ways and i don't like them so any change is good yeah labor is pretty pretty it's pretty good

738
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,440
pretty good to me thanks man thanks for that thanks for making me feel a little better

739
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:10,480
well anyone else got away in elizar feel free to drop a timestamp here to skip the

740
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:16,400
politics discussion yeah we it's like that's a good show everybody we touch on everything everyone

741
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:24,000
wants to hear about oh wait no wait one one last little small topic um i went to uh the royal

742
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,840
albert hall a few days ago a big place really big uh very cool um i was up in the gallery uh and i

743
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:38,480
was seeing snarky puppy the jazz oh you showed me that my favorite streamer yes my favorite

744
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:48,080
streamer on twitch.tv yes uh she was streaming live in the royal albert hall uh no like the jazz

745
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:56,160
fusion prog rock cool guy band full of uh you got the the three piece brass uh virtuosos and and

746
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:01,920
like the super like percussion maniacs and the and the drummer he was insane and the they were all

747
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,680
going nuts playing their music and it was really fun and i was up in the very very top and it was

748
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:13,600
like 20 pounds for that ticket it was a standing ticket and if you see pictures of the royal

749
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:19,280
albert hall you can see you know there's chairs and there's boxes and stuff but right at the top

750
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:26,400
there's like this like big open space of a ring but just like a like a a ledge you just lean on

751
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,960
and it was so cool damn that's a big ass zone i'm looking at in this place uh here posting an image

752
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:40,960
over in the chat over here uh it's it's like if if if anybody has an opportunity to go to a place

753
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:47,760
that has like a standing room at the top i don't know how many places have that but i really actually

754
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:53,440
prefer it to having a seat because when you have a seat it's like a cinema you can't you can't like

755
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,680
really your legs are stuck you don't have anywhere to actually put your drink without kicking it if

756
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:03,120
there's no cup holder um and every time somebody anywhere near you needs to go to the bathroom you

757
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,600
have to stand up and shuffle through but when you're up at the top you're just sort of standing you're

758
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,760
like you're you're like on the balcony basically just looking at looking down you can walk around

759
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,560
there's bars right behind us you could just go and get a drink and these guys are like a they're

760
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:22,160
like a jammin ass fun boy kind of get up on your feet and move a little bit kind of group yeah so

761
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,640
you know what he's sitting down for this bullshit yeah they they were grooving they had a big old

762
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:34,640
bit where um they were having a the half the Royal Albert Hall was clapping three four and the other

763
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:40,000
half was clapping four four it was like drum beats it was like whoa yeah clapping it was like clapping

764
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,280
and tapping my feet and moving my head like yeah this is really fucking good i love snarky puppy

765
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:50,240
i've been to some concerts where like you're sitting down and it i feel bad for the performers

766
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,240
because sitting down and watching feels like i mean i bought my dad tickets for his birthday

767
01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:01,120
wants to um uh oh shit what is it uh fleetwood mac we saw fleetwood mac once and oh yeah it was uh it

768
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,360
was cool and all that but uh like we were sitting down in the area and i just felt bad like i wasn't

769
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,480
being into the performance enough even though it was totally sick and uh it was awesome um i forget

770
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:19,120
the the guitarist but he's a fucking shred master i only know albert hall because i heard a like

771
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:28,640
world war two like fight song one time that goes like hitler has only got one ball the other is in

772
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:38,000
the albert hall his mother the dirty bugger cut it off him when he was small why i don't remember

773
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,680
where i heard that that that is a that is a fun like i think it's a football chant it's just or

774
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,000
why would you chant about hitler at football i mean he's not he did it during world war two

775
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,720
or something it's a sing it's a sing song thing that like that like melody would be sung at a

776
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,800
football show can you just like insert anyone in place of hitler it's the sort of it's the sort

777
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:02,240
of thing i heard when i was a kid in in in the playground like you know edgy kid would say about

778
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:10,960
hitler has only got one ball he's with the batman the christmas uh what was it uh just uh yeah um

779
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:18,000
batmobile lost a wheel and a joker got away yeah very edgy very edgy yeah imagine the joker

780
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,960
winning that's making fun of hitler was a really fun past time for for young school boys now we

781
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,840
take it for some reason now i've made that hobby into my career and let me tell you it's going great

782
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,320
we didn't really do that as in america growing up because we didn't need to have kicked his ass we

783
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,360
weren't we weren't we weren't concerned about the whole hitler question it was pretty much a settled

784
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:44,640
question i'd say uh yeah you know what another grounded tread uh just to finish the the the

785
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:51,200
story i i put like a snippet of that on instagram oh and it was like really fucking sick and like oh

786
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,520
yeah people are gonna love see like people are gonna be impressed that i like this kind of music

787
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:02,960
put it on instagram uh and it got muted within a few hours well because i copyright yeah but like

788
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:08,400
it was a live performance but i think the reason was was they were they were recording it and

789
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:15,360
um they said the guys said at the end uh this recording was actually like a live album so you

790
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,760
know you're all gonna be in it and it's like oh i'm gonna be in a live album what if i yelled

791
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,800
really loud the whole time so i get like a little what if i what if i yelled really loud onto the

792
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:32,320
album uh patreon.com slash tpcrastinators oh that'd be good is it tpcrastinators it's the

793
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:42,160
procrastinators for the procrastinators whoops whoops that's what i said oh no those assholes

794
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:48,000
at tpcrastinators are gonna see a spike damn it i think like that night they made a mix of it and

795
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:55,440
then it got copyrighted and it got fucked so that sucks i don't like that that happened so quickly

796
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:00,240
but uh whatever yeah that's too bad i mean just as a competing theory perhaps i mean that okay that

797
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:04,880
all makes sense but like some events like this they just say no recording allowed even if they're

798
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:10,720
not making they they didn't have anything like that up there and i don't know but it was it was

799
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:16,160
i only recorded right at the end it was muted by instagram right not by um like this company or

800
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,200
yeah yeah just well i it i didn't get like an email saying it'd just been muted it was just

801
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:26,880
this video has no sound like a few hours later it's like oh i have such a strong sense of deja vu

802
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:32,640
about this conversation had happened but i know it couldn't have happened but my god deja vu

803
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,760
major dream powers are getting out of control they're bleeding into the waking world we're

804
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,800
seeing the future no that's the thing like it's always i always get the sense of deja vu only

805
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,880
after it starts happening i'm like well what good is that if i can't even tell if it's gonna

806
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,920
happen in the future because deja vu isn't real it's an illusion it's uh just a minor trick on

807
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:57,760
itself you know i mean i did talk i may have talked a while ago about a similar thing where

808
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:04,320
um i had films uh like a record player playing a led zeppelin song and i got muted i don't know

809
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:09,680
why i would have talked about that though maybe because like it sounds very similar to the point

810
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:16,400
of all like what nate was saying as well is also very similar to it's your brain it's tricking

811
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:23,520
itself i hate my brain it does shit don't we all uh time to time to take that that brain out behind

812
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:30,240
the the the bike shifts and kill it speaking of killing it uh let's get to the voicemails what do

813
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:36,480
you say las wait wait wait i got a i got a funny i got a funny story so i believe it or not i'm

814
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:42,320
going to be on uh i don't believe it i'm gonna be on the next or it'll be the it'll be tomorrow

815
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:46,560

yeah so he they they those two invited me to do uh what will you be reviewing uh uh well they asked

819
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:12,880
me if there were any underrated or unknown movies and and i was very excited i immediately was like

820
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:18,320
turbo kid have you guys seen turbo kid i heard i know what i heard about turbo kid is fucking

821
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:26,080
awesome okay turbo kid is sick as fuck so i'm wicked stoked to expose turbo kid uh to an audience

822
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:32,400
it's really good uh so i guess me and mumke and florian aka game squad i guess he'll be streaming

823
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,880
it i'll be streaming it on my twitch as well and i think it'll probably be like one or two p.m

824
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:43,680
on saturday so i don't know twitch.tv slash st comics whoo um and also everyone should watch

825
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:49,280
turbo kid it's really fucking cool movie it's like a see it's like a low it's like a low budget um

826
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,200
like canadian it's sort of like a mad max kind of thing but like the protagonist is like a

827
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:01,680
kid who finds like a magic glove that makes him into a superhero is it quite graphic it is like

828
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:06,320
comedically graphic like there are like jesus is going to like this there are like blood and

829
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:12,000
guts but it's like it's kind of silly i think i remember uh red letter media giving it a favorable

830
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,720
review back in the day if i wait really did red letter media review turbo kid i believe it might

831
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:21,200
have been like a wrap up or i know they talked about the sequel not the sequel but like the next

832
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:27,120
movie that those guys did in like their 2018 wrap up i'm gonna google it which was i think the summer

833
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:32,800
of 84 was the next one they did i can't remember okay yeah here we go we're half in the bag episode

834
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:39,360
95 the visit and turbo kid i must have watched this uh in 2015 holy shit i'm fucking old

835
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:45,520
muck yeah dude a year in the past that i remember it this is four years ago and i've been watching

836
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:51,040
the whole time you know that's like t-bap era that we're getting to this point where like i'm

837
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,440
starting to be like oh yeah that analysis video i just watched was really good let's check when it

838
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:03,120
came out 2011 dude yeah yeah yeah no i feel the same way like i i still think of like um i still

839
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:07,760
feel like all the controversy about like the ghostbusters remake as like recent controversy it

840
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:14,800
was like three fucking years ago yeah that's yeah that's an ancient yeah so i know as we get older

841
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:20,000
time begins to accelerate our perception of time gets faster and we're gonna be 40 tomorrow

842
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,920
it's very distressing it's the worst we most of us are like rounding the corner 30 if not 30

843
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,280
already i'll be 30 in uh you know seven eight months or so that's the end of my life it's a

844
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:36,080
fate worse than death let me tell you i i believe you i believe you you're you're officially entering

845
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,200
the not cool period because like if you do something before you're 18 you're a prodigy if you do

846
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:45,840
something like in your 20s you're pretty cool anything from 30 to 60 it's like well of course

847
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,840
you're an adult it's just you're normal you're just you're at the age where you should be doing

848
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,960
things but then it swings back around if you're still like doing cool shit at 60 plus then you're

849
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:58,320
a badass old person so prepare for three decades of like nothing you do is anything other than

850
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:03,200
expectation and three decades of everyone just rolling your eyes at your bullshit and then of

851
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:07,840
course take the fact that you're a white cis male and then add that and it's just like so it's just

852
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,680
like it's a real you'll be lucky if you don't get the fucking guillotine the next 30 years

853
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:18,400
yeah by the by the time i'm an old white man old white men will be illegal and i'll be killed

854
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:23,120
immediately you know i was just saying the other day gib that you reminded me of a man who's

855
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:32,000
simultaneously 15 and 75 or something like that uh in the best way yikes wait wait i remind you of

856
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:40,160
that you you young at heart old of old of skeleton body riddle of bone and weak of mind

857
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:51,360
is the boomer mantra is that a fucking t-shirt i hear is that a fucking t-shirt i smell that's

858
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,560
good oh how about like a like a yes i'm a boomer and then it's like and then on the back it just

859
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:04,960
says big bold words brittle of bone weak or ask you about how i'm a boomer maybe with like the

860
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,440
word like censored because it's a bad or like like that sonic meme where it's like the letters

861
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,480
vertically and it's supposed to spell out an acronym it's like yes i'm a boomer brittle of

862
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:22,720
bone weak of mind all the other letters are empty something one of these will work yeah get back

863
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:27,920
to us artistic designer people with but wait wait what do you actually mean though i don't know you

864
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:33,040
just simultaneously you have the air of someone who's both 13 and 75 at the same time you just

865
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:37,040
restate it but what does that mean it's because you're explain yourself i don't know because you

866
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:44,080
have like a a slow gentlemanly disposition about you like an old man but also i don't know you are

867
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:51,120
a small because i like minecraft and i'm stupid uh yeah you're a 15 year old that talks to the

868
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,640
british accent so you must be refined that's definitely that's definitely an advantage in my

869
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:05,760
in my favor uh i i do i do enjoy being stupid and young at heart that is my favorite thing to be

870
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:11,200
so i'm glad that that comes across but also being smart being smart and being smart is really good

871
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:18,880
you talk like a man of a wizened uh disposition i guess i hope when i am 75 i still seem like

872
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:25,840
that that's my goal you'll be full uh hey fellow kids check out my skateboard no i'll i'll i'll be

873
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:34,160
playing the the hot new game minecraft patch minecraft 2 will finally be 50 years from now

874
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:39,040
what if everything was a sphere in minecraft 2 instead mine's mine's fear we finally have the

875
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,440
technology to make rounded corners yeah instead of crafting you sphere things

876
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,960
all right let's let's get to these voicemails over here it's we can't delay the inevitable

877
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,160
any longer um all right link down below people speak pipe you know what to do leave us quality

878
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:01,920
voicemails uh we'll we'll be kicked to the curb if it's some bullshit uh but we've got our first

879
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:08,240
boy up here uh it's just statistics uh let's let's hear what manner of statistics he has for us

880
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,880
okay go so nate definitely has something going on when he talks about the idea of one night is

881
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,360
and that being a big problem because let's say you have a question on someone and you wait

882
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:22,560
like a month to ask them out or whatever that's a month so you could have asked out a hundred other

883
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:29,840
girls right so what i did as a social experiment as a meme that's what i say but you know obviously it's

884
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:35,520
is i well when one week i asked out every single girl i had an interest in i socialized for like

885
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:42,480
one minute and then asked no are you single kind of thing and i got 20 rejections and four yeses

886
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:48,800
in one week and statistically there you go eventually they'll say yes you know if you're

887
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:55,200
on like a stupid like whiny bitch like oh please be my girlfriend i'm so sad that's not gonna work

888
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:01,280
if you just act like a human being and you're just being cool then eventually people will see it

889
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:06,960
people will think you're funny you know i i didn't take rejections like a big deal i was like hey

890
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:12,400
where's the shot and i like made flirty jokes because that's what funny people do and that's

891
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:17,600
all you have to do all yeah to get a girlfriend is this make yourself available and like tell

892
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:23,680
everyone i don't i don't know fuck maybe this isn't a good advice i don't know see there you

893
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:29,360
pretty good advice probably and i wait so this guy got four yeses does this guy have four girlfriends

894
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:34,080
now he's spinning plates like a good man should he sure indeed he should be these are not i don't

895
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:38,160
think they're full-fledged girlfriends i think he got four like sure i'd like to hang out yeah

896
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:43,040
something like that yeah yeah wait well that's not fucking worth anything just because they

897
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:48,240
say yes they're single i don't think he's saying that like i did it i bagged a girlfriend from nothing

898
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:52,400
i think he's saying that like he's crossed the threshold of being too afraid to even make that

899
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:57,920
step and now it's not a big deal anymore so i can go out and do it exactly exactly this way

900
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,240
it's making progress okay i'm just a little confused that like the goal of this exercise

901
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,800
was not to like ask someone to be your girlfriend or even to ask for a date but just to ask no are

902
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,920
you single no no no what he said was that he asked he was talking to a bunch of girls he asked 20

903
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:17,520
girls or whatever and most of them were taken but four of them said they were single and so he

904
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,680
proceeded to ask them out and they all rejected him that's what he's saying what he's saying oh

905
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:27,440
with this method no no he said he got 20 rejections and four yeses i thought the rejections

906
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,120
were four being single should we play it again real quick just to clarify can we play can we hear

907
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:35,280
that part again as i rewind this we're we're gonna skip okay just i have to play the beginning part

908
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,880
but just give it a second we'll get to the thing you can cut this out ellie is our the beginning

909
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:47,840
part if you want and i got 20 rejections and four yeses in one week and statistics okay that

910
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:54,560
he asked them out got 20 rejections but four yeses four people he asked out said if he would

911
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:02,240
have continued i think he wouldn't like what he said was like um and they can turn into girlfriends

912
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:08,720
or they can turn into like maybe he hasn't he's not going out yeah yeah you don't you don't start

913
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:14,480
with a girlfriend instantly you go out a few times okay but he got four he asked them out and he got

914
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:20,640
four yeses correct correct that's like four date equivalents four dates yeah something like that

915
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:25,360
yeah and then he and then all on the same day and he says hey girls and they were all like what the

916
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:30,640
fuck and and then you're part of a social experiment he had to he had to do a fucking uh mrs

917
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:35,680
doubtfire routine of running back and forth between each one okay but i think the takeaway here is

918
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:41,040
clearly boys uh man up and just don't just give it a shot man no one's gonna you know it's fine

919
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:47,040
it's cool just i'm wondering where like he sounds like he's in school still yeah yeah young and plenty

920
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:52,640
of access to 20 girls that yeah yeah under what sort of being strange when would there be like 20

921
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:58,720
girls around that is like hmm these are 20 out of all the girls i know i i can narrow it down to

922
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:03,840
these 20 that i might have some interest i would guess it's almost him it's in school but like better

923
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,000
to break the ice on a girl you don't want to go out with because when you get rejected you don't

924
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,400
feel bad about it it's like all right i just did it it's real it happened i i didn't die from the

925
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:17,280
question in the biz game started bitches yeah but why would you ask out a girl you don't want to go

926
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:22,800
out with because what is the idea is that if you're afraid don't if you're awkward around talking to

927
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,760
people like this is a way of like pushing you out of your comfort zone on and growing as a person

928
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:33,520
on the one hand i get that but like if she does say yes then you would just stand out with a

929
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:38,800
fucking shad look there's nothing wrong with going out with a girl and then saying to her later

930
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,440
like yeah you know we went out a couple times but you know i think that's okay but if you know

931
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:48,080
that you're not interested okay why would you even if you even if you get a yes doesn't that

932
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:52,480
it's not improve your confidence like if you're if you're someone who's in like in your shell like

933
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,360
in your bubble you you feel like you have no value whatsoever and that's why you're afraid to talk to

934
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:02,240
women and you talk to a girl and even if you're not interested she does want to go out with you

935
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:06,720
does that not like to someone in this position like wow maybe i'm not a complete fucking lost case

936
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:16,720
it does make it does it's not about the fucking girls like no one's right this is about training

937
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:22,240
your brain like test dummies or anything i'm just saying what isn't it weird it's weird to ask out a

938
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:26,480
girl that you're not interested in well it's the same way that people sometimes they apply for jobs

939
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:32,080
they don't want because it improves their like ability to uh do interviews and stuff and like

940
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:39,840
they become more confident as a person okay it's the same idea is it you get something out of a job

941
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,200
even if you don't like it you still get paid no like people will get accepted for jobs and

942
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,080
then not take them because they don't want to take them they're they're doing the interviews to get

943
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:52,800
better at yeah and and in that situation you're not hurting anyone's feelings yeah okay so you go

944
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,400
out and then you just say it doesn't work out what this is like the issue here what's the this is

945
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,800
like such a one in a million shot anyway because if you're like still trying to like struggle through

946
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,840
even making the sentence because you're socially awkward the chances of someone like yeah i like

947
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:10,720
autists let's do it like it's not it's small i mean even if it does happen that'll a give you a

948
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:15,200
confidence boost and b you can go out on one thing i have a weird coffee date and end it

949
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,880
awkwardly after that or maybe something good will happen who knows the point is that you're trying

950
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,920
to grow as a person and get better social skills and become more confident yourself how okay this

951
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:30,560
is a net positive it's a net positive for you i'm just i'm just like maybe i have too much confidence

952
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,800
in myself that i think it's not in one in a million like there's no chance that this could go wrong

953
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,360
like i think that there's there's a chance that if i talk to a go that i'm not interested in

954
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,160
into it for reasons of practice and she says yes interested in what do you mean by that what does

955
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:49,520
that mean well i don't want to go on a date with her okay don't do that that's dumb why would you

956
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,840
do that that doesn't make any sense well that's what i'm saying that's what i mean yeah there are many

957
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,640
many girls who okay well i guess i would just if that's what you're saying tom i disagree if you

958
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:03,760
like you you shouldn't ask someone out knowing you won't want to like some like someone you are

959
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:09,840
like have no interest in i don't know if you have nobody around you and you're just trying to develop

960
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,560
the social skill i think it's worth doing no well just just go out just like literally go walk outside

961
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,520
like to the supermarket there'll be a girl there just like sure but this is a this is a fucking small

962
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:24,160
case that probably won't all right if you're in that situation let me let me it's better to do it than

963
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:29,440
to not do it if you're fucking that socially autistic i suppose i'm saying that if you do

964
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:33,280
that if you if there's a girl that you have no interest in you do not want to go on a date but

965
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,280
you're lacking in self-confidence and you're like i'll ask her out and see if she says yes and you

966
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:42,640
ask her and she says yes i don't know if that isn't a positive because then you just i mean it's bad

967
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:46,160
for her because you're maybe she likes you and you're gonna stand her up you're gonna have to

968
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:52,640
reject her but like leaving that aside then you are just you just have this like weird social

969
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:57,440
obligation now that you have to meet you don't you won't enjoy it you don't want to do it and

970
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,960
are you is it really going to boost your confidence to know that you got a date with a girl that you

971
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:07,680
didn't even like it's about it's about getting i i guess like it's not a good thing to happen

972
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:12,720
but it's like it's a small bump in the road to getting to a better place mentally in my opinion

973
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:17,840
feel free to disagree i think i mean i understand you going to a place lying though tom isn't that

974
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:22,400
like telling a lie kind of asking a girl out who you don't yeah i guess it kind of is yeah

975
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:29,520
i guess it kind of is the thing the thing in my mind is just like if like she's the only girl in

976
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:34,720
the entire country sure but like that's my whole point is that like like this is like such a fringe

977
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:39,760
case that will probably never happen so i don't know why it's not hard to like find an attractive

978
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,560
woman i mean it's almost like it's a hypothetical thing it's like where are you gonna go where

979
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:49,440
there's like there's just nobody that you have any like interest in even like on a surface level

980
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:53,280
like it's that's my life okay well that's me your standards are pretty high then

981
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:58,880
that's my daily circumstances well i guess i stay in your house where there's just dudes okay okay

982
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:03,440
yeah that's right in case aside practically speaking like women exist around you you can

983
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:08,960
you can find one around that you have at least some desire to spend some amount of time with

984
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:14,560
and i would recommend trying on those correct correct just get out there and do something

985
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:21,040
please god yes that's the real takeaway okay next voicemail here we go this is from quality voicemail

986
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:26,240
oh right this person i put a note that they're the voice of the people uh this person is here to speak

987
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:32,400
on the subject of getting into voicemails uh okay i forget exactly do we need another one of these

988
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:38,960
well i remember this being decent so let me uh i don't know if i'm wrong let's judge me physically

989
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:43,440
all right let's let's here go so i create quality voicemails for you

994
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,440

1000
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:46,240
sharing it on our voicemails we have some obligation to play your terrible sounding voicemail with your

shit audio quality shit personality and shit life uh nah nah you can you can go you can go take a jog

1002
01:34:53,600 --> 01:35:00,880

1003
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:05,520
well i mean this is the exact have any of his life stories i feel like you've done a number of

1004
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,880
these things to to to bring something shit on so you could shit on it you set the precedent that

1005
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:16,880
shit is a okay as long as you want to do it ironically i mean are they are they do the people

1006
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:22,640
want to be on to be told how terrible their lives are i feel like some of them might get

1007
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:27,680
some of the attention is good attention if you can't have fame you might as well have infamy

1008
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:33,120
fair enough how many how many more voicemails do we have i think like four uh all right let's get

1009
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:38,560
to the machine gun let's go go go go go here we go this is uh harlock aznebel uh he's called

1011
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:53,680
yeah and you want to know how i did it uh how i did it i took nate's advice i went to anime club

1012
01:35:53,680 --> 01:36:00,640
no joe yeah i'm a great girl she can fucking speak fluent japanese oh yeah so she's essentially

1013
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:07,600
perfect and then like we started hanging out and obviously i'm a shy little pussy bitch so i didn't

1014
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:14,560
say anything but she essentially seduced me that's and it was just great it was great and you know

1015
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:19,840
what else is great is she's bisexual so we both appreciate how awesome women are it's fun i like

1016
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:26,800
cool it's so cool so cool i'm not i'm not a virgin anymore munchie so i can leave voicemails now

1017
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,120
man you get lady anime club let me tell you there's some desperate hoes in there let me tell you

1018
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:41,600
harlock harlock i just want you to reckon with the fact that you will go to your grave carrying

1019
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:48,560
the shame of knowing that you lost your virginity during no nut november shake my fucking head

1020
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:56,080
i just it's wrong it's tainted i i have difficulty wrapping my mind around the point of no nut

1021
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:02,800
november if not to like pursue like okay i know i said this last time but like to me it seems like

1022
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:08,960
the point of not fapping is to like encourage you to socialize no i think a lot of people do it

1023
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:13,760
just spread the bragging rights of like self control i suppose it's to be it's to be morally pure

1024
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:20,080
and to defend western civilization against degeneracy that's what it's about yeah okay sure

1025
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:25,920
but wouldn't one component of the jews want us to fap tom but they want us to fap so that so that

1026
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,960
black men can steal our white women and miscegenate the white race out of existence damn it i hate

1027
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:36,400
you don't fucking believe me you've been fucking co-opted by the pedophile billionaires okay the

1028
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:43,040
satanic cult all right bernie got you what about bernie though wouldn't having sex with someone to

1029
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:47,520
you know be like child light or to you know be in the sphere sure obviously you're probably not

1030
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:52,640
gonna have a kid but you're you're like closer to you know doing that than fapping know what i'm

1031
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,480
saying i don't know no what i wasn't listening oh whatever who cares all right next voicemail here

1032
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:01,600
we go please okay we're just checking in on uh this guy saying uh why no radcon for all right

1033
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:08,480
let's let's let's hear his question okay i'm trying to be quick for just for nate so okay why isn't

1034
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:15,040
there already a kickstarter for radcon for i mean it's been fucking millenials since the last one so

1035
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:21,040
why give me reasons i need fucking reasons yeah quick update on that you you can blame me it's my

1036
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:26,000
fault oh i mean is it yeah because i because i've been crippled and i wouldn't be able to go to it

1037
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,440
so we weren't we're not sure when it was going to be able to be held i'm sure we would have fucked it

1038
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:35,200
up and not done it anyway well the tom involvement was was one factor that wasn't everything or anything

1039
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:39,520
but um beyond that you know we got it was the tom there was the tom factor there was the munchie

1040
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:44,160
factor yeah the munchie and then there was the the location factor and also nate's moving potentially

1041
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:50,000
to virginia i mean there's no hard plans so we could like that could be totally worked around in

1042
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,960
many ways that we don't mean that doesn't matter that much but i mean we don't have a location

1043
01:38:54,960 --> 01:39:02,880
picture anything for it um we just we just haven't put uh any like real mental energy into picking

1044
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,360
making any of the tough decisions that need to go into the thing like i mean i the the the current

1045
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:11,280
status is there's there's a slight update which is just like at this point i i don't know if we

1046
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:16,000
talk about this recently or not but like all the main obstacles of like we know people's availability

1047
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,120
now we know the windows they might be somewhat limited and maybe take a little bit to get to it

1048
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:25,760
but we know that we just need to like sit down and and hash out what we want to do where we're

1049
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,840
going to do it you know how much money is going to be involved and if we kickstarter or any of that

1050
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:37,440
stuff um and um also um there's there's a potential for kickstarter fatigue because digi said he was

1051
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:44,640
going to do like a kickstarter for his uh light novel printing yes yes uh and you know oh he didn't

1052
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:49,120
do that yet did he said he's gonna do that yeah i don't think he has we should beat him to the punch

1053
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:54,960
maybe maybe they're not they don't have to do with us and not the other way around there's i mean

1054
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:59,600
when it comes to kickstarter fatigue also part of the conversation of the of the can tent uh business

1055
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:05,680
was there there is discussion of a can tent kickstarter to fund my move to virginia now there's

1056
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:11,440
no we should just roll them into one and then have radcon forever you know we talked about why

1057
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:17,600
that wasn't that maybe we talked to i think a while ago or not a while ago but like about

1058
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:25,840
the idea of consolidating can tent kickstarter and um radcon for kickstarter but i think it was

1059
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:30,080
unfavorably looked upon in general was it just like it was because i don't know how much it'll

1060
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:36,080
fucking cost to move you well i mean the main expense over that yeah sorry sorry but like it's

1061
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,560
just the main expense of that would like for me like i i've just been looking over like the numbers

1062
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:45,760
and i think it's gonna cost me like roughly four thousand dollars what the fuck i don't even think

1063
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:51,680
i own four thousand dollars worth of stuff i have to pay off my current lease well i mean like that's

1064
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,000
how much money would be involved i have to pay off my current lease i have to then get a new lease

1065
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,920
with the money down on that so like that's already like i thought you meant you just had four thousand

1066
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:05,440
dollars in moving expenses i'm like how in god's name i'm trying to consolidate like all the fact

1067
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,080
one number for that and then also like movements maybe buying new furniture or something like

1068
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:13,600
four thousand to five thousand dollars is my estimate for that so like we've been talking

1069
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,680
about like if we did like a kickstarter for content or mixed in with the pcb or whatever

1070
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:22,640
like like a four thousand to five thousand dollar chunk i mean i would sure like to be

1071
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:27,680
fundnates moving expenses and it's like how much sense does it make to put like that much

1072
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:33,120
in a large pcb is it fair to put your moving expense on the people in the first place

1073
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:38,480
well i mean that all depends if we can convince them that it's worth their money to make live

1074
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:44,240
content i suppose then you know that's the pitch yeah that the idea was content would get its own

1075
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:50,160
fan base and people would want nate to be able to move to digis quicker and so they would pledge

1076
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:56,320
to that and once that's like locked and loaded then a radcon will be much easier to fund because

1077
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:02,160
nate will already be wherever digis and if we do it there that seems more like a go fund me thing

1078
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:07,840
than a than a kickstarter thing well okay we're just haven't discussed the old the other big factor

1079
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:14,160
here which is how we will come up with like many specific productions that will be an integral part

1080
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:19,760
like if you give us this money you will get these can tent productions i mean we just you and i mean

1081
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,160
you know we haven't come up with that plan as you can see voicemailer there's a lot involved

1082
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:28,720
in just like the logistics there's a lot that we haven't come to any agreement on like we might

1083
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:33,760
want to it might make more sense to do it in boston as well but like you know who knows i think so

1084
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,280
because three of us are here and only one or maybe two of us are going to be in virginia the x

1085
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:44,240
factor on that whole thing is just like do we want to like could we theoretically cram ourselves

1086
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:49,360
into digis place and like minimize costs by doing so would that mitigate the fly i mean i don't i

1087
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:53,280
don't know i don't yeah i mean yeah obviously we should do wherever we can do it for the cheapest

1088
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:57,760
we should do that's totally what i think that's all i care about like the the thing i was thinking

1089
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:04,320
is um if nate is in virginia we might not you know i don't know how you would feel about people

1090
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:10,320
sharing your house accommodation ways but like digis definitely fine with people staying over so if

1091
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:16,560
we have you know that's like a few people at digis house maybe a few people at nate's house i mean

1092
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:21,680
most of the expense of radcon three was renting the house right yeah the house itself was a large

1093
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:27,760
part of like the production too though and uh i mean like how much i mean i've been to digis

1094
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,840
house a bunch of times well like literally once in a while do you think it's big enough to host a

1095
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:39,680
radcon four like theoretically yes but like to is it bigger than the place in brain tree was yes uh i

1096
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:45,520
think so comparable sized maybe no it's smaller but there's a good amount of space there it's it's

1097
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:50,640
comparably so it's smaller comparably size really because did you was saying it was bigger

1098
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:55,440
well i don't know it's fine it doesn't matter it's just pretty big i don't know this is all

1099
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:00,080
insider baseball that doesn't matter the viewers next voicemail go go go right okay well no that

1100
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:05,520
they probably would love to be hearing all this radcon ideas oh shoot that was the best way to

1101
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:11,120
get another get a radcon quicker is to give us more money that's not even alive yeah basically true

1102
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:17,200
basically sure i mean in general uh all right we'll go to the next one uh what do we got here

1103
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:24,640
this is from uh tio tio why tio oh i know tio tio yeah okay there you go i already i don't know how to

1104
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:32,480
say it it's like it's like tio's the gif of my patrons it's just not happening okay and go so

1105
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:38,240
listen to the last episode uh and uh nate starts talking about content you know the thing between

1106
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:45,920
him and jit didgy and then he starts saying that uh he's designed to uh bring in as many as the pcp

1107
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:53,760
members as you know they want at that at that rate why not just use the pcp channel it has a

1108
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:59,120
oh right audience already there that's it all right that's enough of that i put that on because i

1109
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:04,640
i don't know this i've heard some discussion of why is it just on the pcp there's i just for all

1110
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:10,000
time here's the answer to that question it's because doing things on the pcp can sometimes

1111
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
be a nightmare when you need to get everybody's permission and like you're putting videos

1112
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:19,520
financial stuff it's all mixed up so fuck it we just split off new channel we're in charge of it

1113
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:23,600
we'll do all the money managing ourselves no need to worry about what anybody else thinks

1114
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:29,760
there's that's it there's your answer whatever uh good done out the kate next voicemail

1117
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:47,040
