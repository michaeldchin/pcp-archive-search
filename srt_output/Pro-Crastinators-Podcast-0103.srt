00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:21,080
guy ever and let's see who else is here. We got Ben Saint. Minimum wage. Illegal band.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,720
We've got Tom Oliver. I was really upset at the death of Steve Jobs. It ruined Apple

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
and it's cost him thousands of dollars in revenue from me personally because I will

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,240
not buy their products anymore because they're so fucking bad. Well, how unfortunate. We've

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:46,560
got Munchy. Hi guys, it's me, Prisoner308. Welcome back to day 238 of my let's play of

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,880
Breaking Out of Jail. The Warner hasn't found me yet but he just might. Stay tuned. I really

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,200
wish you'd said Prisoner358 because that's Casey Neistat's new company 358 and you would

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,760
have been the one political prisoner of Casey Neistat. But anyway, the one political prisoner.

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,240
Have you fucking seen that guy? Maybe I'm just the first prisoner. Okay, fair enough.

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,360
And welcome to Thew. Hey buddy. In the land of Ooze, there was a man whose name was Job.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,520
This man was blameless and upright. He feared God and shunned evil. Nice. Thew, I just need

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,880
to let it sink in. How many, like, fangirls just squeed and glomped themselves because

14
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,600
Thew is on this episode. It needs to sink in for you. I'm very happy. I'm very happy

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,680
to have the legendary cryptid Thew break weir's head once more. Let's just know cousin of

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,200
Slimmer Man, Thew underscore thes here for another round of the Procrastiners podcast.

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,680
Yeah. Welcome. Welcome. Nate, you're the person. You're the guy who started it. What are we

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,160
doing? What are we doing? Why are we here? Listen up, everybody. Here's what we're doing.

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,680
We're talking about jobs. We're talking about jobs. What is a job? Where is a job? Please

20
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,680
give me a job. I deserve a job for free. I don't have to work. I deserve a job. Just

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,680
give it to me. Let's get into it. All right. So here we go, everybody. A definition of

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,720
a job according to Urban Dictionary. Here's what we got. Job means by which at least 30%

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,200
of your life is stolen from you. Here we go. To enrich the owners of a company making useless

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:34,000
shit that some other poor idiot in a job will buy. Wow. Are we going to have to fight Nate?

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,280
Tom over here. That sounds right. I'm with Tom. We need to seize the means of production,

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,600
you motherfuckers. I think I wrote that definition myself. Edited by Ben St. It says. There you

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,880
go. Ben has had an allergy to jobs. Why would you edit my perfect entry, Ben? God damn it.

28
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,800
Now that we're past the re-perselection podcast, let me just lay down the law here and say

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:06,960
that I am post-job. I am post-job. My generation is post-job. We do not need jobs anymore. We

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,480
are past the point of jobs and now we can just do things on the internet and that can be where we

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,000
make money. Well, I mean, yeah, we're in the crowdsourcing crowdfunding era. At least we're

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,720
starting out. We can't all do that. And I'm saying my generation is post-job. Well, okay. The reality

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,680
of the situation is most people get jobs. What? In America, at least. In America. What are you

34
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,080
saying? I am one of them. I have a job. I have a job that subsidizes, at the moment,

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,200
like my internet activities because I, you know, work at it and devote my time to it and stuff.

36
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,600
But listen to the second definition of job, by the way, because this is also incredible,

37
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,720
just in a different way. Job, something that's impossible to find because everyone only wants

38
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,680
to hire experienced people even though you can't get experience if no one will hire you and they're

39
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,600
too damn lazy, you're too damn selfish to train you. And then there's a quote,

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,040
finding a job is such a pain. I'm imagining like a guy, I'm imagining a guy in like a

41
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,920
rumpled up, you know, business shirt and like his tie is all pulled loose and stuff and he's like

42
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,440
hungover. He's all scruffy and five o'clock shadow and he's just been out pounding the pavement.

43
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,000
He's been out pounding the pavement trying to, you know, trying to work to get his life on.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,720
Yeah, it's not at all that this person was actually sitting at their computer refreshing

45
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,280
Craigslist for one hour a day and deciding that was enough work. Thank you very much.

46
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,760
And then going back to play Hexbox, damn that Hexbox for the rest of the day.

47
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,520
There are definitely people like that, but the job market is pretty retarded, especially in

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,080
Craigslist. Well, don't get me wrong, it took me like three years to find a job that I now have

49
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,160
and it's a great job. It's a very good job. Well, it's funny, you said that and I was immediately

50
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,880
reminded of a tweet I saw on like the, you know, how like Twitter has like recommended things.

51
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,720
They had like the UX Twitter for some reason, it like knows that I went to school for design

52
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,800
and like always recommends me all these things. And one of them was a terrifying a job posting

53
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,680
for a programmer and it's like required 10 years of experience in Swift, which is like

54
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,640
Apple's programming language. And I just like posted a screenshot of that. And he's just like,

55
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Swift has only been around for three years. Oh my God. It's just like LeMau. Oh no. So yeah,

56
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,400
it's pretty dumb. It's pretty stupid. Well, there's a lot to say about jobs. I mean, these are

57
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,840
actually really good jumping off points, these two definitions, because they're really, they really

58
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,680
showcase what the current generation thinks of jobs. And you know what? Well, wait, the last

59
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,960
generation, we are in the Gen X is represented right here. The last generation, we are not going to be,

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,560
you know, degraded with your disgusting millennial tendencies. We are, we are post job. We are,

61
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,320
I don't have a bite in this. Millennials, millennials failed to get jobs. And then Gen X is post

62
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,040
jobs. They get off scot free. They win. They want to take credit for, but really they had no choice

63
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,800
because jobs just don't exist anymore. Clearly. Yeah. That's, that's, they're for baby boomers only.

64
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Hate the tale. The game has changed in a lot of ways. It really has. Because like in the old days,

65
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,840
you know, everybody says it, but like in the fifties, you know, you'd go to fucking elementary

66
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,920
school, you go to middle school, you'd maybe finish high school, and then you could get a job at a

67
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,920
factory like one guy and provide for you, your wife and your nine hot children. You could do that

68
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,520
back in those days. You could pay, you could pay your way through college where flipping burgers

69
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,560
over the summer. It's true. That's true. That is generally true. I do think that what has happened

70
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,760
is it's, it's fucking machine learning. Basically, as long as there's anyone who knows how to do

71
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,280
something, it'll only take some developer about a couple of months to create a program that can do

72
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,040
it as well. We're seeing this happen with like analysis videos on YouTube. I'm pretty sure over

73
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,840
the summer, someone's going to make an algorithm that can produce a nerd writer video. There's

74
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,560
already top 10s, dude. Nerd writer's not that far above a top 10. The last thing you want to see

75
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,480
is someone standing in your lettuce at Burger King. This person posted themselves on Burger King

76
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,040
standing on lettuce and posted it on 4jack. Yeah, so like this thing is basically the only way to be

77
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,200
a... There's so many cryptids. The only fucking way... Why did we do cryptids for the topics?

78
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,640
Next time, next episode. Sorry, dude. Sorry. No, no. The only way to fucking make money and have a job

79
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,760
is to outthink all humans and all robots in the world, right? And that's what basically all of us

80
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,360
do. We all talk about things, but it's certain things. I mean, that's created with the people that

81
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,520
had to figure it out slightly. The scale floor is so high for this game. Yeah. No, it's the only

82
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,000
fucking way. It's the only fucking way. The only thing you can do is to be ahead of trends,

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,040
and that's the only way to make money now. I mean, just the way that it is, like, and this is the way

84
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,960
that's technically always been. It's just that technology is advancing so fast now. Like the

85
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,120
only thing that anyone will pay someone to do is that they can't do on their own, or they can't,

86
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,000
like, hire a machine to do at a much lower cost than it would take to hire a human. So, for example,

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,040
you got, like, a janitor. Like, yes, you could get a robot to be a janitor in theory, but that would

88
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,800
probably be really expensive, so it's cheaper to just, like, hire a guy to push a group around.

89
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,480
The fact that we have every job listing for entry-level jobs requires 25,000 years of experience,

90
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,160
I think it's probably because of, you know, the legal system and employee protection system is

91
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,160
kind of being outdated at this point. Like, we don't have the frameworks, both legal and colloquial,

92
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,520
or unofficial, that we have as expectations for what an employee-employer relationship should be

93
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,080
is kind of dated at this point. At this point, having a job is just sort of filling in the

94
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,400
cracks that robots can't quite fulfill yet, you know what I mean? Like, and yeah, like, all the

95
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,800
friends I know who have, like, regular-ass jobs at, like, stores, they're always worked part-time,

96
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,320
but given as many hours as you can possibly make someone do without it being full-time.

97
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,600
Yeah. Right?

98
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,960
That's like 39 hours a week or whatever.

99
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
The worst.

100
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,880
Should be illegal.

101
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,160
It's like...

102
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,320
Yeah, I mean, it's just in the nature that, like, as long as it's not technically illegal,

103
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,600
these giant organizations are gonna do whatever they can to maximize profit and minimize expense.

104
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,160
So, you know?

105
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,400
But yeah, employee protection, like, I'm not trying to sound all fucking randy in here,

106
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,120
but it does make humans more expensive to take care of because robots, you can kick them around,

107
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,000
and abuse them all day long, and be a cheese gate with them, and I think that that is part of why,

108
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,760
uh, yeah, entry-level jobs require five years of experience now.

109
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,680
You know what? Guys, the PCP podcast is probably repetitive enough to us to get

110
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,600
AI versions of ourselves, and the people won't know the difference,

111
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,160
so we can just rake in the cash by putting our AIs up to battle week after week.

112
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,760
I have no doubt. There is a formula. There's an algorithm we could assemble.

113
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,640
You know, you start off the podcast, you got, like, uh, you know,

114
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,080
like, you get a percentage chance of, like, 90% I do an intro,

115
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,440
then there's, like, a 10% chance it's one of the other random people who'll do it.

116
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,360
Then after that, you've got, like, Urban Dictionary.

117
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,840
Like, literally just have a bot read the definition from UrbanDictionary.com,

118
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,080
and then you just move on, you just, you go to Wikipedia, you look up the entries there,

119
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,520
and you just make a random, you select random words from that page,

120
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,720
and you insert them into a thing. You have it cut from person to person every,

121
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,880
like, 20 seconds or something, maybe less than that.

122
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,880
And then at one point, you have a giant section of weird utilitarianism just stuck in there.

123
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,800
You just insert that awkwardly and arbitrarily, and then you just go to the questions.

124
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,360
Uh, it's, it's, it's baby shit.

125
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,560
We gotta get, we gotta get people on this. We, we gotta, we gotta calm up.

126
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,200
We gotta calm up. We need, we, this needs to be real.

127
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,600
Bonus episode, the, come on with the next bonus episode, the PCPAI episode.

128
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,200
Oh, that'd be a great idea. The next bonus is the bot episode.

129
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
Okay, we gotta get working on that.

130
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,880
Yeah.

131
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,360
Yeah, PBSA News channel made an algorithm up to themselves.

132
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,280
Please email me Steve Jobs.

133
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,760
Uh,

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,920
Nate, it seems like you're pretty, you're coming down hard on the jobs are good,

135
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,240
and everyone, and if you don't have a job, well, then my, like, time to perish.

136
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,360
Well, okay, listen, I, I'm just very hard on the personal responsibility front, you know?

137
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,000
And like, if you don't have a job, like, I, I get it.

138
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,280
There are all these challenges that you face in our, you know,

139
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,600
like my generation is at all these issues.

140
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,840
I was pretty lucky because right from the start, I was interested in technology

141
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,520
and like computer science stuff.

142
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,760
And now I'm a programmer, professional programmer now.

143
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,680
And like, it's, it's a great place to be.

144
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,120
That is, it's pretty much one of the best places to be to get a job.

145
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,080
And I'm really, really sorry to everybody out there who has an intrinsic interest

146
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,640
in to use the old cliche lesbian dance theory or like just what it doesn't matter,

147
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
you know, art history, whatever it is.

148
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm really sorry that no one wants to fucking hire your ass once you get a degree in that shit.

149
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,400
But it, it like, it's your life.

150
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,920
It's your life to run.

151
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,520
And the world doesn't give a shit if you get a job or not.

152
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,480
Only you can carve out your place in the world.

153
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,760
So it's your responsibility.

154
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Once you're fucking 18, 17, 20, whatever it is, figure your shit out.

155
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,960
Don't get into massive debt.

156
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,240
Don't be stupid.

157
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,360
Find a place where you can get a job or, I mean, or be an entrepreneur, you know,

158
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,760
go outside the system that's easier than ever now.

159
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,800
It's just, I, I don't, whenever I hear people complain about the job market, I think like,

160
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:14,200
I, what I hear is, it sure is unfair that people will not give me shit.

161
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,720
That's really upsetting to me.

162
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,000
That's really upsetting to me.

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,280
And I, again, I acknowledge all the challenges involved in this,

164
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,320
but no one owes you anything and normal that attitude help you to get the things you want.

165
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,160
I'm interested in helping people get what they want in life and be better people.

166
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,160
And that means, you know, not just sitting around and wishing you had a job, but like

167
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,960
literally going out and like, if you go to school for five years and you get your art degree or

168
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,160
whatever, and then you find yourself flipping burgers and like, because that's the only job

169
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,360
that's around, I get it.

170
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,320
That's going to kill you.

171
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
It's going to be crippling.

172
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,720
But here's what you do.

173
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,120
You don't cry about it on your fucking blog.

174
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,760
You go and you assess your situation and you determine a path to get what you do want in life.

175
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,520
You know, a better job, you know, whatever it is you want, you make a fucking strategy

176
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,520
and it's just completely useless to sit around and complain about it.

177
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,440
If you're like interested in politics, you could perhaps address what you consider to be

178
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,400
like issues.

179
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,920
Like I'm not a hundred percent on either side of like the minimum wage debate,

180
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,360
but there is real stuff there.

181
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,960
So I could understand someone like committing themselves to fighting on some side of that argument.

182
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,600
But again, don't let politics distract you from the shit you should be doing to run

183
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
your life better.

184
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,640
That's the most important thing.

185
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,720
We are all responsible for our own shit.

186
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,800
So when it comes to jobs, you know, like my mentality is projected onto like,

187
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,760
you know, if someone else has a job they could or could not offer you,

188
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,320
you have to make them want to give it to you by providing value.

189
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,600
That's, you know, that's the long term of it.

190
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,080
I gotta tell you, this is one of the only weird totalitarian rants that I would a hundred

191
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,280
percent agree with and I don't have any problem with.

192
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,560
Well, there you go.

193
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,200
Fantastic.

194
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,320
I think we might be venturing into the realm of non weird utilitarian.

195
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,720
I think this might be the realm of normal, normal discussion.

196
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, that seems like a pretty normal to me.

197
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,920
Well, okay, wait, my, my, my, my mother obviously would like me to go to college

198
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,760
and she is always like, you know, you're such a good artist.

199
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,840
You're drawn the computer and I can't even believe it to me.

200
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,120
I don't even get it.

201
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,800
How can you do that?

202
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,640
You should go to art college.

203
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,760
But I, this kid, this kid's able to go to yahoo.com.

204
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,280
I know an email account.

205
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,640
He's got computer skills.

206
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,520
How does he do it?

207
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,800
I just can't never know.

208
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,280
I can't even turn my computer on.

209
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,120
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

210
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,480
But, but if I, if I were to go to college,

211
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,160
I would go like hard in to like, like, like a STEM field, like like engineering,

212
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,760
like my go to is engineering and my mom's always like, well, well, why do you,

213
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,680
like you don't have an interest in engineering.

214
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,040
You don't like engineering.

215
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,360
Why, why wouldn't you go to something that you like?

216
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,960
Because what I'm not fucking stupid is why because I'm not,

217
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't want to get a degree that won't help me get a job.

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,360
If I'm going to invest in going to college,

219
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,720
then my investment should be returned as fast and as quickly as possible.

220
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,400
You know, I know we've said this a million times,

221
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,800
but like what is the point of college?

222
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,160
What is the point of college?

223
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,880
It is to eventually prepare you for a job.

224
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,440
It is not adult baby camp, you know, where you can just go around and fuck around.

225
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,640
It is that, but that's not, that's not ideal.

226
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,520
It's not, it's not helpful that it is that we should strive against that.

227
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,240
Yeah.

228
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,120
I recently found out, like I didn't realize that this was a thing about, about courses like,

229
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,880
like that are just like, you can just like buy a college course.

230
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,240
Buy a college course that like just is a course for like a semester.

231
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,000
Like you can just do that.

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,360
You can just buy an art like, like course.

233
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,880
If you're like, oh, you know, I really want to be taught anatomy by like a teacher.

234
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,600
So like, you can just buy a course for anatomy at an art school.

235
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,360
Oh, well, dude, you know, I'm sure that's true.

236
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,160
And I'm sure like some, some schools do this differently than I was.

237
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,200
I've literally, I've literally seen that I'm going to do that.

238
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
So I mean, that's cool and all.

239
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,080
And like, if you think it's worth your money and like it's something that you're really interested in,

240
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,120
then great, you know, it's just, it's just, you know, you shouldn't expect.

241
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:23,560
Like there's no reason you can't like go to like engineering school, make that sweet dash

242
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,040
and then just put in the fucking work when you're doing your sick ass engineering job

243
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,400
and also do art.

244
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
That's not, you are not prohibited from that.

245
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,920
You don't have an excuse.

246
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,960
If you come home from work every day fucking tiring, you're like,

247
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,600
you know what, I have this passion for doing, I really want to draw or do whatever,

248
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,760
then you should try, then you should do or whatever.

249
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,040
If you don't like, if you don't do the thing that you want to do,

250
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,240
then you got to wonder like how much, how much you care.

251
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,120
I don't, I don't want to suck my own dick too hard here.

252
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,960
But like that's exactly what I did.

253
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,000
You're the best about this.

254
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,400
Yeah.

255
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,000
I mean, that this is what I did.

256
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,840
I, you know, I took the long, you know, I didn't do a digit and I respect digit for what he did,

257
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,440
but I took a much safer route with my career path where I slowly but surely kept working on my college,

258
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,400
kept doing myself, worked my shitty part time jobs, but the entire time I would do exactly that.

259
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,240
Come home exhausted from like building furniture at peer one or, you know,

260
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,800
stand on my feet doing just a bunch of stupid bullshit that everybody does.

261
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
It was like a shitty job.

262
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,040
And then come home and it's like, okay, time to work for like five hours making a video now.

263
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,960
I'm going to do that now because that's what I want to do.

264
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,760
And like, if you don't do that, I question how committed you really are to this thing.

265
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,320
Yeah.

266
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,560
I, what I love about you, Nate, this is going to turn into Circle of the Jerk episode two.

267
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,680
Yes, go.

268
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,520
It is, is, is that you like, like, like your base stats are like fine, but your true talent,

269
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,320
your, your talent is that you just will go forever and never stop.

270
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,280
You just like, you will just never cease your, your, your tiring advance.

271
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,400
No matter how like, like it hurts your body or soul, you will just never give up.

272
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,200
That, that's your one, that's your one true, like, like special unique ability.

273
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
And you know, again, I don't want to suck my dick either here,

274
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,800
but it's really nice that like other people have started to kind of emulate that with that,

275
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,320
like a bunch of people have done like their own we Aguiz now, or not we Aguiz, but, but

276
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,680
their own me a math of us.

277
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,640
Like, like I just copied guys like Digi and other people who have done like a month of solid content,

278
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,080
but it's the branding man.

279
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,200
It's that Huey's law that makes people see like, wow, this guy really sells me on how cool it is

280
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
to work hard on stuff.

281
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,040
And then other people do it.

282
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,400
And it's like, and then every, everyone is glad they did it.

283
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,680
They feel better.

284
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,800
They feel like heroes.

285
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,360
Ask them all, ask, ask math whiz, ask man mode.

286
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Ask any of those other fucking guys who did it.

287
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,520
Uh, you will be a better person if you just tie yourself to a standard into the legendary

288
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,280
munchy W tiny hats vlog, watery advice.

289
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,280
This was vlogger accord at rad con three, where I took a shower after like 20 minutes

290
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,560
of debating if I want to take a shower.

291
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,720
Because you know, like, oh, you know, I, I, I want to just go downstairs and just hang out.

292
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,760
You know, I don't know if I really want to put in the effort to take a shower.

293
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,480
It's too much.

294
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,840
But then I fucking did it.

295
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,920
I forced myself to, and it was great.

296
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,840
Immediately the water hits me and I feel like a new fucking man.

297
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,560
And I, and this is the same thing that goes as I say in the video for like working out

298
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,760
or, you know, like, like, like exercising anyway, taking a shower, doing the normal people stuff.

299
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,800
You might not want to put in the effort into doing work.

300
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,920
But once you do, it'll feel so good.

301
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,040
It's just like, it's just, it's always like that.

302
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,760
It's always like that in every way.

303
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,640
And every way.

304
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
It'll feel good.

305
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,680
It'll be good when you do it.

306
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,120
And you'll get the experience, obviously, of doing it.

307
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,960
And if you don't, you will feel bad.

308
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,800
You didn't do the thing you know you need to do.

309
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,480
So you're even preventing yourself from feeling bad.

310
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,800
And that all becomes a good thing that you feel about yourself.

311
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,840
That's how like I feel when I work out and when I come out and do work or any of that shit.

312
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,040
Ben, this is what you're saying.

313
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,360
Oh, I was, I was going to say, yeah, you've got to, you've got to step outside yourself

314
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,160
and be like, I am, you know, I feel averse to doing this thing that is good for me.

315
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,480
But, you know, I know that even though it doesn't feel like it now, objectively,

316
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,560
I know that I will feel good once I do it.

317
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,440
And you have to like, you have to like kind of go on faith.

318
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,640
You have to kind of operate on faith that that is what will happen,

319
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,560
that you will be glad you did it.

320
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:24,520
Well, you know, the thing is, the problem is that everyone is like,

321
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,440
Oh, what's the point of life to be happy?

322
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,560
And that's not the truth.

323
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,120
That's wrong.

324
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,240
That's false.

325
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,400
The real meaning of life is to find something that gives you meaning.

326
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,880
You have to do something that makes you feel fulfilled.

327
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,440
And fulfillment is totally different than happiness.

328
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,280
Happiness is eating an entire pizza.

329
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,160
Fulfillment is like doing something that like 10 years from now,

330
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,480
you'll look back and think that was fucking amazing.

331
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,600
So I agree.

332
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,960
I think most people delaying gratification.

333
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,200
Delaying gratification is the most important skill anyone can have.

334
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,800
Look, it's called life edging.

335
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,920
All right, get into it.

336
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,680
That's it, man.

337
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,560
That's exactly it.

338
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,080
Like, I don't know.

339
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,840
Like I remember so well that full year,

340
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,600
it took me one year to make both of my Gurren login videos.

341
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,840
And I remember coming home after my fucking shitty job building furniture,

342
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,160
and I would grab my fucking laptop, get in my car, drive to that.

343
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
My parents had like loaned me.

344
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,720
It wasn't actually my car and that a drive to the fucking library.

345
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,920
So I'd have privacy and be able to focus and sit there on my terrible

346
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,200
fucking laptop that couldn't even play a preview image.

347
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,440
So I had to render out footage and then play it back.

348
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,200
If I want to see if the edit had worked properly and just do that.

349
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,480
And again, you know, six months, just like month after month after month,

350
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,200
working on the shit, coming home, recording, whatever I need to do.

351
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,680
I'm not interested in like making myself sound cool.

352
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,880
When I'm interested in having people understand why this is important

353
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,520
and why it matters that this is how you orient your life,

354
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,880
you got to know that the best things in life take work

355
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,080
and you should not sit around and be like, why are people giving me shit?

356
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,480
I care about you, everybody listening to this.

357
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,960
I want you to have the best life possible.

358
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,240
And the way you can do that is by empowering yourself

359
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,880
and take responsibility for your life.

360
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,000
I just want everyone to be happy.

361
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,480
God damn it.

362
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,440
And this is how you do it.

363
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,360
Nate, you're literally Caliburn.

364
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,320
You literally are Caliburn in every way, in every way.

365
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,560
Yeah, you're playing a game that's supposed to be unwinnable to play.

366
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
And you're just fucking cranking shit out

367
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,600
and you're abusing women every step of the way

368
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,000
and getting your shit done to its fullest extent.

369
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,120
And you'll know the taste of my lash.

370
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,600
The PCP is just the felt that Nate has amassed

371
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,360
over his years grinding out this fucking shit.

372
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,120
As I conquer planet to planet,

373
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,600
I'm like, dissented to that black hole in the sky.

374
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,040
Yeah, sick.

375
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,560
God, X6 was so good.

376
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,200
Remember that part?

377
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, it was really good.

378
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,120
Hey, this is all cool and all.

379
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,720
I feel like we've gone through a little bit of the philosophy.

380
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,000
Believe it or not, whenever we talk too much about how cool I am,

381
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,600
I don't want to do it for that long.

382
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,640
I would rather hear about some specific stories of jobs

383
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,040
that we've each had that are there that I've had a blot in my life.

384
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,520
This is the Nate redemption episode,

385
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,600
where I take back everything that I felt for the past three years.

386
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,680
And Nate comes around to be normal.

387
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,760
He'd be like, you know, guys, let's not get too into the philosophy.

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,600
Let's try and transfer into some standard stories here

389
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,360
and get back to the roots here.

390
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,000
Ever since Radcon, I've just had two phrases

391
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,840
ringing in my mind the whole time.

392
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,360
It's, where are the memes?

393
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,880
And give me the memes.

394
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,520
And by Christ, I know that's what the people crave.

395
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,720
So that's what we got to do.

396
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,760
All right, you were talking.

397
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,120
So you're barred from entry to talk about stories now.

398
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,760
Tom, you haven't said anything, basically this entire podcast.

399
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,800
You're basically not worthy of existence.

400
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,400
What else is new?

401
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,600
No, fuck.

402
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,560
I mean, I agree with everything that's been said so far.

403
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,440
Is that like, yeah, you got to like fucking make your shit happen.

404
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,000
And that's just the, you got to grind if you want to.

405
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,440
Where are the memes?

406
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,040
Give me the stories.

407
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,480
That's the memes.

408
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,720
Well, Munchy, you were horrified at my story.

409
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,440
I told you about how my job got fucked over out of college.

410
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,800
Oh, yeah.

411
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,520
Oh, yeah.

412
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,040
Yeah.

413
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,400
So I, the reason like my whole life went to shit

414
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,480
is because I had, I had everything set up and lined up after school

415
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,840
and then it all was cruelly robbed from me at the last second

416
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,120
for no fault of my own.

417
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,800
So when I,

418
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,440
That's what they all say.

419
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:33,960
What?

420
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,200
Yeah.

421
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,440
Yeah.

422
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,280
I mean, I'm just going to like turn this all around

423
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,920
and take all responsibility off of my clothes.

424
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,440
Well.

425
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,800
But no, so when I was going to school, like during the summer

426
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,800
and the winter, I would work doing like, I sort of an internship.

427
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,920
It was like a college program at where my dad works.

428
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,880
He works as a contractor at Hanscom Air Force Base.

429
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,080
So he's like, he does like businessy sort of things.

430
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,400
He balances like a billion dollar budget and stuff.

431
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,280
He's a smart guy.

432
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,640
Cool.

433
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,280
And so he's like, hey, you're poor as fuck.

434
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,840
Come work here at this program thing.

435
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,680
If they accept you, you can go do that.

436
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,720
I'm like, okay.

437
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,560
So I just started going there, just like doing a like paperwork

438
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,600
and filing things away.

439
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,360
And then I got an email and they were like, hey,

440
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,320
we need this thing designed.

441
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,160
Does anybody know how to do art things?

442
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,960
And I'm just like, hey, this is what I've been waiting for.

443
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,800
So I designed them this whole like thing just in my spare time.

444
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
And like it wasn't open for like people in my position,

445
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,960
but I'm just like, I'll just do it anyway.

446
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,040
Because I have a bunch of downtime in the middle of like the things

447
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,160
they're giving me to do.

448
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,640
So I did it.

449
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,920
And they're like, whoa, this is fucking great.

450
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,640
We're going to use it.

451
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,520
So like it's all over the place at the base now and stuff, I guess.

452
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,720
And they still use it.

453
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,680
And I was like, oh, that's sick.

454
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,600
And they're like, you need to come back again

455
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,760
and do like design work for us this time.

456
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,120
Like, all right, sick.

457
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,480
And then I started doing that.

458
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,120
And then they were like, yeah, you're great.

459
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,080
We like you a lot.

460
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,920
We're going to hire you doing design here at the design team

461
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,880
once you're done with school.

462
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,520
And like six months at this point, I'm like, yes, I'm fucking sick.

463
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,000
This is great.

464
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,960
I'm going to get like a big cushy paid job right out of the gate.

465
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,000
It's going to be great.

466
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,760
And then fucking Obama cut the funds.

467
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,040
And they killed my fucking position literally two weeks

468
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,320
before I was set to graduate.

469
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,480
So when I graduated, I'm like, well, I have no backup plan.

470
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,000
Because I literally have been working where I was supposed

471
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,840
to get hired in two weeks.

472
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,640
And they fucked me.

473
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,000
And then I was a sad boy.

474
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,160
Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Barack Hussein Obama.

475
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,480
Where's Tom's piece, Obama?

476
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,360
Where is it?

477
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,640
I put in the hours.

478
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,480
I put in the effort.

479
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:35,880
What?

480
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,720
What was the thing you worked for?

481
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,080
I just worked for it.

482
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,520
It's a hands come air force base.

483
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,080
It's an acquisition base.

484
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,240
Yeah.

485
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Any, are you commenting there to do anything to say

486
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,360
on the matter?

487
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,800
Well, military spending still increased every year.

488
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,120
Yeah.

489
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,400
Well, not for me.

490
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,120
I know, right?

491
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,920
Yeah, I guess it was bullshit.

492
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,960
They can spend a trillion dollars on like the F-35,

493
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,160
but they can't throw me like 30 grand a year, those fucks.

494
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,880
Now I understand why Tom's a communist.

495
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,080
It's not to rebel against the citizen himself.

496
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,560
It's to spite Obama himself.

497
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,080
It's to get back at the man.

498
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,920
The ultimate cracker of capitalists.

499
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,600
Yeah, yeah.

500
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,480
Tom is looking at Obama up on Capitol Hill

501
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,960
with his fucking fist clutch.

502
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,040
I was ready to make the man rock over there.

503
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,400
I was ready and bushy-tailed.

504
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,320
I remember going into college and I was like,

505
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,920
Dad, I know this is expensive, right?

506
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,480
How much is it going to cost me per month when I graduate?

507
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,600
And straight up, everybody has debt.

508
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,720
Don't worry about it.

509
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,440
And I was like, okay, Dad, I'll believe you.

510
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,200
I don't mean this to be mean or anything,

511
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,600
but your father failed you in this one small thing.

512
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,480
Small, small thing.

513
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,560
Well, okay, that's true.

514
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,200
I'm not trying to say the guy's evil or anything,

515
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,440
but so much of the generation above us has underestimated

516
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,160
and wasn't fully abreast of the situation

517
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,520
that we found ourselves in.

518
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,680
And it is fair to criticize.

519
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,800
It's fair to criticize for that.

520
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,240
Because out of school.

521
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,040
It was a different system when they grew up.

522
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,680
Out of school.

523
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,440
It was a system when they did this.

524
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,560
I really struggle.

525
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,840
My spills were $500 a month in student loans.

526
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,600
If he had said son,

527
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,520
you're going to have to pay $500 a month,

528
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,280
I'd have been like, well, I'm not going to school.

529
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,040
He probably didn't actually know,

530
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,880
because none of our parents grew up

531
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
in the same economy that we're in right now.

532
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,280
If you look at the charts about how, I'm sure you have,

533
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,240
but the charts of the increases in enrollment costs

534
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,000
of colleges and housing and boarding

535
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,160
and all the stuff that people used to do themselves.

536
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,760
But now, because it's all rolled into that,

537
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,840
you can just fucking take a big out federal loan

538
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,440
and just push all, delay the fucking, delay the pain.

539
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,800
As opposed to the growth which causes the cost

540
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,360
to constantly increase for future generations.

541
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,000
And I'll tell you, I'll tell you why.

542
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,960
This isn't really a conspiracy, because this is just true.

543
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,120
But it's the fact that we do this.

544
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,680
It's the fact that we just have this magic wand

545
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,080
we can wave and say, I get into college now.

546
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,120
All my problems get delayed for four or eight years.

547
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,000
The fact that that exists is why it's so easy for the colleges

548
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,480
to just keep blowing up their fucking prices

549
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,160
that they charge for enrollment and shit.

550
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,560
And the government just like magically creates more money.

551
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,400
Like, okay, sure, we'll just give you our money.

552
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,240
It's a huge fucking evil cycle,

553
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,600
and we all get ground up in it.

554
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,560
It's more or less the same thing

555
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,760
as what happens to healthcare prices and housing prices.

556
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,440
Sounds right to me.

557
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
I don't trust big corporations on any of this shit.

558
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
I trust big corporations to make my shoes

559
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,800
and make my iPhones and stuff.

560
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,200
I don't protect them to protect my fucking data or anything.

561
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,720
But that's why I would much rather any fucking time,

562
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,840
like just like deal with individual people

563
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,640
and have like a small little business that I run one-on-one,

564
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,080
as opposed to these giant corporations

565
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
that literally are more powerful than the governments

566
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,400
that theoretically control them.

567
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,720
But actually, they have massive sway over

568
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,800
through fucking funding them politically

569
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,440
through super PACs and all this bullshit.

570
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,400
Oh, it's a mad world.

571
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,640
What are we to do?

572
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,680
What are we to do?

573
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,600
Is there anything that we could do about the system?

574
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,640
How can we change the system?

575
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,840
Is there any way to do that?

576
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,440
Or is it so off the rails now

577
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,360
that there's no point in even acknowledging

578
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,560
that there's a problem?

579
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,160
I really think the only thing to do

580
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,200
is stop relying on the government.

581
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,520
The solution is clearly to seize the means of production.

582
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,640
Yeah!

583
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,560
Well, it sort of is only in the sense of by seizing it,

584
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,120
we stop relying on the government to do shit for us

585
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,720
because it allows them to do this stuff.

586
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,160
Listen, guys, I'm not,

587
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm no fucking hardcore,

588
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,480
like all government is inherently bad or any of that shit.

589
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,840
But I'm telling you right now,

590
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,360
like who the fuck wants your government

591
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,280
to control like every aspect of your life?

592
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,960
Do you trust these fucking bureaucrats

593
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,040
to control every minute detail?

594
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,360
They've got 300 million people to control it.

595
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,960
Don't be a didgy bro and let the civil system come to pass.

596
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,720
You gotta be more woke than that.

597
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,520
I'm with you and I am on your side,

598
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,800
but I want to be Del's advocate

599
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,760
because there are people who are a dirt pour

600
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,840
like white trash like trailer parks

601
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,240
and they are just in the cycle

602
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,840
where everyone around them.

603
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,360
How dare you talk about talking like that?

604
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
They're in the cycle where like

605
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,600
their dad relied on the government

606
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,360
and his dad relied on the government

607
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,120
and now like they are just so entrenched in that culture.

608
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,280
Like what can they do to break through?

609
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,920
Because it's not like they have any money to begin with.

610
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
It's totally, that's a totally fair point,

611
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,840
but here's the real deal.

612
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:25,960
Fuck them.

613
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,160
Fuck them.

614
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,080
That's my answer to this question.

615
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,400
At some point, someone's gotta pay

616
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,840
and it's gonna be these people.

617
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,880
I'm really sorry.

618
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,680
I'm really sorry.

619
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,120
I wish it wouldn't happen.

620
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Wait, wait, they have to pay for what?

621
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,240
Well, they went when we, like just for example,

622
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,760
they were one crazy example.

623
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,120
If we just, for example, cut welfare 100%,

624
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,800
just say it was gone,

625
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,400
because let's just say America had a revolution

626
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,640
where everyone realized that like taxation is theft

627
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,360
just crossed the board.

628
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,640
Let's just say that happened.

629
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,320
Then like, then man,

630
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,200
that sucks for all the people

631
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,520
who really relied on welfare to live and shit.

632
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,360
That's like, and that's gonna cause huge problems.

633
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,720
Like all those people will probably

634
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,000
not be able to pay their fucking rent,

635
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,920
get kicked out with a massive homeless population.

636
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,840
You know, the housing market will crash

637
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,040
because people can't afford the things

638
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,560
that were being subsidized by the government.

639
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,280
Don't get me wrong.

640
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,640
There's gonna be huge problems.

641
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,120
But long term, long term,

642
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,600
I like to think things would go better.

643
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,120
You know, if there was less reliance

644
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,760
and less government control and all this shit,

645
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,880
but I'm not fucking economy.

646
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,400
The solution is something even more socialist,

647
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,240
but it's secretly better for economics, which is-

648
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,520
Bring back Obama!

649
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,440
Is he the universal guaranteed income?

650
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,320
Yeah.

651
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,200
Yeah!

652
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,760
Okay.

653
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,200
That's not a bad plan.

654
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,160
Well, yeah, because the thing is-

655
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,080
That's the opposite of what you just proposed, Nate.

656
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,840
I know, but like DeVoo said,

657
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,200
it's technically more socialist,

658
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,360
but it gets us more towards an egalitarian system.

659
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,400
Right, because it's-

660
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,040
The thing about welfare-

661
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,920
Does it, though?

662
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,480
Does it, though?

663
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,280
Well, security-

664
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,400
Well, here's my-

665
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,000
Wait, wait, wait, let DeVoo finish.

666
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,800
Okay, go.

667
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,040
The thing about all the government spending shit,

668
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,360
and let's just go on the record here.

669
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,280
The government spends way the fuck more money

670
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
on entitlements than it does on the military.

671
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,160
People don't-

672
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,200
Just spend more, that's true.

673
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,760
Yeah, it's true.

674
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,200
It's like significantly fucking more.

675
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,000
You could kill the entire military.

676
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,800
I thought it was something like two-

677
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,080
Two-thirds is like entitlements,

678
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,560
then one-third is the military.

679
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,280
It's like a half.

680
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,160
Like, you could actually-

681
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,640
Okay.

682
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,480
The military is like a quarter,

683
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,080
and entitlements is like half

684
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,360
of all the money the government spends.

685
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,840
And let's not-

686
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,880
Let's not be-

687
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
You know, like, that's a lot of money on both fronts.

688
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,360
I know, I know.

689
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,400
It's a lot of money saving both fronts.

690
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,000
It just pisses me off because people

691
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,680
always count social security, welfare,

692
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,320
blah, blah, blah, all as separate slices of the pie.

693
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,840
Right, right.

694
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
But they don't separate the fucking navy

695
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,600
from the fucking, you know, Air Force.

696
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,200
Anyway, irrelevant.

697
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
So the thing is that the government gets

698
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,360
to decide how you use your money,

699
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,720
what you can spend your money on.

700
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,640
It gives you all these rules.

701
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,200
The idea of UBI is simply that everyone,

702
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,960
everyone gets a certain amount of money,

703
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,360
the same amount of money in their bank account,

704
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,000
attach their social securities every month.

705
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,560
And that's it.

706
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,960
Doesn't matter how much or how little money you make.

707
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,440
That way you don't have to worry about losing money

708
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,800
by making more money in the form

709
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,880
of different tax brackets, for instance, right?

710
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,800
You'd make the same money every single month.

711
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,360
Well, Taboo, here is why.

712
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,520
Here is why that plan is evil,

713
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,800
and I'm coming to your house to kill you.

714
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,880
It's because that system is prejudiced

715
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
against the less competent.

716
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,640
That's the problem with that system.

717
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,880
And how can we discriminate against people

718
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,560
on the basis of competency?

719
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,600
How can you make that case?

720
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,040
Didn't you just make the case that we need

721
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,480
to fuck those people and let them die completely?

722
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,000
I am, I mean, I'm being...

723
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,680
He's making a joke.

724
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,800
He's trying to...

725
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,240
Where are the memes?

726
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,280
Did you like that joke?

727
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,800
Did you like that joke?

728
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,440
Yeah.

729
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,320
No, I was fucking gay.

730
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,120
There's the memes.

731
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,400
But dude, no, like, the idea of UBI

732
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,080
is that you don't have any excuses.

733
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,760
There's nothing in UBI

734
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,080
that incentivizes you to work less, you know?

735
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,680
I love it.

736
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,200
I think plenty of people know,

737
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,280
like have some Republican uncle

738
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,960
who is still on disability

739
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,040
and totally could fucking work but doesn't.

740
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,480
I have one, you know?

741
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,680
So it's just like, yeah.

742
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,800
People, you know,

743
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,560
as long as they're fair economics people,

744
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,480
they talk about how when you have the government

745
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,680
spend money on shit,

746
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,280
not only does it cost a lot of money,

747
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,480
it also results in all this fucking red tape

748
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,400
and it makes the law too complicated.

749
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,280
And I mean, complicated laws in general

750
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,600
are the secret way in which the poor get fucked over

751
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,440
because we have a lawyer society

752
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,880
where basically the better lawyers you have,

753
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,120
the more you can get away with shit and vice versa.

754
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,880
No one ever talks about that shit.

755
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,040
No one ever talks about simplifying the law.

756
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,120
That would help out a lot of people.

757
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,640
It's because who's gonna fucking report on that?

758
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,760
Fucking Rachel Maddow,

759
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,920
who's like one of the elite class, you know?

760
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,400
Right, exactly.

761
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,760
Of course not, you know?

762
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,280
So simplified law,

763
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,320
the thing is that you can't politically get away

764
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,800
with having less fucking entitlements.

765
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,800
People don't really talk about this,

766
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,280
but Republicans almost never even propose that shit.

767
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,520
It's mostly libertarian think tanks

768
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,000
talking about cutting funding for shit.

769
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,520
No one even suggests it actually.

770
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,280
No one even suggests it because it's too political.

771
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,120
I'm suggesting the right fucking now.

772
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,920
I'm doing it.

773
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,600
So my point is with UBI,

774
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,880
you sort of cheat the system

775
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,160
because everyone basically gets what they want

776
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,480
regarding helping out the poor, right?

777
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,000
But without all the red tape.

778
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,680
And I think that's probably the best compromise

779
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,720
that you can come to.

780
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,600
But even fucking the socialist paradise is like Sweden,

781
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,800
can't make that shit happen

782
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,680
because obviously the government wants all that control.

783
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,400
That's why they use the whole

784
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,200
veneer of generosity with other people's tax money

785
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,760
in order to get by with that shit.

786
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,880
But yeah, UBI, that's the closest I think we can get

787
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,000
in this generation.

788
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,760
That system is so attractive to me in many ways.

789
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,880
And everyone's gonna,

790
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,000
Tom, if you want to cut in, yeah, feel free to answer.

791
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,360
Well, I was going to say like,

792
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,040
just to play devil's advocate on it,

793
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,080
is that I think personally, I would love that.

794
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,040
I think it's a great idea.

795
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,800
My only concern with a system like that

796
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,040
is like we just talked about how like government,

797
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,800
intrusion into things like the healthcare market

798
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,440
and college drove the prices up.

799
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,680
Like wouldn't the market eventually adjust the fact

800
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,520
that, oh, everyone has X amount of money

801
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,000
so we can price everything up slowly but steadily

802
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,920
until it just doesn't matter anymore?

803
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,760
Oh, you might be right.

804
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,240
I don't actually understand economics,

805
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,200
so I don't know exactly how.

806
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,560
I got it, price controls.

807
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,680
That's always worked out.

808
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, I found the solution.

809
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,560
I'm gonna sound, Munchie, I do want to say something.

810
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,880
No, no, no, you go on, I'm gonna shift gears.

811
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Okay, I might go on a little bit long.

812
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,760
Sure, sure, sure.

813
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,320
But it's just, so there's just a story that I want to tell

814
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,720
about me as a young man that might make people think

815
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,360
I was always evil, but here's just one.

816
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,120
If you don't need any help with that, Nate,

817
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,280
that's not a thing that we will now think.

818
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,680
Here's how you know that I'm not pretending anything

819
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,640
that I say now.

820
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,160
It's because when I was a kid,

821
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
I was like, you know, I was like,

822
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,760
it's because when I was a kid,

823
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
my mom is a special education teacher.

824
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,080
And so when I was in school, and I was doing well,

825
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,680
and I felt whatever, things were going fine.

826
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,360
I was in elementary school at this point.

827
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,920
And my mom was telling me about her day.

828
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,080
She worked with a kid one-on-one.

829
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,360
You know, she spends her days just with one kid,

830
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,880
at least with this particular job she was in

831
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,320
at the school that she worked at.

832
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,000
And I just said to my mom, okay, mom, I get it,

833
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,520
but here's my question.

834
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,880
Why are you paying so much attention to this kid

835
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,120
who will never be an amazing shining star?

836
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,960
Why not spend your time to help a kid who's really good,

837
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,880
and could be even better with one-on-one attention?

838
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,000
And she was just like, well, he doesn't need it as much.

839
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,480
I gotta help the people who are lacking

840
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,840
and need more of a boost to get up to help them.

841
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,120
And that has always confused me.

842
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,440
I've never been on board with that system.

843
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Like, what is gained?

844
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,080
We feel good.

845
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,120
We feel good.

846
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,240
Yeah, like, what is gained helping someone

847
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,640
who is never gonna make significant progress?

848
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,280
Well, I guess if you wanna talk purely...

849
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,320
We feel good.

850
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,280
No, I think there's a utilitarian fact of that.

851
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,760
You know, the low achievers, they form the backbone

852
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,520
of the service industry and stuff.

853
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,400
There are people who can't really climb higher.

854
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,600
So there needs to be a minimum level of competency

855
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,760
in any sort of employed positions.

856
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,960
Yeah, you're not wrong, Tom.

857
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,600
I'm talking about people who are not even capable of speech,

858
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,440
for example, as some of these students.

859
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,400
So there's...

860
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,120
Like, we got issues.

861
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,240
I think you're severely alienating most of our audience.

862
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,200
I'm not trying to say people who are more lower functioning

863
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,160
don't deserve care or attention or appreciation.

864
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,800
It's a matter of distribution of resources

865
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
is what I am focusing on.

866
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,960
And I'm interested...

867
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
And let's be real.

868
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,240
If we invented robot butlers that could one-on-one

869
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,440
tend to all the people who needed this kind of extra care,

870
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,760
and I'll tell you right now, the way that we get there

871
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,400
is by helping people be really smart science boys

872
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,160
who are at the top level of achievement

873
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,120
so that we can invent that.

874
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,920
And right now, isn't it great that when...

875
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,680
This is just one example, but you got a girl

876
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,720
who's got some disability, she gets lost or something,

877
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,600
she pulls out what?

878
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,480
Her fucking cell phone that she couldn't have made

879
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,320
that was made by a really smart science boy

880
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,760
that science fucking developed,

881
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,680
and she calls home so someone can come pick her up

882
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,280
so she's not, you know, scared or in danger or any of that shit.

883
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,080
Like, that...

884
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,800
To me, it makes all the sense in the world

885
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,160
to focus our resources on the high achievement.

886
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,640
Oh, God.

887
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,160
On the high achievement.

888
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,600
That's what I'm saying.

889
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,000
Let it be known that I...

890
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,600
And as a baby, I detected that.

891
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,200
As a baby, I detected that shit.

892
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,520
Yeah.

893
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Let it be known that I've hit the eject button

894
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,880
on this train that we've all been steaming, powering down.

895
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,560
And I am now outside.

896
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,480
I just want to gas the retarded munchie.

897
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,280
That's all I'm saying.

898
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,960
I think the reason you knew that

899
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,640
is exactly what your mom has said.

900
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,640
I don't think this is necessarily true.

901
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,560
Like, objective fact, this is what should happen.

902
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,200
Again, I'm not...

903
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,400
But the people want to...

904
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,480
The reason people want to do that

905
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,200
is because they feel like the people who are well off

906
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,360
are well off and they want to help the people who are not.

907
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,920
Whether that's morally objectionable or not,

908
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
I'm not here to discuss.

909
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,880
A lot of people have an instinct.

910
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,680
But people want to do it.

911
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,240
People want to help people.

912
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
But see, I think this is a major issue

913
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,200
of human nature itself.

914
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
Like, we see people who are rich

915
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,560
and I see it every fucking day.

916
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,320
I did it today.

917
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,600
Me and my girlfriend were talking about...

918
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,400
I forget who.

919
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,840
Let's just say like Nicki Minaj.

920
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
And it was like Nicki Minaj tweeted something

921
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,360
about being unhappy.

922
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,720
And my response was,

923
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,640
okay, but you're rich, so fuck you.

924
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,760
That's wrong.

925
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,040
That's incorrect.

926
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,760
That does not...

927
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,680
Just because someone is rich or successful

928
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,000
does not invalidate, you know, like...

929
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,800
Yeah.

930
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,760
They're part of this.

931
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,080
Well, there's a connection here.

932
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,160
There's a connection here.

933
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,440
On the rich.

934
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,120
I made the connection to those with versus those that...

935
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,800
We have such strong instincts

936
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,640
to just want to help those without.

937
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,800
And on a practical matter,

938
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,480
it is not always beneficial.

939
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,640
And this is why people love communism and socialism

940
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,360
to begin with.

941
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,520
They love the idea of just giving stuff

942
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,960
to people who are without.

943
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,440
But that might not necessarily be the best way

944
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,640
to help those people.

945
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,680
That's the point I'm trying to make here.

946
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
Stuff is not just something you can give.

947
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,880
When people talk about like,

948
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,560
oh, let's fucking...

949
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,760
Let's bridge that fucking wage gap

950
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
by giving some money over to those other people.

951
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,960
Ask yourself why the hell does handing

952
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,720
and throwing a shitload of money at Africa

953
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,880
not necessarily fix it, right?

954
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,160
There's more than just...

955
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,560
I think...

956
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,440
Okay, let me put this away.

957
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,200
When it comes to institutionalized

958
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,640
those in power versus those in not,

959
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,760
those who are not in power,

960
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,480
incomes, wealth,

961
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
is actually kind of a distraction.

962
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,640
It doesn't actually have all to do

963
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,720
with why certain people remain successful

964
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,760
and others don't.

965
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,000
When we just look at the wealth gap

966
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,600
or the income gap and we're like,

967
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,120
oh, if we could just fix that,

968
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,520
we fix the actual underlying reason

969
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,120
why these people are making

970
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,720
different amounts of money.

971
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,000
It doesn't make any sense.

972
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,680
Like if we make it to where it's illegal

973
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,760
to pay a CEO more than say $250,000 a year,

974
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,120
all they're gonna do

975
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,840
companies will just give CEOs

976
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,120
a shitload of free stuff to incentivize them

977
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,960
because there's a reason why CEOs get paid so much.

978
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,760
They'll work around it.

979
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,040
That actually...

980
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,480
And then we just get in the semantics game

981
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,280
of trying to criminalize each of these little things

982
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,720
and that's a huge waste of time.

983
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,520
Right.

984
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,600
Okay, I think we're conflating certain subjects

985
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,440
because I'm not talking about the rich

986
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,800
or people who just don't have the backbone

987
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,240
in order to get a job.

988
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,800
I'm talking about mentally birth defect people.

989
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,880
I'm talking about birth defect people

990
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,920
who I feel like their existence is suffering.

991
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,520
And I feel like...

992
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,640
That's not necessarily true.

993
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,520
I mean, it depends.

994
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,560
It depends on what you do in your stuff.

995
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,440
It might be content.

996
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,600
Like there's a lot of people who are retarded,

997
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,800
who are just perfectly happy,

998
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,360
it's just that they're not gonna fucking make Apple too

999
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,840
or whatever.

1000
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,240
They're just...

1001
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,040
I know...

1002
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,920
Okay, what I'm saying is that I'm not saying

1003
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,360
that we should just have all of our teachers focus

1004
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,400
on the people who are just underachievers,

1005
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,480
who are just able-bodied and fine

1006
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
and can do whatever.

1007
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,000
They just don't have the fortitude and willpower to do it.

1008
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,080
Those people can fucking die and they don't matter.

1009
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,520
At some point, somebody has to start looking out

1010
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,360
for those people because if we say,

1011
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,640
if we do what you say,

1012
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,480
we should just focus on all of the successful people,

1013
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,360
who are going far so they can create things

1014
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,040
to make the robot butlers or whatever,

1015
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,560
they have to care about those people

1016
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,320
to want to make the robot butlers.

1017
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,640
If they don't, then they'll never get made

1018
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,920
and they'll just all die.

1019
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,000
The way I see it, there should be a skill floor

1020
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,720
that we should be trying to elevate everyone to.

1021
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,800
And then once they are at that floor,

1022
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,640
we should leave them alone until...

1023
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,560
It depends on in what way, but yes.

1024
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,760
I mean, that's the general idea.

1025
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,440
We should try and elevate the people

1026
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,120
who need our help on a physical or mental level.

1027
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,640
Maybe not, I don't know how much money

1028
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,080
we are dedicating to this in our society.

1029
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,680
I don't know what our priorities are,

1030
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,000
but I think that it's just a humanitarian

1031
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,640
and just not entirely against our interests

1032
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,320
or burning money or anything.

1033
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,800
I think it's just a nice thing to do

1034
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,760
in order to help our general society

1035
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,480
be more on level with one another

1036
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,800
and be able to achieve the same things as one another.

1037
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,560
You're not wrong and I would never say anyone

1038
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,480
who wants to do that shouldn't do it.

1039
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,320
For example, my mom chose to go

1040
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,520
into the special education field.

1041
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,360
She knew exactly what she was getting into

1042
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,920
and I salute her and I'm proud of her and I love her.

1043
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,040
And of course, I respect her decisions, of course.

1044
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,360
The problem is when you conflate,

1045
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,360
or not not conflate, but we're mixing

1046
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,320
between individual specific choices people make

1047
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,640
and then just broad policy issues.

1048
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,120
I don't believe that men are biologically equal

1049
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,400
to women in every single way.

1050
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,880
But I know women who are stronger than men.

1051
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,400
I mean, of course, that's true

1052
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
and it happens plenty of times.

1053
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,240
It's just, whatever, it doesn't matter.

1054
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,360
I'm getting lost in the woods here.

1055
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,160
A bunchy...

1056
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,840
You're saying different topics here.

1057
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,960
I want to talk about something.

1058
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,080
I want to shift gears to something

1059
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,440
that we were kind of talking before.

1060
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,080
DeVu reminded me of, about simplifying the law.

1061
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,440
I think one of the major problems

1062
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,880
in the United States government

1063
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,520
is that it's so fucking old

1064
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,080
and all the people in it are so fucking old.

1065
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,640
Very, very sure.

1066
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,440
The government, like the way I...

1067
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,280
That's why I'm voting for Bernie Sanders.

1068
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,680
Exactly, this is the youngest person,

1069
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,120
the hippest guy in the crowd.

1070
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,840
I'm voting Bernie in 2020.

1071
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,320
I don't know about you guys.

1072
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,040
Bernie's a good man.

1073
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,960
Yeah, yeah, when he's six feet fucking under,

1074
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,800
we're going to lift him up to the O-locks.

1075
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,080
Why the fuck not?

1076
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,880
At this point...

1077
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,040
I mean, he's what, he's like 74 now,

1078
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,760
something like that?

1079
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,280
Oh, he's already dead.

1080
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,480
No, no, all we got to do,

1081
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,880
we just got a weekend at Bernie's, Sanders him.

1082
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,960
The entire fucking presidency.

1083
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,440
The entire, the entire 2016 election

1084
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,600
was just a buildup to that punchline.

1085
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,760
Remember everybody out there,

1086
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,760
when they start telling you to vote for Joe Biden

1087
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,880
instead of Bernie Sanders,

1088
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,800
remember Joe Biden is 75,

1089
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,640
Bernie Sanders is 76.

1090
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,600
Not a big difference there.

1091
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,680
Why does Bernie Sanders look so fucking old?

1092
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,440
He just looks like an old ass man.

1093
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,760
He just, well, Joe Biden is one year younger.

1094
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,160
He just happens to look more photogenic and stuff.

1095
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,680
Okay, okay, well, it fucking doesn't matter.

1096
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,600
I'm an old ass Jew, Bernie Sanders.

1097
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,480
Uh, I'm from Brooklyn, motherfuckers.

1098
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,640
The way I see the government is like a bunch of bricks,

1099
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,880
like tacked on top of one another,

1100
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,120
who like, like, like each layer of bricks

1101
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,720
is from like a different time period

1102
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
and like looks completely aesthetically different

1103
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,760
to the bricks before,

1104
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,240
but they're all laid upon the same foundation.

1105
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,440
So when you step back and look at it,

1106
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,800
it's just like a hodgepodge, different ideas.

1107
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,480
Munchy, I hear you do tear up the Constitution.

1108
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,360
We've got to start.

1109
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,480
Destroy it, dude.

1110
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,840
We've got to start with the service agreement to Minecraft

1111
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,360
is the template we should be using.

1112
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,840
All right, all right, all right.

1113
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,240
Rule number one, all people who are created work equal.

1114
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,400
Rule number two, do not mine at nine.

1115
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,720
This is broken by the United States of America.

1116
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,720
Okay, so like, bro, see the thing about like society,

1117
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
and I assume basically every culture,

1118
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,880
but America is definitely no different,

1119
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,840
is that the average person really views the government

1120
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,880
as like a magic MacGuffin in like a movie,

1121
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,200
but it's like whoever can grab the magic lamp

1122
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,240
and then like rub their wish into it in the third act,

1123
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,000
like everything will be fine.

1124
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,600
Like at the end of fucking Return of the King,

1125
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,600
where like, you know, the ground collapses

1126
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,240
and conveniently only collapses the bad people, you know?

1127
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,920
But that's what we always want.

1128
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,760
That's how it's always talked about.

1129
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,200
Like I remember like when Obamacare was like very slightly

1130
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,960
approved of by the Supreme Court,

1131
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,680
people were like, okay, cool, healthcare is free right now, right?

1132
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,160
Like, yeah, or like when conversely,

1133
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,880
if Obamacare gets obstructed by like one month,

1134
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,400
people are like, oh good, healthcare

1135
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,080
has improved the capitalist now, right?

1136
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,680
Fucking no, I think it's-

1137
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,120
You know, Tavu, you're totally right.

1138
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,440
Like remember that argument I made a long time ago

1139
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,240
about like, shit, what was it?

1140
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,080
It was like that we should like,

1141
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,480
we want to get on the suicide episode when I said like,

1142
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,960
I want like people to like review people

1143
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,680
and like approve people before committing suicide.

1144
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,760
Like to institute that,

1145
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,480
I recognize takes like a magical level of like bureaucracy

1146
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,720
that does not exist and can't be relied upon,

1147
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,600
but like if it existed and worked perfectly as I envisioned it,

1148
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,200
that would be nice, but it's not real.

1149
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,760
And I think that this mentality comes from sort of childhood

1150
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,160
where you see police officers as just like objective enforcers

1151
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,960
of the law, which is this objective power or like,

1152
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,400
you know, you go to school and like,

1153
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,040
the school is this objective force of knowledge

1154
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,680
and teachers just know things, right?

1155
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,880
So I think that if we saw not having laws as,

1156
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,200
not necessarily a problem, but possibly a solution,

1157
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,680
if we always just think of the way to solve problems

1158
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,760
as more laws, why can't it ever be-

1159
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,880
You know the problem is here?

1160
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,120
What?

1161
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,680
The problem is we got all these goddamn gamer girls

1162
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,600
who think of the goddamn American government as like the,

1163
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,320
it's like the code base that was made by the creators

1164
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,440
of their favorite game Minecraft, you know, Notch.

1165
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,600
They think that like, of course it was crafted perfectly,

1166
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,040
to be the most impartial.

1167
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,840
You know what it's like?

1168
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,920
There's this one scene in I Shield 21.

1169
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,600
Okay, this is a great example.

1170
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,560
In I Shield 21, there is an exact, there is a moment.

1171
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,320
It's a football manga.

1172
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,320
It's one of my favorites, it's a sports manga.

1173
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,160
The only time, okay, so whatever.

1174
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,000
Like in real, like these days,

1175
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,640
football is called ref ball in the United States of America

1176
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,960
because the refs like interfere with like every fucking play

1177
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,200
and throw a million flags and like control the whole game

1178
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,800
because of like safety and other shit.

1179
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,400
In I Shield 21, every, like the whole game is played,

1180
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,800
the whole manga is laid out that people just like do things

1181
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,480
and then like a touchdown happened, yay.

1182
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,080
And like everyone understands it immediately.

1183
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,440
There's never any question.

1184
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,160
There was only one moment in the manga

1185
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,240
where the issue of the refs is addressed.

1186
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,200
And it's this one moment where like the character looks

1187
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,040
like he was out of bounds,

1188
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,360
but he had actually grabbed some dirt to be in bounds

1189
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,400
or something like that.

1190
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,840
And like there's a dramatic reveal

1191
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
as he like looks into the eyes of the ref.

1192
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,160
And the left, like stone faced and perfect,

1193
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,000
perfectly mechanical and robotic,

1194
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,440
looks back into the eyes of Manta,

1195
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,720
the guy who had made the play.

1196
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,240
All right, he was like trying to get out of bounds

1197
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,520
or whatever to stop the clock.

1198
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,000
And like they do zooms on face to face to face

1199
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,440
and the ref raises his hand

1200
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,000
and in perfect recognition of all the facts says,

1201
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,760
yes, it was out of bounds.

1202
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,040
You are safe to do another play.

1203
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,120
You can still win this game, my heroes.

1204
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,440
And then he overturns Roe v. Wade.

1205
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,080
Like perfect.

1206
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:21,920
Yeah, exactly.

1207
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,440
And they think of the government as like perfect

1208
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,040
and impartial and always has your best games and minds.

1209
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,160
They're constantly complaining

1210
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,920
about how bad the government is.

1211
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,640
Right, yeah.

1212
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,520
Oh, that's, that's true.

1213
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,480
No, like I remember, okay, in 2012 or 2011,

1214
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,040
it was the 112th Congress or whatever the fuck.

1215
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,600
It was the one where Democrats and Republicans

1216
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,560
were like half and half.

1217
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,760
So like nothing was getting done.

1218
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,520
It was obstructionist central,

1219
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,560
north, south walking, Zach, fuck, Tobias.

1220
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,920
And one of the, I would read articles of like the top 10

1221
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,720
reasons why this Congress is the worst Congress ever.

1222
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,040
And one of the reasons that they brought up was

1223
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,560
this Congress has passed the fewest laws

1224
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,520
of any Congress in like 80 years or something.

1225
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,720
And I'm like, you know, I hear people talk about, you know,

1226
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,400
deregulation, like it's really cool.

1227
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,200
But then other people are like,

1228
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,880
Oh, deregulation sounds scary.

1229
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,840
Like we don't want corporations to do whatever.

1230
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,120
But like why not just actually look at the regulations

1231
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,520
and look at this on a case by case basis

1232
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,000
and consider which ones are reasonable.

1233
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,280
I actually, for unrelated reasons, happened to check.

1234
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:33,520
December 2017, the US government had 61,950 pages

1235
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,600
of regulations, the federal government,

1236
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,640
which apparently is a 25 year low

1237
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,440
because of the Trump administration's net negative

1238
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,480
on regulations.

1239
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,840
But yeah, 61,000 pages, like.

1240
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,120
Have you seen the shit they do?

1241
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,840
Where like they'll get like a new law

1242
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,680
and that they're voting on like an hour

1243
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,360
and like all the senators get a copy of it,

1244
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,400
like one hour before.

1245
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,280
And it's like literally 2000 pages long.

1246
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,760
That happens every fucking day that shit's happening.

1247
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,320
It's a world.

1248
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,560
I mean, I remember some people I've heard people who've said

1249
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,400
that they've heard people who've said

1250
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,560
that every US citizen breaks three felonies a year.

1251
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,240
And there you go.

1252
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,720
We live in a world where it's really just all about

1253
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,320
selective enforcement.

1254
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,840
Lawyers are really the ones who control the control freedom

1255
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,280
in the society.

1256
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,160
So there you go.

1257
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,680
You know what really sucks?

1258
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,680
What really fucking sucks?

1259
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,840
Working a job.

1260
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,160
Let's talk about how fucking gay it is to have a job.

1261
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,960
Let's talk about how gay it is to fucking.

1262
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,720
We should have an entire episode about that.

1263
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,000
I've woken up.

1264
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,440
I've woken up for my stupid.

1265
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,760
I have a big news for everyone.

1266
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,240
That I'm.

1267
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,040
Make news change.

1268
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,080
I already know this.

1269
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,400
Yeah, I got a fucking job.

1270
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,120
Oh, right.

1271
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,240
Oh, no.

1272
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,280
I can imagine it.

1273
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:47,680
I know.

1274
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:48,640
I know.

1275
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,640
What a nightmare.

1276
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,040
Oh.

1277
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,920
That he's betrayed us all.

1278
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,560
Life is over.

1279
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Well, do you want to talk about what it is?

1280
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,120
The neat life continues because it's a work from home thing.

1281
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,880
I'm basically just answering calls.

1282
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,640
And the reason why I did it.

1283
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,760
OK, I used to do online tutoring.

1284
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,480
And I would just be hanging out on this tutoring website

1285
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,000
waiting for notifications come up that people needed help

1286
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,520
with math problems.

1287
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
And then I would go and walk them through a math problem.

1288
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,320
And I would just have that open while I was working on stuff.

1289
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,120
And also the physics, right?

1290
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,400
So I would kind of split my attention between

1291
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,080
doing my art and doing my job.

1292
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,680
So I got this job in the hopes that I can kind of do that

1293
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,400
and just be like drawing while I'm waiting for calls

1294
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,000
and then take a call and do a whole thing

1295
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,640
and then go back to doing my shit.

1296
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,160
In the hopes that I can have money

1297
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,800
but also be working at the same time.

1298
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,760
But time will tell.

1299
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,880
Time will tell if that pans out.

1300
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,440
Yeah, but I'm not just asking you about physics.

1301
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,520
Why nothing can go faster than light?

1302
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,400
And your answers sounded like a shitty sci-fi novel.

1303
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,400
Wait, are you?

1304
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,520
When?

1305
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,120
It's like a last year or something.

1306
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:55,680
We just were real.

1307
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,920
Because real physics is bizarre.

1308
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,840
Real physics is a shitty sci-fi novel.

1309
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,880
I know, right?

1310
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,240
Isn't that fucking weird?

1311
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,000
That's God, man.

1312
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,560
There he is.

1313
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,600
There he is right there, my dude.

1314
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,280
How is your production of the only thing

1315
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,480
that really matters?

1316
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,360
Endless war.

1317
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,800
Beast capades.

1318
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,320
No, endless war.

1319
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,040
Endless war.

1320
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,920
I was in training this past week.

1321
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,080
And in training, I was like tuning out

1322
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,760
and just trying my best to throw together some shitty makeshift code

1323
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,440
out of cracks like source code.

1324
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,200
Endless war will continue forever.

1325
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,640
Endless war is the new hotness.

1326
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,880
What is this, an episode of the Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers?

1327
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,080
Get the fuck out of here, guys.

1328
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,280
God, the people wish.

1329
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,720
The people wish, they.

1330
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,040
The people wish.

1331
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,520
They will.

1332
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,600
I have banned Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers.

1333
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,280
Slime will flow forever.

1334
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,160
I have today achieved the dream, the impossible dream.

1335
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,400
I now command two mega slime.

1336
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,520
Whoa.

1337
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,600
Compared to your pitiful one, Munchy.

1338
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1339
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,640
The Rowdy's will fucking rise.

1340
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,800
We were catching up to you right and quick.

1341
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,320
And this, and that was like, that was only like three people.

1342
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,640
Those are only three training sessions that I had

1343
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,720
to destroy your pitiful army.

1344
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,080
They have no resolve.

1345
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,200
Once I put my immense wit and intellect onto the scene,

1346
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,320
and I command my troops, like they've been desperately asking me to,

1347
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,320
then I will achieve victory in no less than 30 minutes.

1348
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,040
I guarantee.

1349
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,520
Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers are banned from now on forever on the PCP.

1350
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,080
It's over.

1351
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,440
Listen, listen.

1352
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,720
All I'm saying is that not yet, this is just a stopgap measure

1353
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,640
from when I can make my full-time job developing Endless War,

1354
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,800
by which I mean thinking of things to do with Endless War,

1355
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,760
trying to do it, failing, and then asking Crack to do it for me.

1356
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,720
Endless War, that's your job.

1357
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,360
Who are you?

1358
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,320
Donald Trump?

1359
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:46,800
Syria?

1360
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,760
Am I right or wrong?

1361
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,240
Yeah!

1362
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,120
There's each other on the back.

1363
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,520
Got him.

1364
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,360
The actual serious question is, of course,

1365
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,640
like I assume you plan to still do comics and stuff.

1366
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,720
Yeah, yeah, that's the whole point.

1367
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,520
I'm going to be like, my goal is that I can make money

1368
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,760
while I like do art kind of intermittently, you know?

1369
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
Okay, now we're talking about job shit.

1370
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,040
You know, trying to shape my life in such a way

1371
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,520
that I can get my shit done without, you know,

1372
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,720
without neglecting, you know, my stuff.

1373
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,120
You're packed.

1374
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,440
Ladies and gentlemen, there you have it right there.

1375
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
Ben taking responsibility for his life,

1376
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,400
recognizing he has to make a change, I'm assuming,

1377
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,800
in order to reach some financial goal or whatever,

1378
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,480
and here he is doing it, all right?

1379
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,080
So I don't want to hear no fucking excuses.

1380
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,440
If even Ben can do it, anybody can do it.

1381
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,280
He needed the second Oculus Rift.

1382
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,400
One wasn't enough.

1383
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,240
Any one for each eye.

1384
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
HTC Vive Saint.

1385
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,400
Now that would be the one for the modern age.

1386
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,240
Guys, that's too advanced.

1387
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,440
Let me ask you this.

1388
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,200
It's time to Max Revive.

1389
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,240
It's me.

1390
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,560
Oh, yes.

1391
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,280
It's me, Munchy, tripping of the plebs,

1392
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,600
the Procrastinator Senate we had before us.

1393
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,160
Everyone wants to hear stories.

1394
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,440
People want to see the personal raw experiences

1395
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,560
about the stories that we've had doing our selective jobs.

1396
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,880
And we want to hear Nate groan about,

1397
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,080
I don't know, furniture or some shit.

1398
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,040
We don't even know about that.

1399
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,080
I'm talking about people right now.

1400
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,560
Wait a second.

1401
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,400
Why have we been talking about philosophy and governments?

1402
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,360
None of that matters.

1403
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,000
Let's get into where are the memes?

1404
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,760
We need the memes.

1405
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,240
He's right.

1406
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,320
Was Davoo saying something there?

1407
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,760
Nate, I was just thinking, you already

1408
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,520
have such a messianic complex.

1409
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,640
Does that have anything to do with making furniture out of wood,

1410
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,080
being like a carpenter or some shit?

1411
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,920
Well, you know, it's like, so I guess the job I was referring to there

1412
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,840
was, like I said before, working at Pier 1,

1413
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,600
worked at Pier 1 for a year or two.

1414
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,960
My job was, I did some of that up front,

1415
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,240
just people buying shit.

1416
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:54,560
Your job was basically like push sales of all kinds of bullshit.

1417
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,520
But what I much prefer to do, my favorite thing to do there,

1418
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,040
which was sort of my main responsibility was,

1419
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,480
Pier 1 is to some degree a furniture store.

1420
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,440
So we would get these big boxes of furniture in,

1421
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,640
and it would be my job.

1422
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,720
And then there were other guys who would come in.

1423
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,240
It was all women who worked there.

1424
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,160
But then the guys who worked there were the ones

1425
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,600
who would build the furniture, just because we were bigger, I guess.

1426
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,720
And so I would just sit in the back.

1427
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,000
I would open up box after box after box and assemble,

1428
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,400
like Ikea style, extremely simple furniture pieces to put together.

1429
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,760
And I would sit there, and I would commune with God,

1430
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,400
and my halo would appear, and I would invent the table.

1431
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,960
I am Jesus, is what I'm saying.

1432
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,240
Guys, remember in fucking Passion of the Christ at the beginning

1433
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,280
when Jesus literally invents the long legged table?

1434
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:47,840
Yes.

1435
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,480
Is that true?

1436
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,440
Did that happen in that movie?

1437
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,440
It starts out, someone is like...

1438
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,400
Gibson.

1439
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,760
Someone is like, wow, what is this weird table you're making, Jesus?

1440
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,080
He's like, oh, see, it's got long legs, but you sit at taller chairs.

1441
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,160
And the guy's like, oh, it'll never catch on.

1442
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,040
Did I talk with you guys, I don't think I did.

1443
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,560
Just so happened a week ago, I was just sitting in the back of the car,

1444
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,680
I think, yeah, with my parents, this was a few weeks ago,

1445
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,480
my parents are in the car, like my sister's in the car,

1446
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,960
and I'm just sort of sitting in the back seat,

1447
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,560
and just randomly accessing memories in my brain.

1448
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,520
And I remember having seen the beginning of the Passion of the Christ,

1449
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,520
which I hadn't seen since I was like a kid.

1450
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,480
So I didn't really, at the time I took that scene for granted,

1451
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,400
but now I'm like, what the fuck?

1452
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,160
It's like one of those like time travel movies

1453
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,320
where like someone bumps into Ben Franklin, you know,

1454
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,200
and it's like, oh man, you know, you should put a key in a bottle or some shit.

1455
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,600
But it's like a Jesus movie, you know?

1456
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,720
Like, it's a fucking Jesus movie where like,

1457
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,280
it's not only that he died for our sins,

1458
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,920
but he also invented the long-legged table.

1459
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,600
Is there any evidence that there is a connection there?

1460
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,160
That Jesus didn't invent the long-legged table.

1461
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,560
Yeah, it's not the fuck up haters, I want to hear it.

1462
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,120
We just seem to sit a little bit closer to heaven,

1463
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,920
and Jesus was there.

1464
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,720
There you go!

1465
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,520
Yeah!

1466
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,800
Woo-hoo!

1467
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,240
Oh, god damn.

1468
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,520
So guys, what do you say?

1469
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,680
Radcon 4, we have the last supper.

1470
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,280
We make long-legged tables!

1471
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,280
We invent the even longer-legged table.

1472
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,080
So we can get closer to Jesus!

1473
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:16,880
Yes!

1474
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,400
It's the PCP, the Pro Carpenters podcast.

1475
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,000
Whoa, soon, soon.

1476
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,960
The Pro Christenators podcast.

1477
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,000
I don't personally have much more to say about that job,

1478
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,440
but that was the job that I worked while I was making

1479
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,840
Gern-Loggin video, part one and part two.

1480
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,880
So like, I would buy day, I'd be fucking building furniture

1481
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,800
and selling people shit at Pier 1,

1482
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,000
and I'd come home, and I would work on-

1483
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,600
And you'd be building mines.

1484
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,880
I'd be mining.

1485
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,480
What fucking motivates you?

1486
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,840
What is it inside of you that makes you go building furniture?

1487
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,880
Before you answer that, I want to say to Javu,

1488
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,680
Radcon 4, Jesus lecture,

1489
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,560
where you explain the history and life of Jesus Christ.

1490
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,040
I don't know.

1491
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,440
I think I probably could have my dad do that lecture, but...

1492
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:02,880
Yeah, okay.

1493
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,160
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1494
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,680
Wait, what's the fire that's lit under your ass that makes you go,

1495
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,400
I'm gonna make this whole video on this shitty laptop?

1496
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,880
You know what it is?

1497
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,520
It's fear.

1498
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,320
For me, it's fear.

1499
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,600
A lot of things are motivated by fear,

1500
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,960
a lot of things are motivated by fear,

1501
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,160
and there's probably some degree of that,

1502
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,760
like fear of like being unworthy in life,

1503
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,520
and like allowing myself to...

1504
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,880
Fear of looking back and regretting all the things you didn't do.

1505
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:29,920
Yeah.

1506
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,880
That's what motivates me.

1507
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,760
That's a fair, it's a fair thing.

1508
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,200
It's a fair thing, and I think that's kind of helpful.

1509
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,080
I don't fear that, I'm living that.

1510
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,200
That's my life.

1511
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,080
Well, there you go.

1512
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,360
I guess, like, I don't know,

1513
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,920
a lot of it really does come from, like,

1514
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,560
when I was growing up, I just felt shitty about myself,

1515
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,320
and just like I wasn't doing it.

1516
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,440
Like, I don't know, like it really,

1517
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,440
I know it's weird as I come back to a lot,

1518
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,160
but a lot of it comes back to, I think, my issues with women,

1519
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,160
and like how I felt like such a failure,

1520
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,960
and that I was completely failing when all my friends were like,

1521
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,000
superior to me, and then I realized I didn't want to be,

1522
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,920
nor did I have to be inferior anymore.

1523
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,320
Like, I could fix myself, and then I did.

1524
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,000
And then once I did that, I was like,

1525
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,880
well, let's keep this train rolling, I think.

1526
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,560
Like, and like, I don't want to take all credit.

1527
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,240
Like, Ben is the one who suggested

1528
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,320
we even make videos in the first place.

1529
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,120
So he's the one who like turned me on to even the possibility

1530
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,080
of doing this kind of stuff.

1531
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,640
Nailed it.

1532
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,280
It was good, I'm sure glad it happened.

1533
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,800
And then, just when I was in it,

1534
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,040
I discovered how much I enjoyed doing it,

1535
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,400
and then, I don't know, man.

1536
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,040
Like, it's like that particular video series or whatever.

1537
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,240
I just really liked that show.

1538
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,480
I was mad that people were explaining it poorly,

1539
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,480
and I like wanted to correct the record.

1540
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,480
But the real thing at the root of it.

1541
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,640
That particular show whose name must not be mentioned.

1542
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,440
Indeed, indeed.

1543
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,880
The Bolton Mortyve anime.

1544
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:48,960
That's what they call it.

1545
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,480
I guess I just really have things I want to achieve in life.

1546
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,840
Like, these days, I spend a pretty large amount of time

1547
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,880
thinking about how I admire Cenk Juger of the Young Turks.

1548
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,160
And I know that's a weird guy to pick out of a hat.

1549
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,320
But apart from the political issues I strongly disagree with him on,

1550
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,440
I look at this guy who was some fat, virgin, 25-year-old asshole

1551
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,600
who was a super political nerd.

1552
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:22,480
But now, he's got a huge network and a huge successful business

1553
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,400
where he works with all these fascinating people.

1554
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,080
He gets to meet all these amazing people

1555
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,680
and do all these cool things.

1556
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,200
He's not in as good of shape as he could be,

1557
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,080
so I'm gonna be working on that.

1558
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,880
But I really spend a lot of my time thinking about

1559
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,680
the male role models in my life I want to be like.

1560
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,000
And just try to live the way they would, I guess.

1561
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,880
I spend a lot of my time thinking about how the Penny Arcade guys live

1562
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,960
and how I want to live like them.

1563
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,760
And how I'm closer than I ever thought I would be.

1564
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,200
But there's still a long way to go.

1565
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,520
I mean, and I think about Red Letter Media too,

1566
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,760
just whatever, I know we talk about them a lot, but that's...

1567
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,640
The Penny Arcade guys, they fucking built an intellectual property

1568
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,560
that now has turned, and they expanded their operations

1569
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,960
and they turned into these media juggernauts.

1570
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,240
And what the end result of that is that now,

1571
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,720
they can spend like literally one hundred, well not one hundred,

1572
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,960
like so much of their time can be devoted to them

1573
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,040
just pursuing whatever they want to do.

1574
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,880
Like Tyco can just go and fucking make raps with that other guy.

1575
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,920
And that's fine, and they can fucking bullshit around

1576
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,440
with their stupid Boy Scouts in the Woods D&D setting

1577
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,360
that nobody cares about, but it's totally fine

1578
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,120
and I'm sure they have a great time with it.

1579
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,040
And that's how I want to live, just fucking around and doing whatever I want.

1580
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,120
These guys have added a ton of value to the world

1581
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,800
and now they get to enjoy the benefits.

1582
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,520
Like they fucking...

1583
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,520
The first thing I was real, like I was always aware of...

1584
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,520
What's the name of their comic?

1585
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,560
Penny Arcade, it's called Penny Arcade, right?

1586
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,600
It's just like you showed me, what was that show?

1587
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,400
Strip Search.

1588
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,120
Strip Search.

1589
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,320
Yeah, that's the kind of thing they can just do on a whim.

1590
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:02,000
And like if they hadn't spent like a decade or decades or whatever it was,

1591
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,520
like building up themselves to the point where they had the resources

1592
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,640
to like create that show that they probably never even imagined

1593
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,160
they'd be making like at the start.

1594
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,560
It's because they gave themselves power.

1595
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,320
I'll say it man, I'm in it for power.

1596
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,480
I want the power to control my life and do fun things I want to do.

1597
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,680
Yeah, exactly.

1598
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,600
Yeah, that's what I'm in for, that's what I'm doing.

1599
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:29,360
For me, it's really like a holy war in the name of proliferating the art and society,

1600
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,520
but mostly just art that I want there to be.

1601
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,320
But in my honor, right?

1602
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:39,360
Like when I hear, whenever I read up or watch YouTube videos

1603
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,400
about the fucking Roman warriors, I'm like, they have my mentality.

1604
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,000
Maybe we're the same number of skirts, probably.

1605
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,760
And like...

1606
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,800
You know what they called, if I remember correctly,

1607
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,400
the Roman soldiers, DeVu?

1608
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,840
Legionnaires.

1609
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,480
DeVu is Legion, is the joke I'm trying to make.

1610
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,520
Yes, I am.

1611
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,080
All right.

1612
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,960
Forgot about that one.

1613
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,600
Discrystallize to my mind.

1614
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,480
Where are the memes?

1615
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,760
Where have all the memes gone?

1616
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,560
I'm doing my best.

1617
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:06,080
They have, they have, no, they have, yeah, they've fallen into obscurity.

1618
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,680
They need to be max-revived.

1619
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,720
You know what they called, you know what they called Roman soldiers back in the day?

1620
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,160
They called them DeVus.

1621
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,760
That's what we're doing right now.

1622
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,320
Did you know?

1623
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,000
So fucking like, I mean, I think it's pretty appropriate.

1624
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,520
My fucking fiance, she's always complaining about her sister, whose name is Sam,

1625
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,840
and one of her ex-friends, whose name is Sam.

1626
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,000
And I'm like, you're in the Samnite Wars.

1627
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,920
The first and second Samnite Wars.

1628
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,760
And it's like, do you think of in any language that isn't Roman history?

1629
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,640
And I'm like, no.

1630
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,760
Wait, is that a real word?

1631
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,800
Samnite?

1632
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,320
Yeah, the fucking Romans kick the show of the Samnites.

1633
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,360
Oh, did the Samnites have jobs?

1634
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:50,560
Any fucking fucking antiquity history buffs laugh at that joke, you see?

1635
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:51,920
I'm sure they did.

1636
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,640
I mean, I'm sure they did.

1637
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:58,400
You have to cast a shitload of stupid miniature nets to get random people in the audience,

1638
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,200
you see.

1639
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,240
You know, the PCB has splintered into minuscule individualized memes for different groups

1640
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:04,720
to appreciate.

1641
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,280
Yeah, it's fucking literally going around.

1642
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,360
That's what we're going to press the groups for to toilet.

1643
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,000
Yes.

1644
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,200
Like the history buffs.

1645
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:09,840
Like the history buffs.

1646
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,520
Every audience member is sitting waiting.

1647
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,200
When will my memes come?

1648
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,000
Yeah.

1649
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,400
All right.

1650
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,680
I'm going to sit through all these.

1651
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,280
All these bargain memes.

1652
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,960
It's the Disney princess mentality.

1653
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,040
Like your group isn't real and doesn't really exist or no one gives a shit unless you have

1654
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,880
a Disney princess associated with your ethnic or religious group.

1655
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,840
That's how it works.

1656
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,480
That's how it works.

1657
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,240
We're never going to get into the Muslim Disney princess.

1658
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:30,800
I'm waiting.

1659
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:31,680
Well, there's Jasmine.

1660
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,320
There's Jasmine.

1661
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:32,480
Yeah.

1662
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,360
She's not.

1663
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,480
She's not a good Christian wife.

1664
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,480
Look at what she's wearing, Nate.

1665
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:38,880
Come on.

1666
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,640
Well, okay, goddamn.

1667
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,760
Back to the topic here.

1668
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,800
This mentality in myself was finally I understood.

1669
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,240
Jasmine is Islamic.

1670
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,080
That's the topic of the podcast.

1671
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,040
Okay, I'm sorry.

1672
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,920
I'm sorry.

1673
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,960
We could debate whether or not Jasmine is a Muslim for ages.

1674
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,960
We could never reach a consensus.

1675
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,680
Jasmine versus Islam, the new bonus episode.

1676
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:58,880
That's a good one.

1677
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,520
That's a good one.

1678
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,560
When Hippo was saying in the chat earlier that, you know,

1679
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,400
when I really think about it, creating a cult around myself like developing hardcore fans

1680
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,160
is really just exactly the same as getting the algorithms.

1681
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,280
You're basically just doing a humiliating rain dance

1682
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:23,520
and tooling your content and persona to get a certain specific result.

1683
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,680
Neither one of them is doing what you want to do as an artist.

1684
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:28,000
Right?

1685
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,440
It's kind of the way he was putting it.

1686
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:34,320
But you get, if you've got a following that gives you power

1687
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,880
and having power lets you do the things that you want to do.

1688
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:42,160
And doing what you want will lead to success

1689
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,960
if you just do it consistently and you work hard.

1690
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,360
Guys, can I, I'm sorry, I'm sorry to cut in.

1691
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,840
Can I just bring you a brief moment of joy

1692
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,680
that just happened in real time in my life while I was on this podcast?

1693
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,800
I get a message from Michelle that who just says-

1694
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,080
Thanks, a father-in-law.

1695
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,920
Let's go to the board.

1696
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,640
It's just that she says, someone, she's at work right now.

1697
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,160
I picked her up yesterday.

1698
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,640
She just sent me by saying, hey, Nate, just thought you should know.

1699
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,480
Someone just asked me, hey, Michelle,

1700
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,360
were you here with the big muscular bodybuilder last night?

1701
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,920
And they literally asked if I was a bodybuilder.

1702
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,800
I know I don't deserve it, but it makes me feel good, okay?

1703
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,360
Fuck off.

1704
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,080
All right, I'm sorry.

1705
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:24,160
Nate, I really like this idea of Nate having a kid.

1706
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,560
And the moment I thought of Nate having a kid,

1707
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,000
I was reminded of this YouTube Barats and Barretta skit

1708
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,440
where there's this guy who's training his year and a half old daughter

1709
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,560
to be a world-class Olympian and giving her weights

1710
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,600
and throwing her all around.

1711
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,040
That's what I will do with all my children.

1712
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:39,600
That sounds like Nate.

1713
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,640
That's what I will do.

1714
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:40,960
Yes.

1715
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,680
No, I'll do it.

1716
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,800
I will show you that score.

1717
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,880
You played that explicitly, the horrific regimen you have planned out.

1718
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,040
To make sure your kids can be all they can be.

1719
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,640
Well, listen, Ben, exactly as you said, delay gratification.

1720
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,760
I will delay all gratification for my children until they are 18.

1721
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,320
They will not know an ounce of happiness or joy in their life

1722
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,240
until they reach the age of 18.

1723
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,520
My children will have the ultimate coom when they leave the nest

1724
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,720
and they realize they are so much better than all these scum out there

1725
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,240
in the fucking world who did not wear fucking training masks

1726
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,640
and weights for this time they were one fucking day old.

1727
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,240
They'll know no pleasure until they rip the still beating heart

1728
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,760
from your enemy's breasts.

1729
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,240
That's right.

1730
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:20,960
A.K. me.

1731
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,160
I will be their adversary.

1732
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,120
The joy and rage and the soul of weird utilitarianism.

1733
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,200
When they conquer me, they go to be transcended.

1734
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,440
That's the end goal.

1735
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,240
That's the end goal.

1736
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,280
Every weird utilitarianism is doomed to be killed by his own children.

1737
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,600
Who lives in permanent antagonism with.

1738
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,120
That would be the final challenge.

1739
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,600
The day they reach 18, you'll stand in front of the door

1740
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,600
and you'll have your back turned to them

1741
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,960
and you'll slowly turn around and be like,

1742
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,640
your final challenge is to defeat me in hand to hand combat.

1743
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,480
And they'll be like, what, dad?

1744
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,160
And meanwhile, while they're stuttering,

1745
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,880
you make your first move and stab your son through his heart.

1746
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,040
You should have acted sooner.

1747
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,760
You slow pussy, too fucking slow.

1748
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,040
Luckily, I've got several clones of you lined up in 2016

1749
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,480
where you fucking failed.

1750
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,880
Number 27, get the fuck dead.

1751
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,240
That's what I'll say.

1752
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,520
That's what I'll say.

1753
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,080
It'll be great.

1754
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,880
You'll say, get in the ground, you fucking nigger.

1755
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,080
There, that's what it'll be.

1756
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:10,800
That's what it'll be.

1757
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,720
Because this is my wife's son, just to clarify.

1758
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,840
Um, you know.

1759
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,120
This is not yet.

1760
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:15,840
That's what it is.

1761
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,960
That's what it is.

1762
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,840
All right.

1763
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,520
Where were, well, jobs, right?

1764
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,640
Yeah, I was talking to you.

1765
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,600
My wife's full-time job is to stay at home, dad,

1766
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,560
to my wife's son.

1767
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,640
Is my full-time job is what I'm doing every day.

1768
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,240
Please don't bully me.

1769
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,200
This is a real job.

1770
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,080
Someone has to do it.

1771
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,200
God damn it, I deserve respect.

1772
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:33,920
I'm a human being.

1773
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,040
That's it.

1774
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:35,840
Someone has to do it.

1775
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,080
We all know, we all know that Tarone can't do it.

1776
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,520
We, yeah, I just got to take up,

1777
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,400
I just got to take up the main tool.

1778
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,120
Yeah.

1779
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:41,840
Yeah, that's right.

1780
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,120
Ben, you've done jobs before.

1781
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,640
You were just talking about jobs.

1782
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:44,960
Yeah.

1783
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,360
Should I list them?

1784
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,080
Yes.

1785
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:48,880
Yeah, that sounds fun.

1786
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,680
Let's all list our jobs.

1787
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,720
Okay, let's list our jobs.

1788
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,200
I like that.

1789
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:51,760
Well, let's see.

1790
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,720
When I was in high school,

1791
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,120
I worked at Mrs. Fields Cookies in the mall.

1792
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:56,800
Yeah, yeah.

1793
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,520
I worked.

1794
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,200
You drew fancy designs on them.

1795
01:12:59,200 --> 01:12:59,760
I remember that.

1796
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,360
Yeah, it was really fun, actually.

1797
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,520
It was like way fun when I had to decorate cakes.

1798
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,120
I was a counselor at Astro Camp for like six months there.

1799
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,800
I worked at, I was a food runner.

1800
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,960
After that was over, I was a food runner

1801
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,400
at this restaurant called the Chateau

1802
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,640
that actually we just went to when we were in Boston.

1803
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,840
Oh yeah, it was nice.

1804
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,360
Yeah, yeah, I worked at that restaurant.

1805
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,520
And I actually, this was like eight years ago

1806
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,720
or like seven years ago.

1807
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,520
And I saw people there that I barely recognized

1808
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,320
out of the corner of my mind.

1809
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,600
I was like, oh my God, they're still here.

1810
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,640
Oh no.

1811
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,400
They escaped, but they're still here.

1812
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,960
So that was harrowing.

1813
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,600
God, what the fuck?

1814
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:37,840
I don't know.

1815
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,120
I was a, I don't know.

1816
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,640
I had a bunch of shitty little jobs.

1817
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,680
Fucking Poland, fucking Poland, job.

1818
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,240
I was like a, I did like document editing

1819
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,040
for some company.

1820
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:45,840
I was just like editing,

1821
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,760
that I would, I did that from home for the most.

1822
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,040
I had a cubicle in an office,

1823
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,400
but I almost never went to it.

1824
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,360
I mostly just worked it from home.

1825
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,320
They would send me assignments,

1826
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,760
I would do them, send it back,

1827
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,960
but a bing, but a boom.

1828
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,880
I was like sort of an engineer,

1829
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,400
but mostly I just like,

1830
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,920
mostly I just like took readings

1831
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,440
off of an electron microscope

1832
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:05,920
at this place called Integris in Bilarica,

1833
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,800
Bilarica, whatever.

1834
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,400
I never learned how to say the town's name.

1835
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,520
And I think there's more.

1836
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:11,920
Oh, I was.

1837
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,480
The Poland one.

1838
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,600
What about Poland?

1839
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,240
Oh yeah, yeah.

1840
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:14,960
And then I taught,

1841
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,240
I taught physics to, to Arab kids in Poland.

1842
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,480
Several months.

1843
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,640
Yes.

1844
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:22,720
Nice, nice.

1845
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,680
I think that's a pretty exhaustive list of my jobs.

1846
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,840
Ben, the real mental powerhouse behind 9-11,

1847
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,040
you can thank him for its success.

1848
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:31,280
Yeah.

1849
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,000
This was post 9-11.

1850
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:34,960
Of course.

1851
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,840
Oh, okay.

1852
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,240
They were all in very high spirits.

1853
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,240
I can't imagine what it must have been like

1854
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,480
to be alive during 9-11

1855
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,440
and like being able to like,

1856
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,000
like perceive it as being true.

1857
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,960
That's incredible.

1858
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,840
Yeah, I would say that for me is the dividing line

1859
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,760
between like millennials and then millennial 2.0s.

1860
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,320
If you don't remember distinctly 9-11 happening,

1861
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:58,880
then you're.

1862
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,920
I'll tell you right now, Munchie,

1863
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,040
you missed a hell of a party.

1864
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,000
You missed a hell of a good time.

1865
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,320
I know, I know.

1866
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,360
I wish I had been there.

1867
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,800
I was, I was just in the plane.

1868
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,200
I was having too, I was dead when I go to attend to.

1869
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,960
Hey, I'll just run through my jobs real fast

1870
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,080
because we're all doing it.

1871
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,920
My first job was I worked for our next door neighbor Ralph

1872
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,760
and I worked, like he had like a big party,

1873
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,360
like he had a big fucking bit of land

1874
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,560
in front of his house.

1875
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,760
Or like he would hold like events.

1876
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,280
So people would like have weddings there

1877
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,320
and they'd like do stuff like that.

1878
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,800
I worked there as like a caterer

1879
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,320
and just like a guy who would stand around

1880
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,960
and like watch and like make sure and clean up stuff.

1881
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,720
And I worked there for like a couple months.

1882
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,840
That was on and off.

1883
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,480
I got a job at Papa Gino's Pizzeria.

1884
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:40,720
That's the good shit.

1885
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,760
That's my favorite kind of pizza.

1886
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,320
To this day.

1887
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,640
So in your dad's man, that's pretty.

1888
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,080
Oh yeah, there will be a stealing your dad on Papa Gino's.

1889
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:48,720
I'm very excited.

1890
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,840
I want to watch that.

1891
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,760
I want to know, I want to know an in-depth review

1892
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,080
of this Papa Gino's pizza, which I'm sure you will do.

1893
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,360
Oh, we get deeper in depth than you have ever

1894
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,320
dwelled before.

1895
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,440
Let me see.

1896
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,560
In, I think that was the last job I did before college.

1897
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,480
In college, I worked as a librarian

1898
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,720
at our award-winning school library

1899
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,640
at the College of New Jersey where I went.

1900
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,000
That's my alma mater.

1901
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,600
Also while I was working there,

1902
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,760
I got like a small little gig

1903
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,040
to like make a program for a guy that he paid me for.

1904
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,560
I just didn't do it though.

1905
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,800
That's really the long and short of it.

1906
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,160
What was the program supposed to be?

1907
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,680
You know, I can't even remember what the point of it was,

1908
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,640
but like I basically, this is my first quote-unquote job

1909
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,680
as a programmer.

1910
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,840
The guy, like I met him through my job at the library.

1911
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,480
He just was like, hey, I want to like this thing to do this.

1912
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,240
And we had a couple meetings

1913
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,600
and then like a couple months passed

1914
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,280
when I was supposed to be working on it.

1915
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,520
And I just presented him like the fuck all that I'd done.

1916
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,840
He was like, wow, this is like terrible.

1917
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,520
This is not, you did not do the work.

1918
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,120
And I'm just like, no, I did a good job.

1919
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,640
I'm really good.

1920
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,800
I deeply ashamed of it to this day.

1921
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,120
Beyond that, I think after college,

1922
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,240
I just got a job at,

1923
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,840
I worked at a pizza place for a little while,

1924
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,360
making some shitty ass pizzas for this like mom and pop place.

1925
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,640
They were, they were a,

1926
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,800
Hoptic Christian Egyptians.

1927
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,280
They were cool.

1928
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,640
They loved Jesus.

1929
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,200
They loved-

1930
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:09,920
I'm the only one who thinks Hoptic is.

1931
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,120
That might be the wrong word.

1932
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:13,360
Whatever.

1933
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,520
They were just like super Christ-faggy Egyptians.

1934
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,040
They had haptic technology.

1935
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,640
They didn't have a brain uncontrollably.

1936
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,520
Yeah, like touch.

1937
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,960
I would feel them and they would, you know,

1938
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,560
respond to my touch in real time.

1939
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,040
That's not the pizza's homemade.

1940
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,240
I asked the man to tell me the secret recipe for his secret sauce

1941
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,760
and he would not tell me.

1942
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,560
He would not tell me.

1943
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,840
He started to unbuckle his pants.

1944
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,680
And you're like, actually, I don't need to know that bad.

1945
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,280
Yeah, that's how it went.

1946
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,080
So I worked there.

1947
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,400
Then I worked at Best Buy for like a year or two.

1948
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,040
That was okay.

1949
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,840
I had some amazing fucking stories

1950
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,560
about the things that happened in that fucking place.

1951
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,280
That's where I met the guy who I had literally the moment

1952
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,000
that made me realize all weed was bad and evil forever at that job.

1953
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,560
I was just around these people who were just big weed guys

1954
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,960
and recognized I never wanted to be around them ever again

1955
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,840
or anyone like them.

1956
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:11,040
ParkourDude91 was such an unbelievable good experience for me

1957
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,440
to see in real time this person hopped up

1958
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,520
on weed doing bad things.

1959
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,520
It doesn't matter that it was all fake and not real.

1960
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,720
That doesn't matter.

1961
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:21,600
That's not a problem.

1962
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,120
It's your only reason to imagine it.

1963
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,160
As long as...

1964
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,600
It instilled in me the knowledge, the knowledge,

1965
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,680
the objective true fact that weed makes you retarded.

1966
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,680
And I'm so stretched this day.

1967
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,000
Thank you so fucking much, ParkourDude.

1968
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,600
You've done a real solid for me.

1969
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:42,720
You saved one from that green hell known as the M life.

1970
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,040
That was one of the reasons why he wanted to do it.

1971
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,040
Was to portray gamer weed culture as terrible.

1972
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,920
And in literal hopes to inspire people to not be the person he was presenting.

1973
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,200
Is he on record just saying that?

1974
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:55,760
Is that true?

1975
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,960
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1976
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,720
Dude, right after we recorded that lecture,

1977
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,800
Munchie took us upstairs and showed us the video

1978
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,640
where he reveals himself as a fake.

1979
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,440
And then he goes on his diatribe explaining his motivations.

1980
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,720
And I'm like, oh, ParkourDude's mission was born out of hatred and contempt.

1981
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,560
It wasn't just lighthearted poking fun at.

1982
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,280
He's like really seriously despises the kind of thing he was parodying.

1983
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,640
And he was just going full tilt propaganda against it.

1984
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,680
Holy shit.

1985
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,880
Nate, I feel like you would really like Yann Rinkowski.

1986
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,080
I mean, because he is, he's like, I feel like both him and Sam Hyde

1987
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,120
are like, like, like, like they moonlight in philosophy.

1988
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:40,160
But I think Yann is really like, Yann really has a principle that I really enjoy.

1989
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,000
And I try and do, but I'm not very good at it.

1990
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,400
And I need, I've been thinking about it and I want to do it more.

1991
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,400
Where your comedy is rooted in the things that you believe.

1992
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:55,520
And like your, your comedy is rooted in like, like how you want to perceive reality.

1993
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,880
That is 100% true.

1994
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,080
And I think about that a lot when I'm, when I'm trying to do stuff.

1995
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,400
Yeah.

1996
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,280
When I, I, I kind of think that comedy without that is just inherently less valuable.

1997
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:09,360
But, you know, whatever, I can just say just goof for the sake of a goof.

1998
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,280
Hey, let me just finish my last jobs here.

1999
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,120
All I did, I worked at peer one and now I got my current programming job.

2000
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:15,600
And that's it.

2001
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,640
So I'm, I'm, I'm done.

2002
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,280
I'm out.

2003
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,000
It's all my jobs.

2004
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,120
Um, um, David, you, you, you clone some Wondos, right?

2005
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:23,920
What?

2006
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,560
Yeah, that's all I've done.

2007
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,000
I've never actually had a real job.

2008
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,680
I just fucking worked with my dad on cleaning windows and cleaning out gutters.

2009
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:32,560
Yeah.

2010
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,080
Really interesting because looking back, I think I,

2011
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:43,040
the, the, the way in which I ran at YouTube clearly reflects that job because that job was

2012
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,200
totally unfulfilling, but like totally not stressful.

2013
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,200
Cause when it's just, you know, you, you're there and your fucking dad and your brother,

2014
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,720
it's not like you have to like put on a huge.

2015
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,360
When you're there and you're fucking your dad and your brother understood.

2016
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,080
I'm with you, dude.

2017
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:56,640
I'm with you.

2018
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,680
I only gotta be professional.

2019
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:01,760
I only gotta like be professional attitude when there's a fucking customer there.

2020
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,720
You know, that's fine.

2021
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,040
Yeah.

2022
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:03,280
Yeah.

2023
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,440
But it was, it was pretty low pressure, right?

2024
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,000
And it's a pretty easy job to do.

2025
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,400
Like the thing about the reason why my dad has a successful business doing that is that

2026
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,560
no one wants to clean the windows, which is why you can never get a consistent employee.

2027
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,920
Like, you know when you can never get a decent window cleaner,

2028
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,680
but if it's someone who's in your family, then they have to give a shit.

2029
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:29,200
Like it was weird watching like familial bonds for sweet actually do a good job,

2030
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,120
even though I openly didn't give a shit.

2031
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:36,640
The point is, despite being very like physically draining, it wasn't that draining.

2032
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,000
And it wasn't like emotionally or psychologically draining because

2033
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,280
you can just be like, oh, hey, I have 20 windows to clean right here.

2034
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,640
Pops into your buds, listens to entire podcasts.

2035
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,000
So it's pretty easy.

2036
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,880
So I had plenty of time to like think all day.

2037
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:56,880
So it was actually a pretty easy, a pretty great job to then transition into being an internet person.

2038
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,440
But also it took my very specific mentality of absolutely hating it.

2039
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,600
If I'm spending any time not doing what I want to do and thinking that I'm making something

2040
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,440
important that I actually give a shit about.

2041
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,760
If I spend any time not doing that, I want to die.

2042
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,000
So, you know, I feel you on that.

2043
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,960
But incidentally, speaking of family jobs, I totally forgot about this.

2044
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,200
I was the guy who filed my dad's paperwork for a long time.

2045
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,560
I totally forgot about it.

2046
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,920
But yeah, I remember filing dad's paperwork.

2047
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,520
Yeah, I actually kind of loved it because I get to watch Star Trek while I do it.

2048
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,960
And I did that all day.

2049
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,960
I would listen to podcasts while doing it.

2050
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,440
I hated doing it because I was like, man, I could be spending my time so much better

2051
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,440
because he would pay like $8 an hour.

2052
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,760
Yeah, my dad would do that kind of stuff too, even before he did that business.

2053
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,240
He'd be like, hey.

2054
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,800
Honestly, I would not have done it even though he was paying me.

2055
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,000
But like he kind of like insisted that we do it.

2056
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,240
Yeah, well, hey, we were living with his house rent-free.

2057
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,040
So yeah, yeah.

2058
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,560
I guess it was pretty good of him to pay anything.

2059
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:55,760
True.

2060
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,080
Tom.

2061
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,040
Okay, so my first job was in high school and I went to Papageno's just like Nate did.

2062
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,440
I worked there just to buy a computer because I didn't have.

2063
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,880
Tom, let's literally open a Papageno's franchise, just you and me.

2064
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,360
We should.

2065
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,280
We're old school employees.

2066
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:18,080
My mom and dad, their first job was both Sonic.

2067
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,560
They both worked at the Sonic restaurant as their first job.

2068
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,120
Oh, yeah?

2069
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,560
Is that how they met?

2070
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,760
No, they met each other like decades later or like 15 years later,

2071
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,640
but they still like that was that just coincidence, right?

2072
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,080
But they still worked at Sonic.

2073
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,040
No.

2074
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,000
All right.

2075
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,120
So sorry, Tom, didn't mean that.

2076
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:35,680
It's all good.

2077
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,520
Papageno's the first job.

2078
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:45,040
Then I went to college and I worked at the cafeteria at the school for a while making sandwiches.

2079
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,800
And then I also did like the desk thing like where you like sign people into like the dorms

2080
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,120
and stuff.

2081
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,080
I did that for a while.

2082
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,560
And then I got a job at Apple while I was in school.

2083
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,480
So I would go down the street to the mall and I'd work as the guy who like you talked to

2084
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,440
you about computers and shit.

2085
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,400
And I did that for like almost all the Apple geniuses.

2086
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,040
That's pretty cool.

2087
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,240
You were an Apple genius.

2088
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,160
I was like the specialist.

2089
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,920
That was the one who like sold you stuff.

2090
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,840
I wanted to be a genius, but they're like, you got to work your way up to that.

2091
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,640
But yeah, I did that.

2092
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:19,600
It was it's funny because like to this day, everything that I've done, like when I've gone

2093
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,960
in to talk to people about jobs, everyone's like floored that I work for Apple.

2094
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,000
They're like, what the fuck?

2095
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,560
Did you design the Galaxy S5?

2096
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,440
God, I wish.

2097
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,560
Dude, look at my iPhone.

2098
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,440
Was this you?

2099
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,640
Was this you, Tom?

2100
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,120
Just tell me.

2101
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:33,280
Yeah.

2102
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,960
When you see the jobs died, I go.

2103
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,840
Put it together.

2104
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,520
Yeah, that was me.

2105
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,080
Okay.

2106
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,560
So I did that.

2107
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,800
Then I worked during the summers at Handsome Air Force Base.

2108
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,560
My dad, we're not with him.

2109
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,440
I was like in a totally different building doing something completely unrelated.

2110
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,440
But I did that for a while.

2111
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,600
Then when I got out of school, I worked at Best Buy for the season.

2112
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,240
And it was.

2113
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,320
Hey, are we the same guy?

2114
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,040
Yes.

2115
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,720
We are the best and worst guy ever.

2116
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,600
That's the dynamic.

2117
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,120
This runs so deep.

2118
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,200
It's so deep, dude.

2119
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,280
We need to do our best guy, worst guy podcast.

2120
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:09,680
That'll be great.

2121
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:10,160
That's a great.

2122
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:10,480
That's a fun truth.

2123
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,760
Oh my God, literally.

2124
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,200
That should be what happens.

2125
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:13,600
I agree.

2126
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,640
The communists on the capitalist finally clash.

2127
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,360
Oh, no.

2128
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,640
Those two ideologies finally get compared to each other after all these years.

2129
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,320
I don't think the universe could handle it, but.

2130
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,160
Cold War II begins.

2131
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,040
By the way, oh, continue, Tom.

2132
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,000
I was just going to say after that, I went to Staples for a little bit and that sucked.

2133
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:40,400
Then I went to Whole Foods and I was like a sign maker.

2134
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,080
I did like graphic design and stuff there.

2135
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,280
And that was nice.

2136
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:43,760
I worked there.

2137
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,960
We got our legendary groceries for Radcon.

2138
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:55,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, the first, the first place that me and Tom went to.

2139
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,800
No, I don't think we went to Whole Foods.

2140
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,840
We went to Star Market, which is like the total opposite of Whole Foods.

2141
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,960
Whole Foods is like a high organic food place.

2142
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,960
And that was like the healthiest I'd ever been when I worked at Whole Foods.

2143
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,360
I had to do nothing but eat food there.

2144
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:17,440
But the only thing I got afforded to eat was Caesar salads because it was so expensive.

2145
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:23,680
So I ate nothing but Caesar salad for like a year and I lost a ton of weight and it was great.

2146
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,080
But I lost that job because I was like too...

2147
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:30,960
Retarded.

2148
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,000
Yeah, retarded.

2149
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,840
No, I was like, I was trying to do too much.

2150
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,120
Like I'd try and like solve problems and maybe like get fucked.

2151
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,840
And eventually we're just like, we're tired of you trying to solve problems.

2152
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,400
Get out here.

2153
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,280
We want to be shit.

2154
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,120
Uh, that sounds slightly like a simplification.

2155
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,320
You were, you were too...

2156
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,960
Maybe you overextended yourself and then got not enough done or something.

2157
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,520
No, like the problem was that like I would

2158
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,920
suggest ways of making things better.

2159
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,320
And they didn't want anybody to rock the boat, I guess.

2160
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:58,880
Oh.

2161
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,160
And we shoveled this, Tom?

2162
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,000
Whole Foods.

2163
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,720
I see.

2164
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,000
Trying to make things better.

2165
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,080
Like what if we had some fucking unhealthy things here so that people would actually power shit?

2166
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,480
Because I worked, I worked up, I didn't work on the floor.

2167
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,960
There was like an upstairs where they made all the signage and stuff.

2168
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,080
Because all the signs of Whole Foods are done by hand.

2169
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:20,400
So I'd have to like write, I had to like do a bunch of classes to learn how to do the Whole Foods

2170
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,200
handwritten font.

2171
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,280
There's like classes you had to take on how to do that.

2172
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,560
So I'd learn how to do that.

2173
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,840
And then like you just write these big signs and you have to like draw and cut out on like

2174
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,320
phone board and stuff like illustrations to like...

2175
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,200
They must be losing so much money by using that system.

2176
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,000
Absolutely.

2177
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,160
To train people to make a handwriting font.

2178
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,840
It's their goddamn branding though.

2179
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:38,960
They gots to do it.

2180
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:45,040
I love that they have this corporate fucking pipeline to artificially induce that homemade aesthetic.

2181
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,400
It's so fucking fake.

2182
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,880
Like do they like, hey we need to go and pick out the individual coffee beans,

2183
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:55,600
but first we need to put you in baggy shitty like overalls and then like make you look ethnic?

2184
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,080
Probably.

2185
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,720
Yeah, so that was dumb.

2186
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,120
But I was like, I was trying to like...

2187
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,240
We had these two computers to do all the work on.

2188
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:08,400
And one of them was like a really really old Power Mac G5 and it was a piece of shit.

2189
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,200
And they had files on both computers.

2190
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,160
So if you were...

2191
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,480
There were three people in the office including me.

2192
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,520
They would be on the computers.

2193
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,840
I'd be doing all the bitch work because I was the newest person.

2194
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,840
And if they needed to get a file off the other computer, they have to stop what they're doing,

2195
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,240
get off, go on the other computer, get the file and bring it over.

2196
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,000
And I was like, I can network these.

2197
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,160
Like give me some time and I can network them together.

2198
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,080
So you can access the files from each other's system so you don't have to keep stopping.

2199
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,040
And they like, give me like an hour to do it.

2200
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,000
I'm like, it's gonna take more than this.

2201
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,360
And they're like, well forget it, you suck.

2202
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:37,840
We hate you.

2203
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,120
And there's like just tons of like little things about how like the signs were made.

2204
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:45,680
They're like, we could do this faster, but they like refuse and eventually they're just like get out.

2205
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,960
So that's how I lost that job.

2206
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,080
Okay.

2207
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:48,640
Okay.

2208
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,240
And then I started doing Patreon for a while.

2209
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:53,120
Never try and fix the world ever, is the moral.

2210
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,640
That was the moral of the story.

2211
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,760
Never give up.

2212
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,560
Sometimes corporate systems can be too rigid and we clash with them.

2213
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,280
It's true, but never give up on fixing the world even if some people.

2214
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:07,920
If embargo and boycott whole foods, that is the moral of this message.

2215
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:14,960
And then the last job I had, I had a job for, I think a week doing at a racquetball office,

2216
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,560
doing like paperwork for them.

2217
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,200
And it was like the most dumb job in the world because I originally,

2218
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,120
one of my mom's friends told me about it because she works like a hiring agency

2219
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,120
who's trying to get people to fill the slot and I need a job.

2220
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,240
She's like, do this.

2221
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,360
It's work from home.

2222
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:33,440
It's like $15 an hour and you'll be doing like social media stuff,

2223
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,520
like getting your social media brand account set up.

2224
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,520
And I was like, oh yeah, I can do that in my sleep.

2225
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,160
Sure.

2226
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:41,680
So I like go through all these like ridiculous bullshit,

2227
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:43,920
like trying to talk to people to get the job signed up.

2228
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:49,120
And during that time, it changed from work from home to come into our office an hour away

2229
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,280
and from $15 to $10.

2230
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,040
So, and I was just like, I was already signed the paperwork at that point,

2231
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,120
but day before I went into work, they're like, by the way,

2232
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:01,680
you were only giving you a two thirds of what we said that the price was going to be.

2233
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,200
So I'd go in there and I just like, it's not social media branding anymore.

2234
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,760
They just want me to like do data entry.

2235
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,600
So the entire job was a lie.

2236
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,160
And I was like, okay, so I was there for a week and then a week,

2237
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:16,880
the next week, I got an email when I woke up before I was going to go into work saying,

2238
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,200
we actually decided we don't want anyone to have this position because it's too expensive.

2239
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:21,920
So you're fired.

2240
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:30,000
And it was, you know what, your stories about all this,

2241
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,840
everyone just seems to fuck you over all the time.

2242
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,760
And it reminds me of the opposite.

2243
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,320
Are you starting to understand why my life is awful?

2244
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:41,760
No, let's, and like next PCP episode, the PCP fucks over Tom.

2245
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,160
Then we kick him out and we take his money.

2246
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:47,120
I just remembered the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

2247
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,120
And it was when I got fired.

2248
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,080
Well, I didn't get fired.

2249
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:55,840
They just like stopped the hire, they just stopped paying me from that job where I was

2250
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,720
like doing document editing for whatever company.

2251
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,400
I did not know, I had no idea that this is how it worked,

2252
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,400
but you know, I did that job for maybe six months.

2253
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,840
This was like kind of during the TBAP days or maybe a little before.

2254
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:16,720
So it turned out afterwards that I didn't know about unemployment insurance,

2255
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:20,320
but apparently if you work like a real job or a real enough job,

2256
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,160
you know, they just bank a bunch of money with the government.

2257
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:27,920
And then if you lose the job under like the right circumstances,

2258
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:34,400
like if they lay you off or whatever, whatever, you just get more money,

2259
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,920
like even though you're not working.

2260
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,400
And so like for like several months or maybe like two months or more after that,

2261
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,080
I was getting like $200 a week in the mail.

2262
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,120
And I was like, or no, it was like $150 a week.

2263
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,680
And I was like, oh my God, it's, this is all like,

2264
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,640
like I was living in a shitty little side room of some guys apartment.

2265
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,480
I was like, I can basically live off this.

2266
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,920
Like I don't, I'm not working, but I can live and it's like America.

2267
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,480
And you know, that's that, that's that emotion, you know, that,

2268
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,200
and then I hatched a plan to live that way for the rest of my life.

2269
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,400
Right. Yeah.

2270
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,920
So it was this unfortunate series of events that led to your current mindset

2271
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,640
about lowering your standards to adjust to whatever,

2272
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:16,320
whatever you're currently being given out of the, out of the pity of people's hearts.

2273
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,840
It's funny, it's funny you mentioned that.

2274
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,120
That's the origin story.

2275
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:23,520
Like this job, the racket ball job was actually like amazing because like,

2276
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,800
what a racket am I right?

2277
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,480
It was, it was, it was incredible.

2278
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:30,400
Like I made negative money working for this job because,

2279
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,600
because of the driving or something.

2280
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,800
Because, because they, I had initially gone there to get a work from home

2281
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,240
because I didn't, my car was broken and I didn't have the money to fix it.

2282
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:44,560
So, so I got the job because there was supposed to be a work at home position.

2283
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,360
So then they said, well, it's actually a driving in position.

2284
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,480
So I had to get my car fixed, which was $600.

2285
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,800
And then I only got $150 where I was fired.

2286
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,840
So I made negative $450 working for this.

2287
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,800
Which was amazing.

2288
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:03,280
First of all, Nate, I can understand why you're so fucking utilitarian and

2289
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,040
objectivist sometimes when like, I hear people all the time go,

2290
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,640
Oh, it's a full stereotype that there's all these people who just wouldn't work at all

2291
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,360
if they didn't have to.

2292
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,920
But like your older brother kind of is like that.

2293
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,760
So I guess Ben did it, everyone.

2294
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,040
It's Ben mentality.

2295
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:17,200
I did it.

2296
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,000
You just like, you're one of these guys who doesn't want to have to work any harder.

2297
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,400
And if someone just gave you money, of course you'd take it, you know.

2298
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:24,960
Well, why not?

2299
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,520
Who wouldn't?

2300
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,480
Because you're not, I'll tell you why Ben.

2301
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:32,080
And it's because you will not have real power over your life.

2302
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,360
You'll always be dependent on people.

2303
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,080
And that's not fun.

2304
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,640
That's very stressful.

2305
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:40,240
Listen, the only thing that I want power for is to be able to do whatever I want.

2306
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,080
But what if they take it away one day?

2307
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:47,680
And if I have that, if I can have that, you know, without, you know, working for it,

2308
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:53,200
like, like if I can have that on like relatively little, you know, resources,

2309
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,840
then it like, what would more resources even gain me?

2310
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,960
Really, the only thing that the greater number of resources gain you,

2311
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,960
which I would understand if people didn't put as a priority,

2312
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,120
but it's just a bigger safety net if things go wrong or change.

2313
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,400
That's really what it comes down to.

2314
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,680
I like a big safety net.

2315
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,080
I do.

2316
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:08,560
I admit it.

2317
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,680
Sure, sure.

2318
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:10,160
That's all.

2319
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:15,680
It's just if I'm all, if I'm managing to do everything that I want with relatively little,

2320
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,040
you know, it's not, I don't have much motivation to strive for more.

2321
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,480
I have big goals for my life.

2322
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,600
Because I already, because in that situation, I've already achieved the goal.

2323
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,360
I, it is, it has come to my attention.

2324
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,480
But a safety net is true.

2325
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,600
And you know, I mean, it's not like I, you know,

2326
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,080
I put off a lot of responsibilities for a lot of time and like,

2327
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,680
I put off paying off my student loans for a long time and that was irresponsible.

2328
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:39,920
So.

2329
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:40,640
Sure, sure.

2330
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,720
I'm not, that was not the optimal solution.

2331
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:45,920
Well, there you go.

2332
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:46,400
That's great.

2333
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,280
I'm glad to hear that.

2334
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,920
I guys, I know it's off topic, but I just need to say,

2335
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,960
like that came into my life in real time.

2336
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,680
This little bundle of joy that just appeared right now.

2337
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,760
I need to share with you guys here today.

2338
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,200
This will be in the show notes.

2339
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,480
Oh, what's, what's this about?

2340
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:07,840
Just, just, just look and see who you see in this crowd shot of this My Little Pony episode.

2341
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,800
Just, just go through and tell me who you see.

2342
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,000
I see the Breaking Bad guy.

2343
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,040
I see Heisenberg.

2344
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:13,920
It's Rick and Morty.

2345
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:14,880
Yeah.

2346
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:15,440
Wait, this isn't it.

2347
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,200
Oh, there it is.

2348
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:17,840
There they are.

2349
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,640
This is not real.

2350
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,960
Well, I mean, they've already done Dr. Hooves.

2351
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,720
No, look at, look at, like, look at the pixels on Morty's eyebrow.

2352
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,160
It's real.

2353
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,440
How do we know this is real?

2354
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,160
Where's the confirmation?

2355
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,920
That looks, that looks fake to me.

2356
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,080
I saw it posted somewhere.

2357
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:32,720
Oh, is that Heisenberg?

2358
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:33,680
And I choose to believe it.

2359
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,280
Is that Heisenberg in the back?

2360
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:35,920
I think so.

2361
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:36,560
Probably.

2362
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,200
Disgusting.

2363
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,560
Okay, but hang on.

2364
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,240
His cutie mark is a pickle.

2365
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,920
Like would Rick's cutie mark really be?

2366
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:42,720
No, no, it's a test.

2367
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:43,360
It's not.

2368
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,680
It's a test too.

2369
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:44,640
Oh, oh, okay.

2370
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,760
My screen is fucked up.

2371
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:46,480
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

2372
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:46,720
Okay.

2373
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,320
The bottom looks like a pickle.

2374
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:49,840
Okay.

2375
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,480
All right.

2376
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,840
Uh, I don't, I don't know.

2377
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,120
I can't even speculate.

2378
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:53,760
Right, dude.

2379
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,280
Like Tom, whenever you talk about how people were just like,

2380
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,280
Hey, we, you know, that job we decided to give you,

2381
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,040
we decided to not give you that job.

2382
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,680
It reminded me of the inverse of this one window cleaning customer I had,

2383
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:10,000
which was like a fucking modern castle, but a house,

2384
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,640
which is to say a really big house that has lots of stone,

2385
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,080
like siding and shit.

2386
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,400
And I was just like, damn, this house is amazing.

2387
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,480
And my dad told me that he had talked with, you know,

2388
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,440
the customers and like had a conversation and like

2389
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,280
somewhere or another, how they made all this money came up.

2390
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,960
Cause these people were fucking young, like mid thirties, maybe early, no, no.

2391
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,960
I think like late twenties and with like, like some baby kids, right?

2392
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:34,560
So here's what it was.

2393
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:42,320
The guy, the husband, the dad, he's like a legal document writer thing or something.

2394
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:47,040
He like was doing negotiations for a thing regarding a casino.

2395
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:53,600
And basically his company had him write up a list of terms and agreements and

2396
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,480
usually they're going to like reject half of it and you're going to be negotiating for a while.

2397
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:01,520
But they just accepted all of their terms.

2398
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,320
I don't know exactly the cause and effect chain reaction here,

2399
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:08,480
but basically it just meant that they all made shit billion dollars of money.

2400
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,280
Right.

2401
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,640
And it's just like, wow.

2402
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:10,880
Yeah.

2403
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,080
That's like a total like out of nowhere windfall.

2404
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:14,640
Crazy.

2405
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,360
Right.

2406
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,960
And like the mom was saying that like it's crazy when I'm taking my kids to the grocery store

2407
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,280
and they basically want everything off the shelf.

2408
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:26,480
And I don't know what to do because I could buy everything on the shelf.

2409
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:26,800
Right.

2410
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,040
I'm like, damn bro.

2411
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:34,640
Damn.

2412
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:36,240
Yeah.

2413
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:40,000
It's just like, I feel damned when fucking how when like YouTubers are all like,

2414
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,880
I can't believe it.

2415
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,960
I have 500,000 subscribers.

2416
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,800
I never thought I'd have that many.

2417
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,240
Really?

2418
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:49,760
You actually got more subscribers than you imagined yourself having.

2419
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,000
Does anyone ever actually done that?

2420
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,800
Or am I just, I don't know.

2421
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,920
You know what I'm talking about guys?

2422
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:57,280
Yeah.

2423
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,280
Well, I suppose I'm lost.

2424
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:00,320
Yeah.

2425
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,640
I know.

2426
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:03,520
I'm gay.

2427
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,640
I haven't gone through my list.

2428
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,760
I haven't gone through my list.

2429
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,000
Yeah.

2430
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,720
Please, please.

2431
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,440
Yeah.

2432
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:14,080
As I said before, I am post job.

2433
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:20,080
The only jobs I have have been like a back room deals.

2434
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,960
Like like no like official salary or you know,

2435
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:27,360
you know, what's the word like regular earnings.

2436
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,400
You know, I did not have like a schedule or anything.

2437
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:36,800
I would just do odd jobs throughout society and mostly commissions on the internet.

2438
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,320
So I am post.

2439
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:39,760
What's that again?

2440
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,920
It's called the gig economy, right?

2441
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,240
Right.

2442
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:42,960
Yeah, that's right.

2443
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:43,600
That's right.

2444
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,520
I am post job.

2445
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:53,040
I have lived my entire life, including now where I guess you could say that the PCP is a job,

2446
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,200
but like it's more fluid.

2447
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:56,000
It's more fluid.

2448
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
It's entirely like individual.

2449
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,760
Like it's basically commission based more or less for everyone, including me.

2450
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,200
Yeah.

2451
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:10,240
So on the only jobs, like if I like the main thing that I've done with my life,

2452
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:15,760
like the main salary earner, I would say is probably commissions followed by the PCP

2453
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,840
in terms of how much I've made.

2454
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,280
You're also a lawn mower, ain't you?

2455
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,200
Well, I used to.

2456
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,800
I don't really do that as much anymore, but that's what I'm saying.

2457
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,920
I remember you saying that that's how you paid for your flight to Radcon too,

2458
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,440
if I remember correctly.

2459
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,920
Well, it was mostly commissions, but like.

2460
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,600
Okay, no shade on it obviously.

2461
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,240
I think it's cool.

2462
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,000
No, no, no, no, no.

2463
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,600
I know that it's cool.

2464
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:39,680
That's why I say what I mean, like do odd jobs through society,

2465
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:43,840
where I'll just like go a neighbor or someone who just needs me to do something for them.

2466
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,520
Who just needs me to perform some miscellaneous sexual act?

2467
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,160
I understood.

2468
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:48,960
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

2469
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,680
Yeah, okay.

2470
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:54,160
I don't like to do that much anymore because I don't, like most of the people who would be

2471
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:59,280
that are like not here and like I don't live in an area that pertains to,

2472
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:05,280
what I'm saying is I live in a shit ghetto place and I'm not really in demand anymore.

2473
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:14,640
So most of it is online stuff, but I've never like, I didn't have like a summer job or anything.

2474
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:19,360
I've never had like, you know, I need to flip burgers in a high score or anything.

2475
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:26,640
My flipping burgers was flipping minds and creating psychological revolutions on this podcast.

2476
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:29,120
I mean, because you know, that's definitely true.

2477
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:33,280
And it's like, I got my first job at Papa Geno's, or you know, it works for my neighbor,

2478
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:37,680
whatever, like the first one I think it was Papa Geno's that I did when I was like 16 and a half

2479
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,960
or like 17 or something.

2480
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:39,920
Yeah, that's exactly, yeah.

2481
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:44,160
And that's like, that's exactly like when you were doing like this stuff, this online stuff and

2482
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,960
Mohan Lawson, you know, but more importantly, like the commission.

2483
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:52,480
So like you totally, just like your generation in general, at least like the artists out there

2484
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:56,960
now have like the ability to do this like online commission work when guys like, you know,

2485
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,000
my generation was the transitional one where we were going toward this,

2486
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,480
but everybody still got like shitty meme jobs out there.

2487
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,480
I know, that's what I'm trying to hammer home.

2488
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,840
We are folks job.

2489
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,040
We have evolved past the need for jobs.

2490
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,600
We can just do like, like, like, like, like young artists can just do commission work

2491
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,640
and they can get fucking mad dash.

2492
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:21,680
By mad dash, I mean barely more than like a quarter of what you need to live.

2493
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:23,680
Well, you know, this is the fascinating thing though.

2494
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:30,080
Like maybe I'm not really sure it's a quote unquote good thing for like the people

2495
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:35,600
I guess just like for the worker class of society that things are going this way

2496
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,760
because things used to be much more cushy and like comfortable and you didn't really need

2497
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,640
to worry about it.

2498
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:44,640
And like the economy has just gotten so much more demanding, I guess you have to have like

2499
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,960
two parents working to support a family and stuff.

2500
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:52,480
I'm not saying there's nothing to be done except rise to the challenge, obviously.

2501
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:57,120
But I'm just saying that like people really seem to be like lowering their standards across

2502
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,480
the board and maybe at a necessity.

2503
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:01,920
Like I don't know if it's just, you know, not everyone's a Ben out here.

2504
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,400
It's just, you know, like I was reading like something recently about how like,

2505
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,120
or you know what it was?

2506
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:11,440
It was that article that came out pretty recently about how like your average YouTuber

2507
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,000
is like barely escaping poverty.

2508
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,520
I mean, not your average YouTuber, like your successful mainstream YouTuber,

2509
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:22,720
like I don't know, like your super bunny hops maybe or, you know, one of those tier of guys.

2510
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:28,960
Like those guys like are barely making what like, you know, like a livable minimum class wage,

2511
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,680
or minimum class, middle class wage.

2512
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:36,000
And there's just like, like where's the growth opportunity here?

2513
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,720
Like there is some if you become like a media mogul or something and you really like

2514
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:44,080
take the internet by storm, you know, you're a fucking PewDiePie or you're, you know,

2515
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,320
like the young Turks have a huge network of stuff.

2516
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:51,600
But like, man, it's tough out there in the commission world of being an artiste on the internet.

2517
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,960
It is tough out there.

2518
01:42:52,960 --> 01:43:02,480
But I think what you lose in like wealth and money, you make up for in time doing what you like.

2519
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,200
That's valuable.

2520
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,440
Which is the most valuable thing.

2521
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,120
That is the highest good that there is.

2522
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:07,440
Agreed.

2523
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,240
I'm sort of on board because like, what do you want to do with the money?

2524
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,560
Do things that you want to do.

2525
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,280
Yeah, that's right.

2526
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,520
If you're doing what you want to do, then I said this time and time again,

2527
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,640
where I don't particularly want to be super rich or anything.

2528
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:27,120
I just want to be able to do what I want to do, which is just to draw forever.

2529
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:31,520
And so as long as I'm not dead and I'm drawing forever, that's ideal for me.

2530
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,760
Yeah, Munchie, what you're tapping into is the fact that we're in this transitionary period,

2531
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:41,440
like hypothetically, well, it won't be that long before robots actually do actually everything.

2532
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,720
Like they could even make novels better than people could.

2533
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:48,560
And at that point, we're just crossing our fingers that we continue to be the masters

2534
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,400
of this planetary domain.

2535
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,240
That will be the final issue.

2536
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:55,600
But at that point, you know, we won't even have money.

2537
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,080
I mean, I don't know, this is this is really high minded shit.

2538
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,800
But like, we're sort of moving into an area where like,

2539
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,520
if everything is automated, hypothetically, then you don't even need to pay money for

2540
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,840
anything because everything is automated, right?

2541
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:13,680
So we're sort of hypothetically transitioning away from a life from a world where money is

2542
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,800
even relevant.

2543
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,840
And the transitionary side effects is it feels like we're fucking up and failing

2544
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,440
because we're making less money.

2545
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,160
But like money is becoming less relevant.

2546
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,440
You know, like, think about, yeah, that's kind of the awkward transitional,

2547
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,520
if we're talking like the baby boomer era, we're talking about like the 60s and 70s,

2548
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,640
we're thinking about like, it's all about making lots of money and spending that money

2549
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,000
to have a good life.

2550
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,080
But nowadays, you can sort of have a lot of the same things for a lot less money.

2551
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:45,200
How much money did you have to spend back in the 70s to have a level of entertainment that

2552
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:47,120
you can now have with Netflix?

2553
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:47,440
You know?

2554
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,080
Yeah, infinitely more, obviously.

2555
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:55,040
So like, I feel like we've sort of developed our lives.

2556
01:44:55,600 --> 01:45:01,520
Like the capitalism develops in our minds, this idea of like this fucking MMO that we're all

2557
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:06,320
playing where like the score that you judge yourself by is your point, which is to say

2558
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,600
your money, right?

2559
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,560
But there are other ways to feel valuable.

2560
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,800
And yeah, I think that like your KD ratio or something, right?

2561
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:21,440
So yeah, yeah, let's we need to gamify real life.

2562
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,520
The only problem is I don't trust anyone to make a system where like you allocate points

2563
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,480
for the right things, because you're just going to get a bunch of like spawn camping

2564
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:31,040
pieces of shit who just, you know, that's endless war.

2565
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,600
Endless war is the gamification of real life.

2566
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,400
Yeah, you're right.

2567
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:39,920
The only thing is to make endless war real, aka incite gang violence across all the major

2568
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,520
cities in the United States of America.

2569
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:43,600
And then we'll have our ideal society.

2570
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,880
We have to irradiate the seas and turn it all to slime.

2571
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:52,240
We need to flood the Grand Canyon with slime to make that slime river flow.

2572
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:52,560
Yes.

2573
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,120
And the violence should follow naturally from there.

2574
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:58,480
That's true, but also forbidden.

2575
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:00,560
Deleted.

2576
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:14,000
I I I've been having doubts myself about about how the upward momentum of Internet

2577
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,760
content creation and how it will be good for like like me personally.

2578
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:25,440
And I've been thinking about, you know, like I really admire and I and I respect the security

2579
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:31,840
that you have, Nate, of, you know, just doing a job, having that safety net and also doing

2580
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,480
what you love, you know, make videos and stuff.

2581
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,360
And I have not fully formulated and you'll hard set my opinion.

2582
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:44,080
I used to be super into like, you know, obviously content creation is just a way for me in lines

2583
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,840
with all of my beliefs and like what I want to do and it will allow me to do what I want.

2584
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:52,240
But the more I think about the more I think, well, you know, like, like having more money

2585
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:56,160
will be having more money and I will be able to do more of what I want.

2586
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,080
You know what I'm saying?

2587
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,880
If I, yeah, yeah, wealthy, I will be able to go and go more places and do more things,

2588
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,400
which will tie back into my heart.

2589
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:09,440
Yeah, I mean, it does serve the goal of, you know, freedom.

2590
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,360
Yeah, it gives you the freedom.

2591
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:16,880
You just it is important to balance your your time that you dedicate to this thing to give

2592
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,680
you the safety net so you can do the fun things that you really are passionate about versus

2593
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:27,040
you know, about those two things, making sure that they don't, one doesn't consume the other.

2594
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,200
And, you know, like you have to be pragmatic.

2595
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:33,920
Like if you can't pay your rent unless you spend, you know, 12 hours a day at a normie job,

2596
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,360
you know, because then you have to do that or else you'll just die and then you won't get to

2597
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,200
spend any time doing the fun stuff.

2598
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,280
So, you know, you got to be pragmatic about the stuff.

2599
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:46,800
But yeah, that's that's the most important thing I'd want people to take away.

2600
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,920
I think that's really important.

2601
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,560
If you can make it work full time doing the thing you want to do.

2602
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,880
Fantastic. I recommend you do so immediately.

2603
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,960
But, you know, being aware of where future trends are going.

2604
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:02,080
And I mean, these days there's a lot of there's a lot of cracking down on some of the more out there.

2605
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:06,640
The only future trend that matters is your trend into the fucking grave.

2606
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:07,680
So there's no time.

2607
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:08,160
There's no time.

2608
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,600
Which is 100%.

2609
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:14,960
There's no time to be like, oh, I wonder if I should like wait or not.

2610
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,960
No, just fucking do your shit because time's the most important thing.

2611
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,240
Money's stupid.

2612
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:24,800
Just fucking waiting waiting in general is almost always a mistake.

2613
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,720
But it's important to take smart action.

2614
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:29,200
So like it just like like there's this guy like Uncle Adams.

2615
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,600
I know I think I talked about it before, but that guy just said like fuck it.

2616
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:36,080
I'm going to spend whatever amount of money it takes work full time on being a musician.

2617
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:39,760
And I will drive myself into the fucking ground until I get there.

2618
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:43,680
Like in my personal opinion, he is a little bit naive about his chances.

2619
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:48,080
And I think a much smarter move would be to like get a job work on your music in the side.

2620
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,000
And because frankly, his music is like, isn't that great?

2621
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,280
It's like, what if you never get good and you never get the money back?

2622
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:57,920
Like which will happen to most people who try probably, you know, worrisome.

2623
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:03,200
So you have a motivational crack.com article talking about success.

2624
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:08,160
And like it's point number six to be successful or to get anywhere in life.

2625
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:11,360
You have to start now, which is pretty basic sentiment.

2626
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:15,360
But my favorite my favorite sentence on probably anything cracks ever written

2627
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:20,960
was I would come home every day, I would be at work all day not liking my job,

2628
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,240
thinking about all the things I'd like to do writing my novels and shit.

2629
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:30,080
But then I'd get home and then file the rest of my time under the fuck this day folder.

2630
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,360
And then just get ready to do it all again tomorrow.

2631
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,120
That's what people do.

2632
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,040
That's what people do.

2633
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,080
It's really easy to do that.

2634
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,440
I did that for a long time myself.

2635
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:44,240
I always I did that my a lot of my life and hated myself intensely for it.

2636
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:49,840
And I was just so delighted to look back one day after I'd gone through doing all this Tbap

2637
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,520
and you know best guy ever in PCP stuff.

2638
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:56,960
And now I'm just like I'm so happy every day when I realize I'm not that guy anymore.

2639
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:02,880
I'm like still that 50% of the time it's like a coin toss whether I'll actually like burn a day or not.

2640
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,080
And it's okay be wrong.

2641
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:10,960
Yesterday I should have been working on finishing all the paperwork for like who gets what for the

2642
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:11,920
for the rad kind of it.

2643
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:13,360
Instead I played Stardew Valley.

2644
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:18,560
So you know every day you have a lot of money writing on that.

2645
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,360
So I feel free to criticize me everybody.

2646
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,000
That's totally fair.

2647
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:22,880
But I'm working on it.

2648
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,400
I'm by the time you hear this it'll be done.

2649
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:33,120
So I will say like I have figured out I have cured myself of the most base form of procrastination.

2650
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,720
But there's other forms like a crop.

2651
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:36,160
He has to leave the podcast now.

2652
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:41,120
Well I'm supposed to be working on the next Digi video right now.

2653
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,640
And I'm kind of doing it.

2654
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:48,320
But I was also kind of just working on selecting dozens of different colors for mannequins in a

2655
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,600
level in a video game.

2656
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,680
And I'm like I don't want to make the video.

2657
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,840
I want to make more colors for my mannequins.

2658
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:57,040
So I'm like oh um anyway the point is.

2659
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:57,600
D-d-divu.

2660
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:58,880
What's up?

2661
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,880
Oh continue continue I'll do it after you.

2662
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,920
Yeah so I tend to procrastinate by doing something else.

2663
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:04,720
But isn't the thing I'm supposed to do.

2664
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,760
A lot of people do that as a way to trick themselves into thinking they're doing what

2665
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:08,800
they should be doing.

2666
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,320
Like for example when it's time to do your taxes I will like clean my room.

2667
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:15,280
Because one is like less objectionable than the other.

2668
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,640
You know we do that kind of stuff.

2669
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:17,840
Don't fall for that trap people.

2670
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,120
You got to be aware of that stuff.

2671
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,000
You got to be aware.

2672
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:25,600
So like here's the thing about all these motivational speeches that you've been cutting Nate.

2673
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:29,360
It's like I give all these I mean you're better you're a better hype man than me.

2674
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,560
So I guess this is the difference.

2675
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:32,720
But all these people in my life who I've known.

2676
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:38,480
Who have who still struggle with the same problems I had before I started working hard.

2677
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:42,560
And I just feel like none of my motivational fucking speeches like help them at all.

2678
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:46,960
Like for me I look back at myself and it was just all it took was I had I was forced to

2679
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,480
start doing a full-time job.

2680
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:54,480
And then like nine months later it was literally just something in me snapped.

2681
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,600
And I just didn't stop working ever.

2682
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:03,760
And I don't know maybe it's just not everyone is cut out for this.

2683
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,480
Maybe some people ultimately don't mind having a stupid job that much.

2684
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:11,440
They just think that all these cool internet people are cool.

2685
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:12,720
So I want to be like that.

2686
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:19,680
It's like you know I think it might only be for you if not being that is literal psychological torture.

2687
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:26,400
You know as the world famous show Grounded for Life once eloquently put it somebody's

2688
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,840
got to make the sandwiches.

2689
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:28,240
Yes.

2690
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,960
And that's a perfectly reasonable thing to say.

2691
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,800
When the robots make the sandwiches there is a there is an AI burger flipper.

2692
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:40,000
I don't really put a lot of stock personally in like willpower or like people's like inner

2693
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,200
strength coming out.

2694
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:45,680
I really think you're just either predisposed to hear a certain message and then like do stuff

2695
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:47,120
or you won't be.

2696
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:51,360
So yeah you know I just think like some people will just get that.

2697
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:56,000
But what I will say is though like because I am a guy who cares about this kind of stuff.

2698
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:01,680
I think that the more messages that are out there though the higher likelihood that someone

2699
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:05,680
might hear it and then be inspired to do these sorts of things which I would argue is a good

2700
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:06,080
thing.

2701
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:09,280
Motivational speeches didn't work on me but it might work on someone else.

2702
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,000
Yeah exactly exactly.

2703
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:17,520
I okay this is slightly off topic but I but there needs to be a topic about self-help

2704
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:26,720
culture slash like spirituality because my mom my mom is so hopped up on like feeling the

2705
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:31,360
good vibrations and like thought it was within you and like self-help and like trying to

2706
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:36,560
like like like like do all these like weird like bell and whistles like like fucking fake

2707
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:41,360
snake oil bullshit in order to make herself feel better after coming home from work instead

2708
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:47,200
of just trying like to do normal like I'm going to take a walk or exercise.

2709
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:50,000
See that stuff that stuff comes off.

2710
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:56,480
That stuff comes off is so like I don't know like not not like you're talking down to people

2711
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:02,000
and like it's just so like self masturbatory and like not actually fixing the problem.

2712
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,160
That's why I always do and I always go for like the blackpilled like self-help like listen

2713
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:10,080
literally no one cares about your life.

2714
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:15,680
You are worthless in the eyes of everyone else only you can like fix your shit.

2715
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:19,840
So listen do you want to show your life do you want to be sad forever you know if that's

2716
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:25,120
the situation you're in if the answer is no literally no one else will help you you have

2717
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:26,240
to do it yourself.

2718
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:30,560
That's the kind of message that I respond to at least and so it seems more sincere.

2719
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:39,520
Whenever I fucking get in my mom's car and we go anywhere she always is playing some

2720
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:46,160
fucking bullshit like someone lying through their fucking teeth making mad dosh praying

2721
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:52,160
on fucking naive like like like like like mentally exhausted middle-aged single moms

2722
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:58,400
sure it was like he like like self-help like how to be happy in 10 steps here's what you do

2723
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:04,320
or like a thousand steps and it's all fucking not like it's all like like nebulous fucking

2724
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:09,200
not actually like practical like not actually like just take these steps it's all fucking

2725
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:15,840
bullshit number one remember to love yourself oh my god that's it right that's the shit what

2726
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:20,320
this is and when you have to self-help it's not like you shouldn't do that no of course not

2727
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:25,760
of course not I know I can quantify the issue with this mentality that all these that so many

2728
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:32,880
people have that it's a focus on the methods and not a focus on the results you see the

2729
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:37,840
thing about all those books first helping you with any walk in life whether it be money or

2730
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:45,600
confidence or sex they they spend so much time complicating the procedures and like adding more

2731
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:50,080
and more things to remember and you just spend more and more time thinking about all the improvements

2732
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:55,040
you can do then it distracts you from the fact that it's actually it's pretty easy to know whether

2733
01:55:55,040 --> 01:56:00,160
or not things are changing you just look and see the results you know yeah like you just gotta be

2734
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:06,000
honest about your situation books to like get you laid with women you know that I feel like they

2735
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:13,360
kind of distract you from a very simple a very simple test are you getting laid or not right

2736
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:19,280
all you got to do is just keep examining that fact and then change your behavior accordingly

2737
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:24,400
you know a great way I look at great example of this I think is like like working out and

2738
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:28,480
like being in the gym the work is the ultimate example of that like you could read it is it

2739
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:34,400
is perfect for this because if you aren't tracking your numbers and your reps and your like if you

2740
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:37,520
you're smart you should measure like your waist size if you're trying to lose weight and you know

2741
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:41,120
check your weight like you should be writing it all down if you're not you're fucking up right

2742
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:45,200
off the gate but most people I think do who are serious about this by doing that you have

2743
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:52,560
uncontroversial like 100 factual results right in front of you every time you go in so you know

2744
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:58,080
if you're doing it right and if you're not progressing you are doing something wrong and it's just

2745
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:02,960
up to you if you're gonna fix or not or if you just don't care I know I've seen like fitness videos

2746
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,560
about this being like you can spend forever researching fitness and never like dipping your

2747
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:15,120
fucking toes into it get yourself addicted to the feeling of actually having accomplished something

2748
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:20,720
you know that's the way that's the way exercise is good for you and will make you feel good go

2749
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:26,240
back yeah like watch water advice watch water it just takes effort it takes more effort than

2750
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:34,000
not doing it so the default is to not do it of course for I just realized a way I can describe

2751
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:41,760
what's happening here these these books want to say that it's all mental like it's all in your head

2752
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,240
the reason why why your life sucks and you're and you feel bad because you don't do anything it's

2753
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:51,600
all mental it's not about your physical habits that you do it's not about what you do with your life

2754
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:56,240
and like who you hang out with or the way that you spend your time it's all just like just like

2755
01:57:56,240 --> 01:58:02,720
readjust how like it's like just think about you know when you put in your debit card to pay for

2756
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:07,040
something and it makes the no it's just thinking about like an 8-bit video game just making like an

2757
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:14,080
8-bit video game yeah I can see that seems like that mentality is a little bit liberating but

2758
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:19,840
really it's binding it's basically putting all misfortune onto you like it's all within you

2759
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:25,440
nothing about your environment is limiting you see that's where like like someone might be tempted

2760
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:29,760
to like really gravitate to that because it allows them to like quote-unquote like be responsible

2761
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:35,760
for everything but that's not actually the case it makes your challenge insurmountable in some

2762
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:41,120
cases yeah well it just it's just you're not fully assessing the problem because like just for example

2763
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:46,400
if you want to lose weight and like your whole family is fat and all your friends are fat like

2764
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:51,120
like yes you could theoretically just completely change your habits but realistically we have

2765
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:57,200
to recognize we are weak impressionable foolish creatures and the best thing to do is start hanging

2766
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:02,960
around people who eat the way you want to eat and who exercise and to get friends like that you know

2767
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:08,240
that's the that's that's a huge way to change our environment yeah yeah yeah I'm just saying and

2768
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:12,880
I'll just share my mom because she's a great lady and I like her but like she'll listen to all of

2769
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:18,880
these books and and she's listening to like like unbelievable like hundreds of books and hasn't

2770
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:25,280
given her a single extra number in her kd ratio has increased at all exactly exactly because

2771
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:30,640
she'll just do like like she'll just try and like think about the world differently but she doesn't

2772
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:36,080
do anything differently she still does the exact same things that she's always done for years this

2773
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:40,880
much his mom is the ultimate nemesis of the pcp she is our art ethicist of

2774
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:47,600
if Nate were to encounter her as like a child he would have smothered her like

2775
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:53,680
well listen I got a lot of respect for for people who raise a kid but but you know still we can still

2776
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:59,840
make criticism it is totally back easy to fall into the trap of like listening to and like indulging

2777
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:05,760
in things that like tell you that like tell you how to feel better that like that like that like

2778
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,880
tell you how to think you know yeah yeah like like like it's easy to fall down the self-help

2779
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:16,480
rabbit hole and and think and think that it is doing something for you even listening to this

2780
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:21,760
podcast fair viewer you may be pushing off responsibilities maybe you should be applying

2781
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:28,240
for that job you want right now instead of listening to this podcast about jobs for a bunch of assholes

2782
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:33,360
who don't know shit like one quote from welcome to the nhk that did you always fucking quotes where

2783
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:41,520
the guy says I have read all the self-help books I could write a self-help book just based on my

2784
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:48,000
knowledge of all the other self-help books and none of it has helped me yeah but like to jump back

2785
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,400
to what you said about um about uh you know getting yourself into an environment of say

2786
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:58,000
people who eat right or eat the way you want to eat I guess one thing to keep in mind

2787
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:03,360
is that we here on youtube telling people about getting success on youtube we exist in this void

2788
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:07,920
without considering any of the other values and variables or things that you want to have or

2789
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:14,320
maintain in your life i.e if the people if all the fat fucks if all the fucking grease slurping

2790
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:20,560
slobs in your life are people who matter to you maybe that's simply your fate if you can't turn

2791
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:25,280
your if you can't turn your fucking there's no such thing as fate fucking bean burger

2792
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:31,280
knows away from them then maybe not your fate but ultimately maybe you should give up you should

2793
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:36,480
give up the bacon of giving up bacon right well it's it's just you're making a calculation that

2794
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:40,800
you know your proximity to these people is more important to you than whatever the goal is and

2795
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:45,200
you can do that a lot of people do that it's actually pretty psychologically easy for me

2796
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:52,880
in like 2012 to decide I should start working on youtube or game design stuff because I had

2797
02:01:52,880 --> 02:02:00,880
nothing else going on in my life right I had like two friends who I would see once a week

2798
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:10,080
and that's all I had to live for I had nothing to lose right whereas so you were liberated in a way

2799
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:14,960
if you're someone who has anything to lose it becomes a much more difficult like my first

2800
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:21,840
experience with actually having to make a hard decision was deciding how much effort I should

2801
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:27,920
put into my channel versus the digi bro channel that was the first time I ever had an actual fucking

2802
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:33,360
trade-off so just keep that in mind folks that a lot of people are held back like you might be held

2803
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:41,840
back by other things you already have in your life you know and don't let our single-minded

2804
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:48,400
explanations of how to fucking get youtube success like dictate your decisions because you have my

2805
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:55,040
approach here I want people to insert whatever thing it is that they care about into the slot

2806
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:58,720
of like just for example like if you want to lose weight or something surround yourself with

2807
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:03,360
like-minded people you know whatever it is you're interested in whether you have passion for pursue

2808
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:10,080
it with as much gusto as you can muster right like if doing yeah if doing an actual job like

2809
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:17,600
being a dentist or some shit interests you like genuinely interests you and like doing painting

2810
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:23,040
or some art thing doesn't interest you to a significant degree stronger I don't think there's

2811
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:29,440
any reason to do that like the only reason I do art is because there's nothing else I am interested

2812
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:37,600
in doing so it's actually a very easy decision for me sure yeah what are you gonna do when digi

2813
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:41,760
bleeds all of his money for making an avant-garde content that no one understands or what are you

2814
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:47,840
gonna do when he bleeds all this money fair fair question yeah I mean I'm right now I'm working

2815
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:52,720
on going down and downloading shitloads of porn that's related to the video and gonna have to figure

2816
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:59,280
out how to censor that yeah what are you gonna do when he bleeds away all of his money well I don't

2817
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:07,200
know make uh he fucking he's gonna get a job there we go back on top there we go bringing it back

2818
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:12,480
no I'm working I'm working on video games something even more okay quick question quick

2819
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:16,960
question to do here's a real okay how much money have you invested in making this game and how much

2820
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:23,440
have you seen on returns uh maybe both are maybe both are zero maybe I am well I am well

2821
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:28,560
beyond well I mean that's my point it's you know what I think it's so bullshit to everyone now you

2822
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:34,560
guys are jumping on this whole like oh you're in a patreon that someone else's patreon is y'all are

2823
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:38,160
all living your life no no no I'm just asking dude I'm not giving you shit no

2824
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:44,000
the fact that you were doing this for digi is not a problem at all the fact is that digi is

2825
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,360
bleeding money and exactly as I would say for anyone who works for a corporation like you should

2826
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:54,080
be aware of if that corporation is like currently going through bankruptcy proceedings just like

2827
02:04:54,080 --> 02:04:58,800
my friend digi but no I'm just kidding that's not the sound but like theoretically let's just say digi

2828
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:03,680
dies I mean you never know like just what if he dies you know and I'm just saying anyone in any

2829
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:07,680
situation should be aware of the realities of how things could change and have a backup plan that's

2830
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:13,360
on the right the reality I want to live in is where where where divu becomes unshackled exclamation

2831
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:20,080
point divu well I will say I will say I deeply I deeply miss divu's videos I would love those

2832
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:24,560
back yeah I forgot that would be that I forgot divu used to make video in a perfect world in a

2833
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:31,200
perfect world uh but you know hey man okay digi's patreon did decrease over the winter

2834
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:37,280
by a huge margin I've actually continued to get paid the same amount of money like digi also

2835
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:42,160
makes lots of money from agrev that he just keeps sure I've actually been continued to be paid the

2836
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:46,400
same amount of money so I'm not actually I don't want to criticize you you don't need to get into

2837
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:50,480
if you don't want to I'm not trying to like examine your financial situation uh you know

2838
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:55,440
if you don't want to that's perfectly perfectly fine but a bunch of started this munchie what the

2839
02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:00,000
hell do you need my money I mean that is actually why I'm on the pcp right now I decided yeah I'm

2840
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,760
just gonna sure it's gonna fucking bite the bullet and be on this show where we go completely

2841
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:08,640
off topic and I'm as bad as anyone else at that because I will make a bit of money I do need that

2842
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:13,520
money uh so there you go good I didn't know where your priorities are the barrels was to your head

2843
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:18,480
you just had to pull that trigger and he's done it last thank god like talking about what we said

2844
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:24,800
earlier about the irrelevance of money in the face of like just being happy actually I basically

2845
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:30,080
already have that like I felt like I fucking broke through the heavens of actually becoming

2846
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:37,360
someone who makes stuff that people find relevant and useful to them that's really hard to accomplish

2847
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:42,080
you know to like actually be someone who can make things that people give a shit that's really

2848
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:47,200
hard to do so once I accomplish that I basically felt like I've been set for life you know now

2849
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:52,000
that we found the goldmine that is water park vlogs there's no going back we've cracked we've

2850
02:06:52,000 --> 02:07:00,720
opened Pandora's box this is a bubble that will never burst

2851
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:06,720
there's two there's two major forms of currency in 2018 and going forward there is two major

2852
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:11,920
source of income across the world water park vlogs and endless war these are the two driving

2853
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:17,280
force of the economy everything depends on them what if there is gang violence at Disneyland

2854
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:23,360
oh christ it'll be a slime park instead of a water park oh my god that would be we have to make

2855
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:27,280
that we have to we have to build yeah we have to build a new room we have to build a new room in

2856
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:34,480
endless war the slime park oh maybe you can maybe you can pay you can like pay a little bit of

2857
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:40,880
slime to like go on one of the rides or something you have to pay for admission yeah yeah okay okay

2858
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:47,840
bin no okay okay you do like like like exclamation point ride name of ride and and then like like

2859
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:54,560
and then you and then you pay amount of slime and then we have like six or seven like like like uh uh

2860
02:07:54,560 --> 02:08:00,320
text walls that we will type out describing your experience with the ride oh oh and here's a quick

2861
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:05,360
thought yeah both both ben and munchy can make competing rides at the slime water park and of

2862
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:09,760
course whoever makes the better ride will get the more money because they get paid for the experience

2863
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:14,960
oh my god like right like we're like tycoons like we like this business we're like your rollers coaster

2864
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:21,360
tycoons in real life and it'll be a race to see who can make more rides and like who can make more

2865
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:27,440
like designs for rides like more like running like running this water park racket in the background

2866
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:32,000
we're just like making slime hand over fists you know how there's like like like like in normal

2867
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,680
means there's always like okay who can make the biggest roller coaster we can like who has like

2868
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:43,040
the biggest wall effects describing this person's yeah exactly all right and this war has infinite

2869
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:49,760
growth potential there we go straight from the mines to the water parks to the tycoons yeah we gotta

2870
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:54,160
close this pcp because we have to work on endless war right the fuck we gotta get to the questions

2871
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:58,480
these are the questions let's let's shift over to anyone want to make any final points on jobs

2872
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:06,240
jobs suck i hate them that's fair correct same i am post jobs me and my me and my fellow

2873
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:16,240
2000 millennial children are all post job hashtag post job you indigo children yeah we have no need

2874
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:22,880
for for your for your dirt all you know why hashtag post your jobs because we're poor because the

2875
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:30,000
robots have taken over jobs because um you know the other thing that's appetizing about this kind

2876
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,360
of job is that you're your own boss you know you don't have to call in all the time but but just

2877
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:40,160
remember people who want to have a job with their their own boss you really do you have to be your

2878
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:47,200
own boss and you might end up hating yourself as your own boss and that's me i can talk about this

2879
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:51,760
you know how like you get you blame your boss for making you go to work even though going to work is

2880
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:57,760
like like what you're supposed to do with a job if you force yourself to do your job you might have

2881
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:04,960
people blaming you for working like it can't it might even be you you might have contempt for

2882
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:10,880
yourself for forcing yourself to work and if you can't have that then you probably cannot be your

2883
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:18,400
own boss makes sense to me i mean dude it's fucking it's fucking hard like every every success you

2884
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:22,640
get to revel in but every failure you have to realize it was totally your fault you know

2885
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:29,760
so like it sucks realizing that oh i only make 10 percent of the money i used to

2886
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:37,200
and that's my fault so hooray yeah uh well there you go all right let's let's get some questions

2887
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:46,080
jobs are gay question time uh here we go here we go here is a pity question over on the twitter

2888
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:54,080
hashtag sbcp follow us at tbcrasnators uh here here we go uh eskimo bob two asks do any of you

2889
02:10:54,080 --> 02:11:00,640
give to charities why are why not no anybody does any no because i'm a charity at this point

2890
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:07,760
i don't give to charities simply because i don't have the money to i don't think i don't think

2891
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:11,840
charities are like evil or anything i get the impression that people are in the chat are gonna

2892
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,040
be like come down like oh fucking any don't you all know that charities are evil well well i don't

2893
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:21,760
i don't really i'm sure nate's gonna throw some weird utilitarianism but no i would donate to charity

2894
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:27,120
if i had the money to do so as long as i believe in the cause yeah i i don't have enough money that's

2895
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:31,520
an excuse like if you did have the money you would is what munchie and tom are saying i don't really

2896
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:37,040
trust charities but it's it's not even in the equate it's it's not even a question because i'm

2897
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:41,840
you know because like i'm in debt and stuff i'm like i can't be i can't be doing that with like

2898
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:47,360
that's not what i'm gonna do with money if i get it if it's a hard yes i would get a charity but i

2899
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:53,680
don't it's it's not off the table for me in any way i was a charity that i trusted then maybe i

2900
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:58,880
i i could make excuses personally all day about like oh my finances aren't in as good a shape as i

2901
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:03,760
would like before being to me to start giving money but i'll tell you right now philosophically i

2902
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:10,560
dislike charities not across the board but like the idea that i could give money to a charity and

2903
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:15,920
like any of that money gets absorbed in like administrative costs i do and who knows who

2904
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:21,360
knows what percentage that is i okay i get exactly that has to be there has to be some mechanism like

2905
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:26,080
there has to be some red tape there for like anything to get done like okay i know again like

2906
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:30,320
i'm a little biased here but like i think about like the fucking the pink ribbons the nfl players

2907
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:34,640
who are like the pink shoes are like the it's like breast cancer awareness and like of course we

2908
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:39,440
all want to fight breast cancer it's evil let's kill it but the if you look into the finances like

2909
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:45,760
less than like 10 percent of the revenue from that shit goes to the goddamn charity and fucking

2910
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:51,280
nike keeps the rest and the fucking nfl gets their cut of course like it sickens me i think of

2911
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:56,320
charities as sort of like a modern day what was it like catholic church uh where you just give the

2912
02:12:56,320 --> 02:13:00,640
catholic church money in order to get into heaven for free i think of charities and basically like

2913
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:05,920
well even if the money socially that's what they are even if the money didn't actually go to a good

2914
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:12,160
cause i intended for it to be a good cause therefore it's a good thing to do i'll tell you what if i had

2915
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:18,000
lots of money like millions of dollars billion if i had fucking you know notch money i would be like

2916
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:25,040
notch but way stronger like i would just pay people to do art all the time strong like i would

2917
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:30,400
like nobody's stronger than notch if i had a billion dollars i would go on youtube look at all

2918
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:36,720
the people who obviously want to have full-time jobs doing your videos and i'd be like yo close

2919
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:44,320
your patreon that has a sad like seven dollars a month on it i will pay you a full-time wage to

2920
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:50,160
make this on a contract basis right that's what i would do you know that's nice because i believe

2921
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:57,760
in art i don't believe in disease free third world nations leave that shit to bill gates you

2922
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:03,280
see that's the thing the only way the fallacy of spending money is that it doesn't necessarily

2923
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:08,080
get you exactly what you want you can spend a billion dollars to have something happen but if

2924
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:13,680
you're not there making sure the money's being spent correctly it doesn't make shit that's why

2925
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:20,400
the bill and melinda gates foundation does do legitimate good in the world yeah yeah gates is

2926
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:25,920
full-time fucking job it doesn't just take all his money it takes all of his fucking time

2927
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:32,080
and if bill gates didn't do it he would be considered like evil by the world just by virtue

2928
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:36,640
of having that money so he gets something out of it but i just assumed if he had spent the same

2929
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:43,600
amount of money on charity but just threw the money to like the most honest earnest sounding bitter

2930
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:50,800
you wouldn't vaccinate shit well yeah agreed uh probably it's like that that's that's my point

2931
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:55,360
like okay when i think about like it like yeah exactly as you were saying debu there's like

2932
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:59,200
people out there who just aren't making enough money doing what they want to do and you know i have

2933
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:03,040
a little bit of conflicting feelings because i think to myself like okay i value what this person

2934
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:08,400
is doing but if they're so unpopular that like they haven't been able to like capitalize on this

2935
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:13,120
and like make it a successful business like i know not everyone's a great businessman but like will

2936
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:17,680
this even succeed long term if i subsidize it so there's like concerns about that it's not about

2937
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:22,400
me it's not about trying to push stuff out the boat that is going to be successful it's about me

2938
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:27,520
wanting certain art to exist okay sure i remember there's this documentary i only have seen the

2939
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:32,240
commercials all this relay the commercials information about the guy who made five-hour energy

2940
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:38,320
he became a god damn billionaire and spent 99 percent of it on just charity and fucking like

2941
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:46,080
uh philanthropy he basically built this huge fucking like science lab where he just gives

2942
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:52,480
scientists and engineers free money to build cool shit that can help the poor like a a hand-cranked

2943
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:58,640
water filtration bitch type of thing right like so basically he spends his money on very specific

2944
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:03,760
things that can very specifically help people in specific ways like when um james ralph recently

2945
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:09,440
like a couple years back did a charity where he was auctioning off some old avg and set pieces or

2946
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:16,000
like scripts and the money was going to charity but it was very specifically going to the hospital

2947
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:22,560
this like this like specialty hospital that like saved his daughter's life right well sure okay

2948
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:27,840
basically like his daughter wasn't treated properly when she was born so he took her to this other

2949
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:34,720
medical specialty place and they like basically uh resulted in his daughter not being like

2950
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:38,800
permanently disabled because they knew what the fuck they were doing right so james ralph was like

2951
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:43,920
all right if i ever do a charity it's gonna be these guys right because they're very specific

2952
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:51,520
people who i actually know right mm-hmm so that that's the thing about why i think it's bad to

2953
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:55,840
like not bad but i think it's misguided to think that if you have money you must give the charity

2954
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:04,480
because yes you could have a million times more money than someone else but we all only have 24

2955
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:10,960
hours in the day and doing good takes time not money i mean takes you know and that's very true

2956
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:16,160
and i like i can make another argument here that like okay who's gonna do more with the money for

2957
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:23,680
the world like some like elon musk or like some poor kid in chicago like you know maybe that kid is

2958
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:28,080
like a super genius and like he'll use that money and like get somewhere in life and go really far

2959
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:33,280
but we've got a track record with elon he's doing good work over here with all his money i don't know

2960
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:39,920
if i necessarily agree with the sentimentality of we just have to like put all of our resources into

2961
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:45,920
like like the rich and powerful and and genius well i mean in this particular case it's an argument

2962
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:52,480
to like take elon's money to give to like poor people which of course i am not in favor of uh

2963
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:58,880
but yeah i i i it again it comes down to the individual decision of just i like poor black

2964
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:04,640
kids in chicago let me give the money if i like everybody i just choose to wait there was infinite

2965
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:08,480
money and infinite resources of course we want everybody to have it uh it's just a matter it's

2966
02:18:08,480 --> 02:18:13,280
a matter of you know distribution um i don't think i don't think it like like i don't think it needs

2967
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:19,920
to be a matter of of of moral ambiguity to just do to just give money to who you want to give money

2968
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:26,480
to win and if and not what i you choose to do i i disagree i mean to certain degrees because like

2969
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:32,160
if i give so well just like there can be cases where like if i give so much money that i personally

2970
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:35,920
let's just say i give so much money that i starve to death because i can't buy money for myself

2971
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:41,440
just as an edge case obviously that is that is not ideal you don't want to go that far that's

2972
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:46,960
too much even if the people that you're giving money to survive only because you gave money

2973
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:52,560
and maybe more people survive than you die the question is what will they do with their lives

2974
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:56,960
we have to make these calculations now because we're dealing with these sort of like that's

2975
02:18:56,960 --> 02:19:02,080
that's what we're talking about we're trafficking in direct human life at this point the human

2976
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:07,840
trafficking and what they'll do with their lives is i'm a human trafficker is that they will be happy

2977
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:14,800
uh correct correct but and that's what people want is for other people i have now completely

2978
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:19,440
forgotten and just now remember this is a question this isn't just a continuation of the topic

2979
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:24,160
yeah that's true just do any of you give to charities why why not i'll make one last point

2980
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:28,560
in favor of munchie basically in this point which is just like if i could for if you think about for

2981
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:34,080
example like in the middle in the middle ages like there were probably like super genius kids born

2982
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:38,560
to just like dirt poor surf families and like they obviously had like no opportunity to like

2983
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:42,960
succeed and we're just like trampled and you know died never getting a chance to succeed

2984
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:48,560
i want all those people to have an opportunity to succeed across the world so like yeah where

2985
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:52,880
charity where charity can do those sorts of things i absolutely wanted to do so though i don't believe

2986
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:58,400
in like extracting money from people if they don't choose to i don't when this when this person said

2987
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:05,360
like would you give charity i i don't like believe in like really like huge big charities or anything

2988
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:11,680
i just want to like analyze like just giving two things that i feel deserve money and slash or

2989
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:18,400
attention yeah i don't have any particular like uh standards or or beliefs like that i

2990
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:23,520
want to give to that i can like think of right now mm-hmm you know i'm saying like like there's no

2991
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:30,480
charity that i that i am like itching to give money to i'm just like like the idea of giving money

2992
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:35,120
to other people does not repulse me i it doesn't repulse me either it just depends on this like

2993
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:39,840
sometimes it does repulse me other times it doesn't you know yeah sometimes repulses me too

2994
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,800
yeah there you go there you go we don't anyone else want to win this no tom would you give

2995
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:48,640
it oh tom is the charity case right i forgot i've been ben what do you think just real quick uh

2996
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:56,080
if i had like more money than i knew what to do with than maybe but like i'd have to be really

2997
02:20:56,080 --> 02:21:01,840
i'd have to like really know like what the money was going to yeah like i would just have to be

2998
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:07,600
thoroughly convinced that the money was actually making a real difference and not you know that's

2999
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:14,160
it makes sense to me uh one other uh twitter question here from at doombox two favorite

3000
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:19,760
anime okay moving on we're going to be uh to the piece to the patreon lounge questions over here

3001
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:24,320
this is why we have bad comments is because you read them aloud and they think they're really

3002
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:29,840
funny that one is funny it was a joke comment god damn it all right we've had that joke like four

3003
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:37,920
i like it every time all right here's an actual good question yeah an actual good question here

3004
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:42,000
discount gumshoe asks this is a great question for this topic i told everybody that we're doing

3005
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:48,560
the job's topic uh okay will the chad artist or just you know or will the artist ever be free of the

3006
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:54,720
you don't work hard meme that the virgin wage cucks have forced upon us you don't understand what he's

3007
02:21:54,720 --> 02:22:00,480
asking here like so so often so often you'll be like an online content creator like a video maker

3008
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:04,320
or like a draw boy and you'll say those you know you'll meet someone out they'll be like hey what do

3009
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:08,800
you do uh so you know i'm i'm a i'm a youtuber i'm an artist you know i do commissions and they're

3010
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:15,280
like oh no what about a real job though what's your oh you know never be free because inherently

3011
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:20,400
being an artist means that what you that you're doing what you you're you're you're choosing your own

3012
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:25,440
work and it's just i think it's just inherently less punishing and it's just it's going to be seen

3013
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:30,000
by those who have to do stuff they don't want to do for a living you know it's going to be seen that

3014
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,960
way no matter what and i don't even blame it like i think that's kind of reasonable i don't think

3015
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:44,640
what the work of an artist and the work of a wage cucks virgin wage cucks they they are of the

3016
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:52,640
opinion that work is supposed to be like grueling and hard and bad they the word work has negative

3017
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:59,440
connotation to them because they are virgin wage cuck bitches yeah and so they they feel the need

3018
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:05,680
that like oh like work needs to be hard because i'm because you know it's hard for me because i don't

3019
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:11,680
want to do any work i'm just a worthless piece of shit but like artists are doing work objectively

3020
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:15,680
they're just doing work that they enjoy and that doesn't make them feel bad

3021
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:24,560
yeah man like i don't see like virgin wage cuck comments in my preview much like let's just face

3022
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:31,280
back plenty of artists are pretty damn lazy a lot of people don't realize how i think the real

3023
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:36,320
issue here is discrimination like artists being called inherently like not working hard like some

3024
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:43,280
subset of my experience might be really skewed or wrong but i just see that if you are obviously

3025
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:49,360
working really fucking hard it's gonna show and people are gonna not say that shit right you

3026
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:54,000
know the only reason i disagree with that divu is because of like stuff that like tom will retweet

3027
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,800
where like people i i don't even know like i kind of am skeptical as to how often this even happens

3028
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:03,600
but like tom will retweet these like horror stories sometimes of like someone like he's like

3029
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:06,880
hey would you draw my oc and they're like sure it's like a hundred dollars like

3030
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:13,760
you expect to be fucking paid for that piece of shit and you know like that attitude is kind of

3031
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:18,080
inherent here it's like how i'm sorry my body's still fucking high uh it's like how could you

3032
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:23,280
possibly not expect someone to request some form of compensation i feel like that's just that's in

3033
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:28,800
the mix here somewhere you know what i mean that's like me and me and divu me and divu staged one

3034
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:35,040
right yeah and it took seven fucking months to do it you goddamn non-worker yeah i just sat on it

3035
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:40,560
and didn't post it for months and i don't know why yeah so it was a perfect example of lazy

3036
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:48,160
artists ladies and gentlemen there they are yeah all artists don't work you see i can feel why why

3037
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:52,960
munchy would would be so strident fighting back against this because we all know how hard a worker

3038
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:58,400
munchy is and the crazy stuff he's always cooking up uh i could i feel the same way you know like

3039
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:03,200
the content that i make is is generally very high effort i'm currently fighting against that but

3040
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:10,480
was that not sarcasm just now i was sincere just now whoa what do you mean i think i it feels so

3041
02:25:10,480 --> 02:25:16,400
weird for someone to have nate compliment me it doesn't i come with people all the time that was

3042
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:21,760
so bizarre i was just waiting for the like like like oh we all we all know what munchy's always

3043
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:28,080
cooking up a fucking faggot let's go ahead dude yeah my answer to that question so people

3044
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:34,960
can't tell i'm sincere my answer to that question is really just fucking if you want those people

3045
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:42,400
to go away i think that if you just work harder people will see it you know like yes you can say

3046
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:49,520
oh it's you know it's not actually easy to draw yeah but i see artists of equal drawing quality

3047
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:55,040
who are like five times more prolific than the other one you know sure you know what i mean like

3048
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:59,920
there's definitely you know what it comes down to the the question is will like the artist ever

3049
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:04,880
be free of this like meme that's you know discrimination or whatever the answer is basically

3050
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:10,240
what ben was saying it's really no like because there's this kind of there's this kind of like

3051
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:15,040
competition between the two yeah because people associate work with like bad unfun stuff as long

3052
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:19,600
as that exists right there will be but there's here but you individually can absolutely rise

3053
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:27,120
above it there's a much stronger reputation uh deriding those who are stuck in entry level jobs

3054
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:32,960
as being underachievers who coast on minimal you know clock in your nine to five every day

3055
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:39,360
and then go home and do nothing right so i think though i think that stigma is probably worse and

3056
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:46,800
more hard to get rid of so i think uh i think everyone in any position is going to be faced with

3057
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:52,000
some sort of prejudice about not being hard enough yeah he's gotta be hard even if you're

3058
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,000
successful and rich people are gonna be like oh this guy didn't fucking work to be rich right yeah

3059
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,920
yeah and there's the whole like yeah there's the management fallacy where people don't people are

3060
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:04,080
like you don't do fucking work you just tell other people to do work why are you getting paid so much

3061
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:08,560
money kills me that's the fucking capital uh fucking communist mindset in a nutshell yeah those

3062
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:13,120
bitches need to watch winter wrap up where you see the true value of someone whose skill is

3063
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:18,880
organization yeah people need to fucking watch season one winter fucking wrap up organization

3064
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:23,280
matters people get the fucking right the the problems they just don't understand what managers

3065
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:28,880
actually do uh and some are lazy yeah you know what you know what this is actually kind of relevant

3066
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:33,120
to this in general because like i think of a lot of the reason people think art is just easy

3067
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:37,360
and they assume they're lazy is because they don't know how hard artists can actually work

3068
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:41,360
because they don't understand the process yeah of it being made you know idea that like artists are

3069
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:47,040
just talented you know yeah they just have an inability that's true and just for my realm of

3070
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:52,640
experience like when you post a video bam the video just for the viewer it didn't exist now

3071
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:57,040
magically it exists but they don't see the months of work and the editing and the recording and you

3072
02:27:57,040 --> 02:28:02,560
know all that shit that that's one of the things mean mean been starting to go back to

3073
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:08,400
reference copulars but but we're trying out streaming and that's like the main thing that I

3074
02:28:08,400 --> 02:28:12,720
think like like we're trying to see if we want to do that full time yeah and it's looking pretty

3075
02:28:12,720 --> 02:28:18,480
great and like i think it's well suited to our long form content but the satisfaction that the

3076
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:26,080
reference specialist fans get from just waking up on some random day and you are just blessed out

3077
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:33,680
of the blue by by a ravers cop killers video by six seven hours long yeah yes it just it spawns out

3078
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:38,640
of nowhere it's great it's a great feeling it's a great feeling i think that's a large part of why

3079
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:44,480
youtube is so fun you know it's just fun to be subscribed see a huge video drop everybody loves

3080
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:48,720
it plays off that like slot machine mentality where it's just like i wonder if it's gonna be here

3081
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:55,040
today it's the skinner box it's like you know small like random random rewards more or less yeah

3082
02:28:55,040 --> 02:29:01,840
youtube subscriptions are loot boxes we need to ban online gambling such as subscribing to anyone on

3083
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:06,400
youtube it's a gamble and we can't allow it we need harsh regulations that that's why there's such a

3084
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:10,960
little Amish population and like demographics on youtube is because it's a form of gambling they

3085
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:15,040
can't do it that's the reason all right two more points before we go on the next question okay first

3086
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:21,840
of all uh just really quick here unrelated uh i just realized the other day that we actually passed

3087
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:27,760
the two-year anniversary of ravers cop killers on uh april 11th so yeah well the debut was on that

3088
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:34,000
first one so right yeah dude the pcp is also passed or not aware yesterday was homestuck day

3089
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:40,640
yeah it was right i know right i wish i hadn't been so sick i would have fucking done something for it

3090
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:47,680
i would have been stuck you were stuck at home and i was so upset you know i was going to make

3091
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:51,280
armors people fan art because i don't want to disrespect homestuck by just like not even

3092
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:56,480
acknowledging that it was there all right but the real thing that actually is related to this

3093
02:29:56,480 --> 02:30:04,160
is the one like like like the biggest influence or the biggest positive influence the pcp has had

3094
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:10,960
my life uh that's completely changed the way i perceive something was the insistence and and

3095
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:17,680
me realizing that work is and should be good yes work should have no negative connotations

3096
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:24,000
and it should be a pure positive because you know like i had grown up and my mom would come home

3097
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:30,400
for like oh working this fucking so bad and i hate it so much uh but like when i yesterday yesterday

3098
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:35,200
was or two days i lose track of all time because uh because i don't perceive time the same way other

3099
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:42,480
people do i'm a cryptid uh i i worked for like like six hours on that one feeling closer to death

3100
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:46,960
like vlog video i worked so hard that i had to like get footage of like a range things and then

3101
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:53,840
after it was done i was so fucking happy that i had put in the work to make that and i had gone

3102
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:57,440
like like this guy like like like call me on skype and i had to like do some like green

3103
02:30:57,440 --> 02:31:02,320
green screening shit right i had to like arrange a footage like frame by frame for a certain part

3104
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:06,800
it was fucking it was great and i was so happy that i had done it and and and just the fact that

3105
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:12,960
i could sit back and think wow i put in so much work what what a good what a good day this yeah

3106
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:17,840
that's the feeling that i love more than anything else you think real smart and you'll get real

3107
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:24,080
lucky work can be nothing but good when it comes to like editing videos there's lots of parts that

3108
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:30,320
are just constantly creative but then in parts where it's more like grudge work uh then you can

3109
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:34,160
put on a podcast because there's parts of your brain that are being unoccupied because it's

3110
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:39,200
boring but then there's parts where it has to be stupid there's just no two way you cannot be

3111
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:44,960
cognizant while doing this part so then you can get drunk for that part you see if you play your

3112
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:50,720
cards correctly you could smooth over the experience of every part of the production and if you can't

3113
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:57,040
then you're doing something wrong and and furthermore if you are listening to this podcast right now

3114
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:01,200
if you have found your way here and you are you are intelligent enough to be listening to this right

3115
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:08,640
now i guarantee you can have the life that you envision for yourself ideally in i would say

3116
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:14,720
five to ten years of investment no matter how you work right fucking now yeah if you get to it now

3117
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:18,240
and whenever you start like if you want to start for a year that's fine but then there'll be five

3118
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:22,960
to ten years from then so you know whatever you want to do buddy that's that's the sooner you'll

3119
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:27,040
get it to pay off and when you start doing the thing you want to do we're think about how to make

3120
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:31,760
it a like economically viable if it will never be economically viable except the fact that you'll

3121
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:35,760
need to have a side job and then maybe one day you'll be you'll be doing this 20 years later and

3122
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:39,200
you'll realize huh you know what i guess i don't need my side job i really can do this full time

3123
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:43,280
because you never know if the what matters is to just be working towards the things that you want

3124
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:48,800
to do that aren't economically viable that's probably a hobby and hobbies are cool yeah so there you go

3125
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:54,640
that's true hobbies the ladies love hobbies guys the ladies love doing it and what it takes

3126
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:59,600
is working a job to make it possible then you know you got to do that you know what i'll say

3127
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:03,760
about this if it's what you want then it should be worth it i i said before that a lot of this

3128
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:10,400
is motivated by my deep sexual insecurities as a man and uh i feel like that really did motivate me

3129
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:15,280
in in one sense here that was like i once heard advice uh in my in my old days of researching

3130
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:20,480
like how to be attractive and how to be cool and stuff and i i read a thing that just like women

3131
02:33:20,480 --> 02:33:26,960
just love men with passion and like it's you got two choices one make your full-time job your passion

3132
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:31,200
so that you're excited to go there every day and you have something to talk about to like the ladies

3133
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:35,680
or whatever so that you you are full of interesting and exciting things that are that like a woman

3134
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:40,560
would want to be a part of there's that option or if it's not your full-time job and if you're if

3135
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:45,680
you don't like your full-time job then you've got to make yourself like your hobby your your purpose

3136
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:51,040
in life you've got to have something in you that's burning inside as like a desire to reach and yeah

3137
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:55,600
so that you have things to share with people that's what it's all about man and and having that inside

3138
02:33:55,600 --> 02:34:00,480
me both motivated me to like improve my life so i would like be able you know just like all the

3139
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:03,920
normal stuff of like wanting the things i want having you know control over my life and that

3140
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:08,480
and then also it tied into my you know wanting to like be attractive to women and stuff it was

3141
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:12,800
helpful in two ways yeah i completely agree with everything that you just said but i just hate sex

3142
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:18,160
so much so i'm just going to say do everything nate said but do it for yourself for inner fulfillment

3143
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:22,720
what i'm describing is basically a cheat code it's a cheat code if you attach your desire to get

3144
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:27,760
girls to this that might help you as well it did for me entirely how i've gotten a fucking person

3145
02:34:28,320 --> 02:34:33,520
i think like the the the hilarious side effect of that is if you do nate's cheat by the time you

3146
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:37,840
get like so fucking good and like your life is so good you realize you don't even fucking need to

3147
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:42,080
fuck that much because that's yeah that that's a real secret dude the real thing that is more

3148
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:46,800
important and like like there's guys out there was inside you all along there are guys out there

3149
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:52,000
who enjoy a fucking new bitch like every single day but your average guy what they're interested in

3150
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:56,880
is like i i mean this is my experience i think your most average guy just wants a girlfriend

3151
02:34:56,880 --> 02:35:01,120
who makes him happy you know he's pretty hot we all want that and even whatever way you define

3152
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:07,760
that as and uh like you just feel contented like that part of your life is satisfied i think that's

3153
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:11,760
a very common thing that a lot of people want and like if personally on my quest that took

3154
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:16,240
fucking a bunch of bitches that's what it took for me to realize that about myself and uh but now i

3155
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:21,360
know now i know and i'm pretty content i would tell my fiance back when we were just like dating

3156
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:27,760
and shit i just asked her like why the fuck do you find me attractive like i don't i don't know

3157
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:33,680
why i'm that hot to you and she said okay well you know quentin tarantino and i was like what and

3158
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:38,000
so she compared me to quentin tarantino and then she's into people like quentin tarantino

3159
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:46,560
the madman himself fucking shrimpy fucking egotistical a guy like that when when billy

3160
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:51,280
mitchell has fallen from grace recently for being a cheater she was really sad about that too because

3161
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:57,120
she really likes billy mitchell for the same reasons and i was like oh wow yeah i went when i

3162
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:02,160
was i totally get that it's a passion man yeah when i was 15 i realized oh i should just like

3163
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:08,560
not care about like trying to impress girls and i will just make myself impressed with myself

3164
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:13,680
and yeah basically ever since then it's been pretty easy you just you just don't even think about it

3165
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:18,480
and you just get pussy jumping on your ass all day you gotta do it we should really have

3166
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:23,600
we should really have an entire episode about relationship so so so we can get into this

3167
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:28,560
but i'm much more far online with the devoo of just improve yourself and obviously people who

3168
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:34,560
like the improved you which is to say the you that you want and should be we'll just naturally

3169
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:39,840
gravitate towards you yeah i mean i told you that's that's the that's the basic uh logic find it

3170
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:47,440
we've been going for almost three hours yeah we gotta start we gotta start rapping

3171
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:52,000
i've been like the last hour we've been talking about getting hype and doing your work i've been

3172
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:55,360
looking at this file that i started before the podcast it's like i really just want to

3173
02:36:55,360 --> 02:36:59,680
fucking work on this it's okay you know what i i totally feel i totally feel it for that sake

3174
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:04,080
let's let's just get a question to a little bang them out real fast yeah yeah rap is shit out

3175
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:09,920
here's one that i well i want to answer by one spar bleakly and in the patreon lounge

3176
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:16,720
since shitty questions is a big pcp meme now will there be questioners rules episode uh on the

3177
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:23,040
podcast like like commenter and reviewer rules i think that would be funny and possibly a decent

3178
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:28,960
topic i could see doing it i what i would want to do is i want i would want to like replace the

3179
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:33,760
question section of an episode with questioner rules so we can have like a dual topic kind of

3180
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:37,680
because because i don't know if we have enough to say that will fill like an entire episode

3181
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:43,040
but i don't know about that okay okay to like to like address how bad the questions are i think

3182
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:47,120
we could do that i'm in favor of doing i think that would be cool i think that'd be some idea

3183
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:51,120
such a boner killer to have a whole episode on like questioner rules and then have to take

3184
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:56,160
the shitty questions after laying it all out but they perfect perfect examples of what what how to

3185
02:37:56,160 --> 02:38:02,400
do it wrong which i'm sure it will be without a cable out of town maybe um all right well you

3186
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:09,600
know what uh this is okay this is an interesting question grace you asks i got my masters and

3187
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:14,720
and i guess this thing and i'm still struggle oh and i still struggle to get a job how can you

3188
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:21,120
really stand out fancier resume formatting interview tips so okay well if we're the ones

3189
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:25,680
to be asking about this yeah yeah i like there's a million things you could say about this i just

3190
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:29,760
i thought this was a heartfelt question that this person's looking for for information on

3191
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:34,720
a little help so just i don't know my my thoughts on this are damn you already got a masters and

3192
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:39,120
you're struggling to get a job okay here's my here's my real question okay like what's the masters in

3193
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:43,520
i assume there's not a lot of demand for it uh i mean i suppose you could be shit and you could

3194
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:51,280
be like bad that's entirely possible um okay like there's no cheat to like one one weird old tip

3195
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:57,840
to like stand out or anything i would say what what people want is just competency at the at the

3196
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:02,080
end of the day they're gonna take whoever looks like they're best at the job so like how do you

3197
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:06,320
demonstrate that here's what i would do i don't know what your field is for me like one thing

3198
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:11,280
that really impressed people when i was applying for programming jobs was the work i did on my own

3199
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:16,720
outside work just the side programming stuff i had going on so i don't know maybe you're like a

3200
02:39:17,360 --> 02:39:20,640
maybe you're a fucking writer or something you're trying to get like some job writing for a magazine

3201
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:26,000
or something like have a blog have written to it try to make it popular you know just you know go

3202
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:31,040
through the motions of doing the thing that they want like nobody wants a college kid who's only

3203
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:34,880
learned a bunch of bullshit that probably isn't practically applicable they want someone who's

3204
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:40,240
in the fucking trenches already and they know can easily plop into a slot so what like resume

3205
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:44,560
formatting interview tips like i don't know if you have like terrible time interviewing and

3206
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:48,720
you're constantly fucking it up then like yeah obviously you should work on that in in whatever

3207
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:53,120
way i'm sure there's lots of resources for that fancier resume formatting man we're just we're

3208
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:59,760
beating around the edges the core issue is have be able to tell them why you're great and how you're

3209
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:04,560
perfect for this and all that shit like you want them to believe that you're worth the job

3210
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:12,880
do you believe that you're worth the job good yeah yeah you gotta you gotta impress him a little

3211
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:17,920
peacocking in terms of what you can do does not hurt you never heard that's right that's right

3212
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:23,840
kstep in the questions bar asks thoughts on the tick with take your dog we were actually playing

3213
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:28,720
on doing i thought we should do that as the topic today nobody wanted to do it because they didn't

3214
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:32,720
want to get into the weeds of the drama i didn't even want to talk about the drama literally just

3215
02:40:32,720 --> 02:40:37,920
figured out how we can do well okay tig with a bring it up is inherently linked because it's

3216
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:43,520
popular right now it's a property talk about right now because the drama i mean i know i just figured

3217
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:48,800
it out here's how we can do an episode about the episode will be called internet content creator

3218
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:55,040
group incompetence or maybe somebody shorter that way we can compare and contrast our own

3219
02:40:55,040 --> 02:41:00,000
competence or lack thereof to tig with tags because there's a lot of times where i'm thinking

3220
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:05,760
man we sure are a lot less masturbatory here's here's my i mean there are many differences

3221
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:09,920
and i guess there's some similarities but like right out of the gate here here are my thoughts

3222
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:17,440
on the tig with take doc kstep i have not read it and i am not a lawyer i have i don't trust anyone

3223
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:23,840
who just says i had x experience i demand evidence before i think anything about anyone

3224
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:31,040
and to do otherwise anyone in the world is immoral so i hope that like everyone we could what are

3225
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:34,880
you supposed to say right now like oh they're all bad because a lot of people said they were bad

3226
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:39,680
is that true where's the proof like were the police involved like there was like sexual allegations

3227
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:44,880
is any of that substantiated i don't fucking know i have no grounds to make any assessment

3228
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:49,520
whatsoever and frankly it pisses me off that people just take the word of people when they

3229
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:55,040
just assert things without evidence agreed no need to me dude don't you think it's fucked up that

3230
02:41:55,040 --> 02:42:01,440
like we think this culture now is just like an allegation can tank an entire business that's the

3231
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:07,120
problem that's the problem but and i read some of that stuff most of it is people being awkward

3232
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:12,080
and just not communicating clearly like some people have sexual crime allegations literally

3233
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:17,520
go to the cops and tell them everything and work it out it's not the court of public opinions job

3234
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:22,480
to judge if you were like abused at your job it's your job to figure it out yeah why are you like

3235
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:27,360
why am i involved i don't care at all about the um the issue of like whether or not they should

3236
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:32,160
like it should be sued or some shit like that or defamation yeah like wait what is tick with tick

3237
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:37,200
actually tanking right now as a result is channel awesome like actually like financially i believe

3238
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:41,680
that as a note like basically none of their fans gave a shit and that it didn't matter right exactly

3239
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:47,040
for me this is like a bunch of people leave the site though like i a bunch of people have been

3240
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:50,880
leaving the site for the reasons that have been explained in a document that it's it's

3241
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:56,160
shit to work for them right but for me what i take away from it is it's an interesting case study in

3242
02:42:56,160 --> 02:43:01,760
incompetence and hubris basically imagine if you listening at home have you read it do have you read

3243
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:06,480
i scammed a shitload of it and i read all of lindsay ellis's part because she's the one good

3244
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:10,560
writer in the group so okay so be aware that's what we're working with that's the information

3245
02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:15,600
not only have i said reports being referred to by davoo now okay not only have i skimmed most of it

3246
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:21,280
and a lot of it was the same complaints listed over and over again so i saw the gist of it but

3247
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:25,920
also i am the one in this group who's seen the most tick with a with like hippo at a close second i

3248
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:31,680
believe right so i do have a lot of understanding of this group i've been i mean i i've started

3249
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:38,080
following them like ten goddamn years ago right and it totally makes sense to me now imagine if you

3250
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:43,040
as in you the audience listening at home did some weird shit on the internet that somehow got

3251
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:48,400
popular and now suddenly you have all this power your dug walk or you have all this power to get

3252
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:55,520
a bunch of little spurgies flocking to your throne to mooch off of your fame and now you

3253
02:43:55,520 --> 02:44:00,480
have the power to coordinate them to do these giant skit movies together if you guys didn't know that

3254
02:44:00,480 --> 02:44:05,280
was where most of these complaints come from is is the production of the big tick with tick crossover

3255
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:10,640
movies where they did the anniversary stuff yeah and it was like making a whole movie but like you

3256
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:16,560
know home video style and people were just explaining in depth how dug and his brother rob

3257
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:22,400
and the producer mike mccodd were just totally didn't know the single first fucking thing that

3258
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:27,520
they were doing but because they were in this position of power no one could like question them

3259
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:32,480
and mike mccodd would like you know bat down anyone who did question them so dug always

3260
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:36,800
side as everything is going really well and everybody's really happy but then meanwhile

3261
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:42,480
the people working for them are like why the you didn't think to give us food on this set

3262
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:50,960
what the fuck right like oh that's so that's so retarded that like this is like the major issue

3263
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:57,680
they didn't even give us food or water on the set like this is the big issue this is what you've got

3264
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:03,680
this is the damning evidence oh my god shut the fuck up i don't care about your stupid baby problems

3265
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:09,440
fucking go to starbucks across embarrassing like it's like it's embarrassing that they would make

3266
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:13,680
such an oversight no i think it's absolutely appropriate that most tick with ticks fans don't

3267
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:18,160
care and they continue to watch the videos yes i don't think okay it does sound like mike mccodd

3268
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:22,160
might be kind of a bad person dug and robber just sort of like oh why would he be a bad person

3269
02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:28,160
what is he done because he sort of was a fucking creep about like people like being critical of the

3270
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:33,440
website not like damning critical not like defamation critical but like saying problems that they have

3271
02:45:33,440 --> 02:45:37,040
that are pretty innocuous mike mccodd would be like shut the fuck up you don't get to say that right

3272
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:41,440
or you're fired right he's a man defending his business whatever i don't know unless it is something

3273
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:46,320
directly more of a criminal on behalf of dug and rob walker they're just they were just fucking

3274
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:51,360
over privileged fucking white boys who don't understand like how to take care of shit and it

3275
02:45:51,360 --> 02:45:55,040
pissed a lot of people i don't even agree with that i don't even agree with that shit like what the

3276
02:45:55,040 --> 02:46:00,560
hell i didn't read the fucking document i don't deserve to comment on this none of us too i bet

3277
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:04,400
the people who fucking wrote the thing i don't even know half of what the fuck they're talking about

3278
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:09,760
because none of this shit's serious and it's all like little baby complaints if it's more than a

3279
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:15,040
baby complaint it should be with the fucking police it should not be the court of fucking opinion

3280
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:20,560
public opinion i just like this is such a bitch move no they're just trying to ruin the reputation

3281
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:26,400
of a fucking company and what did they really do they didn't give us fucking water on our fucking

3282
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:31,280
coffee break when we were at this big meetup thing bring a fucking water bottle go to the

3283
02:46:31,280 --> 02:46:37,680
fuck to shaws and buy one no let me explain yes i do totally agree that this is why they were able

3284
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:41,120
to be kicked around so much and and and i'm no people are gonna get mad at me because i'm sure

3285
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:44,800
there's more serious stuff than what i'm bringing up i'm just focusing on the stuff that i'm biased

3286
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:49,840
toward that's exactly why i know what you'd listen to me either no one should care to anyone on this

3287
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:55,360
issue well please go on actually like kind of have to go so like if we don't wrap up soon i'm

3288
02:46:55,360 --> 02:47:00,320
gonna have to leave okay i'll say okay i'll say yeah the thing is the reason why these people were

3289
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:05,200
kicked around is that they're all talentless fucks like almost all of tag is just non-entities right

3290
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:12,000
like there was no formula more boring that was that was brought to prominent popularity on the

3291
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:17,680
internet until the cinemasans fucking plague hit the world right so like they didn't really have

3292
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:22,640
any power they didn't have the ability to like strike out and do their own thing they were completely

3293
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:28,560
leaching off of Doug Doug's popularity so you can see in the article most of them writing their

3294
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:33,840
complaints in this document are too incompetent to make a compelling case i had to sort of unpack

3295
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:38,480
what they're saying detach what they're actually saying from what they think they're saying and

3296
02:47:38,480 --> 02:47:43,760
then come out with an accurate explanation they're putting it like we've been mistreated and abused

3297
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:49,040
and hurt and fucked them and there's a little bit of that but again Lindsay Ellis the Nostalgia

3298
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:54,320
Chick the one really talented person who ever graced that website her whole case was presented

3299
02:47:54,320 --> 02:48:01,120
much better she simply explained how Doug was not capable of arranging this shit it was disorganized

3300
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:05,360
people were like he was constantly fighting with his brother like in front of people about like

3301
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:11,280
script disappearance it was just embarrassing and wasn't so is that really what it is though

3302
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:15,760
it was just an embarrassing situation is that the crime it was embarrassing and also way too stressful

3303
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:20,240
and stupid and it could have been so much better like she even explained like i went up to Doug

3304
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:24,480
being like yo we're on a set we're not there's their first big movie was like in the middle of

3305
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:29,040
nowhere i think there weren't a whole lot of restaurants around and she said yo what about

3306
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:34,080
food and Doug was like i don't know but then like fucking spoonie came up and said well you know

3307
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:38,560
food is typically provided on a movie set and he was like maybe you're maybe you're right spoonie

3308
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:44,720
maybe i should well lock up the fucking misogynist i guess i know right what men say i know i know

3309
02:48:44,720 --> 02:48:50,480
anyway the point is it's just a story of incompetence and hubris and not realizing that like people

3310
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:57,360
aren't having nearly as much fun as you are and i totally believe that happened i believe all of that

3311
02:48:57,360 --> 02:49:02,160
i 100% believe every story in there but i just don't give a shit yeah but name because i don't

3312
02:49:02,160 --> 02:49:06,480
think these are serious problems except for the sexual allegations take them to the fucking cops

3313
02:49:06,480 --> 02:49:11,360
yeah i'm not a dude but dude like when people portray this as the fall of the nostalgia critic

3314
02:49:11,360 --> 02:49:17,440
it's like no this is just finally people are pointing fingers when they should have been all

3315
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:22,320
along like finally these i don't even like any of these people i watch this i have some positive

3316
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:25,760
feelings towards the nostalgia critic because i like them i just don't like to see fucking witch

3317
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:30,240
hunts and there's too many fucking witch hunts these days people are fucking cowards fucking

3318
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:36,480
talked i mean whether you know it never mind yeah i love this fiery name but we should leave now

3319
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:42,480
escape my right before i turn it against you okay you gotta get the fuck out of here i have nothing

3320
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:47,920
else to say on this matter anyone else want to comment on this it's gay and i like it uh i

3321
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:53,680
i agree i agree that if the allegations are criminal in nature then they should be taken up with the

3322
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:59,200
police i just really don't think the people like us the viewers have should have like any involvement

3323
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:03,840
in any of this it's like the whatever people can tell their stories if they're fucked up it's just

3324
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:09,040
the way it is presented at a point where you can do more damage to somebody on twitter than through

3325
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:13,680
legal means that's a good point tom that's a damn good point basically what i am saying here is way

3326
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:18,960
back in 2008 when this site was brand fucking new i made a blog post i made a different forum post

3327
02:50:18,960 --> 02:50:24,080
saying yo you people like don't know what you're doing this is a giant shit show of talentless

3328
02:50:24,960 --> 02:50:30,640
and everyone came down my fucking door being like oh you're being a true old band band band right

3329
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:36,320
