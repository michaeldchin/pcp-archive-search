00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello, and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello, and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It is February 21st, 2021. Hey, the numbers are the same. This is Ben Saint and Gibbontake's here and Trixie's here.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's true.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wow.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It couldn't be more true.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's got to be a good day for witchcraft.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's also true.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If there's all those same numbers in the date.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I mean, that makes sense.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, for me, it's 2102, 2021. So it's mirrored.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A palindrome.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
21.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, it's not, actually.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
02.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I found out the name for, oh god, this week I found out the name for and then forgot the name for when you have a sentence that has every letter in it.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The quick ramp box jumps over the lazy dog.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's the one that they taught me, pangram. It's a pangram.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Ooh.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But there's a better one and I saw someone use it and I was like, holy shit, that's so good.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This one is Sphinx of Black Quartz, Judge My Vow.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, now I want to write a song called pangram bars where like every bar is a pangram.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Walt's nymph for quick jigs vex is pretty good.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No, quick jigs vex bud.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's not as good.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Glib jox quiz nymph to vex dwarf.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Sphinx of Black Quartz is obviously the best one.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
By Jove, my quick study of lexicography won a prize.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Waxy and quivering, jox fumble the pizza.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wait, is it like every letter has to be used on the gas?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Waxy and quivering, jox fumble the pizza?

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Fumble, fumble, jox fumble the pizza.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Waxy.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, it's not, they don't have to only have the letter once.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
There are no, there are no sentences that have every letter only once.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You could really, you could have a really long sentence that has every letter like a hundred times.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You'd technically have a pangram, I guess.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Would there be a word for like a pangram where each letter is used the same number of times?

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That'd be a challenge.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't, I don't know.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because Vow is so much more used.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They call it a pangram-banandam.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I think the one with only once is called a perfect pangram.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it would be a semi-perfect pangram.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It'll be a perfect pangram tied to the power of something.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mmm.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mmm.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Mmm.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, that's right.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How's, how's everyone's week been?

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Good.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, I've been.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Good.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was, I was against crypto before because of, of the old like the, the stress of, of like buy low sell high.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I've, I've taken Digi's advice and I'm doing a long-term thing.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Good.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I've purchased, I purchased a hundred pounds of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And they've, they've been slowly going up and I'm just looking at it.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wow.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Nice, nice long-term investment.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wow.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They went up this week.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Cool.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And you know what?

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They might go up even more.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They might.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
They very well might.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We'll all find out together here on the PCP.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I, I keep, I keep, I keep struggling with, I keep struggling with, should I, should I,

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
last time I invested, it didn't go super great.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Obviously selling at that point was a mistake.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And now I'm just like, should I, is now, should I reinvest now?

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Or, or is it, is it, is this as high as it's going to go?

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I know it's been going up for like a while, but it can only, it can only do that for so

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
long.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So I just, I just don't know.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
At some point there will be a dip and that would be when I would buy in if I were you is

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
whenever there is a dip, just buy the dip, don't worry about if it keeps going down, just

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
worry about if it eventually goes back up.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I, I've been thinking about it in a, in a sort of different way because I've been the,

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the app I'm using is Coinbase and you can, you can track like the price of Bitcoin over

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the past hour, day, week, month, year and all time.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And if I look at like, if I'm focusing on the hourly thing, it looks like it's tanking.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It looks like it's going so low right now.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's crazy how much fluctuation there is on the hourly scale.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But then you go to the weekly and it's like, Oh, the dip is so small compared to the gains

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
it's made in the past week, it's unbelievably small.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So like when it starts going down, the, the, the natural impetus is to be like, Oh shit,

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it's going down better sell now so that assuming that it continues to go down.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And then you realize later with hindsight that every peak before it goes down because it

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
just is really fluctuating.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It goes down for a bit quite sharply.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And then it goes and then it goes back up in a similar like sharpness and just goes past

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the previous peak and it just has been doing that.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I feel like, I feel like a lot of people are like waiting for Bitcoin because Bitcoin is

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
like so unbelievable at the moment.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Like the first peak was quite huge and it made cryptocurrency so normal.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Like put it on the map, put people's attention on it and that has been dwarfed by how much

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is growing currently that people are thinking, Oh, if it crashes and if I invest then I'll

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
become a super billionaire because now I know that cryptocurrency is something that is worth

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
investing in.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But because of that, I don't think it would ever dip so low ever again.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because I don't think it'll ever get catastrophically low.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So I feel like it's kind of stable now because of how famous it is.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's not stable.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, not super stable.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't think it's going to dip to 2017-18 levels.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, I don't think it'll go that low again.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But it could go down to something like 20 maybe.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A couple of interesting things about the future of Bitcoin is that there is a limit of how

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
much Bitcoin there will ever be and every year there is less and less of it produced.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So eventually all the Bitcoin will be in circulation.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So there's other coins are largely built off of Bitcoin's network or Ethereum's network,

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
which is to propel the faster sale of Bitcoin.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's all such a weird system where everything feeds into each other.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The more you read into what the coins actually do, it's a weird infrastructure.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But as they grow, all of them will grow because of the fact that they are connected to each other.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The existence of Chainlink and Ethereum makes Bitcoin better.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So if Bitcoin keeps going up, those things, you know,

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
assumably, unless something were to replace them that did what they did even better,

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But I think that so much of it is like...

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Because I know XRP's whole thing is that it's like its own separate different network

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that is all about the fact that they are installed in banks.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't trust XRP for a lot of reasons.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I mean, we have a history there.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I had some of it briefly.

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I sold it when it was up, the one time it was up,

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but it always is like minor fluctuations and the so-called promise of its eventual being

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
so mainstream with usage in banks that its value has to appreciate,

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
which is just what the people shilling it say.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But so when it comes to looking at the hourly stuff,

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I really think that that starts to matter to people when you've got $45,000 invested in something

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and if it goes up that hour and then you sell some of it while it's up,

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you're actually making thousands of dollars and those little micro things actually matter.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But I had a period where I had a system of...

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I had six different cryptos and any time one of them would go up by $4 from what I started with,

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I would spend that $4 in whichever one was down at the moment.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Doing that, I could make net a couple dollars a week by just the process of occasionally trading every couple of days,

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
but it's literally nickel and diamond, but it can be fun.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, but at a certain point, there's fees, right?

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Like the transaction fees.

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's why I would only do it when it was above a certain dollar amount.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because the more you are trading the lower the fees.

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So I would only trade at amounts where I thought it was worth the fee and I'd calculated that.

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I spent a week just staring at these fucking metrics until I felt like I understood the ebb and flow of them.

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, that was my week when I was way in.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was terrible. I hated it. It was so bad.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
A big reason why I haven't reinvested.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I was greatly enjoying myself, but I didn't have any money to put into it.

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And this was at a time...

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Chainlink happened in August, which is when I was trying to do a whole bunch of other shit to make money,

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
because I didn't have any money.

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I was like, maybe if I get on this Chainlink thing early enough, maybe it'll give me some money.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And it did, but only enough to put back into fucking around with coins.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So I spent a week doing that I really shouldn't have at a time when I didn't need to be doing it,

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
but it's paid off now because I've got like an extra thousand dollars in fucking coins from that.

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Pretty good. Pretty good.

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, putting large amounts of money in it increases the reward, but it also increases the stress.

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I put £200 in.

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Mentally, I've decided that it's like, oh, this video game called Cryptocurrency, it costs £200.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I've just bought a video game.

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's a fun way to look at it.

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And I'm okay with it. It is gone.

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And I know that I've invested £200. This is an S-run number, so I can look at how much higher it is than £200.

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The moment's at £240.

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I've made £40 if I cash out now.

176
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But I don't really want to go in and out because I just want to watch it.

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's nice that you also don't have to cash out all your money at any time.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can literally cash out the extra 40 you made just to spend it.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought if Bitcoin is on the up, but if it goes in a majestic spike and it's like,

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
oh, suddenly I have thousands, then I will definitely take out enough money to reimburse my initial investment at the very least.

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then beyond that, it would be like, hey, that's pretty cool.

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But if it all crashes down and I end up with nothing, then I'm like, well, whatever.

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It was fun while it lasted.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It was fun. I saw a number go up for a while and it wasn't stressful because it wasn't a lot of money, so it's okay.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I am cursed. I am cursed because you say the more you put in, the more stressed.

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's true, but not just while it's in forever now because I had put in a couple thousand dollars into Bitcoin for a while.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If I kept it in, it would have almost doubled at this point.

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So now the fact that I'm seeing it go up when I'm not, I don't have it.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Ben, you should just buy it as soon as possible to get this fucking bandaid off.

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You have to replace this sorrow in your life.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It was bad before. It was bad while I was in. It was bad while I was in and it'll be bad and it's bad now that I'm out.

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm totally doomed no matter what I do.

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Think of your first investment in Bitcoin as a child that didn't make it to birth.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He failed a botched abortion.

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You couldn't make it out.

196
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Are you going to give up on ever trying to have another baby after that, Ben?

197
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't know. I don't know.

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I mean, I know it's going to keep going higher, but it could also crash.

199
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It could also crash and that could happen in a week.

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It could happen in a year and I just, I don't know.

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I would just be like hold until it comes back.

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't know.

203
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
OK, I lost money on the GameStop thing, right?

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I put money into my Fidelity account.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I invested it in GameStop. GameStop crashed, of course.

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So now I've got like a fraction of what I put in there.

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You know, I just cashed it out.

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So cementing my losses once and for all, it's fine.

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The way that I have consoled myself is that I think I'm going to put that like couple hundred bucks that I have left.

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I think I'm going to put it into my 401K so that, you know, when that matures,

211
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
it will be worth even more than what I initially invested into GameStop.

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So who backs a 401K? Is that like through your bank or what?

213
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I have an account with Fidelity. I think they just do it.

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Is that an insurance company?

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't know what they are.

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think they're a bank and they do trading, stock trading, and like they're like a mutual fund

217
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and they have my 401K and they take my 401K money and they have an algorithm that trades it on the market.

218
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So it's been appreciating for over the last few years.

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Are they a healthy company? Have they been doing well?

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I mean, I don't know how they're like stock performances, but they're like a pretty old company for a long, long time.

221
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What happens to your 401K if Fidelity goes belly up before you get the chance to use it?

222
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I would assume that it dies, but I mean, I think Fidelity is a pretty established institution.

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I feel like Fidelity is one of those too big to fail.

224
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
How will established are we talking?

225
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Like how many years?

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I mean, good question.

227
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like what's 80 years if you're going to live another 50 years? You know what I mean?

228
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Wait, what? What's 80 years if I'm going to live another 50 years?

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah, like 80 years of sort of like a business having survived is like not that much in the grand scheme of things, you know?

230
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Like you got 50 ahead of you for the world to make undergo massive change, you know?

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's true.

232
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If we have technological singularity, I don't know if Fidelity is going to be around, but cryptocurrency will.

233
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I mean, maybe.

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay, well, I would say that, yeah, it's true.

235
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Who knows what will happen in 50 years, but Fidelity won't be the first to die.

236
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Probably not.

237
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Other institutions will die for.

238
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It has been around, it was founded in 1946, so it is 75 years old.

239
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So kind of old.

240
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Very solid guess on my part.

241
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I what? Yeah, true.

242
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know.

243
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I mean, yeah, Fiat currency could just become obsolete at some point.

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But who knows?

245
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I mean, if that happens, we've probably got bigger problems.

246
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm going to be curious to hear what the comment section thinks of this.

247
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The last one, there were some people who were like, yes, Digi, who quote in the latest video says,

248
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have no money is talking about investment.

249
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Great.

250
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And then there was someone else who was like, Digi, you're fighting the good fight.

251
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You saved these boys from hating crypto.

252
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Like it would have been a nightmare.

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I didn't hate it.

254
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I had crypto, but I had crypto before.

255
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I just fucked up with it.

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The buy low sell high within such a small timeframe that I have an issue with

257
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
because it just introduces too much negative aspects to life in general

258
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
that I just don't want to think about it too much.

259
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Long term is much nicer.

260
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I can just put it in there and occasionally look at it.

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't think people should be trying to make short term investments

262
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
unless they're playing with like fuck tons of money, basically.

263
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
When Bitcoin peaked around 40 before and then it started going down

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and then I was like, I can't, I have too much in here.

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I can't afford to lose it.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm cashing out while I'm just broken even when it was going down.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I was, I read like interviews with people.

268
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I read like articles and some guy was like, yeah, it's probably going to go down

269
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
a little bit more.

270
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm going to wait until it goes a little lower and then I'm going to reinvent.

271
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I was waiting for it to go down to like 20 and then I was going to reinvest.

272
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And of course it never went that low.

273
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It immediately just started spiking again.

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I think what it is is that people see it going low

275
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and there's loads of people waiting to get into Bitcoin,

276
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
but they know that it's high now.

277
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So they're waiting for it to go low and they don't know when.

278
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They don't have patience to wait for it to go very low.

279
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So they start buying immediately and it just goes right back up.

280
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
People are like, oh shit, it was high and now it's going down.

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This is my time.

282
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No patience.

283
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The ideal situation is that everybody does just continually do that

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
until everyone has Bitcoin.

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then people remember that you can spend Bitcoin,

286
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
like regardless of converting it back into dollars in lots of places.

287
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Most of the other ones you can't really like most coins like are best used

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
for trading for other coins or just cashing out with.

289
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Bitcoin, there's like a website that lets you just trade Bitcoin

290
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
for what are they called?

291
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Gift cards for basically anywhere.

292
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So you can just buy a gift card and then go to that store's online store

293
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and use that sort of a roundabout method.

294
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But there's like...

295
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So actually, do you have like an actual Bitcoin wallet?

296
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't have a...

297
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Like, I mean, I have wallets do various websites.

298
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I have like my own independent wallet that doesn't have anything in it.

299
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I think I only really have money through wallet websites.

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Are you invested through like Coinbase or Robinhood or something?

301
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah, I have a bunch in Coinbase and a bunch in Uphold,

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
which is Uphold is what does all the transactions for basic attention tokens.

303
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So that's why I ended up with that as well.

304
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I have an Uphold account.

305
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Okay, so I mean, you don't actually own the Bitcoin.

306
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You're invested in Bitcoin, but you don't actually have Bitcoin

307
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
to like spend through websites and stuff.

308
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You can spend the stuff that's in those website wallets.

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Like, you just get the code for that wallet and then, you know...

310
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Well, this is what I'm confused about,

311
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
because I saw there was like an app associated with Coinbase,

312
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
which is like decentralized wallet thing.

313
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You can put your Coinbase money into that.

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And they didn't explain why I would need to do that.

315
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's basically what Ben's talking about is like,

316
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
if you have your own wallet, then your money is...

317
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You can have a physical wallet that is basically like a USB stick

318
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
that you plug in and it will store the crypto literally in that

319
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
so that it would not be like hackable for a minute.

320
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Like, if Coinbase got hacked,

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
somebody could take my money from Coinbase, I guess.

322
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Whereas if it was in an individual wallet,

323
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
they would have to hack my wallet, which is very unlikely

324
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
unless they like found all the codes and knew about it somehow.

325
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Like, you know, that's basically why.

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Cyber security.

327
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Cyber space.

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Hack the system.

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Hack the mainframe.

330
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Don't quote me on that though.

331
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There might be other reasons to have a crypto wallet.

332
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't have one, so I'm not going to speak with authority on the subject.

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I downloaded a Dogecoin wallet, like when Dogecoin was spiking,

334
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and I think it is still syncing to the fucking blockchain.

335
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Sinking?

336
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And I don't even know what that means.

337
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah.

338
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Like, I downloaded it and it was like, before you can use this wallet,

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
it has to sync itself to the blockchain and it's still going.

340
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Like, it's still not done.

341
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Is there a way to, like, start over, like, quit and try again?

342
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Well, I think that would just, it would just have to do it all over again.

343
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I feel like maybe it's failed. How long has it been going for?

344
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It might actually, I think I restarted my computer at some point,

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
so I don't know if it's actually running right now.

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But it was going for, like, weeks.

347
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It was just, like, the little bar was just ticking up.

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And I don't even know how to use it.

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't even know how to purchase Dogecoin in a wallet.

350
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Right.

351
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I mean, there's probably a guide somewhere.

352
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Initially, I will say that the existence of stuff like Coinbase and Uphold

353
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
has made this a lot easier because, like,

354
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
initially I was trying to fuck around with, like, all the different,

355
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
because, like, Brave has a built-in wallet,

356
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
so if you use the Brave browser wallet, you have that one.

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And then, separately, I had an Uphold wallet.

358
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Like, I thought that the Brave attention to the,

359
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
or basic attention tokens I was collecting through Brave

360
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
would be in my Brave wallet, but they were not stored there.

361
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Nothing has been in there.

362
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And then I had, like, separately a wallet that I first got

363
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
when I set up my Ethereum two years ago.

364
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So, like, yeah.

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Having just, like, easily accessible websites made this much less of a fucking nightmare.

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But I guess it's...

367
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I don't know the security levels by comparison, but...

368
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Anyway, enough about fucking Bitcoin.

369
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This is a hate currency.

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Bitcoin.

371
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Bitcoin.

372
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah, more like Bitcoin.

373
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, fuck you.

374
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What do we have?

375
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
$558k.

376
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay, that's cool.

377
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
All right, that's only, that's...

378
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, how many thousands of dollars have I missed out on?

379
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No, you've got to stop thinking like that.

380
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

381
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
No.

382
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yes.

383
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Probably, like, six grand.

384
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Probably, like, six grand you missed out on.

385
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Six or seven grand.

386
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Maybe thereabouts.

387
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Maybe six or seven.

388
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Maybe eight, nine, like ten.

389
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Five, five-ish.

390
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Maybe 15, 20.

391
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
100.

392
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
100,000.

393
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
20.

394
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
20.

395
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
14.

396
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
0.

397
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Billions.

398
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If only, if only I had, if only I had invested a pizza's worth of Bitcoin back in 2003,

399
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
then I would have $18 billion right now.

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah, well...

401
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If only I was born in the wrong generation, I would have grown up to be wealthier probably.

402
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
True.

403
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah, if only I was a boomer, I could have gone to college for $5,000.

404
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I could have bought a house for, like, 2P.

405
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But gotten a job as an executive bank CEO based on my third grade reading level.

406
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Oh, I saw that.

407
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's sweet.

409
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You know, similar to, I think this really was brought on by the crypto was, I was like,

410
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
ah, number go up.

411
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Hmm.

412
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You know what else number go up?

413
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
My age.

414
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Idol games.

415
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm going to die.

416
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
No.

417
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
No.

418
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It was an idol game.

419
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It was playing Clicker Heroes again.

420
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And now, I'm vegetable.

421
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's like saying I'm baby, but I'm vegetable.

422
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,880
That happened to me last week with Minesweeper and then again today for like four hours before

423
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,760
the podcast when I read the comments on last week and then was reminded of Minesweeper.

424
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
I'm just playing Clicker Heroes so much.

425
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
I'm getting so many coins.

426
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm leveling up my heroes.

427
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
It's so fucking cool.

428
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I had a great run of Noida yesterday where I was incredibly powerful.

429
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
I was tearing through the game.

430
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,760
I was obliterating the game, but I was greedy and I needed some mana spells.

431
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
I needed some mana regeneration spells.

432
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,760
That was going to be like, that was going to make put me over the edge, make me invincible.

433
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
The most powerful being.

434
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
So I knew of it.

435
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
I knew of a trek.

436
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,760
There's a secret zone where you can go to find this magic hourglass and if you put a substance

437
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,760
called teleportation in this hourglass, it will bring you to a secret chamber that has powerful

438
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
spells in it.

439
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
And I was like, I could get some really good shit in there.

440
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,760
So I went down to the bottom of the temple of the art, which is the last normal level in the game

441
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,760
because there was a big pool at the bottom of teleportation because these certain wizards

442
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
bleed teleportation when you kill them.

443
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,760
And I'd killed a bunch of these wizards and all their blood had pooled at the bottom of the level.

444
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,760
So I kept going down there and jumping into this pool of teleportation with a bottle trying to bottle it.

445
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,760
But every time I would get a little bit and then it would teleport me away randomly.

446
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
So I kept doing that, just trying to be patient.

447
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,760
And then the last time I jumped in with my bottle about half full and I go down there into the pool

448
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
and then I'm in there and it teleports me.

449
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,760
But this time it teleports me down under the level into the lava sea that leads to hell.

450
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,760
And I'm instantly incinerated and I die.

451
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,760
And it was pretty fucking funny.

452
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
Live and learn, I guess.

453
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Live and learn.

454
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
Hanging on the edge of tomorrow.

455
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
I didn't think it would send me that far.

456
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Die and learn.

457
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
More like.

458
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Oh yeah, yeah, true.

459
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Live and die and learn and live again and become a powerful alchemist.

460
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,760
And don't fuck with teleportation.

461
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Just don't do it.

462
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Yeah.

463
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
It's a cool name though.

464
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
I like that name.

465
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,760
I have found many secrets.

466
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Many, many secret tricks.

467
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Many secret tricks to use the various alchemical substances with in that game.

468
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
And it's very satisfying.

469
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,760
It's very satisfying because you can find this stuff in bottles.

470
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,760
Just like from the very beginning you'll start and you'll be like,

471
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,760
why am I finding a bottle of pheromones?

472
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
What the fuck do I need this shit for?

473
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Ambrosia?

474
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
What the fuck?

475
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Teleportation?

476
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Worthless garbage.

477
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
And then you find this weird stuff to do with it.

478
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Like you find, oh, if I bring pheromone to the Hisi base and if I, if I squirt it on a healer,

479
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
the healer will become my friend and then he'll heal me and stuff like that.

480
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,760
And, you know, I can use Ambrosia to circumvent the curse damage that I used to go through the cursed rock

481
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,760
that leads between parallel worlds and stuff.

482
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
What a fucking game.

483
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
What a fucking game.

484
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,760
I've been seeing, there's like new additions being made to it in the beta branch

485
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,760
that I guess you can play although I don't know how to do it.

486
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,760
But they're, they're, they're adding all kinds of crazy new shit.

487
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
It's so fucking cool.

488
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,760
I've been watching a lot of Noida, like YouTubers.

489
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
There are a few.

490
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
It's pretty cool.

491
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,760
A lot of them also do like Minecraft stuff and, and Terraria stuff.

492
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Well, there are a lot of them dabble in Noida.

493
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,760
But I love watching people like make experimental wand builds that do like,

494
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,760
that do like quintillions of damage because of all these like multiplier effects.

495
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Big number.

496
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Yeah, the biggest number.

497
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Yeah.

498
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Like if, yeah, like the, the final boss of the game,

499
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I think he's got like a few thousand HP to start with.

500
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,760
But if you collect the orbs of knowledge, then he will become more and more powerful.

501
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
And the most you can get is 33.

502
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,760
And then when you have 33 orbs, he has like trillions of health.

503
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,760
So you have to like, you know, to kill them then you have to have like high level

504
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,760
wand craft skills that like, like double quadruple quintuple, you know,

505
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,760
over and over again, your damage output or you just can't even touch him.

506
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Great game.

507
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Great game.

508
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,760
That's all I have to say about it.

509
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,760
On Clicker Heroes right now, I'm working with big numbers, much bigger than that.

510
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,760
In fact, it makes your own numbers look stupid.

511
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
It's tiny.

512
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
I think at the moment.

513
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
Clicker Heroes.

514
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,760
At the moment, I've got my, my damage output among all my heroes is 3.771.

515
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Euler's number to the power of 231.

516
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
I think that's Euler's number.

517
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
It's just E.

518
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,760
I don't know what E is, but it's more than like sextillion at least.

519
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Why would you play Clicker Heroes or you can just play Cookie Clicker?

520
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Because Clicker Heroes has a more satisfying like strategy to like progress quickly.

521
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Then Clicker Heroes, then Cookie Clicker.

522
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
And also it's a Steam game.

523
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:33,760
So I can, I can block it with the block that I have for Steam.

524
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,760
So that I, so that I can't play it.

525
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,760
You can't play it.

526
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,760
During the week, which is when my block period starts.

527
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Hmm.

528
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Block chain.

529
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Cryptocurrency.

530
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

531
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,760
I should block, I should block myself from looking at Bitcoin prices because it's just making me unhappy.

532
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,760
You should chain yourself to not be looking at it.

533
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,760
I should chain myself to a rock and let the buzzards peck my liver out until eternity.

534
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Chain yourself to a cinder block.

535
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Good.

536
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,760
And then jump down to a pool and you teleported into a lava sea.

537
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Teleported into a lava sea.

538
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
Ah, circles within circles.

539
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
The way, this is really cool.

540
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
The way to get to hell.

541
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,760
The way, or the way that I've managed to get to hell is I use a spell called lava to blood.

542
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:29,760
And I go down underneath the world to the lava sea and I fire projectiles that cause the lava to turn to blood.

543
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,760
And then the blood gets hardened into volcanic rock.

544
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,760
And then you dig through this tunnel you make out of blood and volcanic rock.

545
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,760
You go down through the sea and then you get to hell.

546
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Why is it turned into rock if it's blood?

547
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I don't know. When you when you put blood on lava, it turns into volcanic rock.

548
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Like water plus lava makes rock.

549
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,760
If you put water on lava, it turns into rock.

550
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,760
If you put brine in lava, it turns into glowing rock.

551
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,760
So, and if you put toxic sludge, it turns into toxic rock.

552
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,760
When you're a high level alchemist like me, you just know these things.

553
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,760
I've never watched full metal alchemists, but I've heard that that's a good one.

554
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,760
It is very good. You would definitely enjoy it, especially Brotherhood.

555
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,760
I watched the old series. I never watched the Brotherhood remake. I've heard it's better.

556
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,760
I don't know which one you would like more, Ben, because the first one's a lot weirder.

557
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:35,760
The second half of it is completely different from the original and just goes into such bizarre dimensions.

558
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
I thought the first one had a really good ending.

559
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,760
If you like the ending of the first show, you will like the first show more, I think.

560
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,760
I hated the ending of the first show at the time I watched it. I haven't rewatched it since,

561
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,760
but everybody I know who likes the first one more is a big fan of the ending,

562
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,760
and that's pretty much like the divisive factor, because Brotherhood is so much more traditional.

563
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:03,760
It has like a 14 episode climax of just everybody getting their own fight,

564
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,760
like all the big rivalries getting wrapped up, very satisfying shonen action type climax.

565
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,760
That's totally nothing like what the original show had.

566
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,760
When you say the ending, do you mean how they go through the portal and they come to the real world?

567
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Like I said, the whole second half of the original show is completely different.

568
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Literally anything regarding Dante is a totally made up character for that series.

569
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
Which one's Dante?

570
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,760
She was like the main bad guy who sends them to the other world at the end.

571
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Wait, what?

572
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
I don't even remember her. What the fuck?

573
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Yeah, there was a lot of shit going on, dude. That show was crazy.

574
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
It was a lot of shit.

575
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Dante.

576
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,760
I remember seeing like a fucking...

577
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Oh, she sucks. Oh, she's pointless. I don't like her.

578
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:06,760
There was this video by I think someone who made a pony analysis of an animation cycle,

579
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,760
and he made a full metal alchemist video about like,

580
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,760
this is how the blocking of the scene influences your eye so that you notice this thing.

581
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
And I'm like, oh, that's cool.

582
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Brotherhood is good, but it's different, and it doesn't have those scenes.

583
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,760
I'm like, hmm, I don't know. I kind of like full by three shows, just aesthetically.

584
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,760
That's kind of the main point of contention between the two is that the first one is aesthetically superior,

585
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:41,760
because studio bones really was trying to make it a really fleshed out feeling series.

586
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:50,760
There's just way more filler, but the filler is good, and it's well animated and looks nice.

587
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,760
There's a lot of stuff in the performance is really good.

588
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,760
The original series is pretty tight.

589
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,760
There's some filler in the beginning.

590
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,760
There's a bunch of side stories, like that one with the guy who makes the puppet of his wife or whatever.

591
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,760
That's all fine and dandy.

592
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,760
And then about halfway through, when it starts to be the second half, it's all very tight.

593
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
It's all relevant.

594
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,760
The plot just keeps rolling along.

595
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Brotherhood is much more plot focused right from the start, where it doesn't have the filler elements.

596
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,760
There's strengths and weaknesses to it, because I don't want to spoil anything for Hippo,

597
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:42,760
but there's a certain very famous character death that happens 24 episodes into the original show,

598
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,760
like 12 into Brotherhood.

599
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,760
It has way less emotional impact in Brotherhood than it did in the original show,

600
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,760
and that's something that people will point to as one of the highlight moments.

601
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,760
That's the thing everyone remembers from the original show, is death.

602
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,760
There's so much stuff that happens later in Brotherhood that that's pretty much where the story is.

603
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,760
There's two different deaths that could be what you're talking about.

604
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:16,760
The story is kind of diverged around what in Brotherhood is like episode 14, 15,

605
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,760
and what in the original is like episode 26, but that's the same amount of story is covered in that time,

606
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
and then they completely go in different directions.

607
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Brotherhood is 65 episodes, so there's just way the hell more, way more characters,

608
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,760
way more factions, way bigger adventure.

609
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,760
It's more like Avatar, The Last Airbender, like that kind of plot progression,

610
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,760
whereas the original show really gets like...

611
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Yeah, it's actually, it felt like a lot more at the time, you know?

612
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,760
65 was just a more daunting number back then, I guess.

613
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Yeah, I mean, I watched, I've seen half of Legend of the Galactic Heroes, so...

614
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Oh, really?

615
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Yeah, yeah, I watched.

616
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,760
I wanted to finish it, it was really good.

617
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Like the climax that happened, there's like a climax halfway through that's really good,

618
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
and I was like, whoa, what a development, I didn't see that coming.

619
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,760
And then I meant to keep going, and I just never did.

620
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,760
It's a hard one to keep up with, because there's so much you got to like keep inside your brain as you go.

621
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Yeah.

622
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
And like keep track of it.

623
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,760
I was engaged the whole time.

624
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,760
I really wanted to keep going.

625
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
I think it would be a good show for that.

626
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Yeah, it's good.

627
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,760
It's a pretty good one, it's a pretty good show.

628
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Is Legend of the Galactic Heroes the one with the man with the hair, and he's like,

629
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,760
I'm from the 70s, like that guy?

630
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,760
That's the one, I don't know.

631
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,760
And he's got an eye patch and a jacket, and he's like...

632
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
No, you're thinking of Captain Harlock.

633
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
Oh, yeah.

634
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Legend of the Galactic Heroes is like the most super serious space war story ever.

635
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:05,760
It's like, everyone refers to each other with like extensive honorifics and shit, like some...

636
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,760
It's a little bit like Game of Thrones and space.

637
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Yeah, Game of Thrones is a really good comparison.

638
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Is it similar in any way to space runaway Eadion?

639
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,760
Probably a lot less wacky than Eadion.

640
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Like I said, it's very straight laced, it's very like prim and proper.

641
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,760
I posted a shot.

642
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Pride and prejudice and anime.

643
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Narratively, it is pretty much just like Game of Thrones in terms of like being the kind of plot to play.

644
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Wait, I think...

645
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,760
There's a lot of episodes that are dedicated to political maneuvering.

646
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,760
And I was like, okay, whatever, and I never went to the second one.

647
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,760
There's a lot of political maneuvering and there's a lot of like military strategy.

648
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Like, oh, you know, this army was like, you know, routed from behind with a sneak attack,

649
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,760
a pincer attack from the other guys and all, but then a third faction intervened.

650
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,760
And, you know, we use this method to circumvent it and da da da da.

651
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
It's cool, man.

652
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
It's heavily based in history.

653
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:17,760
It's like, it's meant to be like a historical record of this battle that actually happens, you know?

654
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,760
A record of Lodos war, if you will.

655
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,760
It is kind of similar to a record of Lodos war in that one.

656
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Wait, I've only seen, I've seen like, wasn't there two record of Lodos war?

657
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,760
I think I've seen like the second one that was like shorter and was only like six episodes.

658
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:42,760
And was just like, some like really generic like fantasy, like there's an elf and a wizard and a warrior that go into a dungeon.

659
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,760
It's total, the, there's like one half of it is just, or I guess one of them, because I saw it as like,

660
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,760
I think there are two six episode OVA's that were compiled into like one 12 episode release in America.

661
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,760
And I do remember like the first half just being like completely fucking boring and generic,

662
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,760
and the second half being like political and kind of interesting.

663
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,760
But like my, it was cramming a lot into a little bit of space.

664
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:16,760
So it's not like, when I was a kid, when I was a kid, and I went to that summer camp program where I got to play D&D.

665
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:24,760
My D&D counselor showed us all like one day of like one week of the program.

666
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:33,760
He like made us watch a record of Lodos war as an example of like, here is an example of all these different like characters in a party,

667
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,760
like, you know, contributing their unique ability to like beat the adventure.

668
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Yeah.

669
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:47,760
And then he made us watch the sword fight scene from Princess Bride as an example of like combat in an RPG isn't just about rolling dice,

670
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,760
you know, it's an opportunity to, you know, like express your character's personality and whatever.

671
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
That guy was such a fucking nerd.

672
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,760
Yeah, that sounds like the nerdiest, but also most adorable thing I've ever heard about him.

673
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Yeah.

674
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:11,760
He had the rule that I think more people should play with where if you ask if you can do something, you automatically do it.

675
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Because he like couldn't stand characters being like, oh, I come to a hole and there's like, there's a cliff, right?

676
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
There's a gap in the floor.

677
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Oh, can I jump over it?

678
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,760
He would be like, OK, roll the dice, you attempt to jump over it.

679
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:37,760
And he would make you follow through on it because, you know, that question is like, that question is answered with a roll of the dice and with your stats and you should just kind of, you wouldn't know that.

680
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Like it's not, you shouldn't be able to ask the DM and get an answer.

681
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,760
So it's like, fuck you, I'll punish you every time you try to like met a game like that.

682
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,760
That's that's sort of like breaks the flow in the immersion.

683
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Like if your character is thinking, hmm, can I jump that?

684
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,760
They might like, I don't know.

685
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,760
This is this is one of the reasons why I fell out of love with D&D.

686
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,760
And I don't really like it as much as I used to because kind of everybody plays like that.

687
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Everybody plays wrong.

688
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Everybody is always like to the DM like, oh, can I can I make a spot check?

689
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Can I make a spot check to see anything hidden?

690
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
It's like, shut up.

691
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
You're an imbecile.

692
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
You're a moron.

693
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
I hate you.

694
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
You say, I look around the room.

695
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
What do I see?

696
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,760
And then if there's anything to see, or maybe even if there's not, the DM should say, make a spot check.

697
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:30,760
And then you roll a spot check because the DM told you to not because you're like, hmm, I have a I have four ranks in investigation.

698
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,760
DM, can I please make an investigation check to perhaps find any clues to the mystery we are attempting to solve?

699
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Shut up.

700
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Shut up.

701
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Die.

702
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
You shouldn't be playing this game.

703
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
You're stupid.

704
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Yeah, that's sort of playing it like a single player video.

705
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Everybody plays it like that.

706
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
Everybody plays it fucking wrong.

707
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:58,760
Well, I mean, that's what happens when anything catches on and becomes mainstream, you know, as people are going to fucking just engage in a completely wrong way because they probably get something out of it.

708
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:07,760
But it's just so much less rich and pure, you know, than what the than what the chosen few with the experience.

709
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Thank you.

710
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Yes, that's people who play the video games.

711
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,760
I imagine they play them and then they get used to the experience.

712
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:27,760
And then they're not so much immersed in the world and the story so much as they are invested in gaining that's a good way of putting it and getting through to the next part without being killed.

713
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,760
And that's how they understand that that's the appeal for some people.

714
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I understand that that's the appeal for some people.

715
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,760
And like, I guess it's not wrong if you feel that way.

716
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,760
But I mean, a lot of people would argue that's even the problem with modern video games.

717
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Like, Ben, you don't like that in games.

718
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,760
You actually would rather they be more like DMs for you, right?

719
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Like, I feel like the games you play are closer to DMing and experience for you than like purely guiding you through it the way most gamers are used to now.

720
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:07,760
I think the fact that you're really into Neuter and Neuter is not like, you know, a tailored experience.

721
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
It's an experimental one.

722
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,760
So like you as the player and the character in the world are doing the same thing.

723
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,760
Like you're not trying to save the princess because you like the princess in Mario.

724
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
You're just doing it because you like jumping.

725
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Neuter is a game where there is a world, there is a world generated for you and there are many complicated systems that exist in the world that you can with skill and understanding.

726
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Utilize in order to interact with the world and accomplish things.

727
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,760
And it's very self-directed.

728
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Things like going to parallel worlds.

729
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:55,760
You just kind of got to figure it out for yourself or just like read how someone else did it and then copy them.

730
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,760
But still, even so, you got to figure it out.

731
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Did you imagine like a binding of Isaac D and D?

732
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
You enter the room.

733
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
I look around.

734
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,760
Oh, there's shit everywhere.

735
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,760
There's a fetus roll initiative.

736
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
Okay, the fetus kills you.

737
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,760
The fetus pukes blood on you.

738
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,760
And then you go into a room and it's like, oh, you've got a thingy.

739
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,760
It's like a pill or does something.

740
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
I don't know, Isaac.

741
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,760
I take the pill.

742
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,760
Okay, roll a dexterity check.

743
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,760
Oh, I failed.

744
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Okay, the pill messes up your face forever.

745
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,760
All right, cool.

746
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,760
Nice.

747
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,760
We never did the thing that I wanted to do.

748
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,760
Maybe at a Radcon or maybe not where we play a tabletop thing.

749
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,760
That was a Radcon idea that I had that never.

750
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,760
It's shocking.

751
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
It still never happened, actually.

752
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
Yeah, we were just too busy.

753
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
We just had too much fucking shit on our plates.

754
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,760
There was literally no time for it at Radcon for it.

755
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,760
We need to make it like an actual Kickstarter reward for the next one.

756
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,760
It's like a real produced fucking tabletop session or something video.

757
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Produce meaning you just have Victor there.

758
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Well, I mean like with intro music and fucking some, I don't know, visual flair.

759
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,760
Maybe draw some of the monsters.

760
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,760
We're all dressed up as period armor.

761
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,760
Or even just like having like hand drawn like maps or something, you know?

762
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,760
It's like stuff that would make the session seem extra cool and tactile.

763
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,760
Maybe.

764
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,760
I feel like I would want to just be stupid the whole time.

765
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:48,760
What if we did it with the 360 camera in the center of like the table?

766
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,760
It could be a good idea.

767
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,760
Yeah, and then it could be edited so that like the shot cuts from like between people,

768
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,760
like depending on who is talking.

769
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,760
I wonder like how good those have gotten if they've kept like updating the 360 camera technology.

770
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,760
I think that's pretty good.

771
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,760
I mean.

772
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,760
So when I had the only reason I really stopped using it is that it just kind of sucked.

773
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
It over heated.

774
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,760
Yeah, but overheat really easily and like you had to interface with it through the app.

775
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:27,760
It had no like they just had a power button and also not being able to plug a mic into it kind of sucked because like it's it has directional audio,

776
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,760
but it's just not very good.

777
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,760
So like, you know, I would want a better 360 camera if we were going to like rely on it.

778
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,760
But I'm sure they've gotten better for probably not any more expensive.

779
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Speaking of speaking of games that are a bunch of complicated systems stacked on top of each other.

780
00:47:51,760 --> 00:48:00,760
I had a I met with the endless war dev team yesterday and we discussed new features to be added in season four.

781
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,760
I made an official season four.

782
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:15,760
I'm not sure exactly if there is like a clear line between season four and season three, but we are definitely in season four or going to be in season four.

783
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,760
I don't know.

784
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,760
A global warming is going to be where we talked about adding global warming.

785
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,760
I feel like that's good.

786
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:31,760
Obviously, global warming is good and something that like everyone will be attempting to increase as much as possible.

787
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:49,760
How about this cryptid photography where it's like the museum in Animal Crossing, but you have to go to the outlands and find cryptids and take pictures of them and then turn them in to a museum and you'll get on a leaderboard if you can take really clear pictures of cryptids.

788
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,760
How the hell will like the including Goku, Goku is a cryptid.

789
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,760
How do they determine what is a good photo?

790
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,760
Does it just random?

791
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Oh, you tripped and fell and it was a blurry.

792
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,760
I'm going to say probably yes.

793
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,760
And grilling.

794
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,760
And we're going to add grilling to endless war finally.

795
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,760
Oh, you could already do grilling.

796
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,760
You can grill anything and you can eat it once it's grilled.

797
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,760
There's going to be a whole trash box mutation and then you can't eat it.

798
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,760
There needs to be like a place where all the grillers go and just hang out and grill.

799
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,760
Competitive grilling.

800
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,760
Competitive grilling.

801
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,760
I don't know if they want it to be competitive.

802
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,760
You know, you just want to grill, man.

803
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,760
You don't got to make it a whole contest and everything.

804
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,760
Just one place down and um...

805
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:51,760
No, that would be the joke is to make like just, I just want to grill to turn it into a hardcore like min-max sport.

806
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,760
That would be fucking incredible.

807
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,760
My grill gains are down. Fuck.

808
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,760
Grill gains?

809
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:06,760
Like there's just some sub-zone down in like Cratersville or something where there's just a pit full of grills and everybody's there.

810
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:14,760
Everybody's grilling. Everybody's bringing all their junk down south to be grilled and they all feast.

811
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,760
Hell yeah.

812
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,760
It's me and the boys.

813
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,760
Me and the slime boys just grilling.

814
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,760
Me and the slime salami.

815
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,760
Uh, Cratersville is... Yeah, Cratersville.

816
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,760
Cratersville will be the place for that.

817
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,760
Very base. Very good. Very exciting.

818
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,760
Uh, fun-

819
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,760
Exceedingly red-billed.

820
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,760
Absolutely true.

821
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,760
I haven't been paying attention to the happenings.

822
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,760
The last understanding I have of the law was that Endless War was asleep.

823
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,760
Like everyone was asleep because it was like going backwards in time.

824
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,760
And that presumably stopped and then the shamblers were shambling.

825
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,760
And they shambled stuff.

826
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,760
The shamblers were before the dream.

827
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,760
Okay, so they didn't come back afterwards?

828
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,760
I don't...

829
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,760
The shamblers?

830
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,760
Yeah, blue guys.

831
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,760
I don't think so.

832
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,760
I remember being really into shambling and like destroying everything.

833
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,760
I think the shamblers...

834
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,760
I think everyone hated the shamblers because they like...

835
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,760
Deleted the functionality of the game.

836
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,760
Yes, it was really funny.

837
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,760
Yeah, they literally existed to just ruin the game and make things not work anymore.

838
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,760
And it worked perfectly.

839
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,760
I don't think they came back, although I could be wrong.

840
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,760
But I mean, people still shamble, of course.

841
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
Because now shambling is an institution.

842
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,760
It was just such a...

843
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,760
Such a high stakes time because, you know, there are people who enjoy playing the game.

844
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,760
And then there is me who never really was into the game.

845
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,760
And now that there's a way to ruin it for other people, I was so into it.

846
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
And I would...

847
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
There was a time when I would like hide on the train.

848
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,760
And the train would like move from station to station.

849
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,760
People couldn't find me to kill me.

850
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,760
And I was...

851
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
That's how I would stay safe.

852
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
Because shamblers, they didn't have like a base.

853
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,760
So if a shambler just stood still for too long, somebody just killed them.

854
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,760
But if I was on a train, they had to catch the train I was on.

855
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
They never could.

856
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,760
I hated the shamblers because I would go into there...

857
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,760
Into New Los Angeles City and I would try to go to a cafe

858
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,760
and create zines of slime and punishment.

859
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,760
And every time I would go and just the cafe would have been shambled and like I couldn't use it anymore.

860
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,760
And I would just have to wait until somebody fixed it.

861
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,760
Which sometimes took a while.

862
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,760
So it really held up production on my zines for the zine store.

863
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,760
I think I put a bunch of the Load of Ghosts comics in that zine thing.

864
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,760
Like you could purchase the comic with slime.

865
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
Or potrons or something.

866
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,760
And then it would link to an imager file.

867
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,760
I know that I bought a copy of The Gamer and the Bear.

868
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,760
For my personal collection.

869
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,760
That's written by Gun Girl.

870
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,760
Written by Gun Girl.

871
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,760
It's so stupid.

872
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,760
The classic children's tale.

873
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,760
Zines were so good.

874
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,760
Who even did that?

875
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,760
Who added zines? Some fucking genius.

876
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,760
Some genius.

877
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Thank you wherever you are.

878
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,760
Well, so that was fun.

879
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:36,760
I want to publish scenes and rage against machines.

880
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,760
Is that flagpole, Citta?

881
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,760
That it is.

882
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,760
I know that because of Todd and the Shadows.

884
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
It's a good song.

885
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,760
I mean, I'd heard the song, obviously.

886
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,760
I didn't know what it was called.

887
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,760
Did he ever wonder hit Wonderland on that?

888
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Because I haven't seen it.

889
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,760
He did.

890
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,760
I was just thinking, did gun nuts get a noise that zines was used?

891
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,760
Because they have magazines and they also say zines.

892
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,760
But they probably say mags instead.

893
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,760
I know people that say zines and I hate them.

894
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:16,760
Also, there are more fucking gun zines than any other kind of zine.

895
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,760
There's more gun mags than gun zines.

896
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,760
I understand that if you see the word, it's spelled Z-I-N-E-S.

897
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:36,760
And it looks like zines unless you understand that it is a shortening of magazine,

898
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,760
in which case it's obviously zine.

899
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
It's obviously zine.

900
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
Foolish. Foolish people.

901
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,760
What if you made a Make America Great Again zine?

902
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,760
Mm-hmm, go on.

903
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,760
A magazine.

904
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,760
Oh, that's pretty cool.

905
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,760
Of course.

906
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
Well done.

907
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,760
Of course.

908
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,760
Thank you.

909
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,760
Well, I would make a million dollars.

910
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,760
So I guess I should get on that.

911
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,760
Well, now that Trump now that Trump's out, the magas are a subculture again.

912
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,760
So now they have to go to look small and do presses.

913
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,760
They have to make zines.

914
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,760
That's hilarious.

915
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,760
They're pretty obscure.

916
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,760
You probably haven't heard of them.

917
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,760
I also played video game.

918
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,760
Nice.

919
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,760
Oh, yeah?

920
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,760
Other than Minesweeper.

921
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,760
Although I am currently still playing Minesweeper.

922
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,760
And I probably will be in my grave as well.

923
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,760
Don't get it.

924
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
Go on.

925
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,760
You don't like Minesweeper?

926
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,760
It's just...

927
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,760
Not really.

928
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,760
I mean, it's fine.

929
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,760
It's a brain teaser like any other small person being.

930
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,760
It's gambling.

931
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,760
It's the same thing as gambling.

932
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,760
I don't think...

933
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,760
Okay.

934
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,760
There was a guy in the comments who said, it's not random.

935
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,760
You don't have to guess.

936
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,760
But I am stupid.

937
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,760
He doesn't know.

938
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,760
I'll need to look into if there's a Minesweeper YouTuber

939
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,760
who knows the strats and see what he does.

940
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,760
Somebody said that there is a no guessing mode

941
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,760
that gives you your first pick.

942
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,760
Which is fair enough.

943
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
But who cares about the first move?

944
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,760
If you're losing the first move, you just start again.

945
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,760
It's the fact that you can get very deep in

946
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,760
and have just a binary one or the other choice

947
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,760
and no possible way of knowing which it's going to be.

948
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,760
You're almost guaranteed to run into one of those

949
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,760
by the end of a game.

950
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,760
I don't know whether that comes into mind

951
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,760
that you can figure it out no matter what

952
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
if you think big brainily.

953
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,760
Maybe that's true.

954
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,760
It's not that.

955
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,760
There's always...

956
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Minesweeper is an easy game.

957
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,760
It turns out educated guessing,

958
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,760
but there's still guessing.

959
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,760
There's still randomness to it, no matter what you do.

960
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,760
If it was just like follow the logic,

961
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,760
the game would be very easy to win.

962
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,760
It's only hard to win because you almost always

963
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
have to guess at some point.

964
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,760
I usually try to just get to that point as quickly as possible

965
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,760
by just backing into the corners.

966
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,760
I went to no guessing mode and it gave me this.

967
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,760
It told me which one to click on it.

968
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,760
I clicked on it and this is the result.

969
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,760
Looking at this, I can tell that the best course of action

970
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,760
for me is to click something adjacent

971
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,760
to that one in the bottom right corner

972
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,760
because there are five adjacent squares to it

973
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,760
and I know that only one of them has a bomb in it.

974
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,760
That's a four out of five chance of success.

975
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
That's the best odds I have,

976
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
but it's still a four and five.

977
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,760
That's literally the odds of using Stone Edge in Pokémon.

978
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,760
Everyone knows that Stone Edge always misses.

979
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,760
Focus Blast always misses.

980
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,760
I'm guaranteed to lose.

981
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
I'm looking into it and it worked.

982
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:53,760
I think it might actually be impossible to always win.

983
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,760
It is impossible to always win.

984
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,760
I know I've played thousands and thousands of games.

985
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,760
I don't see that as inherent.

986
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,760
It doesn't ruin the game, but it's a different negative.

987
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,760
It just makes it gambling.

988
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,760
I get really excited if I win,

989
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,760
but I never feel like I won necessarily because I'm so good at it.

990
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:22,760
I feel like I won because I had a possible solution.

991
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,760
I'm playing on hard mode right now and you know what?

992
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,760
It's pretty hard.

993
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,760
Craig left the call.

994
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,760
Why?

995
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,760
My go-to puzzle brain teaser game,

996
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,760
aside from Sudoku, which is perfect, is Picross.

997
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,760
I've said this before,

998
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,760
but this is the size of the graph that I'm using.

999
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,760
I started a new game a few hours ago.

1000
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,760
I really like the deduction stuff.

1001
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,760
I guess I'm repeating myself from a few episodes ago.

1002
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,760
But Minesweeper having so much random chance

1003
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,760
puts it in a different genre of pastime.

1004
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,760
The gambling aspect is so antithetical to what I get out of these puzzle games.

1005
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,760
This just looks like Sudoku,

1006
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,760
but with the numbers on the outside instead of the inside.

1007
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,760
The way I play Minesweeper is just a reflexive game.

1008
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,760
I'm not putting any thought whatsoever.

1009
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,760
Oh, I love putting thought.

1010
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
It's just pure pound through.

1011
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,760
It's like big brain Wojak.

1012
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,760
I hate Craig so much.

1013
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:44,760
He's fucking around right now and he is going to get a pay cut.

1014
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,760
For those who don't know,

1015
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Craig is a real human being that we kill every day.

1016
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,760
We abuse him.

1017
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,760
We tell him that he sucks.

1018
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,760
Craig is Eleazar's real name, Doxt.

1019
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,760
I hate him.

1020
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,760
Craig is the voice recording bot who is just a piece of shit and doesn't fucking work.

1021
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,760
We all record our audio anyway, so whatever.

1022
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:16,760
Yeah, but this is how Craig is how we get secret bonus content

1023
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,760
for the secret bonus content episodes.

1024
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,760
So he's a vital part of the operation.

1025
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,760
Anyway, what I was saying is,

1026
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,760
what I get out of this and Minesweeper, if it were more thoughtful,

1027
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,760
is the...

1028
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,760
I want my brain to heat up and smoke to come out of my ears

1029
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,760
thinking and looking at these things like,

1030
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,760
what the fuck is the number?

1031
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,760
Where's the square go?

1032
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,760
What is it?

1033
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,760
I just want to figure it out so bad.

1034
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,760
I love that.

1035
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,760
It's my favorite thing.

1036
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,760
I like to play Picross.

1037
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:06,760
To play Picross, there's numbers on the left and the top and whatever.

1038
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:12,760
They correspond to, the numbers correspond to consecutive colored inboxes.

1039
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,760
So this one image is quite big, but the one I filled in,

1040
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,760
there's a 9, 9, 2, which means in this row, there is a block of 9,

1041
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,760
a block of 9 and a block of 2,

1042
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,760
and there's only so many places those boxes could be.

1043
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,760
So I figured out by counting from the left and the right,

1044
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:40,760
which blocks are impossible to be blank because of the length.

1045
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,760
It's kind of like battleship in a way.

1046
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,760
The ships are a certain length,

1047
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:52,760
and if you find one of the boxes and you know that there's a 4,

1048
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,760
then that box, if it can only be that 4,

1049
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,760
you know that there's three other boxes connected to that one,

1050
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,760
and then it's just a case of narrowing it down to making sure

1051
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:10,760
you know that this one cannot be colored in or not,

1052
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,760
and this one can,

1053
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,760
and then the more you do, the more information you have to solve more of the puzzle

1054
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
until you've completed it,

1055
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:25,760
and it's just so satisfying to complete such a big, arduous puzzle like this.

1056
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,760
Do you know when it's solved?

1057
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,760
Yeah, when you've completed all of the numbers.

1058
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,760
You can make them go gray.

1059
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,760
I'll just link to the site,

1060
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,760
pcruslyoh.com

1061
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
slash pcrus.

1062
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:50,760
Okay, so a number in a column means...

1063
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,760
A number in a column and a row.

1064
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,760
If you go to like a five by five on the left,

1065
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,760
you can do a five by five.

1066
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,760
It would be pretty easy to figure out,

1067
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:07,760
like I'm just going to take a screenshot of the one I'm looking at.

1068
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,760
I just love pcrus so much.

1069
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,760
So if you see the top left column is a four,

1070
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,760
and there's only five boxes,

1071
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,760
so at least the middle three have to be filled in

1072
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,760
because the four can't fit any other way.

1073
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,760
Wait, so it's a block of four, a line of four?

1074
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,760
Yeah, consecutive blocks, consecutive squares.

1075
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,760
So that means that four have to be together,

1076
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,760
and means three of them have to be like that.

1077
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:43,760
And then from that, you can work out that on the rows on the right,

1078
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,760
there's one, three, there's one, and then there's one, one, one.

1079
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,760
The one, one, one is like individual blocks,

1080
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:56,760
and there's only space for three if you have a space in between.

1081
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,760
That row has to be filled, unfilled, filled, unfilled, filled.

1082
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,760
Yeah, because there's no other way that can fit.

1083
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,760
And so that one's done, and then, yeah,

1084
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,760
it's really quite simple once you know the rules.

1085
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,760
Okay, do the blocks, do they have to go in order?

1086
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,760
Like in the bottom, there's the one, two.

1087
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Does it have to be a one on the left and then a two to the right,

1088
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,760
or could there be a filled, filled, unfilled, unfilled?

1089
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,760
It has to be in the order that it's written.

1090
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,760
So the one has to be to the left of the two,

1091
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,760
and on the top it has like there's two, one in the middle.

1092
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,760
The two has to be above the one.

1093
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,760
So on this one, all right, tell me if I'm getting this right.

1094
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,760
So on mine here, see the middle column is one, three.

1095
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,760
So the only way that that can work is if it's filled, unfilled, filled, filled, filled.

1096
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,760
And it couldn't be the three and then an empty and then the one

1097
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,760
because I would be in the wrong order.

1098
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,760
Got it, got it.

1099
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,760
Very based.

1100
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,760
Okay, I'm learning, I'm learning.

1101
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,760
It's a very fun game.

1102
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,760
Intodesting.

1103
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,760
Oh, okay, okay.

1104
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,760
Oh, my God.

1105
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,760
Oh, my God, I'm getting it.

1106
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,760
I'm getting it.

1107
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,760
So then this is what I'm left with.

1108
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,760
So now over on the left, I see there's a one.

1109
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,760
Oh, wait, there's a one and then a one.

1110
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,760
Yeah, the one could be all the way to the left or all the way to the right.

1111
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1112
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:29,760
But you know it can't, but you know that it can't be next to the ones that you've already drawn

1113
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,760
because that would make it a two, which is impossible.

1114
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,760
So now you know where the gaps, if you right click that like blanks out the space

1115
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,760
so you can keep track of where a block cannot be.

1116
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,760
Okay.

1117
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:50,760
Okay, so but so in the middle row is the one and that middle column has one in it.

1118
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:57,760
So every other one in the middle row has to be a non filled because there's only the one has to be blank.

1119
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,760
Holy shit.

1120
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,760
Holy shit, I get it.

1121
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,760
So fucking good.

1122
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,760
So fucking things.

1123
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,760
I love thinking it's my favorite pastime, but not when it comes to anything important.

1124
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1125
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,760
Ah, very exciting.

1126
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:21,760
Oh, I'm filling them in.

1127
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,760
I'm going to win.

1128
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,760
I'm going to fucking win this video game.

1129
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:32,760
I'm excited to learn about this game after I finish beating my head against the wall of minesweeper.

1130
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,760
You will appreciate this.

1131
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,760
I mean, you do need to think a little bit more if it is not a mindless game.

1132
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,760
Because if you make a mistake, your mistakes are tallied.

1133
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:52,760
And that's bad because if you complete, if you complete the thing without making a single mistake on this website, at least you get a rainbow pattern.

1134
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:58,760
But if you even have one mistake, if you click thoughtlessly and you make a mistake, it goes like black and white.

1135
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,760
So you complete it, you can, you can complete it, but you won't get the funny rainbow.

1136
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,760
And that's where all the true epic gamer gamers strive for.

1137
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,760
I got the rainbow.

1138
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,760
I clicked thoughtlessly and I thought I had fucked it up, but it didn't go black and white.

1139
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:21,760
So I just kind of got lucky there that my fuck up ended up working out for me.

1140
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,760
Hooray.

1141
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,760
I've been progressively getting larger and larger grid sizes on the left.

1142
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,760
There's like, you can choose.

1143
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:40,760
I would like try to complete, like get through one of them without making a mistake and then moving up to the next grid size, making it more difficult for myself at the moment.

1144
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,760
I'm on 25 by 25 and I haven't successfully done that one yet.

1145
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:53,760
On the bigger sizes, I see it's like split into like blocks of five.

1146
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,760
Those don't matter though, right?

1147
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,760
No, those are just for visual clarity.

1148
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,760
Yeah, okay.

1149
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,760
Just checking.

1150
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:08,760
I've been considering what is the appeal of Minesweeper to me and I think it's basically like Valhalla.

1151
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:14,760
It's like, just keep coming back to battle, you die over and over again.

1152
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:23,760
It's not really about winning or losing so much as just continuing to run back into the fight, you know.

1153
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:27,760
I get knocked down, but I get Minesweeped again.

1154
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,760
I'm never going to get Minesweeped.

1155
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:36,760
I've got like Viking metal music playing in my head and you're like, I get knocked down, but no, yes, it's absolutely accurate.

1156
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:45,760
But Vikings didn't have Mines, that was a thing that was invented later.

1157
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,760
That's true.

1158
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:52,760
Now, our listeners have learned how to play Picross and never to play Minesweeper.

1159
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,760
Post your Picrosses in the comments.

1160
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:04,760
Unless you have a gambling addiction and you don't want to spend any more money on it, then this is a healthy alternative.

1161
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,760
If you have a gambling addiction, you might as well just invest in Bitcoin.

1162
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:12,760
Yeah, try all of these things.

1163
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,760
Are you Team Crypto, Team Picross or Team Minesweeper?

1164
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,760
Or Team Noida.

1165
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,760
No, not Noida.

1166
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:28,760
These are all basically the same thing when you really boil it down.

1167
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,760
They're all just ways of feeling good.

1168
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:39,760
Except for these moments I get to in Minesweeper when I'm staring at it and there doesn't seem to be any clear path forward.

1169
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,760
And I know I have to make a guess and I just see with so much anger.

1170
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,760
I made an okay guess.

1171
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,760
Will I live one more click?

1172
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,760
Yes, okay.

1173
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,760
I'm safe.

1174
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,760
I'm safe with me.

1175
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,760
It's like the scene in every movie where there's a bomb and they're trying to...

1176
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,760
Yeah, it literally is.

1177
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,760
It's like, is the red one? There's 17 different red wires. Which one do I cut?

1178
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,760
I don't know. Click!

1179
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:11,760
And in my brain, the threat level is the same as though my life was about to end every single time.

1180
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,760
So what else?

1181
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:26,760
I was going to say that I played another video game other than Minesweeper and then I guess we started talking about Picross.

1182
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,760
I was playing Apex Legends.

1183
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,760
I don't know.

1184
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,760
Wait, isn't that the Battlegrounds game?

1185
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,760
It is a Battlegrounds game.

1186
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,760
It has the same name as 100 different things in my head.

1187
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,760
I know. It's like the most generic fucking possible name.

1188
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,760
What's the game play?

1189
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,760
It's one of those Battle Royale games.

1190
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:55,760
I just played a little bit of it because my boyfriend plays a whole lot of it and so we were squatted up.

1191
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:07,760
It's basically a game where you run around this map and loot shit until you run into other people and then you try not to die first.

1192
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,760
Yeah.

1193
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,760
And if you're lucky you might kill somebody.

1194
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,760
Is it team-based or is it never-made?

1195
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,760
It's three-man squads and there's like 50 of them per match.

1196
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:29,760
The way I think of those games is like Overwatch League of Legends with all of the purchasing of stuff and getting random loot on the map but also fighting to stay alive.

1197
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,760
And I hate League of Legends and all of those MOBA stuff.

1198
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,760
Fortnite has always been like, I hate League of Legends.

1199
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,760
The upside it has on League is that it's way faster.

1200
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,760
Fortnite seems a little more...

1201
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,760
Fortnite seems cooler than League of Legends.

1202
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,760
Oh yes.

1203
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:54,760
It's the random luck of finding the cool loot before someone else does and then also the stress of being good at shooting.

1204
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:05,760
The funny thing is we've been playing where there's 50 people in a match and there's a plane that flies over the island and you can choose when to drop.

1205
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:12,760
And every match I've played, at least half of the people will drop immediately.

1206
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:17,760
The second they get over the island they all drop and then they all just start wiping each other out.

1207
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:24,760
So these people are just like, I don't know if they're just hauling ass getting one gun and then going right into battle or what.

1208
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:36,760
But we usually just land on the opposite side of the map in a totally secluded area and have like 10 minutes to just get whatever the hell you want and then go out and fight.

1209
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:46,760
And so you really spend more of your time running around exploring and looting and hanging out in the areas.

1210
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:57,760
And then if you're lucky then everybody else will mostly have killed each other so there's only a few teams left and ideally you'll run into them one at a time and pick them off.

1211
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:04,760
But the ring closes as the match goes on so you're forced into closer and closer proximity.

1212
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,760
Eventually there's nowhere to run or hide.

1213
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:15,760
But usually you just get found and killed pretty quick.

1214
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:23,760
I don't know if I think that the game is inherently fun, but it is fun to play with TeamSpeak.

1215
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:34,760
And there's a lot of player input commands where you can be like, let's go over there or here's an item that you might like and all that kind of stuff.

1216
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:44,760
So when you're playing with people who can do all that shit quickly, it's a lot easier to follow what the fuck is going on and have a decent time.

1217
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:52,760
But if anybody wants to play Apex Legends with me, my name is Golden Witchfire on there.

1218
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,760
That's to our audience.

1219
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,760
I'm going to stick to the Thinking Man's game.

1220
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,760
I know we've got to have some people in the crowd who play Apex.

1221
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:10,760
How long does it take if you die early for you to wait around to play again?

1222
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,760
It'll probably be a minute or two between matches.

1223
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:24,760
Like I said, a lot of people do die really quick, but that's because they jump right into the fray at the start of the match.

1224
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:36,760
I have not had a match that lasted less than five minutes if I was actively trying to gear up before going into the battle.

1225
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:52,760
I think TF2 is like the perfect shooter game just because it's accessible and when you die over and over again, you can still play the game and feel like you're constantly getting better.

1226
01:14:52,760 --> 01:15:03,760
With stuff like Apex and things of that nature, I would always feel like it's too many variables that dictate whether or not I may have fallen on the right thing,

1227
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:11,760
and get in the best gun or having the best position or just being lucky to notice somebody before they notice me.

1228
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:18,760
But in TF2, the maps are very geared towards one direction of play.

1229
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:24,760
So you can learn the maps and get better at playing on those maps and the classes and the weapons.

1230
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,760
It feels like constant progression.

1231
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,760
I had felt that way about Apex when I first played it.

1232
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,760
I totally didn't understand how you're supposed to get good at this game if most of it is running around and not shooting.

1233
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,760
And then eventually I realized your goal is not to shoot, your goal is to survive.

1234
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:46,760
So ultimately you will do better if you shoot less and don't run into battle.

1235
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:51,760
So it's really more of a game about collecting loot and jungling in my mind.

1236
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:59,760
You get points for how long you live in addition to kills.

1237
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:08,760
There's a kill leader who has the most kills, but ultimately the point is to be the last team standing.

1238
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:15,760
So to me, I think an ideal match of Apex Legends would mean you only ever fought one other team.

1239
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,760
And you don't even have to get all the kills.

1240
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:22,760
Ideally they've already lost teammates by the time they get to you.

1241
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:29,760
So yeah, I think that's kind of what made me start enjoying it was when I stopped thinking of it as a shooter game.

1242
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:35,760
Especially because a lot of the guns are not very accurate and you get very short bursts of fire.

1243
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:43,760
So people take a lot of damage, but it's not like Halo where you could keep suppressing them by emptying clip after clip until they're dead.

1244
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:51,760
It's like you really have to have people on their ass because if you're in a one-on-one firefight, it's usually not a very ideal scenario.

1245
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:58,760
I just don't think the game is like, it's not a game where you're trying to get headshots on your opponent, basically.

1246
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,760
I love headshots.

1247
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,760
I know, I know.

1248
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,760
I know, we know.

1249
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,760
Sniper's a good job, man.

1250
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,760
Alright, I jumped in. I jumped in. I'm playing Noida. I'm in the Ice Caves.

1251
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,760
I'm in the Ice Caves. I'm killing Heesey.

1252
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,760
It's good.

1253
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,760
Heesey?

1254
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,760
All's right.

1255
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,760
Yeah.

1256
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,760
Heesey is a...

1257
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:27,760
The game is based on Finnish mythology and I guess Heesey are goblins.

1258
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,760
They're Finnish goblins or spirits or something.

1259
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:37,760
And in Noida, they have these high-tech blue people that have an underground arctic base.

1260
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,760
And they've got magic machines that drill for gold and can repair.

1261
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:48,760
They have an anvil that you can throw broken wands onto and it repairs them into working wands.

1262
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,760
And they've all got HVAC suits on and grenade launchers.

1263
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,760
Very cool. Very good stuff.

1264
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,760
That's all I have to say about that.

1265
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,760
I'm on fire. I'm on fire.

1266
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,760
Okay, okay.

1267
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,760
I'm getting pincered.

1268
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,760
Pincer attack. It's a pincer attack. They planned it all out.

1269
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,760
Hey, Ben, have you played Rain World at all?

1270
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,760
Oh, that's... No, but I saw the Matthew Matosis video about it.

1271
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,760
That's like a platformer where you're a little monkey thing.

1272
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:26,760
A little rabbit monkey, something or other that squishes through pipes.

1273
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,760
Do I remember that?

1274
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:29,760
Yeah.

1275
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:36,760
Noida sounds like what my impression of that game is like to some degree.

1276
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,760
Noida is a powerful game for powerful people.

1277
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,760
Oh my God. Glowing Lance. I found Glowing Lance.

1278
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,760
Yes.

1279
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,760
Oh my God.

1280
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,760
It's a game changer.

1281
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,760
Well, that's gonna tear right through.

1282
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,760
That's gonna tear right through all kinds of metals.

1283
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,760
Ben, why are you not streaming right now?

1284
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:02,760
Yeah, people have asked me if I'm playing all this Noida, why don't I stream it?

1285
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,760
And sometimes I think I should, but I kind of just like...

1286
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,760
I don't know.

1287
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,760
Just getting to play a video game and not fucking do a whole thing about it?

1288
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,760
There would be...

1289
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,760
It would soil the experience, probably.

1290
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,760
Well, it would change it.

1291
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,760
I would stream Noida potentially, but I wouldn't want to only play Noida on stream,

1292
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,760
because I like the...

1293
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,760
I'll give you an example.

1294
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,760
When I was on that run that ended in the lava,

1295
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,760
I spent a long time, after I beat the last level,

1296
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:43,760
I spent a long time using luminous drills to bore a vertical shaft

1297
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,760
between the different temples so that I could easily travel between them.

1298
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,760
And then I used the drill to carve out a rose in the temples

1299
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,760
so that I could store all my different spells and spell modifiers,

1300
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,760
almost like bookshelves, like a library of them.

1301
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,760
And that took me several hours,

1302
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,760
and I feel like that would not be riveting gameplay for a stream.

1303
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,760
If I was streaming, I think I wouldn't do that,

1304
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,760
because it would be really boring to watch,

1305
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,760
but that's how I like to play.

1306
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,760
So, yeah, different experience.

1307
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,760
I guess it depends on how understanding the audiences of the nature of the game

1308
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,760
and what they want to see from it.

1309
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,760
I'm sure there is an audience who does want to watch you bore a tunnel for four hours,

1310
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,760
but it might not be all of them.

1311
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,760
Yeah, I mean, yeah, people...

1312
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,760
There probably are some people who would find it satisfying to watch me lay out

1313
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,760
all my modifier spells, lay them out in a row,

1314
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,760
all my spells underneath them,

1315
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,760
and make a section over here, and create a little library.

1316
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,760
I mean, yeah.

1317
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:59,760
But when I'm streaming, I feel a compulsion to keep the energy up.

1318
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,760
I feel the compulsion to be entertaining,

1319
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,760
to keep things moving along.

1320
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,760
I feel like I wouldn't do that in those circumstances, so different.

1321
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:14,760
If I was streaming, I would probably try to go for really fast wins,

1322
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,760
which is not how I normally play.

1323
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,760
I'm very methodical, very meticulous,

1324
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,760
and I take forever because I want to search very thoroughly and find everything.

1325
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,760
It would affect my playstyle, is what I'm saying.

1326
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:33,760
I like streaming when it's a game that I'm very familiar with,

1327
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,760
so that it's almost...

1328
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:43,760
I enjoy the feeling of streaming with people in chat and talking and joking around.

1329
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,760
If I didn't feel like having that experience, I wouldn't do it.

1330
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:53,760
But occasionally, there's a game that's easy to play, and I like having people watch.

1331
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,760
I do think that there is something there,

1332
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,760
because on the one hand, I wouldn't do that other thing that I described,

1333
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,760
but on the other hand, it would be fun for me to explain

1334
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,760
why am I carrying this pheromone potion around?

1335
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,760
Well, I'll tell you. You'll see why later.

1336
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,760
I get to the hee-see base, and I'm like,

1337
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,760
okay, now's the time, I'm going to find out what, and then I find the healer,

1338
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,760
and I'm like, check this out, guys, check this out, guys.

1339
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,760
I scored him with the pheromone, and he starts healing me,

1340
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,760
and then the chat goes, ah, Pog, Pog, Pog!

1341
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,760
You know, there's an appeal there.

1342
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,760
You already experienced it, yeah.

1343
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,760
I spoiled it, yeah, it's too late now.

1344
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,760
People will play into it, even if they know it's coming.

1345
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,760
Yeah.

1346
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,760
People like Pog and Enchant.

1347
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,760
This is why I've changed my whole thing.

1348
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,760
Now I always seek out pheromone.

1349
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,760
In real life?

1350
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,760
Yes, yes, in real life, and I'm always squirting it on people

1351
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,760
that I think will have value to me.

1352
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,760
Based.

1353
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,760
I haven't streamed on almost, well, I've streamed on RFCK.

1354
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,760
I haven't streamed on my channel in like almost a year.

1355
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,760
Actually, I had a dream about streaming last night.

1356
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,760
I had a dream?

1357
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,760
Yeah, I had a dream where I streamed, and the chat was nice,

1358
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,760
and I was nice to them, and it was nice.

1359
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,760
That was the dream!

1360
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,760
That literally was the whole dream.

1361
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,760
What a dreamy stream.

1362
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,760
It was, a dreamy stream dream.

1363
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,760
That's it, that's what happened.

1364
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,760
I like those streams.

1365
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,760
We should do voice mails now.

1366
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,760
I was thinking voice mails.

1367
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,760
Would it have been going for an hour and a half?

1368
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:41,760
Yeah.

1369
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,760
Almost.

1370
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,760
Wait, Gib.

1371
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,760
Nah, I got nothing.

1372
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,760
I just like streams.

1373
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,760
Yeah, dream stream.

1374
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,760
That's good.

1375
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,760
Nah, I'll think about it.

1376
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,760
I'll think about streaming at some point.

1377
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,760
I think now that I've become more familiar with Noita,

1378
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,760
and now that I actually can win,

1379
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,760
I feel like streams would be more fun now

1380
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,760
than a few weeks ago

1381
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:08,760
when I was just dying in the mines all the time

1382
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,760
and just had no fucking clue what I was doing.

1383
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:13,760
Maybe.

1384
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,760
Okay.

1385
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,760
So the first voicemail is called...

1386
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:17,760
Oh, this one's good.

1387
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,760
The first voicemail is called Hi Ben.

1388
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,760
So you guys ready?

1389
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:22,760
Mm-hmm.

1390
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,760
All right.

1391
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,760
Three, two, one, go.

1392
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,760
Hi Ben.

1393
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,760
It's me.

1394
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,760
Tommy J.

1395
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,760
What?

1396
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,760
Fucking TV off first.

1397
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:35,760
Since we last spoke,

1398
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,760
I've still voluntarily committed,

1399
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,760
and now I'm on quite a bit of Thorazine.

1400
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:43,760
Bays.

1401
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,760
I know we can't be together.

1402
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,760
Good.

1403
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:52,760
But I still miss what we had.

1404
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,760
No hard feelings, huh?

1405
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,760
We had some good times together, you and I.

1406
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,760
Is this actually Tommy J?

1407
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,760
I can't tell.

1408
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,760
Oh, it's spoke break time.

1409
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,760
I don't think so.

1410
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,760
I guess I'd better go.

1411
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,760
Tommy J, signing off.

1412
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,760
For the last time.

1413
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,760
I feel, well, I don't feel bad.

1414
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,760
I don't feel bad exactly,

1415
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,760
but I do recognize that Tommy J

1416
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,760
did not have the benefit

1417
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,760
of hearing the second time

1418
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,760
we listened to all his voicemails

1419
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,760
and heard about them

1420
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,760
before I went and heard the third time

1421
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,760
and flipped my shit.

1422
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,760
So, you know,

1423
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,760
it was...

1424
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:37,760
It's fine.

1425
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,760
It's fine.

1426
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,760
It's water under the bridge.

1427
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,760
No worries.

1428
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,760
Okay.

1429
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,760
But that guy's got to turn his fucking mic up

1430
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,760
because that was too quiet.

1431
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,760
And his television off.

1432
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,760
I couldn't even hear the television.

1433
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,760
I don't know if my headphones are just quiet or what.

1434
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,760
I'd better make him out.

1435
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,760
Yeah.

1436
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,760
You know what, actually, I might have...

1437
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,760
No, my volume is at a reasonable...

1438
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,760
My volume is at a pretty reasonable setting.

1439
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,760
Okay, whatever.

1440
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,760
Next voicemail is called Which is Worse.

1441
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:10,760
Three, two, one, go.

1442
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:15,760
Tommy J spam or Circumcision Discourse.

1443
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,760
Tommy J spam.

1444
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,760
Hmm, you think?

1445
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,760
Yeah.

1446
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,760
It's a hard stance to tell.

1447
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,760
Tommy J spam doesn't mean anything.

1448
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,760
At least Circumcision...

1449
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,760
At least there's something to feel passionately about.

1450
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:37,760
I guess.

1451
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,760
Circumcision Discourse.

1452
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,760
Circumcision just kept going on and on and on.

1453
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,760
Circum...

1454
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,760
That's true.

1455
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,760
Circumcision was like a month's long process.

1456
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,760
Yeah.

1457
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,760
I don't know.

1458
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,760
Whatever.

1459
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,760
Both banned.

1460
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,760
Next one is called Confessing My Feelings.

1461
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,760
Three, two, one, go.

1462
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:05,760
I keep trying to condense everything into the smallest idea possible.

1463
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,760
But you just can't do that.

1464
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:20,760
Some things are too complicated to say in a 90-second voicemail.

1465
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,760
So, I just want to say...

1466
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,760
Here it comes.

1467
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,760
I love you, man.

1468
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,760
Oh.

1469
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,760
Thank you.

1470
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:43,760
When did the bulk of the voicemails stylistically become creepy whispering into a mic stalker person?

1471
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,760
Become.

1472
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,760
They've always been.

1473
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:56,760
There's definitely been a divergent evolution where the voicemails have taken a few different evolutionary paths.

1474
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:57,760
Yeah.

1475
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,760
Where they lean into different elements.

1476
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,760
Okay, thanks.

1477
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,760
I love you, too.

1478
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,760
Next one is called True Facts About Oblivion Fall.

1479
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,760
Three, two, one, go.

1480
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,760
I remember in school once.

1481
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,760
I was about 12 years old.

1482
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,760
A kid asked me, hey, do you like spunk?

1483
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,760
I wasn't sure entirely what he meant, but I figured it had something to do with dicks.

1484
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,760
So I said no.

1485
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,760
He laughed and said, what about cum?

1486
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,760
Do you like cum?

1487
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:37,760
Well, it turns out as an adult, why am I seeing this?

1488
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,760
I've always heard that cum tastes salty.

1489
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:45,760
And in my experience, it's not salty at all.

1490
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,760
It's more buttery.

1491
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,760
If you've ever eaten your own boogers, why am I seeing this?

1492
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,760
While having a cold or after crying is basically like that.

1493
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,760
I do both all the time.

1494
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,760
Except it tastes a little bit like popcorn.

1495
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:00,760
For us.

1496
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:04,760
Jellified popcorn is the flavor of cum.

1497
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:08,760
Of course, I have yet to try the taste of others cum.

1498
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,760
Why am I seeing this?

1499
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:16,760
So at this stage in my life, there's only one man, Nate, who can satisfy my desires.

1500
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,760
Yeah.

1501
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:19,760
Ben.

1502
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,760
Join the league.

1503
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,760
You've told Nate about the league, right?

1504
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,760
He shouldn't have.

1505
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:25,760
You showed him the voicemails.

1506
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,760
What did he think?

1507
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,760
Or naughty brother, you haven't showed him at all.

1508
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,760
I would be so disappointed in you, Ben.

1509
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,760
I don't feel like that's my job.

1510
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,760
I don't feel like I'm responsible for that.

1511
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,760
The league of Nate fuckers haven't even sent an email his way.

1512
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,760
What do you expect is going to happen?

1513
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,760
You've got to make the first move.

1514
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:56,760
If you want to fuck Nate, you've got to make the first move, my dudes.

1515
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,760
You've got to make yourself available.

1516
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,760
As a large group.

1517
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:07,760
As to the cum taste, gross.

1518
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,760
Gross.

1519
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:09,760
Yuck.

1520
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:10,760
Yuck.

1521
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:16,760
Next voicemail is called a tip for a frequent listener.

1522
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,760
Three, two, one, go.

1523
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,760
Hey, Tommy J.

1524
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:23,760
All right.

1525
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,760
Listen, listen, listen.

1526
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:29,760
I know, I know that you're a fan of this podcast and all.

1527
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,760
There's no Tommy J response.

1528
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:36,760
I just want to provide for the PCP and all that.

1529
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,760
And I get that.

1530
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:43,760
You like, you listen to this and you enjoy it, but please shut the fuck up.

1531
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,760
You were self-absorbed autist.

1532
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,760
Okay.

1533
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:47,760
We know.

1534
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,760
We know.

1535
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:49,760
The point's been made.

1536
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,760
Now I'm on Tommy J's side.

1537
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,760
I've had enough of people beating up on him.

1538
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,760
We did it.

1539
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,760
And you can't do that.

1540
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,760
Yeah.

1541
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:59,760
I already beat up on him as hard as it was possible to do.

1542
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,760
Now we're a Tommy J stands on the PCP.

1543
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:08,760
But pendulum has swung the other way.

1544
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,760
Contrarianism wins again.

1545
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,760
Yeah.

1546
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:12,760
Okay.

1547
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,760
Yeah.

1548
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,760
Good.

1549
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,760
Good tips.

1550
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,760
Don't make too many voicemails.

1551
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:17,760
Got it.

1552
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:18,760
Okay.

1553
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,760
We're up number two.

1554
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,760
I forget what this stands for.

1555
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,760
Ben World Records.

1556
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,760
T-Bag.

1557
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,760
I don't know.

1558
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,760
I can't remember.

1559
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,760
No.

1560
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,760
Okay.

1561
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,760
Three, two, one, go.

1562
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,760
Hey, Ben St.

1563
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,760
It's your weekly reminder to catch up on one piece.

1564
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,760
Thank you.

1565
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,760
Oh yeah.

1566
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,760
Weekly reminder to catch up on one piece.

1567
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,760
I'll get around to it.

1568
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,760
I'll get around to it after I beat Noida again.

1569
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,760
I think again and again and again.

1570
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:55,760
My advice to that caller, I think you need to make your call longer and force Ben to

1571
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,760
memorize the acronym or else he's never going to remember that it's a thing that keeps

1572
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:00,760
happening.

1573
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,760
I think he just mind wipes it immediately after hearing the call.

1574
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,760
This was only number two.

1575
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,760
I think eventually.

1576
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,760
No.

1577
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,760
No.

1578
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,760
Work.

1579
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,760
Work.

1580
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,760
Work.

1581
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,760
Work.

1582
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,760
Work.

1583
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:15,760
Work.

1584
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,760
Work.

1585
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:17,760
Work.

1586
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:18,760
Work.

1587
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,760
Work.

1588
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,760
Work.

1589
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:21,760
Work.

1590
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,760
Work.

1591
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:23,760
Work.

1592
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:24,760
Work.

1593
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:31,760
For little time ago, Eric, Eric, Eric and Eric.

1594
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,760
After that, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.

1595
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:36,280
Eric,

1596
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,760
Eric, structural, вокруг for the leadership in that world.

1597
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,760
And we have to get back up.

1598
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,760
Caneety.

1599
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,760
Go all Free.

1600
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:44,760
Go.

1601
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:50,840
have to use my last resort. I've got missiles in my hands and pistols in my eyes,

1602
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:57,240
rockets in my boots, and lasers in my size. I've got lasers for teeth, and I bring them all to

1603
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:07,000
fight. I'm a clusterfunk cyborg. He's at my mercy now, but he is still alive. Should I spare this

1604
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:15,880
me? Why are you worried? Why are you worried about a bear living an hour's journey away from you

1605
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:26,200
if you're a clusterfunk cyborg with pistols in your eyes? I feel like the bear poses no threat to

1606
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:32,200
you. Yeah, I think you should spare the bear. I think you should detain the bear for the bear cop

1607
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:41,320
and arrest him. Yeah, you've perhaps won his respect now. Alternatively, if you kill and skin

1608
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:49,000
the bear, you can wear the bear. Then you can become the bear. You can take over his life at the

1609
01:33:49,000 --> 01:34:00,360
zoo and steal his identity online. Oh boy, you can take on all his credit card debt. That's tough.

1610
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:05,480
Does the bear own any crypto? In which case, you might want to get some now before it goes to the

1611
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:11,240
moon. It's a start of a really interesting story. You kill a bear and you gain all of its debt.

1612
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:17,400
And then the debt collectors come looking for the bear and you're there.

1613
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:31,240
I don't know. I feel like you have more to gain by alliance with the bear

1614
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,320
than by defeating. I'm going to say spare. I'm going to say spare the bear. Spare the bear.

1615
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:44,040
By the way, some really solid vocal melodies in that. Some good hooks in there.

1616
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:51,480
I was not sure about it until the fight scene began. And then I was like, OK, OK, here we go.

1617
01:34:51,480 --> 01:35:00,360
Here we go. All right. Next one is called Trixie. Please fuck. Three, two, one, go.

1618
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:07,960
You know what, guys, after recording that, I just not feeling it. I just was getting bad

1619
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:13,560
vibes all around. I feel like I was too mean. I would say a lot of those things differently

1620
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:18,120
now. You know, I'm just going to re-record the whole thing. But don't worry, guys,

1621
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,840
it's going to come out. Don't worry that this isn't going to be a blu-ray situation all over

1622
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:30,840
again. I promise you could trust me. OK, it's about the lecture. Can we just cut the bullshit?

1623
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:40,280
Can you just release it? Just give us the original product. So I'm glad this is none of us.

1624
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:47,080
None of us want you to start over. Nobody wants that. But you, Trixie,

1625
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:54,680
for the love of God, please just release the original lecture. Please don't fucking scrap it.

1626
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:59,000
I really don't comprehend this. Please don't fucking scrap it. Holy shit,

1627
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,120
please don't do that. How can you be so attached to something you haven't seen before? I don't

1628
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:08,440
understand. Just release the original lecture for fuck's sake.

1629
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,640
Why are people assuming it's good? Why are you assuming that it's worth releasing?

1630
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,600
Because all the rad con lectures are good. Everybody likes them.

1631
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:20,840
It's not even necessarily true. I've had an unreleased one before because I didn't think it

1632
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:28,680
was good. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, maybe that was a mistake.

1633
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:35,800
Well, I personally think that like the also, OK,

1634
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:42,600
so I talked about recording like a secondary lecture or like a shell component to it and people

1635
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:47,560
were like, oh no, we want the one with like all the people and I'm like, well, why wouldn't you

1636
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:51,720
think I was going to wait till the next rad con to do it again with everybody there? That's

1637
01:36:52,520 --> 01:37:01,640
what I mean. Second of all, like the, to me, the way that would make the most sense would be to do

1638
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:07,720
a second lecture and then to embed parts of the first one into it to like edit them into one

1639
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:13,720
cohesive part. The fucking thing is not done in any way, shape or form. So to say that it's like,

1640
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:19,960
oh, just release it. There is no just release it. It was written in a way to be edited extensively.

1641
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:25,480
There's 15 minutes of heavily edited lecture footage and then about two and a half hours of

1642
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:32,440
not edited at all. So like it could be released as is, I guess. It won't be the product I intended.

1643
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:38,200
It won't be a product I believe in. Why would I not just make it the one that would be good

1644
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:44,280
if I can, if I have the opportunity? It's because people are so fucking impatient. You don't need

1645
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:49,480
the Brony lecture to exist now. You don't need it to exist this fucking year. It could be whenever

1646
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:57,000
the hell it's a historical fucking artifact thing. It's a chronicle of history. It's not time sensitive.

1647
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:05,400
I think, I think that if you try to do that, it will simply never come out.

1648
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:14,040
Why? Because it's been this long. It's been one year. It's been a year. It's been a whole year.

1649
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:21,640
That's nothing. It's not nothing. A year is nothing to me. What the hell happened in the last

1650
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:29,560
year? What literally has anything happened? Name one thing. I can't think of a single thing that's

1651
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:35,960
happened in the last year actually. You're right. There was a coronavirus lockdown and we all sat

1652
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:45,320
indoors and did nothing for a year. Okay. Okay, but why? Okay, you say that it'll be good if you

1653
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:52,920
edit it. I think that most people would find the unedited thing good. Maybe they would. I just,

1654
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:58,280
it was never meant to be released that way though. It's just not the intent of the lecture. Yours

1655
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:07,880
is edited. Mine is not not out because it needs editing. Mine has a couple little flourishes

1656
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:17,160
that I added. Mine is not out for other content related timing reasons. I understand that I'm a

1657
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:21,960
bit of a hypocrite for not having released mine. I mean the ones you do have editing in them though.

1658
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:27,240
Like the Diane Wrights one. The second one. That one had some, I mean yeah, it had some images.

1659
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:31,160
It had some reference images put in. And the same with the Tales Get Strolled one did. But you

1660
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:37,800
know, I mean that's pretty, yeah, that stuff's good. It didn't take me that long to do.

1661
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:46,520
And it's not really changing anything. Just kind of overlaying a little bit more visual

1662
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:52,280
information on top of what's already there. Like the content of the lectures that I have released

1663
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:57,800
is the original content with maybe just a little bit more context overlaid on top of it.

1664
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:03,400
I just, I find myself incredibly baffled at the level of entitlement that people feel to a product

1665
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:08,920
that doesn't exist. I don't, I'm going to defend it. I don't think it's entitlement. I just,

1666
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:15,480
I think that you are undervaluing the original product as it exists. I think it, I think people

1667
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:20,520
think that the original unedited version has value. Right, but that's totally an assumption.

1668
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:26,040
I mean that if, if I, people would feel that way about a lot of ideas that I have that they

1669
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:30,600
never hear about and a lot of video scripts that I throw away because they're incomplete and a lot

1670
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:35,880
like it's just not everything gets to see the light of day if it's not up to standard, you know.

1671
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:42,120
That's true, but the thing that we're talking about now literally exists and could be released.

1672
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,560
It could be, but would it be worthwhile for me to release it? Like what incentive do I have?

1673
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:56,520
Do you want my opinion? Yes. What would be, what would it, what would I gain from releasing this

1674
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:05,400
lecture? Well, I mean, I mean, I guess, hell, I don't know. Yeah. I mean, that's a totally different

1675
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:11,240
question. Okay. What would you, what would you gain? I don't know. The PZP channel would get

1676
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:16,440
some views from it because I assume that's where it would go. And I mean, yeah, it can also happen

1677
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:21,880
in the future when the new version gets made. I actually did not originally intend to release it

1678
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:26,280
on the PCP channel because I thought it would get enough views that it would be like a saving throw

1679
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:31,720
for my channel. At this point, my channel is a whole different beast anyways, but that's fine.

1680
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:41,400
That's fine. I mean, whichever. Okay. I mean, when you say the new one, are you talking about,

1681
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:47,320
because I feel like we're equivocating here between there's like an edited version of the

1682
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:54,680
original, but or like just like a different one. I mean, again, like I said, my goal would be to

1683
01:41:54,680 --> 01:42:00,280
record another one and then to interweave it with the one that already exists. So it would be like,

1684
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:07,320
it would be like the like a duality thing, like the dark and light versions of the story, basically.

1685
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:13,640
Would the second one be designed to be heavily edited as well?

1686
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,720
It would be designed. Well, yeah, because it's going to have the other one intercut into it.

1687
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:23,640
So they will both have to edit it into each other like edit the whole first one and then record

1688
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:28,280
the second one and combine them. Is that what you're thinking? I'm talking about the like,

1689
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:34,920
okay. So like the lecture that you guys have seen starts with me like walking out of a closet,

1690
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:40,680
taking a massive bong hit, explaining basically what the bronies are and then like the historically

1691
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:47,160
going through like each era of content made by the bronies. So if I were to make another clip

1692
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:53,240
in which I fill in all the gaps of everything I missed, like re-explain certain stuff, add nuance

1693
01:42:53,240 --> 01:43:00,440
to it and then like literally edit that into the lecture so that it is a more complete lecture.

1694
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:07,080
Like so it'd be just like, you know, I probably re-explained certain things that I didn't think

1695
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:11,960
I did a good job with the first time and then leave in stuff that was fine and then like have the

1696
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:19,240
this kind of jackal and hide attitude throughout the video of like, hey, this was me a year ago

1697
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:24,680
and this is me today telling you about, you know, how I feel about what I said a year ago, you know.

1698
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:28,760
I mean, what's changed about how you feel about it?

1699
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,080
I don't know.

1700
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:35,800
Even then you were already describing things that were like five years

1701
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:43,640
done. Sure. It's really just a more of the presentation style of it and like

1702
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,880
the attitude of it that I have a problem with.

1703
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:54,600
I don't know. I just think, I just think that focusing on like changing and revising it

1704
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:59,800
basically is just gonna mean that the original is just ends up in the trash. I think that's what's

1705
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:06,520
gonna happen. Think whatever you want. Okay, I will.

1706
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:07,640
I will.

1707
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:18,360
Next voicemail? Yeah. Okay. Next voicemail is called funny joke three, three, two, one, go.

1708
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,840
Hey guys, sorry I haven't made a voicemail in a while.

1709
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,600
That's not funny.

1710
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:28,600
Why are so many voicemails so quiet this week?

1711
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:32,120
I don't know. I thought it was something on my end, but...

1712
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,200
No, I'm getting it too.

1713
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:37,800
By the way, I have to bring up one more thing about the previous voicemail because he said

1714
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:43,240
it was comparing the Brony lecture to the Blu-ray situation, which is different in many different

1715
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:48,520
ways. One, the Brony lecture is not a promised part of a Kickstarter whatsoever. None of the

1716
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:54,120
lectures were. That's technically true. We didn't promise any specific lecture in the Kickstarter.

1717
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:59,880
Secondly, the reason the Blu-rays ever got done is I don't know how to do it. It's not the same.

1718
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:05,880
I have all the Blu-rays. I've been carrying them around for five years. I don't have the technology

1719
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:11,720
or means or knowledge of how to make the Blu-rays. I still have them. I still intend to do that.

1720
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:16,680
You can go ahead and think if it is dead, but if you're not dead, I don't know why you would.

1721
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,000
Fuck you for thinking of things in shorter time spans than I do.

1722
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:32,280
All right. Just as a brief plebe and the weeb, all of the first season is out edited by Jesse,

1723
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:42,200
I think, all of those. What was the season situation because I thought you had a whole

1724
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:47,560
other bunch. The production was for a seasons two and three, was what we were doing. We made

1725
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:57,000
season two. We recorded season three. I don't know what happened to it. Apparently, a lot of the

1726
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:03,160
footage was really fucked because I had the mic arm in between us in front of the camera,

1727
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:07,560
and so the camera would constantly change focus between our faces and the mic arm for all the

1728
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:14,600
episodes we filmed. Another one that, for technical reasons, might not ever see the light of day.

1729
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:23,320
There could be a deleted episode on the Blu-ray. I'll just throw it in there, I guess.

1730
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:31,480
I have no idea if Jesse ever attempted to edit them or if he did. It's possible that he

1731
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:35,240
straight up did anyways. It just hasn't said anything. I don't know, but I haven't heard

1732
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:38,920
any anything about that since he told me that all the footage was fucked.

1733
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:45,320
Damn, damn. Next voicemail.

1734
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:53,480
Okay, next one is called the Yu-Gi-Oh manga is better than the anime. Three, two, one, go.

1735
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:58,040
I'm gonna say a slur. You fucking peendos.

1736
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:09,240
What'd he say? Pe-pe-pe-peendos? Peendos? Oh no, did we all just slur right then? Cool.

1737
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:18,840
KINGOS? I don't know what that means. I assume if I knew Yu-Gi-Oh, maybe I would understand,

1738
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:23,000
but I don't know. I don't know. I know some Yu-Gi-Oh. I never heard that shit.

1739
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:30,920
Mmm, fuck this guy. Next one is called Tom's Digimon lecture, mostly Digimon universe app

1740
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:37,720
monsters. Three, two, one, go. The first big thing that kind of like forks this timeline away from

1741
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:44,520
our world. And in the dawn of revival, we're gonna start off at a 10, my friends. All the technology

1742
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:53,160
in the world goes apeshit at the same time for several hours. And somehow they figure out

1743
01:47:53,160 --> 01:48:00,280
that there's a life form trying to manifest itself through the circuitry of technology

1744
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:03,640
for several hours. And this freaks everyone the fuck out, munchy.

1745
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:11,480
Pacemakers. What about my pacemaker? Will my pacemaker work when the technology revolves?

1746
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:13,160
No. Okay. You're fucked.

1747
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:19,400
Uh, yeah? What was that from? That's the guilty gear one.

1748
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:27,880
Uh, but I guess if you think about it, it kind of sounds like it could be about Digimon.

1749
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:35,640
I don't know what app monsters is. Yeah, I don't know enough Digimon to know. I assume

1750
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:41,480
there is someone who gets exactly what this is in reference to going like, hey, somebody's going

1751
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:51,720
like, oh my God, it's just like that thing. Next voicemail is called sad Susie from sad about

1752
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:57,960
Sonichu at 102.com. Uh, three, two, one, go.

1753
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:18,760
Hello. I have waited here so long, so long, where is Sonichu?

1754
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:39,000
Two, one, who, two, Ben, why have you forsaken your responsibilities, the lazy liberal that you are?

1755
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:53,240
You've disappointed me so far that I became a human good try.

1756
01:49:53,960 --> 01:50:21,720
Okay. I like the sound editing on that. A lot of drums for a human guitar.

1757
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:29,000
Well, he went over the top of it. That's what made the difference. That's what really

1758
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:37,880
put it over the edge. He really. Next voicemail is called very important. Three, two, one, go.

1759
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:56,680
Drinking, but then as he drinks the milk, it starts to drain from the bottle, revealing

1760
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:01,480
mega sized memories. And now it's just an empty bottle with the memories behind it. And it's a

1761
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:07,880
milk jug framing a pair of milk jugs. Thank you for listening to my dad. Cool. Thanks, man.

1762
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:16,520
That is very important. What is that? Next, next voicemail comes with an attached image,

1763
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:23,960
which I will post now. It is this. This is a piece of, this is some art by

1764
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:34,040
Casol. I happen to know. I like this. The voicemail is called Ooh Woo Lilia. Three, two, one, go.

1765
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:48,520
Oh, oh, Michelle. Hi. Here, what? She, she, what? Trixie's planning on, on we recording

1766
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:58,920
the morning lecture. How could she? What, what a betrayal. We, we the people paid for the original

1767
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:04,680
lecture. We did everyone, we all the characters we love and care about. And she's, she's taking

1768
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:17,400
that from us. I, I can't possibly think of a great, ever perpetuated. Oh, what's on my face? Mayonnaise?

1769
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:33,480
Yeah. What do you think now, Trixie? Yeah, citation needed. It's true. It's true. Maybe it wasn't Mayonnaise.

1770
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:49,560
Uh, next one is called large nose man smells a bitch. Three, two, one, go.

1771
01:52:49,720 --> 01:53:04,600
I was this close to having sex with Nate and then I catch a whiff of something truly awful.

1772
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:12,920
You're telling me the Trixie is not going to release the original brownie lecture.

1773
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:22,680
Well, people feel pretty strongly about it. I may have to postpone my fucking of Nate

1774
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:27,000
and have sex with someone else.

1775
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:42,280
Such suit of stir characters. Yeah, but they got a heart of gold. Every single one of them. I promise.

1776
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:52,760
Uh, next one is called this is not financial advice. Three, two, one, go.

1777
01:53:54,120 --> 01:54:02,520
I was listening to the discussion, quote unquote, long term investments in the last episode.

1778
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:09,560
Oh, no. The right answer here is just by index funds. So index funds are basically

1779
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:15,800
like stocks, except, uh, instead of like tracking the performance of a company, they just

1780
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:22,680
track the performance of the entire stock market. So like, by the SMP 500 index fund,

1781
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:29,320
you know, and the SMP 500 goes up, then your index fund goes up. And these are generally just,

1782
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:34,440
you know, for a long term, these are like your safest and probably your best investment.

1783
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:42,440
Yeah. So like, uh, you know, Warren Buffett, like the super rich guy, he made a bet,

1784
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:50,840
like a million art bet a few years ago that like the SMP 500 index fund would actually

1785
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:57,400
would make more money over a 10 year period than like all the best edge funds.

1786
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:03,560
And he ended up winning that bet. So yeah, you want to beat the, you know,

1787
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:07,960
beat the edge funds, don't, don't buy meme stocks, just, just buy index funds.

1788
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,760
That's what Minerva said too, right? Or something like that. She had some advice about some like

1789
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:21,720
index fund. Yeah. Yeah. What's an index fund and what's a bond? I could Google it, but I won't.

1790
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:25,800
Yeah. See, that's the problem is every time somebody has like good advice, they're too

1791
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:32,680
good at the advice and they have to make it better. Like to make it bad enough for people who don't,

1792
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:38,200
who would like, assume that if I could have figured out what you're talking about, I would have

1793
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:43,720
anyways, you know, like, like, obviously we've all heard someone say the phrase index fund before,

1794
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:48,520
but none of us looked into it any further. You got to like really, really lead these horses to

1795
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:54,120
water. You know what I'm saying? And you got to make the tree. I have like your,

1796
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:59,400
you know, your cadence has to be wearing jeans, not like a suit and tie.

1797
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:05,000
Yeah, exactly. Jeans? No. Your cadence needs to be wearing shorts. And then I'll listen to you.

1798
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,520
Your, your, your princess cadence has to be wearing. Yes. Post PNG's a princess cadence

1799
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:14,920
wearing shorts. How would she wear them? Would there be two pairs of shorts? Would it be one

1800
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:21,640
pair of droid going all the way across? You decide. And then I'll buy an index fund.

1801
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:25,000
Yeah, like I said, if I sounded solid, I would go with it. Sounded solid.

1802
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:33,560
Next one is called one cool dud, five a.m. Totino's pizza roll. Three, two, one, go.

1803
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:42,600
So now that we all know as of the Brad this track that Tom is clearly the

1804
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:49,800
most musically talented of the bunch. Oh, he went a little, he did a little voice

1805
01:56:49,800 --> 01:57:02,840
warble. Everyone was so impressed. Thick, juicy, nasty pipes in pursuit of the new theme song

1806
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:14,600
maybe. Also, Tom, I'm going to have to request that you stop getting so violently angry on the

1807
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:23,400
show when complaining about your shitty life because it's really turning me on and I am not

1808
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:31,800
entirely comfortable with, well, I'm comfortable with it. I just, you know, good things by he.

1809
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:39,080
I don't. Yeah, the thing about Tom is that he's just so overly emotional. He just goes,

1810
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:44,840
he just flies off the handle at the drop of a hat. And it's

1811
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:54,520
passionate, sensual. I mean, the gift button debate was pretty heated. I enjoyed that.

1812
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,880
Down to that. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true.

1813
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:05,720
Next voicemail is called theme song contest three, two, one, go.

1814
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,200
This March Simpson.

1815
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:35,080
More. Sold.

1816
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:47,400
Eleazar, you know what to do. Oh, god. Okay, next one is called fn three, two, one, go.

1817
01:58:54,520 --> 01:59:01,800
Yeah, that dude's going to get fucked.

1818
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:17,320
I have such a vivid like imagery in my head from all of these crazy.

1819
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:21,480
I'm going to have PTSD, actually, I think, for these voicemails.

1820
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:27,560
This one felt like a little tiny little gremlin, but also kind of like, what's his face from Dragon Ball?

1821
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:37,080
Like, like pilaf. I'm going to have, I'm going to have a BPD from this. I'm going to have bipolar

1822
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:41,400
disorder. I'm going to develop narcissistic personality disorder. I'm going to have all

1823
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:47,560
the types. I'm going to have ABDL from this to this. I'm going to have ABDL for sure. Yeah.

1824
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:55,400
Yeah, based. Okay, next one is called how many doge coins three, two, one, go.

1825
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:03,640
How many doge coins will it take to get the original Brony lecture footage? How many?

1826
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,720
How many doge coins? How many doge coins? What are doge coins worth?

1827
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:16,280
They're worth about three pounds, not much. They're worth between five and six cents right now.

1828
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:22,520
Yeah, a little tiny small. And it's been going down so long. I don't know. I'll do it for a thousand

1829
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:29,720
dollars. A thousand dollars worth of doge coins. All right. Okay. That's a ton of doge coin.

1830
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:38,120
Time to invest. Time to invest in doge coins. Next one is called Bing Zerk. Wait, I'm seeing

1831
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:42,040
next one. Well, you got to refresh the page. This one's only 35 minutes ago.

1832
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:49,640
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think, yeah. Three, two, one, go.

1833
02:00:52,840 --> 02:01:03,240
Why? Why did I send such a green voicemail last week? Was it because I binged the

1834
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:10,520
gentlest holistic detective agency? What does Martin Lawrence even have to do with Sonic

1835
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:18,760
the Hedgehog? Martin the Lawrence is a very funny name, I think, I thought, I hoped,

1836
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:27,880
and yet I couldn't say it. Why? Why?

1837
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:36,120
I didn't know Dirk Gently's holistic detective agency was a TV show. I thought it was a book.

1838
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:46,680
The show is written by Max Landis. What the fuck? Yeah. Oh, God. Bummer. Bummer.

1839
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:50,040
Max Bummer.

1840
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:00,040
Okay, so what was Kring was himself, I guess, and what was Bing was that? And

1841
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:10,120
I wasn't even going to bear a zerk from the. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

1842
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:16,840
Okay. Next voicemail is called thanks. Thanks, Kring is bingus. Next voicemail is called

Okay. Ito vai to ramen and sayo paraeru. And until you next time, sayonara.

1852
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:53,800

1853
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:58,680
No. Folded. My arms are folded 1000 times.

1854
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:04,040
We'll see. I guess we'll see, Madison Square Garden.

1855
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,320
Shit, I guess that's it. That's the last voicemail.

1856
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:17,640
What's, are we done? Oh my god, only two hours this episode. That's crazy.

1857
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:20,680
The voicemail took so much less time than usual.

1858
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:25,400
The people last time knows quite a lot. There were a lot.

1859
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:29,720
More of them were funny than usual, though. So there is that. Good job.

1860
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:35,400

02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:22,840
you. It's pretty hard to find excuses. I will also say, I will mention again that a couple people

1866
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:28,600
in the comments last week were asking about Radcon stuff, and again, I will say it, believe it or

1867
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:36,840
not, the stuff from Radcon 4 is still being made and will come out. I cannot say exactly when,

1868
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:43,960
but it is still in production. We had a meeting not too long ago to figure out a lot of stuff and

1869
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:52,680
get things rolling. There's been a lack of communication, but we're communicating,

1870
02:05:52,680 --> 02:06:02,440
and it's all getting done. Everything's on its way. Did you ask that one guy about the stuff?

1871
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:09,320
The one guy about the stuff? We'll find out after the podcast is done recording.

1872
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:14,200
Yeah, true. Okay, I guess that's it. Any final, any last words before we close it?

1876
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:33,000
Goodbye. The end. Love you. Mwah.
