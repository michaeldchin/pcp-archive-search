1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
I'm gonna do it, Jenae. I'm gonna hit record, Jenae. No, Forrest.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:16,520
I got B-platform, Jenae. I'm just trying to answer the JQ, Jenae, and they're taking down my videos.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:24,600
Oh no, Gab's getting taken off of Patreon, Jenae. They're coming after the alt-tech media, Jenae.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,520
Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm the best guy ever. Today we're joined by Tom Oliver.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Uh, I'm too hardcore for social media. Find me on gab.com and mines.com and bitchute and follow my hot political takes there. Thank you very much.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Damn, pioneer. Uh, we've got Munchy for this hat.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You know, sometimes we like to fake hype on the show to see more entertaining than we actually are, but I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm a hopped up on sugar right now, and I just wanna wiggle.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not, like, hyped up, like, oh my god, guys, like, get inspired. I just wanna, like, wiggle and, like, run. You ever get it? I just wanna, you ever just get hopped up on sugar and just wanna run.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes, I do know that. I did my run at 2am last night. Do you have any familiarity with this gif, this meme in the Kingdom Hearts community of Kyrie Wiggling from the manga?

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, no, I have no idea. I just like to wiggle on my own accord. I don't follow trends like you do.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, that's too bad. I'm gonna post this in the chat so everyone can observe Kyrie's wiggling. Please enjoy. We'll put it in the show notes.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How did you get that so fast? It was on my desktop, ready to go, as always.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Look at her go. Goddamn, she's killing it. Hold on. She's getting it, boys.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Wait, did you post it in the main chat?

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No, you didn't. You posted it in your own chat.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Speak with your words using audio form.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, I'm actually gonna put in the gross disgusting link thing so we can link it later.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Anyway, hey, Ben.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What's up?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, uh...

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Look at this Kyrie. What do you think?

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She's not wiggling. She's wibbling.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hello, everyone.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is that even related?

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here we go.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The Urban Dictionary term for a wibble.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A wibble. We gotta look up wibble.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Have you guys heard, have you guys heard of the calls, the calls going out there for a return to form?

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The call to adventure.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
A return to our great roots on UrbanDictionary.com.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, I have not heard anyone say that.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, you mean have I heard the song of the people?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You mean have I heard the Zeitgeist?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right. That's right.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
By the way, just so you know, I looked up wibble, which is what Kyrie's doing in this thing, on UrbanDictionary.com.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, God.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And apparently, alright, wibble, the top definition is, quote,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The word used by Rowan Atkinson in Blackadder goes forth to denote a state of insanity.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The scene, he puts pencils up his nose and repeats wibble, wibble in order to get sent home from the trenches.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wait.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's what wibble means to us.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And then, wibbly, wobbly, timey, wimey stuff was also invented by Blackadder.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I love the first track on Alternia Bound entitled, A Risen Anew.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You guys, you guys ever watch us?

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, you guys ever watch Blackadder?

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You know, I want to watch it again, but not for a long time, not for a long time.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I liked it.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I had no idea what that was.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As a kid.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It is a British comedy about, like, Elizabethan nobles, where Mr. Bean plays this, like, incompetent nobleman named Blackadder.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And it's about-

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Fuckin' Cox is on there, too, right?

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hugh Laurie?

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hugh Laurie. I think he's on there, if I'm wrong.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Could be. I forgot about that.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You know who, you know, my friend, John, aka Dwoob,

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
he mentioned-

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait a minute, Ben.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
John is Dwoob?

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You didn't know John is Dwoob?

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I had no fucking idea.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, alright.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who'd you think Dwoob was?

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I just thought it was some fucking asshole.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Plant Roddy Fucker's Copco's like the rest of the assholes.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No, Dwoob is John.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Bullshit.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But I'm surprised you didn't know.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But he referenced a show that I had not-

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Remember Red Green?

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, of course.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Canadian-

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah, the Canadian fixer-upper skit comedy.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He was talking about like a-

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're talking about like all our mouse traps.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So we got mouse traps in my house.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We have been slaughtering my left and right.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It has been a mouse-genice-

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, listen.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I believe you.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you know that I killed them with a frying pan?

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Did I talk about this?

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I saw that.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh my god, that's what that story was about.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Shit.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, alright.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, I know.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, I killed a mouse with a-

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I clobbered it with a frying pan.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Holy shit.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It was great.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Was it like running?

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Was it running for its life, attempting to survive?

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So I bought a bunch of mouse traps, like classical-looking-ass snap mouse traps.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
None of them have caught anything.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They are almost useless, except-

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Except for physical gag comedy bits, which I'm sure they're ripe for usage in that.

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, they- alright.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So I heard one go off and I was like, oh my god, one of them actually caught something.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So I went and I looked, and no.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But there was a mouse next to the one that had gone off, and it seemed to be maybe stunned or something,

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
because it wasn't reacting to me at all.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So I was like, it's now or never before it fucking gets its wits back.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So I went and I grabbed a frying pan and I just smashed it.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh god.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
In one clean clobber?

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In one clean clobber.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You know, I thought maybe I hadn't hit it hard enough.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Like, I was afraid, I was afraid that, you know, as Dwarf Fortrait might put it,

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that it would like explode in a pile of gore.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But it didn't.

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In fact, there was no visible injury at all, and I thought maybe I'd been too much of a fucking pussy and it hadn't died.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Didn't follow through.

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But it kind of fell over and started scrabbling around.

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I was like, oh shit, I didn't get it.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But like, I went back, I went back at it, and no, it was dead.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It eventually slowed down and stopped.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was like, oh, I guess I got it.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh god, that's morbid.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No, I was glad, because like, I was there.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How much HP did you get from that?

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Unfortunately few, because I'm extremely high level.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm extremely powerful, Munchy.

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So, you're like Rapunzel with that frying pan.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So I swept it up in a dustpan and dumped it in the trash.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sure.

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And this could be the start of a new career for you.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You could become an exterminator, but you only use traditional methods.

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You just go in there with your bare hands.

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
With a frying pan.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
With all I need is my frying pan.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You throw in flashbangs to stun them.

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And then you go in there and you take care of them man to man, one on one.

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Like they did the old school.

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh my god, Ben's going to grow up to be the exterminator from Ant-Bully.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's just going to walk up in Ant-Bully little kids into signing contracts

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that they're way out of the jurisdiction to sign.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then when they ask how long it's going to be,

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
you're just going to lie to the guard and take out your trusty drying pan.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And you're going to start beating the shit out of me and say,

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
oh, it'll be done within the hour.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Ant-Bully bonus episode.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
After I had thrown it away, it occurred to me that maybe I had missed an opportunity.

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I had thought, what if I had somehow cured its pride?

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No, what if I had somehow used some kind of chemical powder or something

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to remove its flesh, to desiccate its flesh and collect its skull,

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
clean its skull and display it.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What if we started displaying all the skulls?

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And now you have a pile of mouse skulls right next to your chair.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm thinking we prop them up on toothpicks just kind of around the house.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You got to display them to instill fear into the populace remaining in the house.

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's right, as totems.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
As totems.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Did you know your skill?

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I actually looked it up and I thought, how would you do that?

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Would you boil it first?

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Boil the flesh off or something?

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And I was looking at some site and it had a graph.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There was a graph of what condition is the carcass in

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and cross-reference with what method of flesh removal

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and cleaning of the skull would you employ.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And all conditions said, do not boil.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Do not boil the flesh off of it.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Alright.

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I just did some quick research myself by googling how to clean the skull.

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I discovered the delightful term skeletonization,

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
which I'm going to do to you right after this podcast.

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They're not rats, they're mice.

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They're pretty small.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And actually I haven't seen them.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I spooked them off.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'd been seeing them around.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I got these traps and I was like, man, if I'm seeing a couple of mice,

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that must mean there's like thousands.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That must mean they're everywhere and they're just hiding themselves really well.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I'm only seeing.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But we've only killed maybe like five or six,

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
but I haven't seen them in days.

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Maybe we got the most.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Maybe we fucking got them.

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The downstairs neighbors have-

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know how mice work.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They're not like bugs or anything.

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The downstairs neighbors have it much worse.

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I mean, I haven't seen it,

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
but apparently they're all over the place in the downstairs.

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, and they're going to stick to the ground.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And there's some shit going on where the guy downstairs has said,

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
like I'm not paying rent until the landlord takes care of it

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and the landlord tried to evict them for it,

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but like obviously that's not going to work.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So there's a whole like legal thing going on downstairs.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But since the mouse problem is not that bad up here,

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
we've just kind of ignored it.

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Pests are the number one biggest,

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
like I can't believe in literal 2018 current year,

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
we're still dealing with like pests.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Like when I moved out to Ohio,

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the first place I lived in-

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It seems cartoonish.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Having a mouse problem in your house

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
seems like a problem that like a cartoon kid,

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
like Mr. Bean would have a mouse that he would be running around

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
like a hammer trying to kill or something.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And he would keep running into frying pans

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
like in the kitchen.

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Indeed.

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And like the mouse would jump on his face

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and he would whack himself with a frying pan

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
trying to get it.

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yep.

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
As it evolved, like pure energy,

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you know, internet denizen,

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with this,

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but in my last like two apartments,

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Roaches have been like a more president's issue,

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
which never happened in Massachusetts,

232
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
but I don't know if Roaches are more of a Midwest thing.

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Externator came by and said that he caught a crab

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
in a glue trap one time.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
A crab?

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He showed me a picture.

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He was like, do you take this out?

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And he showed me a picture of his-

239
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Glue traps are these like sort of like paper squares

240
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
that you just put out and the idea is that mice

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
will just step in them and then they can't escape

242
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and they starve to death or whatever.

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Run.

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Pretty brutal.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Pretty brutal.

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But it's fucking genocide, so whatever.

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And then he showed me a picture and like, yeah,

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
like a large crab, like several inches across.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And he said that he said that it was like in a business

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
like near like, like a back bay, like near the ocean,

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
kind of.

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So it wasn't like totally ridiculous that a crab

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
might have made it that far,

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
but still caught a fucking big old crab in his glue trap.

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Speaking of the glue trap,

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
so he put a glue trap out at my house

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and we did, because there was a mouse

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
running around in the house.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We had to get it.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You mean the house you're at now?

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No, my parents' house when I was still there.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And we were all panicked because we knew that

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
when my mom came home,

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if a mouse was still there, she would flip shit

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and we wouldn't hear the end of it for days.

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So it's like, all right, this mouse has to be gone

268
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
within the hour or we're all fucked

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
for the next like two weeks.

270
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So we put out a glue trap and put some peanut butter on it

271
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
because you had to get the sucker out there

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and you go for the peanut butter and you get fucked.

273
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And he did like instantly.

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And it was just there like struggling for like 20 minutes

275
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and I felt really bad about it.

276
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So I did like, I did the opposite.

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Like Vendiz did the genocide run on Undertale

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and I did, I did the pacifist run

279
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
because I just like took it and I brought it outside

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and I kind of like took a little like,

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
like butter knife and kind of scooped its leg out

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
just as like, get out of here, you fucking piece of shit.

283
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're out of the house.

284
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Wait, hadn't you already caught it in the trap?

285
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I caught it in the glue trap.

286
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I caught it in the glue trap,

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but only one of its legs was caught in the glue trap.

288
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So it was like scurrying around with one leg caught

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
slowly dragging this whole thing behind it.

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I was like, I'm not going to let you die like this.

291
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I brought it out and I kind of like freed its leg

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and was like, you're fine, just get out of here.

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I definitely skew towards the top of the spectrum.

294
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If you're a deep core Munchie fan,

295
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
then you will know my, you know, time-tested catchphrase,

296
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Silverfish are allies.

297
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yes, of course.

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And this stems from my childhood obsession with Silverfish

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and my childhood home that I grew up in.

300
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There was a rampant Silverfish like infestation.

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
By the way, with Silverfish,

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
aka house centipedes, right?

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Like the ones with lots and lots of legs that look like frilly.

304
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, that look like skyfish.

305
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They have like six legs, you know, here.

306
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll get you a picture of it as Silverfish.

307
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is an extremely like, you know, high definition photo.

308
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of something that I grew up,

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
or not grew, that I used to call a Silverfish,

310
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but which turns out is actually called a house centipede.

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah, we had tons of those in the house.

312
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I saw one yesterday and I was very upset by it.

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I guess I hate them, but everyone else was like,

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, I think they're cute.

315
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No, dude, they eat, they eat worse bugs.

316
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I'm like, no, they are the worst bug of all.

317
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's why they eat the other ones.

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah.

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And then we had to get like a pest control guy

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
to like basically constantly just come back and destroy them.

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I eventually just got accustomed to them.

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And I would like leave a little, like a bit of like some video game,

323
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
like cover paper there, like some manual paper.

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I would just rip up some like New Super Mario Bros. 64 DS manuals.

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How I love that game.

326
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'd just leave in the bathtub for my allies to eat.

327
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And they would eventually become, to recognize me as their master.

328
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And they, I would just be able to like, you know,

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Hang out with them.

330
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Munchy becoming a real life Pokemon trainer.

331
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, exactly.

332
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Don't catch her Munchy wants to battle.

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There can be, there can be no cooperation with the bugs.

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
There can be, there can be, there can be only war.

335
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There can be only war between us.

336
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I like carrots and peppers and bugs.

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Listen, listen.

338
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Shout out if you get the reference.

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If you're some fucking song fan, you know, you pitched yourself,

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
we've seen the song of the hedgehog getting a brawl,

341
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
or you're some fucking proud fancy head,

342
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and you were so happy when Cloud got in.

343
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Think about how happy I was when Silverfish got into Minecraft,

344
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
the most wholesome, you know, epic gaming mashup of all time.

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And they were representing my brand, my favorite series, Silverfish,

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The Bug from Real Life.

347
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I was so ecstatic.

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Ugh.

349
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It was great.

350
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, that's nice.

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We, me, remember Earwigs?

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Remember Earwigs?

353
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I do.

354
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We had Earwigs by the pool when we were kids.

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They were terrible.

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They were getting your shoes.

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They were getting your shoes.

358
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You had to shake out, you had to shake your shoes

359
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
to make sure no Earwigs had gotten in.

360
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't mind them that much.

361
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I think they're much less disgusting.

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Have you guys ever had fleas?

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Then four, for example, a house centipede.

364
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
As a little kid, as a little kid I did have,

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think we both got lice, Nate.

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I remember having to shampoo with some like special shampoo

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
because I had lice.

368
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, I hate all of this.

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is the worst.

370
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But you know, as a kid, as a little kid,

371
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
as a little kid it didn't gross me out

372
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and I like, I barely even thought about it.

373
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I was like, okay, mom says I got lice.

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, I guess I'll just fucking shampoo

375
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
with this shampoo or whatever.

376
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Back then I didn't mind much.

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Didn't freak me out or anything.

379
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It is pretty fucking gross in hindsight though.

380
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah.

381
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Dude, I only had lice once in my life,

382
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
which I suppose makes sense due to the fact

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that I'm 80% hair.

384
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I got when I was in fourth graders

385
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and then I was the talk of the town.

386
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I was so fucking popular.

387
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Everyone wanted to high five you.

388
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah, they were like, oh shit, you got lice?

389
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Dude, I was like, I know.

390
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It wasn't easy, but believe me,

391
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I triumph over everything that I touch.

392
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Cool.

393
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It was so sick.

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It was like getting a cast and everyone would be like,

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
oh man, can I sign your cast?

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Everyone wanted to stay away from me,

397
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but also whistled me from far away.

398
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Like a cat call, or like a lice call if you would.

399
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How bizarre.

400
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
How bizarre.

401
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
No.

402
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I mean, can you imagine having your friend have lice

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and being like, oh man, I can pick out his hair

404
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and get out of his creature?

405
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No.

406
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

407
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah.

408
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It sounds like the worst thing ever, actually.

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, as a five-year-old?

410
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean, you know, however you roll.

411
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I get that if you're a kid and you're too retarded to know

412
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
that that's awful, then maybe it wouldn't sound awful.

413
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Okay, all right.

414
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah, all right.

415
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That makes sense.

416
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It was delicious.

417
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They were delicious.

418
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hey, I've got a hard left turn of a topic here.

419
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Can we say this?

420
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I want to talk about bugs and pests.

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's good.

422
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I just feel like we've said literally everything there was to say.

423
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But here's what I got.

424
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So yesterday, I finished my Nuzlocke.

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It is complete.

426
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

427
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And it's over.

428
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
A cameo.

429
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
A cameo.

430
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's true.

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There was a cameo from The Saint, a.k.a. Ben.

432
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I conquered.

433
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, you know what?

434
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I won't say what I did.

435
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You can just go watch it for yourself, people.

436
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It was really cool.

437
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But here's what I wanted to say about it.

438
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You thought it was good?

439
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You enjoyed it?

440
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

441
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, it was great.

442
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It was great.

443
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The people went hog wild and they loved it.

444
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
They did.

445
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They did.

446
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Twitch.tv slash definitely best guy ever.

447
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Go check it out.

448
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There's a YouTube upload thing for it as well.

449
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But here's what I wanted to say.

450
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The experience of yesterday was very interesting.

451
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And I think it was not totally new, but reminded me of something I haven't felt in a long time.

452
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And it was that when I was younger, I used to do plays and shit and do musicals.

453
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I haven't done it for quite a while.

454
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But yesterday, doing this Twitch thing, there was around 200 people there.

455
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I actually used to get bigger numbers of viewers when I would stream on YouTube than I do on Twitch.

456
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But what was interesting, what the difference was, this was a far more hype event going on yesterday.

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And everybody was just more into it and freaking out and engaged.

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And as we were doing it, as the whole event was happening, there was just a lot of energy.

459
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There was a lot of fun.

460
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And there was a real sense of, I don't know, community, I guess, going on.

461
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And just hyping life.

462
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I could feel life pulsing through my veins.

463
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And then it finished.

464
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It ended.

465
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And then the turning off the stream and just sitting back and sitting there quietly.

466
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's just like when I'm watching a stream where something cool is happening and then it ends.

467
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
There's a great emptiness.

468
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Beating a video game, especially with this, something I've been doing for like seven months.

469
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Then I beat it.

470
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And now it's like the journey is over.

471
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Imagine shuffling out of the stadium after a good game or something.

472
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

473
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Or imagine like, I don't know, you're fucking, I don't know, Bon Jovi or whoever.

474
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And you go play on stage and you have thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, whatever people cheer in.

475
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Obviously smaller numbers here.

476
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Same idea.

477
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And then you're like, yeah, you're a god on the stage, right?

478
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Everything's great.

479
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And then it ends.

480
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And then you go off stage and there's a guy's like, oh, you want a coffee?

481
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You want me to get you a coffee?

482
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You want me to like, I'll get you one?

483
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, you're like, yeah, sure.

484
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Okay.

485
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then he goes and you're just sitting there.

486
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah.

487
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And you're like, yeah, I did a good job.

488
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I did it.

489
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But it's just quiet now.

490
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's just quiet now.

491
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And sure it's a time to reflect, but that high, that high is gone.

492
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And I'm just like, so this is why they do cocaine.

493
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This is why they do cocaine, to get it back.

494
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And I'm like, I totally get it.

495
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I totally get it.

496
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I mean, was it a bad experience?

497
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, it sounds melancholy, right?

498
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It sounds melancholy.

499
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, it was definitely a melancholy feeling, which I've definitely felt to lesser extents,

500
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
like I was saying.

501
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Would you say that you felt this way before, so insecure?

502
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I would say so.

503
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Owned.

504
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Like when I was young, you know, doing plays and stuff, because like you'll go and you'll

505
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
practice for months and months, like every couple of days or whatever.

506
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And then it's like, you know, you're getting close, you're doing dress rehearsals and shit

507
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and you're like there every day working on stuff.

508
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And then you do your last show and then it's over.

509
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Everybody goes home and that's, yeah, you can look forward to your next thing.

510
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There's all that.

511
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But the sense of melancholy was palpable.

512
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And I don't know, I just felt like I gained a greater understanding for like performers

513
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and show people.

514
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And I'm like, yeah, everybody says they're really retarded for like doing drugs to chase

515
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
a high.

516
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But I think a lot of that's because we can't understand their perspective.

517
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I just felt like I get it more now.

518
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's incredibly interesting.

519
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So you're a drug addict now is what you're telling us.

520
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I would never do any drugs, but too strong.

521
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Stay tuned for the best guy ever rehab arc in 2019.

522
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We're looking forward to that.

523
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I think that's something that's probably unique to live streams or I guess, you know, live performances.

524
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I agree.

525
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I would say I can't really imagine playing the same way when like a, you know, a big

526
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
video gets released, you know, which I have done.

527
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, my fucking big smash videos got like hundreds of thousands of views, but it's a

528
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
totally different sensation.

529
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's not like an immediate, it's not like you were just performing and then the event is over.

530
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's been, you've been toiling over this for, you know, God knows how long, you know, weeks

531
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
at this point and you're divorced from the feeling of actually, you know, the Nate that

532
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
was recording or, you know, not in the smash videos, but you know, in, in, I don't know,

533
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,500
Gern Laganne part two, you're so far removed from the Nate who was doing that voiceover

534
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,000
and you know, who was acted in those bits.

535
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It doesn't even feel like the same person.

536
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's not like you were acting really.

537
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It was just you were, you know, you've been finalizing the act for, you know, months or

538
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
years, I guess in that case.

539
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Those took six months to make or so I think.

540
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's really interesting.

541
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think I have only, because I'm not like a stream person, you know, that's not my trade,

542
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but there's been very few times where I've sort of gotten the same scenario where it's

543
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
been a really successful stream.

544
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There were a lot of people and it was really a hype moment.

545
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The other thing that I could think about after that was just man.

546
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Like, like I've done my work.

547
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I, like I can now read, I can die with a smile.

548
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Like I've completed everything that I need to complete and now it's just time for me

549
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
to rest and you know, not engage with anyone for like two weeks.

550
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
That's how it was after the flag referendum stream on RFCK, which everyone fucking went

551
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
bananas for and it was a great stream.

552
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I still haven't, I still haven't seen it.

553
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Really?

554
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Well, yeah, everyone, everyone says that I should and I keep meaning to, but I haven't

555
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
gotten around to actually watching.

556
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know what, like I, having not seen it, it's very mysterious to me.

557
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And like I wonder what it could, like what could even be about this stream that like

558
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
is so, I don't know, like it's clearly something.

559
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
There's clearly something to it, but I don't know.

560
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, okay.

561
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Tight.

562
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah.

563
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay.

564
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There's a lot of energy, a lot of voting going on, a lot of number tabulation.

565
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

566
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah.

567
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's what I'm saying.

568
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's what I'm talking about.

569
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I think that's some old, munchy hyperactivity that doesn't really translate a lot nowadays

570
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
because I don't know.

571
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah.

572
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I have mellowed down a little bit.

573
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Wait, what do you mean nowadays?

574
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That was like, that was like two weeks ago.

575
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,360
I'm saying, I'm saying that you don't really, like that, that's a sort of old brand of my

576
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,000
humor that you don't really see a whole lot.

577
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That was resurfaced.

578
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Oh, okay.

579
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's a modern day.

580
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's true.

581
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It feels like a sort of like almost even a deagle nation-esque energy that I have for

582
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
a thing.

583
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah.

584
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But you know, the biggest comparison for this whole thing, like the performance thing

585
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,560
definitely probably is the most accurate, but the one that's most familiar to me is

586
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:56,000
when you beat a big video game, specifically that took a ton of time, like a Final Fantasy

587
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
or, I don't know, JRPGs are probably the best example to take like 50 to 100 hours,

588
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
maybe longer.

589
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,880
You beat it and it's, you're happy that you won.

590
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,000
You're satisfied that you did it, but you're sad the journey is over.

591
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah.

592
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That's what it was.

593
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That's the biggest thing I think.

594
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah.

595
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I have that.

596
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Like, I unfortunately cannot relate as someone who doesn't like or play single-player games,

597
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
but I can relate in the sense of like finishing like series of things.

598
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I just undertaken a massive, massive podcasting, I don't know, binge experience listening to

599
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,600
Mike Duncan's The History of Rome, and that was like a long, like 170-plus episode series,

600
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,920
and I just finished it earlier today.

601
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,480
And it's weird having this like series that has taken up like almost every waking hour

602
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,560
of my life when I'm not like editing something for like weeks, just now be gone.

603
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,320
And like, yeah, I guess I finished that.

604
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,600
It's like, it's like, where have my friends gone?

605
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Yeah.

606
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,960
It's like when you beat Final Fantasy VII, it's like, oh, I don't get to hang out with

607
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,920
like Cloud and Tifa and like Yuffie anymore.

608
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Oh, don't say like that.

609
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
You're going to make me fucking cry.

610
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
It's sad.

611
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,440
It's literally like they're dead because it's like you can have no more new experiences

612
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
with Cloud.

613
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,440
You can have no new experiences with these characters that you come accustomed to.

614
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,960
But Nate, when the remake comes out, you'll get all new experiences for $5.99 for DLC

615
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
expansion.

616
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,800
Like when am I going to get to see TTLMZ, the canonical team leader of my party, the

617
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,440
Gyarados, the MVP of the fucking run, and Gastrodon Prime, the legendary Doon Koon who

618
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,760
kicked everybody's ass and overcame all the odds.

619
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,400
You know, when am I going to get harassed by Russell the ghost again and you know, all

620
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,880
these, all these kooky, when am I going to go flying with Juicy Shack Meet the Noctowl,

621
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,960
my useless Pokemon whose only use is flying as my only surviving bird.

622
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,720
But you know, that's sad.

623
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,600
Well, Nate, well, as Tommy Wiseau might say, that's life, you know, that is, you know,

624
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:09,320
you gotta, you know, people, experiences and people and friends are all, you know, fleeting

625
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,360
and they're all, they all end.

626
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,680
I hope this doesn't come across unnecessary dick sucking, but you know what, here you

627
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
need to describe this.

628
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,400
I truly am not sorry, I guess, but you know, I kind of regret not getting on the Nate Nuzlocke

629
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,160
bandwagon because I, because I knew, I knew it was something special for a while now,

630
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
but it's just hard.

631
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,160
But I don't like follow the streams and I don't really know when they're happening

632
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,640
and I don't really, you know, necessarily have the time to tune into streams.

633
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
Yeah, that's, I do.

634
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
I do.

635
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
I do.

636
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
I feel like I should have.

637
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Yeah, same, same, but I also realized that like, I mean, I don't, the time, it's a big

638
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,920
time investment, right?

639
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
It sure is.

640
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
It sure is.

641
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,720
That's like hundreds of hours of fucking content.

642
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,520
I guess about a hundred hours or so.

643
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,760
Yeah, yeah.

644
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
So yeah, I get it.

645
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,080
And also, let's not forget that a lot of those streams are lit, as everybody who is

646
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,200
there would say, it's like, I don't know, 50 to 60% of like looking at charts and updating

647
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,320
spreadsheets and like thinking and just grinding and raw grinding, which has become a great

648
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,120
meme that a lot of people enjoy.

649
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,240
But for the, for the true warriors, no need, bra, you know, everybody else who was in the

650
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,360
trenches, Russell, of course, like they suffered, they suffered the boredom of, I mean, we,

651
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,960
you know, we would just bitch and talk about life and stuff and just answer questions,

652
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,280
which is a lot of what many of those streams were while we grinded.

653
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,160
But I mean, the people now who were there, like they get to feel basically the vicarious

654
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,520
accomplishment and then, you know, the actual accomplishment, because a lot of them actually

655
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,880
contributed to strategy and thoughts and like what we did and stuff.

656
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,480
And so to those, like it's easy to look back now on what those guys did and be like, wow.

657
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
And you know, me too, like that was, that was so great.

658
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,960
I wish I'd been there, but it actually, there was a lot of, there was a lot of work, a lot

659
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
of downtime.

660
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,120
Well, you know, isn't that, isn't that just what any, isn't that what anything good is

661
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
like?

662
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Yes, it is.

663
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,520
Like anything at the time seems like a slog or like gum.

664
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
Dude, like making the highlight.

665
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,800
Or just like work, but then like later you look back and you're like, actually that was

666
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
great.

667
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
At the time it was work.

668
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Yes.

669
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Because we remember the past fondly.

670
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,120
Every single fucking week, I would record arm retrieval and I would be like a time to

671
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
edit it.

672
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,120
It would be like the most, this show sucks.

673
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,520
No one is going to watch it.

674
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,320
There's no reason for me to do this.

675
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,520
It's just taking time away from other things.

676
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
One earth would I do it.

677
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:30,840
And arm retrieval is probably the most defining best thing I've ever done online, unironically.

678
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,800
Arm retrieval fan loves it, like with an unbelievable passion that I cannot even like understand.

679
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,400
I mean, look no farther than arm retrieval con three when like 11 people flew out just

680
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,360
to like talk to me about arm retrieval for like three hours.

681
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Yeah.

682
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Yeah.

683
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
That's how you know.

684
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
That's real shit.

685
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
That's real connection.

686
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,200
I think there's something like apart from the actual like quality of the streams that

687
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,080
makes it such a good experience to be a part of your streams.

688
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,920
I mean, yeah, absolutely.

689
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,560
I think there's a community sense.

690
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Yeah.

691
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,720
A lot of people only see each other during these streams and they're like friends on

692
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,840
the streams kind of.

693
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,760
I think there's something so valuable that like I especially in life in my life of having

694
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,080
a sense of like being a part of a community and being there on the front lines when something

695
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,680
new releases.

696
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:29,280
There is no fucking greater joy in my life than I experienced seeing a new episode of

697
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,160
My Little Pony and being like, I can't wait to fucking talk about this hot new background

698
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
pony.

699
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,440
Can't wait to can't wait to hear the newest T-Bap.

700
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
Can't wait to see the latest T-Bap.

701
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Of course.

702
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
This one.

703
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Yeah.

704
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Yeah.

705
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Yeah.

706
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Yeah.

707
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Yeah.

708
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
It's so great.

709
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,400
Like I know there's a lot to be said about like the actual quality of a show or podcast

710
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
or whatever.

711
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,560
Being dampened by you know having pacing being broken up due to the fact that it releases

712
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,040
over weeks and it's not the ideal way to intake art in for art's sake.

713
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:08,080
But there is no doubt a ton of community joy that you reap from being a part of a fandom

714
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,080
or a community and releasing it to you know and watching it with your fellow community

715
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
ease.

716
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,320
This is the reason behind like the podcast has been going strong like in my life because

717
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,920
I've been reading it every week for like 15 years or whatever.

718
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,040
It's the community that keeps me really engaged and stuff.

719
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,720
I mean I'd read it no matter what but it enhances the experience so much to like have a new

720
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,800
chapter come out.

721
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
It's like a big thing.

722
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,600
It's like God drops a gift that like all these people expect and then we all get to

723
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,560
reap the benefits of in all these different ways with like a new episode of a show everybody's

724
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,680
watching or a new chapter of One Piece or you know or like the stuff we make maybe a

725
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,640
new episode of the fucking PCP that people gather around and have a community around

726
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
and enjoy.

727
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,960
Oh man I would pay money.

728
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,960
I would bribe people to have PCP listening parties.

729
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,880
That would be so cool to hear be a thing.

730
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
That would be pretty cool.

731
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,320
Like we could even pay someone to listen to this track.

732
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
It's great.

733
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,600
By the way maybe we should go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators and donate some

734
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
money there.

735
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
What do you think about that?

736
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
That makes sense.

737
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
I would never do something like that.

738
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,440
Especially in the Patreon page PU it stinks in there.

739
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
No sane person would.

740
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:29,160
By the way this is like this is the PCP viewers like you are aware of the many many many

741
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:36,120
bad things we've had to say about communities and fandoms and internet groups in general.

742
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Just talking about making me kneel over and die.

743
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:51,160
But I think there's a lot of unspoken joys that are in those things that we made trash

744
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
talk a lot.

745
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,160
I mean if there wasn't why would we do any of it.

746
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Yeah.

747
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Right.

748
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,440
Why wouldn't we just kneel down and fucking commit ritual seppuku right here on the fucking

749
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
pavement.

750
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,200
I think we're really getting close to that.

751
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Right here in the Walmart parking lot where I make my home.

752
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,360
Oh the silverfish fill that cardboard box.

753
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,920
They're by pillows at night.

754
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
They're allies Munchy.

755
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,880
Oh they're so fucking allies they are my friends they are my Pokemon I'm gonna name

756
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
them all.

757
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
I love them so much.

758
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Is there a silverfish Pokemon?

759
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
I think there is.

760
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Is it What's His Faces?

761
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Yeah.

762
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Wimpod.

763
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Wimpod.

764
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,080
I guess he's collected so much silverfish candies he can like he's getting ready to

765
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
evolve them.

766
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,080
It's gonna be something nuts.

767
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,280
Oh I can't wait for their community day to come Tom McCow is their community day to come

768
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
up.

769
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,400
I'm so excited.

770
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:54,680
I've talked about this a bit in various fan chats but I think something that is related

771
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,000
to what we've been talking about here that I want to do for my like for like my mental

772
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
health.

773
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,360
This is not a joke.

774
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:07,400
I want to get back on Tumblr because listen everyone has an idea of what Tumblr is like

775
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,280
in their mind like oh you know it's full of SJWs.

776
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:16,320
Like Tumblr is a community like any other website meaning that you can find those people

777
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,320
I don't see that people don't exist or they aren't even a majority but just don't follow

778
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
them.

779
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,000
I've been thinking about getting back on Tumblr too like I never made any headway on Tumblr

780
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,120
and I gave up really fast but like I didn't do anything there so like it's not that surprising

781
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,680
that nothing came of it but yeah it's just like it's just it's another platform where

782
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,200
a lot of people are and like it sure would be nice to fucking be on there.

783
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,480
Tom was always a big Tumblr guy wasn't he?

784
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
I mean just like posting there.

785
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Yeah I mean I still use it.

786
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
I still have a Tumblr.

787
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,480
I want to say for other people who've never been on Tumblr it's so easy to follow like

788
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,520
exclusively alt-right people it's really really easy this is not like a homogenous society

789
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
or a community.

790
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Yeah I mean if you follow me you follow an alt-right guy.

791
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,520
It's not just all SJWs.

792
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,320
It's so easy to like curate what you want to see and what you want to you know engage

793
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
with.

794
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
I guess in the same way.

795
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,320
I love content aggregators so much.

796
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,820
They are real good.

797
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,940
I guess in the same way that like as a 4chan guy I just shit on Reddit you know even though

798
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,900
I could be on you know my my what would be my home base r slash thedonald of course and

799
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:37,180
you know just be on there posting my MAGA hat memes and my you know you know all the

800
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:42,060
things all the things but instead I'm just going to say it's all Reddit skate guys.

801
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
Dude lol.

802
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
I'm going to keep that up as long as possible.

803
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,900
I guess I well not desperately I'm not this is not I'm not aching for this in my life

804
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,140
like I need it like I need it like I need my heroin shots my right fellow drug addicts

805
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,140
haha.

806
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
That's correct.

807
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
Yeah.

808
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,740
But it's I want to come to rehab Nate it's going to be good.

809
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,620
Nate get a heroin problem get a get a drug problem start chase that high you gotta chase

810
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,620
that magic dragon.

811
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,380
That will be a good narrative for the PCP I think that could be a good one so we can

812
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,380
definitely monetize that.

813
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,380
Oh next episode hey guys welcome to the PCP.

814
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:19,740
Welcome to a new episode I think you can snort like powdered heroin or whatever.

815
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,820
I'm going to inject paint okay I mean you can probably snort.

816
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,820
I want to do the eyeball injection style you know right that's what I want right to the

817
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,220
pupil dude.

818
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,380
You know hey I saw something the other day speaking of eyeball injections quick quick

819
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,620
aside on this where could I saw a YouTuber he said something like a hundred thousand

820
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,740
hundred twenty thousand subs I forget his name but his his claim to fame was that he's

821
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:51,020
like a tattoo slash body modification guy and all I'm saying is his he had a bunch tattoos

822
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:56,620
whatever his right eye the white of his eye had been tattooed blue and my first thought

823
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:03,660
was is this a sands reference is this a sands thing going I could not figure out if it was

824
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
or is not.

825
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,900
So he tattooed his fucking the white the white is the cornea right no is that a difference

826
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,820
no I forget the name of it.

827
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,340
Okay I mean I had met a guy in person who had tattooed his white's black but it's sclera

828
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,180
sclera yeah there you go there you go so he had tattooed like with a needle like with

829
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,460
a fucking like yeah I think they do it with a needle it's blue that doesn't live that

830
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,460
doesn't sound possible oh it's I met a man who he was the he said he was the most tattooed

831
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,980
man in the world at a tattoo convention in like somewhere in New York I think and he

832
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,740
had horns and shit under his skin on his head his whole body was covered in blue puzzle

833
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,100
pieces and the whites of his eyes the sclera were tattooed black and I just looked in this

834
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:52,660
man's eyes and was like that's a demon I'm gonna get into the tattoo community on Tumblr

835
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:58,060
I'm gonna make an OC called Tatlis based on Toothless from Helltrain and Dragon I've

836
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,700
made this joke two times before on the pcb by the way it's gonna be a returning joke

837
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,900
the the Tatlis brand will overcome all obstacles I bet that the Tatlis is like the one that

838
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:13,620
the most he's like he's like the pure virgin you know around everyone wants to wants to

839
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:19,980

843
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,820
feel or else we'll feel and we'll feel self-conscious about it if he's not doing it too that's probably

849
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,940
a move well it wasn't his community day it was just generally community no I know but

850
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,540
you could get the community a move still maybe it's like a chance this I don't know I think

851
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:33,260
the game sucks I think that's the yeah that sounds right yeah yeah I don't really care

852

about that oh I've got a quick update I finally evolved my Scyther into a scissor I have I was

00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,740
bag on you know I was very happy when he became a shell gun but it was like oh my god the road

859

the road ahead is so long and it's long it's long good luck we this can easily become like the

860
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:26,660
Pokemon go news segment because there's I mean yeah fucking there's some crazy news I don't know

needs more pokeballs guys doesn't have enough poker stops hashtag Ben Doxt my mom is that

872
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:51,700
Niantic is actually paying more attention to the competitive scene a fucking Pokemon go than

873
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:58,260
the main series is of the actual Pokemon series dude let's get into that this is a fascinating

874
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:05,900
topic to me yeah about representation of characters I just thought about this today so yes an outside

875
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:11,940
company like Niantic giving more of a shit about like what the community wants and demands and what

876
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:18,180
would be best for the people rather than the like first-person self self-awareness of the Nintendo

877
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,900
company Game Freak or whatever that is probably fucking it up bad like that just reminded me of

878
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:29,220
like cloud and smash is real cloud he's not like gay advent children cloud that Square Enix wants him

879
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:35,260
to be and also I thought about in smash like Richter Belmont you know got confirmed whatever

880
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,700
he's cool from Castlevania and shit and like his like intro line when he was put in was the like

881
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,100
actually it's a big on monster they censored die but he says big on monster you don't belong in

882
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:50,300
this world that's the classic line from Symphony of the night and in the remake the update that

883
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:56,140
just got released for that game like because of this announcement probably they change his lines

884
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,460
to be like behold there again is a third party knowing the character and what the people want

885
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,740
more than the base company it's just how is it all the time I don't wait no I don't understand

886
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:13,500
what do you what do you mean okay my point is that what when people think about like Richter

887
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,980
Belmont memes they think about he says he says die monster you don't belong in this world it is a

888
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:25,620
classic quintessential so the parent company changed it to be gone something more like I don't

889
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:30,860
know normal e but they they change the actual that'd be like removing you know all your base

890
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:35,340
are belong to us from like a remake so okay wait wait so they didn't change it to the smash

891
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:42,140
line no no smash is the original line basically no it's not because it's be gone instead of die

892
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,660
okay yes they censored the word die to be gone yet they did do that which is so the parent company

893
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,140
changed it but not to I thought you were gonna say they changed it to be gone monster to match

894
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,740
the smash line no no no no okay they change it to something totally different that you know in

895
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,940
effect communicates the same idea but isn't the meme and that was a mistake this is what was it was

896
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,820
it Jesse talking about they changed the lines and yes that's right well it was both of us we were

897
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,980
both talking yeah yeah okay okay so we're talking about the same thing all right we're best we are

898
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,220
we got we keep them back to this well the reason not that it's just like that and like the cloud

899
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,260
example you know what he's like he's like real cloud and smash he's like not he's fake different

900
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,740
cloud according to square enix and like all those representations and I'm just like it's

901
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:32,380
it really seems like first person self-awareness of companies they don't know what the people want

902
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:37,980
as well as like outside like fandom to get into the specifics of as people know what the fuck we're

903
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:43,980
talking about uh in pokemon go they've introduced like you know along with pvp pvp it's not just

904
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:49,100
going to be you know whoever is the strongest pokemon gets to you know dominate the meta they

905
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:57,980
introduced like pseudo smog on tiers for the battling league leagues based on uh on cp yeah yeah

906
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,580
so it's it's gonna be you're gonna be able to battle in lower tiers with like lower cp limits

907
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:08,860
and it's gonna have a wider range of variety in the pokemon that are presented that is so cool

908
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,180
that it's it's gonna make like shit pokemon relevant yeah i'm gonna be able to use mecargo

909
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:20,460
yeah or fucking i don't know spirit to uh meta chuckle can we do chuckle yeah yeah it's gonna

910
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,580
be fucking crazy are the battles gonna be turn based or is it gonna be the weird gym it's probably

911
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,900
it's pro i'm gonna i mean if it's pokemon go it's gonna be the fucking tap and swipe yeah i mean

912
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,340
we can assume that yeah yeah you know speaking to this yeah quick yeah i'm curious if you guys

913
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,700
have any opinions on this i happen to see some tweets from uh aron hanson from ego raptor today

914
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:51,260
viciously defending pokemon go as like go or let's go oh sorry let's go let's go yeah okay

915
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:59,180
one okay as like way better than people were saying one because he has little time he doesn't care

916
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:06,140
about like the bullshit extra non-core gameplay stuff uh that's been piled on top of like the

917
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:11,260
mainline pokemon games and let's go like apparently does away with that i haven't played it i don't

918
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,700
know and and then also that like the games were always easy so it's not a problem that the games

919
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:23,420
are easier this i it i was thinking about this just the other day i was thinking about that i was

920
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:29,420
thinking about the last pcp episode and how people actually defended pokemon let's go and just getting

921
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:35,820
so mad because like i was i just i don't know what kind of i don't know what kind of fucking mutant

922
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:43,980
tom's in the call right i don't know what's wrong with you and hippo and everyone who is like

923
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:49,500
who is like boy i sure do love i sure do love pokemon i sure am glad that i get to play a

924
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,940
version of pokemon that just isn't even a game anymore because i just i love pokemon but i don't

925
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,940
i love pokemon but i don't have fucking time to actually play it or anything so i have this like

926
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:05,580
shit version that sucks thank god like what i just all all the only thing is i just i'm not as

927
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:10,300
hardcore as you that's it that's all it is and like you could i don't get it i don't get it i look at

928
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,860
pokemon let's go and i just see all the appeal is gone but they took out everything good did you

929
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:20,380
play it no i saw i watched someone play it i actually didn't play it the other day i i did

930
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:26,300
play it with myself with my own my own two hands is it actually like what he was saying and it's

931
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,260
like streamlined it's just kind of better and that you can like just get to the actual i mean i

932
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:37,420
i didn't beat it what if it was like pokemon but there was no real battling and no challenges

933
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,900
but that well there sounds good right sounds cool isn't that pokemon go though pokemon go is

934
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,100
completely different and not even the same thing a slightly made by a different company too so that

935
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:53,100
you know it was i mean streamlined it was just as streamlined as the gameboy games you know the

936
00:46:53,100 --> 00:47:00,700
gameboy games i mean well okay tom i think it's safe to say that pokemon go isn't like a threat to

937
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:07,020
like main core pokemon games it doesn't it doesn't in any way like impede like it is literally a

938
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:13,500
totally separate company working on it i'm sure that it uses some dev time but but but okay i mean

939
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,220
i get that appeal of the core appeal of it is totally i get that and i understand that but

940
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:26,700
here's my question okay if pokemon let's go is a threat as you just said i'm assuming by saying

941
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,740
that pokemon go isn't because it's different platform but pokemon let's go is bad because

942
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:37,900
it's it's a mainline game right like that's your position yeah the reason it might be but the reason

943
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,780
pokemon let's go is what it is is because of pokemon go so it doesn't that mean pokemon go is

944
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:49,100
what fucked everything up it definitely possible definitely possible so like no so yeah i'm prepared

945
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,260
to say that pokemon go was part of the problem possibly also let me just read you a quote real

946
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:59,660
quick there was a news article very well yeah i saw this this is the direct claim that the game is

947
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:06,140
in fact a quote core and quote quote quote the actual title is uh mossy distresses the pokemon

948
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:11,180
let's go isn't a spin-off future tiles could connect to pokemon go and uh i personally prefer the

949
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:17,500
steve version shouts to steve uh mossy distresses that the new pokemon games will be shit that's

950
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,940
you know okay like he just said this is a core title it's time to hit which is weird because

951
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:29,340
like that goes against what they said when they announced yeah yeah it's weird i agree if if if if

952
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:35,020
this is if this is what pokemon is from now on i'm live i'm never buying another pokemon ever again

953
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:40,540
there i mean it is i was i played defense for pokemon let's go saying it was a place to experiment

954
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,820
with different ideas but if this is what they're gonna turn pokemon into i don't hate it as much as

955
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:51,420
you guys do but there's definitely stuff from the classic experiences that aren't there anymore

956
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,660
that i miss and so yeah i'll be a little bit more miffed and i won't be i have to take the

957
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,540
kid gloves off with my yep saying that it's not as big of a deal as it was listen this is going to

958
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,940
get extremely patronizing and anyone who even slightly cares about let's go is going to think

959
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:10,220
i'm such a fucking asshole right now okay all right i'm listening here's the thing i mean this

960
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:16,780
sounds like like goo goo gaga like a vapor like basic like you know do you know you can breathe air

961
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:23,580
you can lower the skill floor while not lowering the skill ceiling too yeah did you

962
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:31,180
guys fucking not know that you can make it easier without just removing features did you not think

963
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,700
that that was possible it's it's like they listened it's like they listened to the people that are

964
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:43,900
like the hidden hidden stats are too i don't like them i can't fucking i don't like hidden you don't

965
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:50,700
need a patron to any of that i played pokemon games for fucking hundreds of hours that i didn't

966
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,500
know when they just work breeding is too complicated with egg i don't want to think about egg moves

967
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,140
when i'm breeding i just want to play pokemon guys i just want to fucking catch monsters and

968
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:07,820
beat the elite ford you don't have to breed to do that you don't even have to try it he's right

969
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:15,100
pokemon is 100% you can casually brute force without any problem and beat the game and like i

970
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:21,900
guess you could complain that like you do have to spend time grinding but it is a jrpg at its core

971
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,900
right grinding and pokemon has never been a problem for me i'm someone who doesn't give a

972
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,460
shit about breeding or egg moves or any of that shit because i just don't think speaks for a lot

973
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:36,060
of people here like more the more like uh i guess like boomer generation who like grew up on pokemon

974
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:41,100
and now as an adult and shit and it's like no no stop stop stop i'm what you we can't we can't

975
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:45,580
just let language corrode to the point that we are just literally calling millennials boomers

976
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:50,780
okay you're right i guess well he's a little bit older so no he's not he's like he's like my age

977
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,020
he's like 30 he's like a year older than me he's 31 i think he's like yeah he's a year he's a millennial

978
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:03,340
okay fair enough okay so he's a millennial but we all agree the bin is a boomer but the point is

979
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:09,100
world world's youngest boomer his biggest issue that i could see he had a long string of tweets um

980
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:14,540
but the the main issue i saw with him was that he he was so much happier that it requires less

981
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,940
time to play because he doesn't like having to spend lots of time that makes me so angry

982
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,660
like i love god i love that i can spend less time playing this game that i really love

983
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,060
fuck i mean because he said he's gonna get the fuck out of here to get to like the core like

984
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:33,580
just the like the stuff that he values more which i i get that guess what you fucking you

985
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:38,540
strip away you strip away all the bullshit in a video game down to the core and what you have

986
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:43,420
is a fucking gland in your brain that's secreting dopamine and that's me there's nothing else

987
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:49,500
everything else is bullshit it's interesting because like as someone who's played some of the

988
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:56,460
pokemon games but not all of them and never to the degree that ben clearly has when i played let's

989
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,700
go i was just like yeah it's pokemon game they change like the capturing but other than that it's

990
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:05,900
pretty much what i've always played so like all the things you're talking about is being stripped out

991
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,380
i don't even know about so it's interesting to hear this perspective oh my god it sounds like the

992
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,420
like the more then why should the mouth if you never even knew about them then why on earth would

993
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,380
you strip them out because even the casual audience doesn't mind it it doesn't impede their affection

994
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:26,060
yeah that's a good question and i don't i don't really have an answer for that i mean all i can

995
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:31,500
say is that for my kind of play i don't have a huge problem with it because it does what i expect

996
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,020
a pokemon game to do i okay why take all the stuff out yeah if it doesn't mean it's not the

997
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:42,140
experience they're trying to create i mean i don't know how much of it is is gone well like like

998
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:49,580
like that god abilities gone wait what yes oh my it's oh my god okay yeah then right yeah all right

999
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:54,780
gone they took up they took good i thought we hold items and abilities are gone are you

1000
00:52:54,780 --> 00:53:00,620
fucking kidding me yes yes i'm sure you're sure okay take your word for it it's even worse than i

1001
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:05,100
thought i got i guess i guess i'm just thinking of red and blue and red and blue let's fucking

1002
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:10,780
let's just fucking regress like sure like we spent we spent like like decades like building up

1003
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:15,180
fire and leaf green though like like i don't have i know hold out where we're good yeah hold

1004
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,220
buildies where yes build it building up this carry this incredibly intricate like you know

1005
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,860
like relatively well balanced combat system and like fucking strategy game and thing

1006
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,580
and then like oh wait let's just fucking make a new one let's just make the next one we just

1007
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:36,300
take it all out again why there's no reason to listen okay listen okay okay wait wait wait

1008
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:43,020
pokemon sun and moon was way easier than x and y but you know what it had held items and abilities

1009
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:49,180
there was no reason to delete features of the video game or remove them when you can just make

1010
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:55,580
the game easier regardless it's not like sun and moon is like a fucking 700 hour campaign it's it's

1011
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:59,740
like it's like it's like someone like it's like erin okay i haven't read the tweets but it's like oh

1012
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,580
you can get to the core you get to the core let's bullshit get to the core of what i like about

1013
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:09,100
fucking pokemon let's go like what is the core that like you see a fucking 3d model of a pokemon

1014
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:14,220
show up on screen and you clap like a fucking seal like there it is like fuck you what's wrong

1015
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,860
with you they just got rid of the game they just like cut the game in half and you're like oh few

1016
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:24,220
oh fucking what a relief i got a question i'm thinking about something and i'm i'm comparing

1017
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:30,540
two games in my mind i'm thinking about what is the core gameplay what is the core that people want

1018
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:36,140
from a game like for example i'm comparing kingdom hearts and then on the other side uh like bayonetta

1019
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:44,460
devil may cry both are action rpgs but very different in uh like like kingdom hearts is like a

1020
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,940
you especially kingdom hearts too is what i'm thinking of uh that's the most similar one to like

1021
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:53,980
you know devil may cry and shit like in devil may cry you still have to like earn orbs to like get

1022
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:58,620
moves for the weapons that you acquire but ultimately in like devil may cry three like the

1023
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:03,180
goal is essentially to like unlock all the moves so that you can like learn how to do them via you

1024
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:09,740
know crazy inputs and shit and and then you're like like you do have to do some grinding to unlock

1025
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,380
everything to play the game like and i guess it's quote unquote core which is what like high level

1026
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:20,780
people want to do and kingdom hearts is similar but there's way more grinding required to get there

1027
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,020
you have to unlock tons more moves you start off with way less abilities at the beginning of the

1028
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,740
game and there's more like customization of like what stuff you equip what what stuff you don't you

1029
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:35,580
know you can like set your stuff up a little bit more carefully that way and i'm like so but i

1030
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:42,540
bet someone like aron would say the core of kingdom hearts is like fun adventures in disney worlds

1031
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:48,300
which is yeah like at the very least some people would make that argument so i'm like so should we

1032
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:54,140
for kingdom hearts three for example remove all that bullshit customization and just make it as

1033
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:59,500
fast as possible all the combat stuffs just streamlined you get like one combo you do and you

1034
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:05,740
just get more disney like faster make it just depends on what you want i don't want to bring back

1035
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:11,900
like the arcade argument from like 2007 like like games are so fucking short now all short games are

1036
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,460
bad like that fucking like old like i can't even believe that i remember that from a billion years

1037
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:26,140
but why do you want every game to require no time investment investment and have no impact on your

1038
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,700
memory and have it just be oh yeah just just i'm just gonna come fucking consume this game in an

1039
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:35,820
afternoon that's what it sounds like aron's advocating for it really does it really does

1040
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,140
i'm sorry i'm sorry to say it aron but like he's talking about in these tweets he doesn't have a

1041
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:46,940
lot of time for video games don't you play video games for a living what am i missing here what yeah

1042
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:51,660
what am i missing with this with this scenario don't you want to like explore the games to their

1043
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:57,260
depth i'm saying it i think aron has lost the fucking plot and he has forgotten what makes

1044
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:02,700
video games good and he treats it too much like a fucking business i think that is what has happened

1045
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:11,820
here and uh i i just i guess i just disagree is all yeah that's it um it's it's it's it's

1046
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:18,940
the human characters look bad listen i'm gonna say it fucking delete hold items delete abilities i

1047
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:25,580
don't care but when you look at a gross little poopy monster like the main character pokemon

1048
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:32,300
let's go is it's so gross he looks like a little snot he looks like a little booger i hate him

1049
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:38,860
okay but i want to dial it back because like i i get why like tom's right here tom likes the game

1050
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,900
i i get it because he i'm not gonna dial back like i like put this in the show it's it all depends

1051
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,300
on what you want right but like i think we could all agree the goal the i think what we would all

1052
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:53,340
want is to lower the skill floor to a place where people can get on board and have a great time

1053
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:59,020
even the most casual of casuals that's fine but we want to keep the skill ceiling high right we

1054
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:05,260
yeah i mean i agree to go deep i don't because i and the weird thing for me is that as someone who

1055
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:14,620
played pokemon red at 10 years old the skill floor was fine uh i i i mean okay hey guys

1056
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:20,620
like guys we we gotta make pokemon casual yeah like we need more people to oh wait uh look at the

1057
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:28,460
pcp main chat oh wait oh wait shit everyone can play this game even like moms and babies pokemon

1058
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:33,980
red blue yellow it is the sixth most selling game of all time is there something just to be said

1059
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:39,020
that people have become pussies though that like they just like don't want even if they could if

1060
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:44,860
they put their minds to it they just they would gravitate away from a game like this i am wondering

1061
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:50,380
and they need to be i am i am wondering if this attitude because like you know i've heard other

1062
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:57,740
people with similar attitudes to errands right like it's not i don't know there's there's something

1063
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:01,420
to it that like he's not the only one that feels as i'm wondering if it's some kind of

1064
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,700
outgrowth of millennial bullshit like which is a which is a term that i'm going to keep pushing

1065
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,340
i'm going to keep pushing millennial bullshit as a thing that i coined and that is associated with

1066
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,540
me specifically that's good as in a thing that i as in a thing that i battle against make a

1067
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:21,100
sure to that then make a sure to that immediately hashtag millennial but that should be your i am

1068
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:27,820
game shirt you know what i fucking will um good good good it'll say fuck millennial bullshit

1069
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:33,340
and i don't think if i am games and then you're gonna have you are millennial bullshit you

1070
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:40,380
you probably are viewer in some way or another i um i think i don't know problem is specifically

1071
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,820
that he's become too much of a business boy in my humble opinion which is a different problem but

1072
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:50,780
also an insidious one okay he says he likes that he gets to walk around with whatever pokemon i want

1073
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:55,500
yet everybody liked that everybody loved that ever like you can do that without in heart game well

1074
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,460
yeah everyone loved that in heart gold and soul silver and yeah it's great that it's back but why

1075
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:07,420
do they take out by the way i i want to say by the way in case anyone tries to retort this this uh

1076
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:12,140
this this hashtag evidence that pokemon is one of the top selling games of all time uh by saying

1077
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:18,140
that the other games you know got more competitive and therefore sold less well they aren't top the

1078
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:25,500
first ones every single core pokemon is on the list of best selling fucking video games pokemon

1079
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:32,060
gold and silver ruby and sapphire diamond and pearl uh fucking black and white x and y and

1080
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:38,940
fucking sun and moon are all on here are all separately on the best set list of best selling

1081
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:46,220
video games of all time yeah but is this gonna beat them no way no no no i don't think this i don't

1082
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:50,860
think the switch install base is there for it to beat them at this point i mean this is definitely

1083
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:55,500
pushing to help that would smash comes out i mean that'll be a big that'll be okay so well

1084
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:00,540
erin erin here is arguing that pokemon let's go is not easier just are you looking at his are you

1085
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:04,700
looking at his i'm looking at his tweets okay it seems like his contention is that the game is not

1086
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:11,580
easier merely less tedious which okay i guess i can kind of get there are i mean in its defense

1087
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:16,700
because again there are a lot of great features i thought that made the game less tedious i think

1088
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:22,620
i i can understand the argument for replacing the wild battles with the pokemon let's go throw

1089
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,860
mechanics like i i don't i honestly i don't necessarily love it but i don't think it's

1090
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:32,860
retarded the only thing that i don't like about the the the throw mechanic is that it the tracking

1091
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:38,780
isn't one to one so like yeah actually throwing it where you want to go at least for me is a pain

1092
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:45,260
in the ass because you can throw like left right or forward there's no like nuance to it yeah it's

1093
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:50,620
not great look it didn't look like like it doesn't it's like in let's go you actually have like like

1094
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:55,580
the way that you move the ball like like you know you you get an arc based on how your right finger

1095
01:01:55,580 --> 01:02:01,500
moved and it's not it's not it's like it's like it's like digital in in let's go right it's not

1096
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:06,140
it's not analog it's kind of like if you played skyward sword when you swing the wheel it's not

1097
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:11,100
a one-to-one swing it just has like eight directions you can swing it and it guesses as best as it can

1098
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:17,340
this is similar to that which is not great um yeah it didn't look great but like the thing that i don't

1099
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:21,260
know why they couldn't have done it because like they have motion control right the thing that i thought

1100
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,740
was really great like probably my favorite addition like besides like the overworld being able to see

1101
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:30,780
the pokemon because it makes it easier to find that's great i like how like there's no you don't

1102
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,420
have to go to the pokemon center and go to the pc to access your box you just access it anywhere

1103
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:40,220
because it it allows you to experiment with more pokemon because you could if you want to switch

1104
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:43,740
out and try like something new like the guy you just caught you don't have to like we'll have to

1105
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:50,220
stop what i'm doing i have to fly back i don't know i like i like the team i like the team like i

1106
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:55,660
like that like you got your team right develop you develop a core team of six that is like your

1107
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:59,900
boys and you can still do that but if you don't want if you want to keep switching it up you

1108
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:05,100
don't it doesn't it it removes a step if you want to play the game that way well hang on

1109
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:09,420
hang on for a second there i know this is this is like early game issues mostly but like as i'm

1110
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:14,300
going through the game if i remember correctly when you put a pokemon in the box it heals its hp

1111
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:18,780
if you then swap it like is this just a way to heal all your pokemon instantly if you're like going

1112
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:24,940
through a dungeon or something i don't know i because we haven't i we've only played it a

1113
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:29,020
couple times on stream and we stopped and we're playing spirano but i haven't played it enough

1114
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:34,220
to even like notice if that is a thing that happens because the whole thing is that like yeah

1115
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:39,980
because we've we've only been uh because like the whole thing is that like if you catch a pokemon

1116
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,660
since there's no battle like you don't do damage to them so when i swap somebody in it has full

1117
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:49,500
hp because of course it does like there was never any battle damage to begin with sure i just i saw

1118
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:55,500
my friend play on it and he's fighting like brock and brock has more than one pokemon but he's

1119
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:01,660
they're playing multiplayer and brock sends out his geodude he's got his onyx in reserve and like

1120
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:07,980
because they're playing like with two players like their main character sends out two pokemon and you

1121
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:15,420
just 2v1 yeah that's weird you can just 2v1 all the time but by the way insane i just want to say

1122
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:21,820
that for how much you think pokemon let's go is a baby game actually like watching it in action

1123
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:29,580
was fucking like insane here's i should do that here's here's what happened uh before i actually

1124
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,900
got my hands on the controller with my friend booted up his like save file and stuff uh and uh

1125
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:40,940
and then he's just walking down a cycling road also by the way quick side by the way uh cycling

1126
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:48,140
road it's a bridge in the old games yeah because otherwise the bow the ssn would be landlocked

1127
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:55,020
they made it just a normal land route so the ssn is landlocked yeah it's landlocked now um which

1128
01:04:55,020 --> 01:05:01,260
great okay so super and anyway besides that autism um he's just walking down cycling road

1129
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:10,780
and a chance he appears and i piss myself and i'm like holy fucking chancey go go catch that

1130
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,780
right now and he's like why would i have 60 like they're not rare they just spawn like

1131
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:23,820
like constantly and i'm like like i cannot believe here's the thing you know like having stakes

1132
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:30,620
or like having resistance or having any fail states whatsoever makes it so that winning

1133
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:38,220
has merit and makes you feel good in any way have your things be rare makes it feel good when you

1134
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:43,020
get a rare thing now that makes you feel it makes you feel anything at all and that's not it and

1135
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:47,500
that's not it that was like fucking small potatoes to prepare but i'm about to tell you

1136
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,340
there's our catch streak so when you catch a single pokemon like for instance he was

1137
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:56,540
trying to shiny hunt evie so he would just encounter an evie you know you know catcher

1138
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:59,740
and then you know continue on with the day he was just trying to catch as many evies as possible

1139
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:07,020
in a row once you get to a high catch rate aka like 30 you can get on your pokemon that can fly

1140
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:15,180
go up into the sky and wild dragon knight and charizard spawn dragon knight and charizard

1141
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:23,580
spawn for you wild that's wait wait like in the sky yes that sounds pretty cool that you're in the

1142
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:30,300
sky i guess uh i mean it's it's more like the like it's the same map it just is like you're higher

1143
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:35,180
up it like is it like that is it like that thing in like omega ruby where you can ride around on

1144
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:41,260
latios no no nothing like not nothing even slightly like that no oh i don't i don't want to

1145
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:44,700
overstate it and make it seem like oh my god like i can't believe like you're finding the pokemon

1146
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:50,540
like it's cool it looks like it just looks like you are riding on your charizard and he is like

1147
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:55,100
elevated slightly above the house so the point is the game is just throwing powerful poke right

1148
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,140
yeah she's throwing dragon knight charizard at you as i'm trying to say to you well that's

1149
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:03,420
fucking gay uh people go watch a little video called game difficulty why i'm right and everyone

1150
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:11,660
else is wrong we agua uh it sums it up it's the genius uh word of god on this issue i'm just the

1151
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:16,300
fact that you can fly is kind of cool i don't want to like diminish it i'm just trying to say

1152
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:22,140
that you just get fucking free dragon knight charizard for no reason i'm i'm i'm having to work to

1153
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:27,260
get legendary pokemon like i mean you know effectively legendary like finding a bag on

1154
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:32,540
in that one area leveling up to salamence finding a trap inch leveling up to fly gone as i

1155
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:37,580
legendarily did and had the greatest time of my life uh you know fucking getting a gible

1156
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:42,940
evolving into garchomp and shit as i tried to do and failed in my most recent nuzlocke but i

1157
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:50,700
rather fail than it just be handed to me on a silver fucking platter yeah um i i fucking you

1158
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:57,340
know a parent okay i don't know who or tom i'm so sorry tom i mean i mean no like that is kind of

1159
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:03,340
gay and i i'll give you that yeah okay i i don't know who said that like this this is a mainline

1160
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:08,060
game i'm hoping that that's like the mistrant the director it's gotta be a mistrant he was drunk

1161
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:12,940
or something i don't know whatever uh you know you know i'm still hoping that like this isn't like

1162
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:17,420
like like that doesn't mean like this is what pokemon is from now and listen to this listen to

1163
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:22,060
the full quote here we go this is the actual quote i'm gonna read it translated from japanese

1164
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,420
true so there could be some wiggle room for issues but but just listen to the language here

1165
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:32,300
okay quote uh in his name is that junichi masuda these games aren't spin-offs these are core

1166
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:36,860
pokemon titles as for whether we would make other games that could connect to pokemon go

1167
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,780
that will depend on how the games are received if we hear a lot of people saying that they enjoyed

1168
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:44,460
being able to bring pokemon to these games from pokemon go then we'll think about maybe having

1169
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:50,940
future titles also be able to connect to it that's okay but sounds like he could just mean in the

1170
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:56,220
sense that these games you know could be legacies in the sense that you know pokemon go has more

1171
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:01,580
interactivity and he doesn't mean like the easiness of it but there's no reason to not believe it

1172
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:07,420
as well that doesn't that doesn't necessarily imply that that what he means is that like this is what

1173
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:10,940
future games will be like yeah it's just like yeah these are different you know let's not

1174
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:16,220
forget but like but but they're still we're still considering them core games he's definitely

1175
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:21,660
that's not to say that all core games will be like this it's definitely in his interest to kind of

1176
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:26,460
upsell the importance of this game as the director so i would not be surprised if he's maybe a little

1177
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:31,820
bit exaggerating so you know what we were a little bit pushing fake news this is not as dire i i i

1178
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:38,460
i have no faith in game freak to not do this like i just don't believe them but i just need to see

1179
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:43,020
the next damn game and see what it is i don't believe them well aren't they gonna reveal it at

1180
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:48,140
e3 didn't they say it's a 2019 release like well they say yeah i don't know if they've said about

1181
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:52,700
e3 or anything like that i mean yeah if it's coming out in 2019 they have to show something

1182
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:59,020
at e3 i would i would hope so i would hope so oh i could it could just uh come out uh you know in

1183
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:05,340
2020 or something when they release the the new new switch they got to have some title to push

1184
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,820
people to go buy another fucking switch that they will inevitably release at some point that's true

1185
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:15,580
uh oh my oh my god oh my god please nintendo this is unironic and actually true you know you

1186
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:22,540
how you have a 3ds xls making switch xl because the joycons are shit and too small and i can't

1187
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:28,780
play video games with them yeah solution just prop up your thing buy it's it's 70 bucks but buy the

1188
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:34,780
like so fucking why is it 70 dollars it is great though it is a great controller but it's what

1189
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:39,660
nintendo needs to do they need to not be gay and they need to spend the extra money get 128 gig

1190
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:43,900
game cards so we don't have to put everything on them anemic 32 gigs of storage on the fucking

1191
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:50,380
switch you morons i bought a i bought a fucking additional micro i did too but it's it's the

1192
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:55,580
principle of the matter yeah i don't want to have to it's get make the game cards 128 gigs or

1193
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:01,660
make the baseline switch have 128 gigs of built-in memory and not upsell anybody on it

1194
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:09,500
you fucking bastard it's like by the way with 32 gigs is an insult 32 gigs yeah after all this

1195
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:15,580
bash and i would like to announce that i'm literally buying a switch today hey dude smash we come on

1209
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:31,580
care about i don't really care about smash either way um let's play uh nate um subspace that did you

1210
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:38,300
know that subspace emissary is horrible no it's not why me bin i want to be friends with you i want

1211
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:42,940
to continue working with you as a colleague and as a co-worker but if you keep saying racist

1212
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:48,540
shit like this i'm not gonna be able to justify our relationship it's just it's such a snore it's so

1213
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:55,580
bad you're such a snore you are about to sleep while playing it you put down your controller

1214
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:04,140
i'm so mad i wish i wish fat three two would suck my fat three two just so that people can see

1215
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:11,340
your incompetence playing the best video game ever made i uh seeing you play it for a couple

1216
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:15,180
of reasons one there's an actually kind of compelling story specifically where rob's

1217
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:21,340
concerned it's good yeah yeah i did like that so it wasn't but it wasn't worth wasn't worth sitting

1218
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:28,540
through like fight a bunch of fucking mooks in smash in like ai smash battles for like 11 hours

1219
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:33,820
i kind of agree but by the way i want to be extremely clear right now is that super smash or

1220
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:38,140
subspace emissary is one of those games where uh when you play it like with your hands and you're

1221
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:41,660
actually playing it this is probably the most miserable experience you could possibly have

1222
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:45,500
your entire life but like like your star wars to complete saga as soon as you put down the

1223
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,420
controller and you walk away you're like oh my god i love that game so much you can see all your

1224
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,900
fucking boys fighting each other and teaming up and stuff in like canonical story shit that's

1225
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:59,340
what you play it for that's the good shit it's fun it's just a bunch of fucking like stupid

1226
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:06,780
cutscenes that exist to just okay it is like the cutscenes are there to justify why are these

1227
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:13,740
smash characters fighting in this ai battles that doesn't need any justification it could have been

1228
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:19,500
it doesn't need them but it's fun yeah it's a fucking sequence of fights the raid on the ship

1229
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:24,940
entering the black hole to go like fight taboo at the end oh my god oh my god it's don't tell i

1230
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:29,100
forget what's called i think it's called it's called like like the great infiltration or something like

1231
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:34,060
that or something like that that's like the most hyped cutscene of all time it is kino it is kino

1232
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:39,500
so fucking good when you have when you when you beat all the hardest level of the entire world

1233
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:44,060
you're half the heels of having robin at your party and the best fucking most like like it's like

1234
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:49,580
it's like it's like the shindler's list of super smash brothers yeah when robin chasing people and

1235
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:53,340
and then you have you unlock all the characters and you're ready to fight taboo and then they all

1236
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:57,740
get in their rickety fucking rocket ship and they all do a full on a star on gannon and bowser

1237
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:04,140
and you see oh you see medknights fucking the halberd you see all our ship you see sam's ship

1238
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:10,540
you see all these cool fucking spacecrafts shoot this giant toho looking monstrosity destroy it

1239
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:17,660
and want a clean slice by carby my maid god damn it's so good all right cool yeah it was there's

1240
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:22,380
like one minute that's kind of cool and then like there's like 16 hours of fucking all right well

1241
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:26,780
for some people that's enough i don't think anyone would really argue the moment to moment gameplay

1242
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:32,140
of subspace emissary is like particularly great because it's not yeah it's pretty shit yeah yeah

1243
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:39,340
yeah it is but but what we got to the legacy of subspace emissary i think has a long shadow

1244
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:44,860
yeah and in the in the good way and it's pretty fucking dope uh by the way the ideal way to play

1245
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:50,300
subspace emissary is to make it as painful as possible and like like like make it such a terrible

1246
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:56,700
experience that it's like legendary so the like one of like like a like a fucking what was like

1247
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:01,980
like a tradition uh whenever i where i meet up with one of my friends is we start a new game

1248
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:08,380
file and uh i'm so necessary on intense mode and intense mode uh the the hard mode for that game

1249
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:13,020
is one of those hard modes where they didn't actually like balance the game to be hard they

1250
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:17,980
just made every enemy do like like five times the damage and have five times the health so

1251
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:23,180
which is the most broken fucking like worst unpolished mess of a video game you could possibly

1252
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:31,180
imagine and it takes like hours to complete one fucking level uh and it's so like balls like

1253
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:37,500
rockingly hard that it takes like the entire time we're together to to beat it and it's so euphoric

1254
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:43,980
it it's really it heightens the cutscene so much to be playing the game as hard as you possibly

1255
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:49,420
can be playing in complete fucking silence in darkness eating pizza rolls having just like

1256
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:53,740
press like smash the start button when it says to continue just like fucking like yeah yeah like

1257
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,020
i'm not even gonna register that we just lost completely i'm just we're just gonna jump right

1258
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:01,900
we just have to continue going and you finally get to like the end level and you get to just

1259
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:06,540
like let's scream an agony and throw yourself back into the chair and just watch the fucking

1260
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,660
three second cutscene that is that is rewarding you it makes it such a more valuable experience

1261
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:17,260
and i now like memorized every cutscene back to back because when they were playing all like like

1262
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:21,900
i just like shut off my brain to like ease the pain and all i could just watch was like midnight

1263
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:27,580
like brogan out that's like all i could register my brain yeah it's great that's game difficulty for

1264
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:35,500
you even when it's broken as shit it when you if you overcome it you get a a little little brain

1265
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:40,300
reward those little brains go go buzzing and you just strip away all the bullshit from the game and

1266
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,940
just have that fucking dopamine while we all get your wreck stimulus we just video games should

1267
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:49,180
just be like a helmet you wear that directly stimulates that just sticks a needle in your brain

1268
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:56,460
yeah and just like just vibrates your pineal gland or whatever just like video video games

1269
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:02,540
should just be you hire someone to come jerk you off oh guys guys i the best idea it's a pokemon

1270
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:08,300
game in vr and it just is a linked boba pd and just cycles through the gallery of all the pokemon

1271
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:13,340
in order and that's the ideal pokemon game for erin hansen it's just you see pokemon designs

1272
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,500
agreed

1273
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:22,780
that's it it's like it's like the fucking the 3d model of your favorite pokemon comes on the

1274
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:31,340
screen and you fucking clap like a train seal i love it i will say about pokemon uh let's go um

1275
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:39,420
the animations don't exist they're terrible dude why are they so bad i always see that compared to

1276
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:45,340
pokemon coliseum which are these crazy meticulous animations oh my god and like what happened watch

1277
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:52,460
fucking xd's animations for pokemon listen you can say xd sucks sure but look at golbat's animation

1278
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:59,740
in that fucking game and it's okay yeah well yeah you're not ready for fucking golbat in xd

1279
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:05,660
golbat's absolutely ridiculous um yeah he like just so you know he hugs himself with his wings and

1280
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:10,860
just rocks back and forth he's not yeah he's not flying he has his arms wrapped around his

1281
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:16,860
beard i don't know but hilarious he's just like rocking back and forth like he's a fucking serial

1282
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:24,940
killer oh aj shoot the golbat oh aj shoot the golbat yeah i don't understand is he dead he's not

1283
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:31,580
dead no he's he's one of our best dudes one of our greatest assets i just don't understand why

1284
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:36,700
there's like no excuse and let's go to not like have animations because like you just have the

1285
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:43,820
original 150 like it's not like you got to animate 700 dudes like yeah yeah that's true they they

1286
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:49,020
wait why don't they have animations because like in the mainline games like like okay correct me if

1287
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:54,540
i'm wrong but don't the let's go just use the same 3d models as like all the other 3d pokemon games

1288
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:59,180
don't they use the same assets i think that i think the models i think the models from the yeah they

1289
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:04,140
they do they do have animations like they like like yeah all the pokemon have like animations

1290
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:09,660
for their battle moves and stuff i'm watching it right now i cannot believe this i i guess i wasn't

1291
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:15,020
paying attention or i you know i you know what i literally probably thought is that my friend had

1292
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:19,740
like like the battle style set to like not to use their battle zone in the main series games we can

1293
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:27,180
turn on battle effects i probably literally thought it i'm looking at this pikachu is like a statue

1294
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:34,140
that like rotates yeah the enemy pokemon and like jumps to indicate it's attacking this is insane

1295
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:39,260
it really doesn't make any sense and like the weird thing is that like i saw because i was watching

1296
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:44,380
the digital foundry video on let's go where they like go over like the frame rates and the models

1297
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:52,540
and stuff yeah and like apparently the models used in let's go are the models from the 3ds games

1298
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:58,540
just a higher resolution so like they've already got animations yes like the animations are made

1299
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:02,940
and they just show no let's just not use they're doing this on the switch like let's just have

1300
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:06,780
an upgrade let's just have it be let's instead of something let's have it be well i haven't played

1301
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:12,140
sun and moon so i don't know how they compare no no but someone has like actual animations it's not

1302
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:17,580
like a pussyfoot thing they they have different animations okay like the way the way that the

1303
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:24,540
other 3d and pokemon games do it is like okay as far as i'm aware every pokemon has a few like

1304
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:28,540
different attack animations they can do depending on like whether it's a special or physical move

1305
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:33,260
and maybe those variations move yeah yeah and they'll have like they'll have a they'll have an

1306
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:37,820
animation that they'll do and then there will be like a separate effect that like plays like a beam

1307
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:42,220
or you know a blizzard effect there's a couple like little animations here and there but like a lot of

1308
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:47,660
the moves there's just nothing it's just like an effect and like i guess that that makes sense

1309
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:51,980
back in like game boy color days when you can't you just run out of memory if you have like 40

1310
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:57,020
frames of animation for every pokemon as much as much as i prefer like the pixel style of like

1311
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:02,460
black and white or something to the 3d i think like the 3d like the animations look mostly pretty

1312
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:08,060
good like some of them are kind of weak but like in general like it looks it looks like they're

1313
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:13,580
performing it looks like they're performing it's just weird that pokemon stadium has more and a

1314
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:19,660
better animation than let's go on the switch i don't want to suck the dick of the 3d animation

1315
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:23,820
too much because there's a lot of animations in x and y and later pokemon games that kind of

1316
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:30,380
fucking blow ass like almost all the bird pokemons all the bird pokemon that are like gliding in place

1317
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:36,700
look like a nightmare and like they're absolutely abysmal however yeah i like like i would say

1318
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:41,020
probably the majority of them are fine and serviceable uh by the way i just want to let you

1319
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:46,620
know guys know that like like the the walking animations for all the pokemon as seen in pokemon

1320
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:51,820
let's go work in sun and moon's files and you could like access them so everyone knew some crazy

1321
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:56,380
shit was happening they they animated walk cycles for all the pokemon by the way not just like the

1322
01:22:56,380 --> 01:23:03,100
hanto ones like literally all of them they all have walk cycles well good yeah so i have no idea

1323
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:11,500
why they didn't import everything i have no clue it's on a move uh but i mean this gives me hope

1324
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:16,140
that walking pokemon will be in the other games because i mean again yeah all the pokemon have

1325
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:20,860
walking animations like all of them do that's the thing that's the thing we all really liked in

1326
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:27,660
heart gold and soul silver and they were like hold on company has a weird fetish like a bizarre

1327
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:34,380
fetish on r slash fetish that is like just removing game features that everyone universally enjoys

1328
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:39,900
for no reason literally why would you remove the battle frontier i cannot imagine it would it would

1329
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:44,380
take away that much effort to make the battle frontier just like an area on the map with

1330
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:49,420
battles like it's not that fucking difficult i have no idea why you keep removing it for no reason

1331
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:55,660
i mean i can understand at least why they removed the uh the walk sprites because like

1332
01:23:55,660 --> 01:24:01,020
you know that's a lot of well i don't know actually i mean it's the pokemon company do

1333
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:05,820
yeah they're not sure yeah yeah i was changing like sure that's a lot of work but like is it so

1334
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:11,500
hard over the course of like a single development cycle to pay one artist to make walk sprites for

1335
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:18,300
you know six like 600 pokemon and like they've already got fucking they've got the models you

1336
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:24,380
can just i don't know yeah making a walk cycle and maybe a couple and maybe making a walk cycle

1337
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:30,140
is not that for for one model can't take more than like a day for like a professional

1338
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:35,820
you know you know what i'm saying so it's gonna i i i don't know i guess i've been talking out my

1339
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:40,220
ass but like they've got their fucking resources to do it you'd think so i mean you you'd think

1340
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:45,020
yeah i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure that i'm no no no i'm sure they're paying their

1341
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:51,100
3d animators just a king's ransom for a salary so they can't possibly afford to pay like one

1342
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:57,260
animator or two to do this studio this is an Nintendo and game freak again pokemon top

1343
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:02,540
selling video games of all time yeah pokemon games are made on such the fucking cheap it's so

1344
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:07,820
bizarre yeah i got i got no sympathy for for that shit they i'm sure they're doing just fine

1345
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:17,100
yeah yeah guys um i can't wait to buy jenny i cannot wait to buy it with my money yeah i sure do

1346
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:23,820
love pokemon i sure do love how fucking mad i am about it all the time dude remember when pokemon

1347
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:30,620
went barg and then he shot the other pokemon with his beam yeah while standing still like a statue

1348
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:38,140
oh my god rear how hype it was when Pikachu rotated two degrees and then jumped up attacking

1349
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:45,900
geodude wasn't that so fucking hype dude i feel like using the word jump is a bit uh yeah generous

1350
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:53,500
yeah his legs don't the model increases like the y value parabolically increases and then decreases

1351
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:59,180
y value no movement of the legs or lower body or anything really that's the good shit no gravity

1352
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:04,620
yeah remember i don't know man i was just gonna say like some pokemon like it doesn't make sense

1353
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:10,940
how to even exist like geodude i guess magnetism or something so for him having meaningless animations

1354
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:15,420
you know okay but with like like pikachu's got legs dog he can all right you get the

1355
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:20,380
pikachu is like already got animations but here's the thing that blows my mind even more is that

1356
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:26,300
like you have a game called pokemon let's go pikachu and like every player is going to see

1357
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:32,860
pikachu himself maybe spend a little bit of time giving that character some animations yeah that's

1358
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:40,700
a great point that character has a specific move set that you know the player is going to get and

1359
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:45,180
the character can't evolve because you can't evolve the pikachu or the evie in these games right so

1360
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:51,260
just go through the effort of making maybe making two sets of unique animations for these two characters

1361
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:56,460
that you know everyone's gonna see maybe you know what i hate you know what i hate uh uh correct me

1362
01:26:56,460 --> 01:27:01,580
remember i know that evie the evie in pokemon let's go evie has like boosted stats and gets like

1363
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:06,780
special moves right i assume that pikachu also has boosted stats i don't know that for sure they're

1364
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:14,060
okay i don't like that uh because it's like fake it's like fake bullshit and it's uh not real

1365
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:19,740
pokemon it's like we're we're making special magical pokemon that like what why are they better

1366
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:24,700
than every other pikachu why i think it's just because i think it's even in like side games like

1367
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:32,620
like like go the fetishization of certain pokemon i miss when pokemon like was just like like

1368
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:37,740
pikachu sure it was the mascot of pokemon and you know what that was fine it was on the all

1369
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:43,180
the promotional material but at the end of the day it was one character of many and in the actual

1370
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:47,980
games it did not have like like it didn't have boosted fucking stats it wasn't like you know

1371
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:52,940
the main character that was forced upon you it wasn't you know just like the be all into all

1372
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:59,820
pokemon this is the main character of pokemon i i do not i literally do not understand like

1373
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:06,460
who pikachu specifically appeals to like who like who sees like oh man i really want this

1374
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:11,900
because it's got pikachu i mean they're clearly i like that way yeah there's definitely sure sure

1375
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:17,820
sure sure i like pikachu he's fine but i don't understand like does he does he does pikachu

1376
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:23,820
in specific appeal to people in a way that pokemon in general does not pikachu is shorthand for

1377
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:29,740
pokemon in general so like if you want to play a pokemon you got pikachu cool there's the guy

1378
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:34,460
there's the man and i guess he's like the most widely recognized one yeah um so that's some people

1379
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:42,380
just like that's fine but i yeah that's fine i get it i i hate that the starter is forced upon you

1380
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:47,340
and while you can have him not be in your team like battle wise he's still like on your shoulder

1381
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:52,300
fucking gross it makes me really upset why is that why is that yellow it's the conceit of the game

1382
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:57,260
because i don't okay listen i like i like that you can have him on your shoulder but i don't like

1383
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:00,860
but if he's not in like on your in your front spot he probably shouldn't be

1384
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:05,100
it's that was i mean that was just part of the game i guess like they

1385
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:11,420
but clearly like the games are like if you like pikachu and or evie like they're a huge part of

1386
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:16,780
this game like there's like there's a whole there's a whole section like it's literally called pikachu

1387
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:23,180
or evie the game so i i don't care you know what hang on was was pikachu better in pokemon yellow

1388
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:29,900
did he have boosted stats in that game um no actually right i mean it's who can fucking say

1389
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:34,060
maybe it did but because the stats weren't visible back then so there was no way of knowing unless

1390
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:39,900
like you like i'm just somebody knows well you you could see you you could see this you could see

1391
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,300
their stats you could see like the number stats i guess but like i never cared enough to compare

1392
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:49,420

1431
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:40,140
link below okay question one from this is from um shit where to go uh moonju moonju calling it

1432
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:47,660
with a question uh yeah valued watcher of my streams go hey fucktards how many times you feel

1433
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:52,060
like you got to repeat a recording before you get it right i know nate's a perfectionist but what

1434
01:33:52,060 --> 01:34:02,700
about the rest of you faggots love moonju that's it depend i mean depends on what it's a recording of

1435
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:10,540
we yeah we do like about 20 takes of every pcp episode honestly in almost in almost all context

1436
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:16,620
one and only yeah like when when was the last time i like rerecorded something i can't even think of it

1437
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:21,900
i do multiple takes of stuff with weagua but the real reason i do that is because maybe if it's

1438
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:26,700
if it's like line delivery or if it's like a song or something then you would like if i stumble over

1439
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:32,220
a line in and i am game script i'll re-say but like for my vlogs and shit it's all off the cuff

1440
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:35,980
and i don't give a fuck because the whole point is like if i have to edit it i've done something

1441
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:41,580
wrong so they're just yeah i'm done people don't seem to have like absorbed this fact people always

1442
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:46,140
think that i write scripts for weagua like i do many takes for weagua but it's specifically because

1443
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:52,220
i am coming up with everything i might have bullet points off the top of my fucking head but um

1444
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:57,420
like i so i'll do multiple takes if i just say something wrong or like i didn't say what i wanted

1445
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:02,140
to say or it sounds incorrect but like that's pretty much it these days i mean if i'm doing a script

1446
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:06,220
but i don't do many scripts you know those best anime ever has come out once in a blue moon so

1447
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:13,980
not too often tell me about it oh no next one this is from uh this is from steve saying let's

1451
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:37,420
mind for a while uh how do we know ben saint is real and not just like a hulu mass hallucination

1452
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:42,460
because i swear to god i'm hearing things on my bed and yesterday my heavy cream disappeared my

1453
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:47,420
heavy cream is gone uh things are going weird in my house and uh when i got out of the shower a

1454
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:53,100
couple hours ago i looked in the mirror it was just ben saint looking back at me uh so i really

1455
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:57,820
i'm starting to freak out maybe you guys can help me maybe you may maybe you know how to deal with

1456
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:04,140
this uh i don't know i need some help i'm freaking out guys i i i too thought that ben was fake and

1457
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:10,060
slash or at least a catfish for many years until i until until i met her in person and i'm just

1458
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:15,420
gonna tell you right now you can't make the stuff up you can like everything you know about ben

1459
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:21,660
is like like like on the one dial and he takes up to ten on the daily bro he takes up to ten on

1460
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:28,220
the daily you cannot make up what he dishes out on the rig well here's all right it's like

1461
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:34,220
santa claus right like i like to like i i like to say that i believe in santa claus but the thing

1462
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:39,820
about santa claus that santa claus is not a person santa claus is the spirit of christmas

1463
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:45,660
generosity and when one person gives a gift out of like like christmas spirit to another

1464
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:51,980
like that act is like santa claus that sounds like some fluffy la la bullshit to me oh oh it

1465
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:56,540
happens oh oh for sure that's just how i like every time every time you drink heavy cream

1466
01:36:56,540 --> 01:37:01,500
ben saint is there in your heart look into the mirror and take three chugs of heavy cream and

1467
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:06,060
ben saint will appear as you as you fade into a coma and you lose consciousness you'll catch a

1468
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:11,420
glimpse that act that act itself is every time you every time you when you when you drink a ben

1469
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:16,060
saint yeah every time you pull a tab on a monster zero and hear that little clink that's ben that's

1470
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:22,700
ben looking down on you every every time every time you buy arizona tea in bulk and then water it

1471
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:30,380
down so you have more arizona tea to go around that's ben yeah that's true that's true okay so i

1472
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:39,260
am i am a concept steve my brother um next episode of this voicemail is uh clomato clomato

guys to come in and they buy clomato juice which is part clam juice part tomato juice whoa yeah i've

1475
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:01,660
heard why would you want this why like i i'm pretty sure they mix it with alcohol but like why okay

1476
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:09,980
well i i mean why clam chowder comes in red and white varieties and the red kind is like tomato

1477
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:14,700
based oh yeah i've never had red chowder but it's a thing that's not new wingland clam chowder that's

1478
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:20,380
the other kind no new england clam chowder is the white that's right that's right um i guess superior

1479
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:27,100
kind if you will uh agree well i don't know probably i i've i've never even heard of of red clam

1480
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:31,340
chowder and that sounds fucking disgusting how could you possibly not it's reprehensible for sure

1481
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:37,020
white shits that's the good shit yeah i i mean i can't answer this question i don't know why someone

1482
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:41,580
would eat drink clomato juice because i've never had it and i have no desire to especially those

1483
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:46,460
spaniards they're a wily bunch can't keep a tabs on their thoughts i mean maybe it's like v8

1484
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:51,100
how do you guys feel about a v8 not a fan not a fan i haven't had enough to really make a

1485
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:56,060
call one way or the other i guess it's growing on me more like i'm more willing to drink it now

1486
01:38:56,060 --> 01:39:01,100
than when i was young but i wouldn't choose it you know it's i don't know if it's really i mean

1487
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:05,260
yeah it's probably got it's probably fairly nutritious but it's also like very sugary yeah it's

1488
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:10,060
all sugary all the calories any any product that insults me and they're advertising i'm not a huge

1489
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:15,740
fan of does it how so they yeah their advertisements of old was that someone would have a drink and

1490
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:22,300
then a bottle of v8 would slam their face and their slogan was you should have had a v8 and i'm just

1491
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:27,180
like should have had a v8 i'm like oh fuck you i don't want to v8 you dick that was when they had

1492
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:32,460
like they had like the like fruit versions they had the v8 splash v8 splash v8 splash that's a good

1493
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:36,220

1494
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:41,340

1496
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:52,860
choco taco calling in again let's see what he's got for us what's the most ridiculous thing you've

1497
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:58,220
ever seen at a church one time i was invited to a church it was like a special thursday

1498
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:05,740
and they decided to reenact curcobane suicide and have him like write out the letter to Courtney

1499
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:11,900
put the gun in his mouth and then gunshot fade to black wait what into the cut into the scene from

1500
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:20,780
broke back mountain where the Heath Ledger is going i can't quit you and the pastor's daughter came out

1501
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:26,780
and said they killed themselves because they were gay this is the last time i went to this church

1502
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:32,060
both because it was incredibly fucked up why would you stop going after that i was dying laughing

1503
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:40,060
and and berry and embarrassed my friend's entire family i haven't talked to him since uh but i don't

1504
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:46,860
know if i really want to uh see you later god uh you should have tipped your fedora and and moon

1505
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:54,540
walked out uh man it's tough to say i had sex in a church i had i had sex in a church yeah did you

1506
01:40:54,540 --> 01:41:03,980
really that was yeah with god oh my god like no within college um just there was a no one was

1507
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:12,940
at her became a bishop yeah that's right that's right filled with the holy spirit cool cool i was

1508
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:19,100
oh she oh she was filled with the holy spirit oh that's disgusting oh it was fucking gross as

1509
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:23,420
hell dude yeah she wasn't she wasn't filled with the holy spirit she was filled with the saint all

1510
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:32,060
right yeah i can't even think of anything that compares i don't know no um i guess the weirdest

1511
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:37,900
thing i have that i've experienced in a church is that when i was a we lad for my my mom is super

1512
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:44,540
christian and for a while we would this is like back in like 1995 so i was like okay the smallest

1513
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:49,820
of children we would go to a church it was like an hour and a half away from us and the whole mass

1514
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:57,180
was done in latin so for an hour and like change i would just be sitting here and like and in latin

1515
01:41:57,180 --> 01:42:01,740
masses the priest is not allowed to look at you because you're you're lower tier you have to look

1516
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:06,140
he has to look at the tabernacle where the eucharist is which like with the jesus wafers so you would

1517
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:11,020
just have his back turned to you the entire time speaking in latin all the nuns would be there

1518
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:15,580
like chanting and i was just like what the fuck is going on i just want to go watch toy story this is

1519
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:20,140
fucked that's kind of aesthetic and cool that's like a bloodborne scene where you go and then you

1520
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:24,860
like kill them all with like your charged r2 a hunter's axe yeah i didn't i didn't get to do that part

1521
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:31,660
that part would have made it sick but i i i continually dismay my entire family whenever

1522
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:36,060
like a church scene comes on like a tv show or even when we just pass this church and i have to

1523
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:41,980
like avert my eyes because i feel like scared just like in the presence of crosses and this isn't a

1524
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:48,140
joke like like the union the godfather came on and you know fucking i i haven't even seen the movie

1525
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:52,780
but you know the mob was going to town to kill a bunch of people haha spoilers and i'm more scared

1526
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:57,660
that someone's getting baptized it was the scariest moment of my fucking life they're chanting it like

1527
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:03,340
a dead or cake language and it's all like darkly lit it's awful it's terrible yeah yeah you're

1528
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:09,340
probably so scary scene it's probably seen in godfather one where uh michael clears out all

1529
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:15,500
his enemies which is during the baptism of the sun yeah yeah it's awful baptism in churches

1530
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:22,860
it's so scary it's all it feels like i don't listen like a like a derogatory way i guess

1531
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:28,780
but like it genuinely feels like a cult like you are inside of a scary creepy pasta i mean i mean

1532
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:33,660
i mean it i mean it literally is a call so there you go yeah there's a famous exchange well i guess

1533
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:38,460
it's famous because it's got a hundred thousand possibly millions of views on joe rogan describing

1534
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:46,380
all uh religion as a cult yeah and i believe it's eric winestein eric winestein is uh saying like

1535
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:51,580
well it's not fair to call it a cult because like then you know there's some like embedded wisdom

1536
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:56,860
and it's like it's a package yeah yeah eat it eat a dig yeah i don't know eat a dig this point is

1537
01:43:56,860 --> 01:44:02,060
kind of reasonable but also fuck him anyway um i actually like the guy okay moving on

dark souls about how i i cooked some butter or like i melted some butter in a pan but then

1562
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:07,900
changed my mind about cooking so i just turned the burner off let the butter recongeal in the pan

1563
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:12,700
right and then left and then said like like the like like the ultimate fate of the butter would

yeah you chop it up or cut it up what a fucking whatever and uh cauliflower preferably fresh okay

1577
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:42,620
and you just fucking saute it you just put in a fucking pan and you put it in a bunch of butter

1578
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:46,460
you let the cauliflower soak up the butter you salt and pepper it you salt and pepper it with the

1579
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:51,020
fucking sausage you mix it all up with the sausage it gets all hot and it gets all soft and and

1580
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:55,420
browned and delicious you take it out you put it in a bowl you sprinkle mozzarella cheese all over

1581
01:48:55,420 --> 01:49:00,780
it and you let it melt all together and you eat it all i can make this literally right now it's

1582
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:06,460
super good dude it's super good and like and cauliflower is pretty low is pretty low carb if

1583
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:10,380
you cook that it's a totally keto meal and if it's real let's add it to the show notes

1584
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:15,100
because i want to see that shit all right all right actually i have a picture actually i posted

1585
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:19,100
a picture in ben sainz hellfire hamlet it's something like like the first time i made it i

1586
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:25,820
posted a picture in the like food in the food section of that uh so i like ben speaking speaking

1587
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:31,580
of keto ben what uh you said you you're making you're mixing heavy cream and like some chocolate

1588
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:36,700
thing and adding stevia to it and making like drinks right is that hot yeah it's just it's

1589
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:41,420
yeah heavy cream you can dilute it with some water because otherwise it's really thick okay and then

1590
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:47,900
you um stevia and cocoa powder and maybe some vanilla okay my question and you microwave it and

1591
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:51,260
it's hot cocoa and it's delicious all right you're you're doing it hot because i had it cold and the

1592
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:56,700
cocoa does not mix at all it just stays gay yeah yeah yeah yeah and i thought i thought i'd purchased

1593
01:49:56,700 --> 01:50:02,300
the wrong kind of chocolate material if you know yeah stirring in cocoa is a nightmare it is the

1594
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:07,100
war and like usually like a blender might be the way to go if you make it hot if you heat it up it

1595
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:11,820
will mix in much better yeah that was the thing because i thought i i mean that was although

1596
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:17,580
alternatively if you want to do it cold you make it in a blender and you add like ice yeah

1597
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:22,780
and like maybe some coffee like i like to freeze coffee as coffee cubes like for ice coffee yeah

1598
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:26,700
so it doesn't dilute it it's good and so like i'll throw in some of those coffee ice cubes

1599
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:33,740
into like you know uh uh heavy cream cocoa stevia vanilla extract and i'll blend it in a blender

1600
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:38,140
or a or a magic bullet or something did you just get a fucking ninja blender and if you stole my

1601
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:44,300
switch i feel i feel obligated to steal his ninja response yes dude yeah yeah mix mix maybe you can

1602
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:48,620
you can add natural peanut butter too which can be good nothing and also thickens thickens it up a

1603
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:52,700
little more and anyway it makes really great like really great fucking like milkshakes that are really

1604
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:57,420
good and totally get that fucking switch top i'm personally invested i just i i've got something

1605
01:50:57,420 --> 01:51:01,980
in me that hates when people take game consoles from other people did you know you probably weren't

1606
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:06,460
using it it probably wasn't a big deal do i know about this do i know about this we just we mentioned

1607
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:11,260
it he just took my switch off of where it was set up for iam games and just it's gone he also did

1608
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:15,900
that for my ps4 i think that's so bad like he probably thought like i don't town wouldn't mind if

1609
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:19,980
i just it's not a huge deal i think the bigger deal was when he took my laptop because he was

1610
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:24,380
going to buy it but then decided that he didn't want it because it was too expensive but i opened

1611
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:27,820
it up and there was like a bunch of porn tabs open i'm like dude it's not even yours yet you're

1612
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:33,100
jerking off with it wait i'm on the switch on the no this is a laptop he's going to buy a laptop

1613
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:37,500
for me and was using it for porn but never bought it i'm like you gotta you can't there's like an

1614
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:42,700
unwritten rule don't use another man's technology for porn yeah i mean he's got his he's got his own

1615
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:47,660
computer i mean it was just sitting right there and you know the time was of the essence so clearly

1616
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:53,660
i have to put it on ebay now it's it's defiled and i don't do people pay good money for that the

1617
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:58,620
the digi bro defiled they probably did you file like the fbi which would have to have

1618
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:07,020
hardcore evidence deep cashed in the ssd of doings so all right next call next call here we go this

1619
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:12,940
is from the big gay let's hear oh my god really the big i mean that's what he says oh the big we

1620
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:17,260
we can't prove any identities but i think it's the big gay that's what it says all right all right

1621
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:24,380
welcome let's let's see what he's got for us why the hell do people not like gay people honestly

1622
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:29,500
i can't wrap my head around it what a selfish like what are the most sound quote unquote sound

1623
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:35,900
arguments you've heard against homosexuality also fuck you kyle just because i'm not okay

1624
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:42,460
of homophobia does not make me a fucking sjw i'm just curious as to why people think the way they do

1625
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:48,140
okay hang on what do you mean well you come to the right place because as as avowed homophobes

1626
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:54,860
ourselves we have great insight into the mindset yeah uh first of all i don't know who this kyle

1627
01:52:55,740 --> 01:53:00,700
individual is sounds like a real hero uh but uh i would uh build the wall build the wall we got

1628
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:04,140
to build that wall guys we got to build that wall um sounds like that guy's got a lot of gay people

1629
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:05,820
which is intent purpose

1630
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:14,620
okay stick with me here here's my like utilitarian point as to why there's obviously a lot of like

1631
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:20,860
religious baggage here right but okay tell me if this is insane all right two guys for example

1632
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:28,300
can't fucking have a child that is an inefficient setup that's an inefficient setup for that reason

1633
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:35,420
i'm gonna say that homosexuality is objectively inferior to heterosexuality on that basis alone

1634
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:40,220
what do you think uh i mean you have sex and you're not making a child right that was my first

1635
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:46,540
thing but i but i have the option at my disposal that's right that's right but you you've got one

1636
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:51,900
more tool in your toolbox to use therefore like let's say one's a 100 out of 10 one's got to be

1637
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:57,100
a 99 out of out of 100 come back when you've had a kid and you're gonna have any firm is footing for

1638
01:53:57,100 --> 01:54:01,740
this argument whatsoever but it's possible and that's not possible you gotta admit that right

1639
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:06,060
here's here's my argument i think you're i think you're close but you're not no you haven't quite

1640
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:13,260
hit on the reason the thing is it's like the more gay people there are the less dudes are out uh

1641
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:18,220
trying to get women which means you have more options by default well but remember i like

1642
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:24,220
hard video games and i want the challenge to have to rise up uh gamers and overcome and can

1643
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:32,140
break stacey's will and you know make her you know my housewife etc etc one of my many harem

1644
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:37,500
wives anyway i don't know i think it's mostly religious shit i think yeah that's really i mean

1645
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:42,380
you can't argue with the doctrine unfortunately i don't i don't think it's no i don't think it's a

1646
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:47,580
religious thing because like the like the alt right is not a religious movement like not even a little

1647
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:55,580
is the alt right anti-gay well of course they fucking are i sure of course of course they are

1648
01:54:55,580 --> 01:55:00,060
yes i would i would kind of think so uh but i guess i don't know the thing the thing about the

1649
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:05,580
thing about like bigotry is all just they all come they all fucking come together like racist like

1650
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:11,500
racists are like tend to also be homophobes tend to also be you know anti fucking muslim i mean

1651
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:16,940
i'm not i'm not saying that people in the alt right don't hate gay people i'm just saying i don't

1652
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:23,980
know if that's a tenet of alt right as a platform i have no idea i would imagine the overall tenets

1653
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:29,660
i think it is alt right is like a what they perceive as a degradation of social i mean the

1654
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:35,180
tenet the tenet that's the tenet that like okay since the alt right is not a unified front there

1655
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:39,740
is no there's you know there's no like official position it takes on anything just like which

1656
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:45,660
need to ask richard as a general as a general movement just like the alt like what the alt

1657
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:50,780
right believes sort of in general is just whatever the nazis believes and like like that's that's

1658
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:56,220
just that's just where it all like might be a bit of an exaggeration but it's it's not it's not an

1659
01:55:56,220 --> 01:56:01,980
exaggeration well i'm no expert uh i don't think it is you know what there's probably something

1660
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:06,860
just sort of biological about it because like you could you could take my point and like make that

1661
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:12,460
into like a hatred thing i guess you know like if you choose to take it to that place because like

1662
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:17,660
you could say that it's quote unquote unnatural because it's you know not whatever but like there

1663
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:21,660
are like gay animals you know it's obviously people are just gay by default you know many of

1664
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:26,300
i guess some choose but seems like the vast majority just are that way so like i don't know

1665
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:30,940
it just doesn't make a lot of sense to like hate people for that sort of thing um but it is like

1666
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:35,740
different it is like weird kind of for you know heterosexual people okay okay i was i was watching

1667
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:42,140
this video by this guy another sibling of mine jack sainz yeah slash slash lacking saint it was the

1668
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:50,060
truth about 90s cartoons and quote lgbt brainwashing and uh i mean i don't i won't talk about the whole

1669
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:55,820
thing or anything but it it oh god oh god oh no i started this point and it escaped oh fuck the

1670
01:56:55,820 --> 01:57:03,980
my point is something about oh something about like oh oh oh like the reaction people like the

1671
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:09,420
reaction people have like like okay like like putting a german character in the simpsons like

1672
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:15,900
putting uter in the simpsons is like it is quote it is you could call it like quote unquote german

1673
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:21,820
representation right and it's just as rare it's just as like unique as like having a gay character

1674
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:25,500
right there's no there's not a lot of germans running around in springfield specifically

1675
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:30,620
and yet that does not give the reaction people have to like when there's a gay character who

1676
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:34,940
is like stop stop shoving it down my throat people don't say stop shoving germans down my

1677
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:41,020
throat because like uter is in the simpsons yeah or like you know i just or like people don't people

1678
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:45,260
don't ask for it to be like you know i'm fine with it just like just just i don't want to see it or

1679
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:50,620
anything right it's something nobody has nobody has ethical problems with someone being german

1680
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:57,020
or at least a far fewer amount of people do yeah you know like like especially going back to the

1681
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:01,820
religious thing no one's going to be like being germans against my religion but like i really think

1682
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:07,740
there's an overarching like miasma that that has lasted for like i don't i mean it yeah like religious

1683
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:15,180
covenant i'm with i think there with what well what i think it is is that i mean religion was

1684
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:21,020
dominant in culture and you know just go back you know a couple decades and you know most people

1685
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:26,060
were protestant christians and you know it's not okay to be gay in there and so i feel like a lot of

1686
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:30,220
you know all right people are just people in general want to preserve the social values that

1687
01:58:30,220 --> 01:58:34,700
came before us and some of those social values were rooted in christianity so i think it's not

1688
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:40,300
so much that they think it's bad because god said it's bad but because they think it's bad because

1689
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:44,780
it's the way things have been and you know they are conservative they want to conserve the way that

1690
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:50,220
the society is currently or you know was in the past and the the reason why society was the way in

1691
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:57,660
this past because it was religious i guess that makes sense but by the way addendum to my point

1692
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:05,420
certainly uh like homosexual couples can adopt kids of course that's certainly true um but uh uh uh

1693
01:59:05,420 --> 01:59:10,380
uh so but but a heterosexual couple could do that as well so i stand by my point that there's just

1694
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:15,500
one option not on the table and you know what i'll go i'll go a little further and just say

1695
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:20,940
it does look like traditionally the standard family unit was a pretty efficient way for

1696
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:25,980
raising families and i'm just saying that's that's more up in the air when it comes to like

1697
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:32,060
same-sex couples i guess in the gay's defense though you can't have i you can't have accidental

1698
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:38,060
pregnancies if you're gay so like you can't fuck over your life i think i think you're looking at it

1699
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:42,940
a little too pragmatically that's possible i don't i i think you're i think you're trying to reason it

1700
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:48,060
out something that isn't that appropriate at least just a degree yeah but i well i think you're

1701
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:52,780
trying to reason out something that is just kind of inherently irrational what's the irrationality

1702
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:59,340
why i well i'm talking about like not liking gay people is is just it's just but that's not my

1703
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:04,780
position no no i know i know but you're trying to reason out why people do it and i'm saying that i

1704
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:10,620
i think it's a pretty in sort of inherently irrational like emotional sort of response

1705
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:15,420
people have and i don't really think you can reason out a hard why well i gotta know you know

1706
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:21,180
what i'm saying yeah i think it's a combination of biological and cultural factors i guess that

1707
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:24,780
people just and because of course ultimately just everybody can do whatever the fuck they

1708
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:30,540
want who cares and that's that's life just i one thing i found interesting that is like a

1709
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:36,060
was a big argument uh you know like like if you're born gay you know if it's a choice or not that

1710
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:40,940
was like a you know uh one of the main arguments at the center of stuff back you know back in the

1711
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:47,820
2000s you know yeah between the lies and stuff uh but like why does it matter if it's a choice or not

1712
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:54,220
like like why is that part of the conversation why i think that matters in a religious context i think

1713
02:00:54,220 --> 02:01:01,260
it i know i can go back to that but still i i mean if it is a if it is a choice well i mean i

1714
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:09,660
if it is a choice then you could say that someone could stop if they wanted to but yeah i guess but

1715
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:16,300
but i mean why they don't want to and so why do we have i mean i mean i guess it just is you know

1716
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:20,860
you know god says it's bad so you want to force well like okay we can all agree that like i guess

1717
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:28,460
it makes more sense to see it as a sin or to like punish it or to or to demand change of it okay

1718
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:31,740
people don't like things that are different right we can all at least agreed ourselves that

1719
02:01:31,740 --> 02:01:35,980
historically it sure was the way things were that it was a man and a woman would pair up that just

1720
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:41,260
was the way things generally went right we're not going to be crazy here and so when when something

1721
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:45,020
news around people are going to be like wary of it right they're going to think well that's weird

1722
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:49,660
and strange i don't know what's going on over there i think that's probably like the biggest factor

1723
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:55,260
in the whole in the whole thing i don't know yeah yeah i mean i think another problem with the

1724
02:01:55,900 --> 02:02:00,540
some of the backlash from people who don't like gays and stuff is probably because

1725
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:07,580
society especially now seems to confuse tolerance with acceptance you know it's not enough to be

1726
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:12,700
like i'm not really a fan of gay people but fine you have to love gay people like you have to be

1727
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:19,260
like being gays great and all that shit and that was the way i want to say that we were doing so

1728
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:24,540
well and we were talking about you know pragmatics you were talking about video games you were talking

1729
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:31,180
about you know you know being right we were going so well and then the meme question why do people

1730
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:36,220
like why is it so bad i was thinking that why do we hate gay people i was like let's just roll with it

1731
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:41,740
long philosophical diatribe well this is this is why society has been this is the hill

1732
02:02:41,740 --> 02:02:46,860
the peace peace peace by this by this question people are dying out there guys people are dying

1733
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:52,140
out there we're the reason people are dying we're the reason the gays are dying and all other people

1734
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:56,380
yeah recipe is all gays sorry we can save you but let's move on to the next question please god

1735
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:01,420
all right this is from endless fart endless fart go

1736
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:05,980
so as a fan of the pcp i knew this guy is munchie and ben saint

1737
02:03:06,540 --> 02:03:11,820
and i seen him promoting this game in this world and i say you know this guy is pretty cool you

1738
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:18,460
know you know i'm gonna try the game he seems pretty cool and i don't understand anything i don't even

1739
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:24,780
use discord i'm argentina i'm from argentina uh we communicate here through smoke signals

1740
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:32,300
so i try i try after day after every day after school i come back i come back i do my homework

1741
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:39,180
like a good boy and i try to understand it like three hours every day i try to visit the website

1742
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:46,460
and and they say other information why don't you update your information um i try to talk in the

1743
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:52,780
chat and they say oh you're a fucking rowdy hey you fucking piece of shit no this is that that's

1744
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:59,420
racist that's racist so after three days i think i understand it so i mine i mine i mine i go to

1745
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:06,700
dojo i buy a weapon munchie try to kill me and i avoid it i don't know how and so i leave i leave

1746
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:12,620
i i leave the game there i close i go to sleep i come back from school the next day and and i'm

1747
02:04:12,620 --> 02:04:18,460
dead i don't even do anything i leave the game you what the fuck what do i need to do i get killed

1748
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:26,220
anywhere i leave the game right there and i kill no no no where were you dude were you in were you

1749
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:30,540
in cop kill town were you in juvie's row were you in a mine all right he must have been enough

1750
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:39,420
that person is like the bizarro world like a u of roba dobot uh who is chilean he's like he's like

1751
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:44,620
the other like the flip side of the coin like like the dark version of him who uh who who who

1752
02:04:44,620 --> 02:04:49,180
was argentina and couldn't get into rfck because he didn't know what tex commands are this is like

1753
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:54,540
this is like like you know the the equipment man it's too okay did anyone else have trouble

1754
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:59,820
understanding that guy i don't understand it i i got most of it i got most of it i struggle here

1755
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:04,060
in there it's uh it's a shame that like the one guy the guy who calls in to talk about like the

1756
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:08,620
specifics of endless war something that i am infinitely interested in discussing and in having

1757
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:13,500
people hear about it has is like you know thickly accented and has like bad audio quality making

1758
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:18,700
it sort of hard to fucking follow what he's saying god damn smoke signals am i right well i mean i

1759
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:22,460
this guy was definitely interesting because he's like i think i felt he was archetypical of people

1760
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:28,300
or archetypal whatever of people who like try and don't get into rfck but this guy's actually

1761
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:33,660
committed more than most i think it sounds like yeah well it sounds like he under i mean he went

1762
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:39,660
to the dojo and equipped a weapon that's like yeah he's he's figuring it out that your problem

1763
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:45,740
your problem must have been that you were waiting in a in a in a pvp zone which is i think this is

1764
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:50,700
a tale of one inch frustration with the game that's just asking to well you know it's not over yet

1765
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:57,260
he's got a long way to go um by the way okay okay well number one um the pcp audience as far as

1766
02:05:57,260 --> 02:06:02,460
i can tell is sick of us talking about rfck and like is actively like hostile towards it at least

1767
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:07,260
in the page okay uh so i don't want to dwell on it too much listen i've listen i've been in the

1768
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:12,300
patron lounge okay it's a fucking crag quagmire the quagmire i'm not worried about it there's not

1769
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:15,580
a lot of movers and shakers hanging out in that chat let me tell you not a lot of big

1770
02:06:15,580 --> 02:06:21,020
big fat cats we uh those people hang out in the bonus lounge for five dollars a month people that's

1771
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:25,420
where you want to be that's where all the real shit goes uh i mean what i mean what's the

1772
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:29,900
problem are are the are they are they a bunch of digi heads who are just like what's the text

1773
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:33,660
command i mean they probably just haven't tried playing and then they just like are like okay we

1774
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:38,860
get it i mean just like a game move on yeah uh just like the pokemon anyway if you haven't tried

1775
02:06:38,860 --> 02:06:44,060
playing in a while or you tried you know playing like a long time ago and it didn't work out orientation

1776
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:50,300
is the channel that you are posted in as soon as you join the discord just read it i like i'm

1777
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:55,740
sorry if it takes you literally two fucking minutes to read this video game explain does it cover

1778
02:06:56,540 --> 02:07:00,300
does it cover that yeah yeah it covers everything it covers everything you could possibly need to

1779
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:06,540
know so fucking just read it and the game is the game has changed man the game has changed so much

1780
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:12,540
yeah and like it's so different now even like even like two months ago yeah it was so different

1781
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:17,180
yeah that's true i'm out of the loop now and all right if you guys if you guys just i really think

1782
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:21,100
it's better if you're one of these people who can't understand text commands just too complicated

1783
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:26,460
for you it's too like esoteric uh come come to my patreon where i have a game with buttons and

1797
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:58,220
keto diet or uh like munchie learning how to cook and i think that's pretty admirable but um i think

1798
02:08:58,220 --> 02:09:05,740
i have uh one one one route you guys have overlooked pretty heavily and that's going pre food all right

1799
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:11,020
so let me give you the lowdown so every morning i wake up i get out of bed i don't need to cook

1800
02:09:11,020 --> 02:09:17,100
i don't need to uh like whatever the fuck you do to prepare some fuel but i just walk outside

1801
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:22,860
i go down in the corner and i find this pregnant homeless lady and i give her five dollars and

1802
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:30,060
she just lets me breastfeed and i do this for breakfast lunch and every day and i was wondering

1803
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:37,420
what your opinions were on this uh new revolution in the dietary world i think it's really i think

1804
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:41,580
it's really great that you're contributing to the economy i appreciate that breast milk

1805
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:46,300
human breast milk is the most nutritious food people can have apparently yeah that can't be true

1806
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:52,780
like that can't be true it's a fact man have you tried it get out there for for babies maybe well

1807
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:58,700
babies have different needs i wonder is human breast milk keto maybe then they can't be there's

1808
02:09:58,700 --> 02:10:04,300
no way there's no way babies consume breast milk and they go from like baby size to full human size

1809
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:10,300
like that so if i start drinking breast milk i'm gonna like double or triple in size at no time

1810
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:17,580
maybe this uh you're you're gonna be like you're gonna be like that guy in dr mcninja who develops

1811
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:24,140
his abs so much that they turn into an organic jet yeah that's right that's what kind of development

1812
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:31,180
everyone's fucking wondering in in the ruins of of the ancient city of kyro they're all wondering

1813
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:36,300
oh why did they make statues of people that were not to scale why did they make statues of people

1814
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:41,020
wouldn't stand upright would have been you know eight meters tall and they're all thinking aliens

1815
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:46,460
you know chocolate blitz but no they just drank breast milk well after they were necessary to

1816
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:52,780
like just fucking tripled in size no extra chromosomes required all right here's uh here's

1817
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:59,100
here's another one from meron pond melon pan meron pan oh yeah i know this guy this this is this

1819
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:13,500
nade obelum you're gonna end up working yourself into a spiral of frustration and wasted time if

1820
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:18,700
you try to spring back into a weekly show it'll take up so much of your time if you try to put in

1821
02:11:18,700 --> 02:11:23,660
as many new features and as much attention as you say you want to but i've come with a solution

1822
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:27,980

1825
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:45,260
features as you want in segments without it feeling overwhelming and you left with more time to work

1826
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:50,540
on bigger projects or those smash reveal things or even just to spend time with your girlfriend

1827
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:54,540

02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:10,380
i mean that's just kicking the the can down the road yeah we all know the real fix here the real

1830
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:15,260
fake is to strip things back and put less effort into them there has been absolute feature creep

1831
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:21,100
in we agua how long how long is it is it how long is it between we are okay i i made a bunch of

1837
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:51,580
one week on one big discussion i think you did yeah i think so i i had to play that one i was

thinking of skipping it but the production value was so high i had to include it he put a bunch of

1839
02:12:56,860 --> 02:13:02,300
music on and smoked some weed he's he's he's wanted to talk about feature creep that was some voicemail

too wispy yeah okay oh my god he's a little more a little more like harsh and nasally a little

1865
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:27,900
a little less a little less okay all right although he does do that he does slip into that sometimes

1866
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:35,420

1885
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:21,980
yeah a little bit that's yeah econ has a has a good heart yeah he's hard to the right place yeah

1886
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:28,620
yeah but his his his calibration of urgency is uh you know or at least the perceived urgency of

1887
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:32,700
the situation no no it was a good conversation it was nice to talk to me yeah i just thought it was

1888
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:39,100
the fact that he was the middle cooking duck yeah i actually appreciate that about him that he will

1889
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:45,820
just like call people like to talk to them like i don't do that enough uh i respect that respect

1890
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:53,020
me yeah it's it's not that hard well yeah i know but i don't do it okay it's easier to text so

1891
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:57,980
and i and that and that's a and that's a fault that's a fault in my stars by john green oh i love

1892
02:17:57,980 --> 02:18:04,300
crash course world history uh uh yeah to the to the answer our hero once for his question to answer

1893
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:09,900
the gq once and for all uh which i think we've already dealt with in this in this episode i don't

1894
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:14,780
i don't even remember what the question was how can he be gay or how can he like he doesn't want to

1895
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:19,820
act gay but he wants to be perceived as more gay uh i think the one thing you need to do to up your

1896
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:24,300
game is head on over to patreon.com slash the procrastinators you're gonna want to up that

1897
02:18:24,300 --> 02:18:30,620
pledge to it like 10 15 maybe 20 dollars no one's gonna mistake you for not getting no one hey listen

1898
02:18:30,620 --> 02:18:36,540
yeah hey listen i was i would say wear a procrastinator shirt oh that's a good idea i have two questions

1899
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:41,900
do we do we even sell shirts and two do we sell them on teespring because if we sell them anywhere

1900
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:46,780
other than teespring we need to stop i'm pretty sure it's all in red bubble right now okay we need

1901
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:51,660
to take down the red bubble in or at least the shirts and fucking start a teespring because they

1902
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:55,900
are so much cheaper you were talking about this okay we so much let's look into this let's look

1903
02:18:55,900 --> 02:19:01,660
into this yeah okay maybe by the time this episode goes up you'll be able to go to our new teespring

1904
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:05,660
linked in the description okay we'll see if not i guess you could buy them on red bubble and look

1905
02:19:05,660 --> 02:19:10,220
really gay in front of all your friends for just throwing your money out the window like that

1906
02:19:10,220 --> 02:19:16,140
i would recommend waiting i would recommend waiting until just go go to the iam games

1907
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:22,540
spread shirt buy the iam game shirt and just pluck out the m e s that just says i am gay and you're

1908
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:29,660
golden you know i made you know i made you know because uh you know i i made all the rfck shirts

1909
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:34,060
and stuff and like i you know i realized that teespring was just such a better service i went

1910
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:39,740
and i made a couple of uh ben saint specific shirt i haven't advertised them at all i have i don't i

1911
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:43,660
think this might be the first time i've even mentioned it to literally anyone that i made them

1912
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:51,020
but i did put a little link to like merchandise on my on my twitch and it's it's the profit margins

1913
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:55,900
name i care i care about the profit margins the profit margins are so much bigger on teespring

1914
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:59,900
they're like double and we should be doing it couldn't agree more yeah we should yeah we should

1915
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:03,500
selling them through any other although i do wonder about like the price like does the item

1916
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:07,020
to the consumer i know i know the interesting thing well well here well here's the thing you

1917
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:12,540
can set it yourself and therefore you can have you can you can literally you can make way you can

1918
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:18,540
make way more money for the same cost of the consumer you can make okay you can make the same

1919
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:24,300
amount of money and cost the consumer way less or you can or you can split the difference and make

1920
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:29,420
more money for less to the well we should do this and i know by the way the higher profit margin is

1921
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:34,620
just on across the board benefit to everyone then i got something for you to fix uh it's heinous

1922
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:41,500
i go to st comics dot com there's no link to your twitch here oh my god you're right um another

1923
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:46,140
another good thing about there's no link to my fucking twitch about uh teespring that there is

1924
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:50,300
youtube integration you're gonna integrate your teespring to a youtube channel have it show up

1925
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:55,660
under videos for merch oh shit that's right we could have that on the pcp below every episode

1926
02:20:55,660 --> 02:21:01,180
current um that's really good we should do that immediately that's what we need we need to go

1927
02:21:01,180 --> 02:21:05,740
fucking corporate hell yeah we do we need to go even we need to go yeah more corporate this is not

not true we invest we invested you we invested huge sums of investors money all right listen

in that scheme and it didn't pay off i still do want one if i if i could snap my fingers get one

1944
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:44,940
that'd be great i might even go purchase one you immediately but but yeah and it's true when i said

1945
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:50,460
that i was burning with a passion that was at my peak level of playing endless war when i was talking

1946
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:55,500
about that i've been playing less recently so it's not exactly top fucking priority to rush over

1947
02:22:55,500 --> 02:23:00,220
and get myself a mug even though objectively it would be sick that's where it would be that's where

1948
02:23:00,220 --> 02:23:07,660
it's at so i told no lies sir no lies all right yeah well i'm just okay you know i went to i

1949
02:23:07,660 --> 02:23:13,580
i i specifically like based on you saying that i went and like searched around websites found the

1950
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:18,300
ideal one which incidentally was spread shirt because spread shirt lets you make mug every other

1951
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:23,660
service if you want a mug to be not yeah you can't do it all you can do is have a white so

1952
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:29,340
with like a big ugly like colored rectangle around it but spread shirt lets you print a design on a

1953
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:34,460
base black or red mug and okay so you're telling me to get the black slime court mug i can go to

1954
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:40,220
teespring and get it no no no no that's on spread oh that's on spread shirt okay gotcha there is

1955
02:23:40,220 --> 02:23:45,100
there's a link on the twitch on the twitch rowdy rowdy fricker's tritch there's like a separate

1956
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:49,820
link to teespring there's spread shirt okay see i didn't know these facts like which one to go to

1957
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:55,100
now that i know what to do that that is making it easy it eases my path what if i do research and

1958
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:59,580
shit but okay and the and the mug the mugs the different different different products are like

1959
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:03,660
different like most of them were the best deal on teespring but not all of them so the ones that

1960
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:08,700
were better on other sites are on the spread shirt and the and the red then do you know if the

1961
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:14,140
teespring shirts are snug or not do you know do you know if they're if they're small or not

1965
02:24:36,220 --> 02:24:41,900
funny and not elongating the podcast for no reason this is actually funny uh remember at rfckcon

1966
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:47,020
when we went to every place that was selling the vapors and i made a big deal about demanding the

1967
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:51,900
people to order more copies of the vapor and i made that i made them write down my phone number and

1968
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:56,940
make them make a special order for the vapors and to alert me when it was in a harvard square

1969
02:24:56,940 --> 02:25:02,860
comic book store near them again you remember that yeah i do yeah yeah like like we all like okay we

1970
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:10,380

1971
02:25:10,380 --> 02:25:14,700
just like waiting like everyone would they like like everyone wanted everyone like bought out my

1972
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:18,620
stock because like these things were these places were carrying like two or three copies of peace

1973
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:23,580
they would buy out my stock and then munchie would go and ask for another one and they'd tell them

1974
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:27,820
they don't have anymore i think we're out of that and he'd be like oh man i'm such a big fan i would
