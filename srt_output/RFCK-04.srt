1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
By the way, whenever I look at this, I think it says E-Fuck, and I don't know why.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, dirt cheap E-Fuck.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Alright, I guess we can start at any time. Talking about the Nintendo Switch.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey everyone, welcome to episode whatever of Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I believe it's the fifth?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, I think so too. It's just me and Munchy here.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We don't need any other people. They always mess everything up. They always bring their gay shit in here.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
They always keep talking about how they're migtails and they love to rape women.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, and frankly, it's offensive and I won't stand for it.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We are the most blue-pilled people on the face of the planet.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I just eat blue pills for breakfast cereal. I have a big box of them.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and dessert are all comprised mainly of blue pills.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I have not once entered a single red pill in my body and I never did.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If I ever did, I would cut off my hand in penance.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Anyway, me and Munchy hate video games.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
More than a human could even describe, I think we are completely fed up with the idea of interacting with media in any meaningful way.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Like, it's not even real, man. It's just pixels on the screen.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, it's not even, it's not, it has no bearing reality. It's all gay shit.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Nintendo hasn't made any good games since they made...

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I think you're...

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
...Mariochic is typing.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And how can video games be real?

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If our eyes aren't real.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's all I'm saying.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, I think to say we both love that presentation and it was great.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh yeah, we just watched the Nintendo Switch presentation.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, and it was...

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was really cool and pretty good.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And I loved it. And we love video games.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And we are the most red-pilled people on the face of the planet when it comes to video games.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If I had $299.99 burning a hole in my pocket, would I get a Switch?

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Honestly, maybe.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Because video games...

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think might redeem themselves.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, video games have caused so much violence in the streets.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Racial tensions are at an all-time high due to video games such as Splatoon.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, because video games have gone off the fray.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Video games have been getting people to Pokemon Go to the polls lately.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We need video games like the Nintendo Switch to get us to Pokemon Get Away from those polls.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Stay inside.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't talk to people and please, please consider suicide.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Unless you're going to your platonic best friend's home for an evening of Ice Breakers with Switch...

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
One-two Switch made by Nintendo, Reggie Philamy.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Anyway, what games did we just see?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We just saw...

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, first of all, I have a bunch of notes here.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And we should start from where the presentation starts, which is the hardware.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, yeah, we start with the hardware.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My first note is I've got something to dock for you.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The Nintendo Switch is a DS, but not at all.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And you charge it by putting it on a little thing, and then you use controllers and you play the games.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a DS...

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's a DS...

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a DS 3DS Wii U.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's it.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's those two things.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It went on extended period of time about how it has D&A from every game system.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But really just like two and a half?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Just like the last couple that were good?

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, the last couple.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The Gamecube has a handle on it.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It doesn't fucking care.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Stupid.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Gamecube's the best system in the game, however.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
However is the best game system.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In spite of its crippling handle.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't even know if the thing had a handle.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's bizarre now that I think of it.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I use it all the time, honestly.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
When I went to go play melee with some bros.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Dude, that's sick dude!

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Jack off, Jack off, Jack off!

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm picturing like...

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's the heart of Tokyo, right?

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And it's 9am or 8am or 6am.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't fucking know.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's when people...

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All the Japanese businessmen are all making their morning commute.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And they're all sitting there on the subway holding the subway poles.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know, the camera pans across the road.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
All, you know, all heights, sizes, ages.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's all these men, all these big towel men.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Just holding their briefcases.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
These important stuffy briefcases.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Checking their watches.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Pan too munchy and his pizza onesie.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Holding his Gamecube like a suitcase.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Checking his watch that he isn't wearing.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Looking out the window.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That is drawn on with Sharpie.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
As I do every morning.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Every, and every, and every number says...

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Burger.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
One.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
One.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Every number says one.

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's always one.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well audience, guess what time it is.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I guess it's time to...

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
One.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
One.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
One.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
One.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
One.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
One.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
One.

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
One.

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
One.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
One.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
One.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
One.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
One.

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
One.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
One.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
One.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
One.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
One.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
One.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
One.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
One.

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
One.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
One.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
One.

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
One.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
One.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
One.

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
One.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
One.

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
One.

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
One.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
One.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
One.

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
One.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
One.

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
One.

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
One.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
One.

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
One.

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
One.

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
One.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000

151
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
One.

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000

153
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000

154
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
One.

191
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One.

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
One.

193
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
One.

194
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,440
It does look janky and they aren't much far apart than any other

195
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,520
Controller, but that is normally where they are placed in the sense that like there's one out like north and one south

196
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,640
Wait, is the 3ds kind of like that? Does it have like two joysticks like that?

197
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,360
Well the the the there's like a proof

198
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,560
Okay

199
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,320
The fucking what are they called the joycon the joycon are tiny

200
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,960
They're very they're tiny and also to you're supposed to like you have that like top slider on that gives them

201
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,200
The the shoulder buttons, yeah, which is even tinier and there's so many fucking moving parts

202
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,520
Yeah, there's so many little things it is very small and very vulgar and very

203
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,840
Complex such as another man that I know named Ben saying small vulgar

204
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,520
Yeah, all these fucking parts. I'm not I don't care that like I don't think I would if I had a Nintendo switch

205
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,920
I don't think I would lose these parts, but I do know I would be I do think that I would be frustrated every single time

206
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,440
I had to like find the like the shoulder buttons and like slide it onto my joycon

207
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,240
I'm not worried about that what I'm worried about is I have big fucking hand come on man

208
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,820
Yeah, and it would be I I think I held it

209
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,080
Obviously, but I think it would be very uncomfortable in my hands be very close together because I oh I already feel that way slightly

210
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,440
With the gamecube control and if it were any smaller than that

211
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,800
I think it would be a bit excessive not to be racist no racism

212
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,000
But I think it's it's because of your race and die

213
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,120
I was gonna say that like I think that it's designed for like Japanese hands, right?

214
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,440
Oh, that is exactly why it is like yeah, it's small for Japanese hands Japanese people are

215
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,940
Categorically smaller than other races. That's not in the physics team. Well, I think so I because I find the truth offensive

216
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,780
We as a poor we are the most blue pill people

217
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,640
Get away from me man, I don't want to hear a single fucking thing about that. All right

218
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,140
I don't want to hear but Japanese people are getting my entire fucking blire. No, I've seen I've seen too many of them

219
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,100
Yeah, in this in this in this last hour

220
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,260
It's coming out in two months. Yeah, it will be here sooner than my cum leaves my body

221
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,940
I hope so

222
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,580
And all right, what else about the hardware? Um, I find it weird. I

223
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,340
I mean, what's what's the deal with like so like all the games that it plays have to be

224
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
Runnable on like portable hardware

225
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,660
Yeah, so that's weird. That seems like it's really limiting

226
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,660
They put a lot of effort into like because that seems like there's a lot of games then that won't

227
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,140
Like like like I mean already like the Wii and the Wii U are not like hard. They're not

228
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,900
Powerful like the PlayStation whatever in the Xbox whatever are so I guess that's probably fine and they're and they're okay with the sacrifice

229
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:39,900
You still though that means that like anything you're playing on your Nintendo Switch is something that you should you would expect to be playing on

230
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:47,180
Something the size of like an intended like a 3ds. Okay. Yes, but have you seen how those games look? Yeah, they look great

231
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,940
I guess I guess we're getting to that point where that's not even that big a deal

232
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,660
Yeah, yeah, no

233
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,940
Because the 3ds the original 3ds was in between the Nintendo 64 and the game

234
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,780
graphics wise, yeah

235
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,780
And I like and due to the fact that they are going out from the outside to make this both a

236
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:12,980
Home and a handheld system. They're gonna put a lot of fucking effort into like min maxing where everything should go and it's

237
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,980
Maximizes

238
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,180
It basically just looks like the Wii U, but I don't care

239
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,540
No, I know that I should grab her, but I don't I don't care at all

240
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,260
Yeah, I think you'll agree with me the graphical fidelity isn't the end all be all

241
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,580
There's way more important things in making good games not not to say that visuals don't matter visuals better a lot

242
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,460
Yeah, art styling themes and gay shit that I don't I I hate everyone

243
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,180
Japanese people the most

244
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,900
Yeah, because they made Nintendo. Yeah, Nintendo

245
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:59,020
More like and they've trapped us in the vicious cycle of video game consoles

246
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Which is the hell that you can never wake up from?

247
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,540
Most definitely most definitely that is the case. What was it saying?

248
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:13,860
Wait 3d hardware small hardware portable hardware visual fidelity. Yeah. Yeah, we're just saying that

249
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:22,500
It doesn't have to look hd necessary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I won't disagree. It looks nice, but it's definitely it's not

250
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,020
important

251
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,340
Yeah, yeah, I think yeah, the hardware is good enough. Yeah, portable

252
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
Yeah, that's something it's good

253
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,180
So so you don't think do you think it will be a visual downgraded from the Wii U? No, no, it's an upgrade. It's a straight up

254
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,780
Holy shit. Yeah, it's impressive. I guess the Wii U is pretty small

255
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,060
Yeah, it is like the actual console itself. I have no doubt it will be heavy

256
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,620
Which I think will hurt it a little bit in the sense that we normally just won't want to lug it around. Yeah, look

257
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,740
Yeah, lugging

258
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,180
Yeah lugging the equivalent of a Wii U around and playing it like on the subway then again

259
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,580
It is much leaner though. I get the impression that is leaner, but bigger

260
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:10,860
How much how much is a 3ds cost a 3ds was originally 250. I believe and now it's a hundred and fifty

261
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,060
Oh shit. So like so like the switch isn't even that much more expensive. No, that's another note of mine

262
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,060
$300 to fuck off

263
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,620
What do you mean?

264
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,860
We pay fun $350 at $300. Sorry. Yeah, and we can fuck off after that

265
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,420
Are you saying that's good or bad? I'm I don't know what I mean

266
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,620
I mean, I think it sounds like an okay price point. No. No. Yeah, it's definitely it. Okay. I'm fine with it

267
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:47,580
Do you remember when like weeds were like a hundred dollars? Yeah. Yeah, it was recent like I mean, what are they now Obama like nothing

268
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:55,040
Yeah, well like original we know her like fucking paper. They're toilet paper. You can pack you you use them as packing peanuts. Yeah

269
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
Very hard packing peanuts. Yeah

270
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,260
Really not not advised however, it is but it is economically viable

271
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,460
I guess I was totally true that certain dollars to fuck off because there's online paid

272
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,500
Oh, yeah, the pay online is such it's so shit. Yeah

273
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,900
That seems that doesn't seem like a Nintendo move to make like a play online service a pay-to-play thing

274
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,260
That's weird. It's never been like no, it hasn't why would they do that?

275
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,820
You know, it's gonna make I mean, I'm not gonna buy it when it comes out

276
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,980
But it would make me mad to like you get the console and the online service is free

277
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,740
And then suddenly it's not yeah, you like you lose that functionality. Yeah, that's that's shitty

278
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,980
I don't like it. I don't like it. It is it is definitely shitty

279
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,620
the only reason they could possibly be doing this is because

280
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,580
No one likes Nintendo online and they want to it like they want to improve its quality

281
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,220
And therefore they must focus on it more and therefore they deserve like they they want money for

282
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,620
They want money for the fact that they will now care about online. That's the only that's the only reason I can

283
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,420
Meet me that's not to say that I think it will be good because I have no like they have never done good online and any capacity whatsoever

284
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,920
God

285
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,620
Fucking the festival Plaza and Sun and Moon is so terrible. Yeah, it is worse thing ever

286
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,420
It doesn't even fucking work. It is so hard. Yeah to do it. Yeah. Oh

287
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,380
It's

288
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,100
Fuck Rick you you gosh dang Japanese people. Yeah, man

289
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,860
What were they thinking they must you know, they must have just not cared because they can all quick connect with each other and they're tiny island nation

290
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:49,220
Because they're all literally like on top of each other. Yeah, 100% of the reason they're so small is because there's not enough space to walk around

291
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:56,780
You have to be they're involved. They're they're they're evolving into oh, you mean the people. Yeah, I thought you meant the hard way

292
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,820
No, the boat. Yeah, yeah, but the one feeds into the yes, they're both shrinking

293
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,280
They're both game video games are shrinking and therefore they must shrink to play video games. That's all

294
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
People get smaller

295
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,820
The selective evolution of people have to get smaller to adapt to the new video game

296
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,260
Oh my god, this is like in this is cycles of every like five years or so the people

297
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:29,660
This is smaller and smaller to adapt to the new video game rapid evolution unlike anything else we've ever observed the Japanese in the video game are truly

298
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:39,060
What's the word this is why I mean, you know the thing about like like Japanese elderly people are like really small and hunched over

299
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,020
Yeah, because they had to adapt too many times because the video games just they just wore them out

300
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,700
This is why I see a video games are destroying Japan in more ways

301
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,060
And now it's bleeding over

302
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Destruction when will it ends?

303
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,540
Well, it's a good thing you're talking about other

304
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Hey, it's Jesse

305
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Rowdy fuck

306
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,460
I don't fucking know I came up with it and I really don't like

307
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
I

308
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,780
Came up with it, isn't that you're very fond of

309
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,860
My next oh

310
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,100
Jesse have you seen the Nintendo switch?

311
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:38,540
He's given through completely. Well, he didn't skip through like 80% of it was hot garbage. Yeah. Well, I was pretty

312
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,820
pleased with the games generally I

313
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,100
Don't really give a fuck about Splatoon. Everybody like that. I love splatoon. Yeah, we're gonna use

314
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,820
Plagueons, you know, I have notes that will guide us through

315
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,860
Oh

316
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,860
If I got if I got a we a switch

317
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,220
Splatoon would be my top my top. Well, unless I wanted to try out arms

318
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,380
We should have said this at the beginning. This is crucial. My dick leans to the left. Does that happen to anyone else?

319
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,940
Or should I ask the doctor about that?

320
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,260
No, it's normal. Everyone's everyone's leans and everyone's bad

321
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,620
Okay, every dick is horrible in its own way, but vaginas are way worse

322
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,420
We can all we can all agree that the giant every vagina is horrible in the same way

323
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:30,020
Well, but join us are like evil. Yeah, but a dick is a sin. Yeah, I agree like vaginas commit dicks

324
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Like genocide, right?

325
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Oh

326
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,740
Fuck okay, okay. Have we said everything about the hardware? No, there's still more

327
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,460
My next note no region locking you fucking cunt. That's good. Yeah, they're not region locking. Yeah, it's great

328
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,660
Why would they never why isn't it hasn't it always been why why is region locking a video game?

329
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,460
Yeah, it's the worst video game ever made. I mean, I don't understand why it ever was ever

330
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
But like in the modern era of

331
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:28,140
Gaming it's especially baffling that it was that it needs still around to be removed second that I've never been able to play my

332
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Evangelion Dating Sim

333
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,940
And they've just been sitting on my shelf, and I'll never know their glory

334
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:44,020
You probably you probably have to like take out the PS the PlayStation motherboard and like put a spring on the reset button

335
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,020
Or something and it'd be easier to build

336
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,300
Truly

337
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,820
Yeah, I think I think all we have to say is that's just sick. Yeah, it's pretty good

338
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,460
It's good, but I'm not gonna praise them for it because it's the base. It's baseline

339
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,780
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Nate was talking about this as well

340
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,860
It's not something we should like yeah, like they should have done this in the first place

341
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,860
It's not something to get all perceived. Yeah, that's not the right way. Yes. I have a note

342
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,540
I don't know what it means Fabio edits entertaining DNA

343
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,540
Go on. That's it. No, what do you think Jesse is that like they could be a game

344
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,460
Is that the truth that that is the that if anything is a red pill in documentary

345
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,160
That's not like a documentary. That'd be like a high fantasy adventure game. Yeah based on like Fabio romance novel

346
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,220
Yes procedurally generated to resemble just based on all the different elements of romance

347
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,180
Weaving a tapestry of continuity between all these disparate covers of these novels

348
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,340
You play as a as a Buxom wench

349
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,900
Whose bodice is ever on the cusp of ripping

350
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,300
You play as Fabio on your love quest across the nine realms

351
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Which includes San Diego, Chicago

352
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
Everyone knows the nine realms

353
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,620
New York City Toronto

354
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
And Rio de Janeiro

355
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
Toronto is the final boss

356
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,420
The women are so Muslim. It's hard to even walk

357
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,060
You have to go and reform it

358
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Curit curits plague

359
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,140
This this is something we're gonna get married to their boats, right? No, no, no

360
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:39,540
Do does anyone agree with the with my opinion that handhelds are better than home consoles? Um

361
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,540
Um

362
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,900
But the Splatoon wait Splatoon is on the 3ds wasn't it? No, not at all

363
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:57,580
I mean, I'm actually I'm not really I completely understand home consoles and I like them just fine

364
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,100
However, I like the idea of like I like to always be at my computer

365
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,580
So the fact that I can just use like a DS while I'm at the computer is

366
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
very appealing

367
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,500
But then you're not really you're not using your computer

368
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,740
I mean couldn't you just have a home console right next to your computer wouldn't it be like the same thing?

369
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,900
I guess so, but I can also like walk around and I can also go to the bathroom

370
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:25,940
I can also you know do all the shit that a normal need does a normal need a good need

371
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,420
Like like every good boy should

372
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,100
It's um

373
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,420
But see what this is the best of both worlds because you can be gay and I can be gay and we can all suck each other's dick

374
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
Hang on. I've lost track of the conversation

375
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,700
Then into a switch this whole gimmick is it's a home console and a and no

376
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:52,260
Yeah, and it's you know what I think I just have a psychological bias against taking my home console on the road

377
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,500
Even though it costs like barely more than a 3ds would but I would still feel really weird like

378
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,380
Plants like the guy in the trailer like playing Skyrim and then picking up my Skyrim machine taking Skyrim on the bus with me

379
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,980
Maybe if I tried it, I would get over it real quick. It seems weird. I would definitely

380
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,820
Like not use it in the situation of that that that hideous monster uses

381
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,660
The boy the boy on the trailer that there's like this guy in like a trailer and he like looks like a normal human

382
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,460
He looks like he looks like a normal will just a human and therefore

383
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,380
Yes, yes, I understand. I mean

384
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,300
Yeah, I don't yeah, I don't get it either

385
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,740
It's like yeah, you play it up if you have like an hour long commute or something on the subway

386
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,220
I think so but like most people don't commute

387
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,940
You like you'd be like in like little five minute increments like oh getting on the bus getting sitting on the bus getting off the bus

388
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,940
Walking down the street. I

389
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,140
Like to flip out my DS if I ever go to say a restaurant alone

390
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,300
When I'm when I'm I can't spend time with my friends like I want to and I decide like well

391
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,020
I might as well just play a video game so I can remind myself

392
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:15,300
Well, I can lead myself in the thinking that people like me like I don't I don't need a video game to fill like

393
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:20,700
Little like five or ten or fifteen minutes. Well, I'm saying if I go into a fucking restaurant

394
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,780
Yeah, like like like while I'm waiting to eat. I'll play the game

395
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,940
I'm going if I if I had a yeah

396
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,460
If yeah, if I had a console a three-hand hill console, yeah

397
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,020
I like I like I'm one of those people who likes is like I'm going to play a video game

398
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,820
Yeah, you know, but I get but I guess I don't know

399
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,580
I guess I'm one of these guys who I like I like

400
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,020
Narrative and I like immersion and I like to get lost in a thing

401
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,500
I don't think I've ever been immersed in anything in my entire life

402
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,740
You and did you both think that and I'm like I get immersed man

403
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,760
That's what I'm looking for when I play a game is to like be have a fun

404
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,860
But the closest thing I've ever been to him probably immerse myself in is rape play because I emphasize so much with the main character

405
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:18,100
Is that the one where you're like a god and you have like powers to like blow the girls skirts up?

406
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:24,540
No, no, I think no, well, it's the one where you rape a mother and then her daughter on a Japanese

407
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,880
I'm pretty sure that's the one. I'm thinking. Okay. I'm pretty sure I've done that scenario so many times

408
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,980
My life is basically like rape in every way and

409
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,860
I'm Japanese. Where did the video games end and reality begin?

410
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,140
With digs predicts prediction

411
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,400
The world will become more like a video game and video games will more and more resemble the real world until the two are

412
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Functionally inseparable

413
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:55,880
Yes, yes, especially in Japan. Well, I already that way in Japan. Can I eat vagina as Crash Bandicoot?

414
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,160
Not yet. Well in the future one day. I can't wait until all law

415
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,200
Reverse to like a Grand Theft Auto five-star system

416
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,560
Like I can rate like as long as I rate under seven people it'll stay under two stars

417
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,480
You can still like hide in an alleyway for five seconds

418
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,880
That ties into our hatred of cost statute of limitations is like 30 seconds to five minutes depending on the severity of the event

419
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Yes, I completely agree

420
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
Home screen there were like three frames of it

421
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,980
Nintendo

422
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,760
I

423
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,440
Don't have any of you play the original BS. I had one

424
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:56,280
It does home screens better than any other fucking thing because it it takes like three seconds to get

425
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,040
It's just like a button, right? Yeah, just you just think yeah

426
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,960
It's like like you turn on it like the big button is like the game. Yeah, you hit the game and then the game

427
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,600
Yes, I it's the best of both worlds because I like game

428
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,240
I like old systems because you can just turn it on in the games there

429
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,680
The fact that you can just do more with video game

430
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,280
And you can like download games and shit

431
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,400
You know, I don't think I agree. I wish that we didn't need a home screen because like yeah

432
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,240
I currently I need the home screen in order to configure all my shit in order to make say the festival plaza and Pokemon Sun

433
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:39,280
Actually work because I need to like add people's friend codes. I wish we didn't need that. I wish I wish I wish it wasn't

434
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
This way

435
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,080
I just like having app like like various applications on my 3ds

436
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
But I never do anything but the game

437
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:55,880
I do agree that it needs to be downplayed as it was with the DS and it looked very similar to the DS

438
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,400
It's like it was just like like big squares and the first one you're on is like Mario

439
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,720
It's isn't it fucked that the 3ds like you open it up and there's all these like 20 buttons

440
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,360
Yeah, and like one of them is the game and it's like no bigger or more prominent than any of the other

441
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,920
Yeah, it's just what one of the many many helpful functions of your 3ds includes playing a video game. Yes. Yes

442
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,280
I I can really agree. Yeah, and I

443
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,400
Everything I've gone from from the way the hardware looks to the the way the the software you want to come in man

444
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Recording

445
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Bye

446
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,400
Thanks for stopping by I'm rowdy fuckers cop killer

447
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,720
Yeah

448
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,360
Ham boys and boys. All right. Oh, yeah, it looks like home screen. Yeah

449
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,440
Everything looks like it looks very modern. Nintendo doesn't make anything look fucking good

450
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,680
They can't make hardware or home menus look good

451
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:04,480
They just can't but now they can because I'm assuming they have like like like phone app developers to help them

452
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,040
They probably poached a bunch of Apple dudes

453
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah, yeah, and now they're and now they're caught up to the modern world because they're channeling the ghost of Steve Jobs

454
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Who is gay? He's my favorite original character is the ghost of Steve Jobs

455
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,920
My favorite original character is the the skeleton

456
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,400
He doesn't have he only has one skeleton in his closet the man is in a doozy

457
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,960
You haven't even talked about the games yet. No, I'm there's a point

458
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
home screen the home screen

459
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
fucking

460
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,120
The way you is the worst game system ever made it looks like shit

461
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Everything about it is shit and and the game pad itself. It's not the most uncomfortable

462
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,160
Disgusting the heaviest thing. I hate the game the game pad or whatever you call it. Yeah, the game

463
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,920
Like when it's fucking time to play a video game everyone wants to not use that. Yeah. Yeah

464
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,080
No, I don't want to be saddled with this burden. Yeah, it's the worst thing ever, but the switch

465
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,120
Does look good. I think it looks it looks like it looks comfortable

466
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,920
Yeah, well other than the fact that the controllers look like fucking tiny and like little toys and stuff

467
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,040
Maybe I could maybe if I held maybe I could get over there. Maybe it's maybe it wouldn't be as bad

468
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:32,320
Yeah, I think holding it in our hands. We would I think it will be bigger than over than what we're thinking

469
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
I do think it will be small

470
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,840
That's not how they aren't atoms better play. I'm playing the world's smallest video games you guys

471
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,720
This is an audio show. This is an individual show. They wouldn't understand that at all

472
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,880
I'm holding my fingers exactly together and rubbing them. It's like like the world's smallest violin. Yeah. Yeah, okay

473
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,580
Got it. Got it. Okay. Uh made for Japs very small. Oh, we've been over that. Yes, uh Fakie

474
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:03,940
Wada's gay the the presentation about it written in itself the presenters were a real wacky cast

475
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:12,540
I mean my my favorite one has to be the guy who comes up looking like this fucking this like he's like a

476
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,420
late 40s

477
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:20,460
Buzz-Cutted guy in like this kind of like pointy-looking tuxedo with like yeah

478
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,460
We have like a big like silver key

479
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,900
And he's and he shows up he shows up looking like some kind of Kingdom Hearts villain

480
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,260
Says something and then goes away with no consequences

481
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,420
He says like Sega makes video games. Bye. Oh, no

482
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,860
He what stuck out to me about it is that he phrased it in terms of himself

483
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:48,380
Yeah, as a game creator like as an individual creator and I have no idea who yes, was he a Sega guy?

484
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,340
Yeah, yeah, he was second. All right. Well, he's clearly him. He's clearly in nefarious

485
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,540
I was like this is a villain that I'm seeing here

486
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:06,300
This guy's gonna come back in chapter three and he's gonna fuck shit up things gonna be going really good for our main character Mario

487
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,940
Yeah, this guy is just gonna yeah, he's gonna flip the script on it. He's off the wall. Yeah

488
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,940
We're

489
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:19,100
Yeah, rowdy fuckers rowdy fuckers. Well, what was incredibly boring? Huh? No

490
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,780
Okay, um

491
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:29,860
Jesse remember remember that one guy from the presentation who was like dressed in a black tuxedo with a big silver key chain

492
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,900
And he has like he was like a head like squirt of like kind of a mohawk a little bit

493
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,300
He was just some I don't know he was he was just like this evil looking guy

494
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,340
He looked like a second guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He looked like a monster. Yeah. Yes

495
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,740
He looked like a Kingdom Hearts villain. Yeah, that's what I thought

496
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:54,580
And then there was there was the guy the guys like let's switch over to this person and the guy comes in and he's like yeah

497
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,420
Oh, oh, right. Yeah, cuz he's talking. He's had a Travis touchdown. Yeah. Was that was that Suda of

498
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,740
51 oh

499
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,540
He comes out like yeah, oh that didn't go over there

500
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:14,980
But then he ends it with another yeah, which also doesn't go over the dub of that man in particular was the funniest thing

501
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,180
I've ever seen in my entire fucking life. He starts taught. He's like talking in Japanese

502
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,980
And the and the translation translators just like

503
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:32,060
Video games in this in this area. I don't think that translator actually speaks any Japanese

504
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:38,260
I think he just like he had like a made his best guess like a weird like sitcom day where he stumbled into that job

505
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,020
Like fill in for somebody

506
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:46,900
That there is ours got one point where I swear like the guy had been talking a fucking mile a minute

507
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
And then like like I like one minute later

508
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,460
You can like hear him like actually like knock his mic over like oh, oh, yes

509
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,740
video games and

510
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,300
Shit, I mean I could not repeat to you anything

511
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:04,180
He mentioned a Travis touchdown and he likes indie games, I guess yeah, I think we scooped over it

512
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:11,500
Well, when me and Jess were watching it with Victor, however, we went to extensive detail about the weird ice cube Arctic scene

513
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Oh when he's like shaking the ice

514
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,020
Where it's supposed to I don't buy it

515
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,620
Looks really cool. Yeah, even though I can't

516
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,100
Imagine it. Do you know what it was saying? Yeah, but it has like some kind of like haptic feedback thing

517
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,180
Yeah, it has HD rumble capabilities

518
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,060
What yeah, which is like which is like high definition rumble which means like nothing

519
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,040
Well, I think well what it seemed to be suggesting was that like the rumble

520
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,340
Functionality is like it's not it's like it's like it has like

521
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,140
Spatial qualities to it like it occurred like in different places in the remote depending on like

522
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:55,340
What the object is supposed to be which I don't think there's any fucking reason for that

523
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,900
No, I don't mind it. I don't mind it at all. But what the fuck are they good?

524
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,160
Yeah, like what what is the purpose of this like I mean I like I like rumble

525
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:13,260
Yeah, like when when when whenever rumbles happening, it's like an explosion, right? Like something fucking crazy is happening

526
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:18,180
Yeah, and so there's no like there's there's never gonna be a point where an explosion is happening

527
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:25,020
Directly on like like on my left side only well if if they somehow crafted a gameplay

528
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,020
experience that like really made use of like this HD rumble

529
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
I think it could be pretty neat

530
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:40,460
Fucking sick nasty. Yeah, so I'm for it. Also. There was like a rock-paper-scissors section. Oh, yeah

531
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:47,500
Like how the Wiimote like sensor bar thing it recognizes the shape of objects and the examples

532
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,060
They gave were rock-paper-scissors with your hands. Yes, which is pretty neat. Uh, I

533
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,820
Feel like that's far more practical

534
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:59,340
Even though I have no idea what it would be used for I mean, I'll tell you what it's gonna be useful

535
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,540
It's gonna be used so you can do your favorite shadow clone jutsu is in our in Naruto fight

536
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,020
Never mind the best game system. Yeah

537
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,500
And so I can do my various game symbols

538
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,780
Yeah, and not look like in retard except I still will and the game will know I'm a retard when you start up

539
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,700
50 cent blood on the sand to 50 cent

540
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,020
51 cents when you start the official Wu Tang

541
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,140
License video game

542
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,460
Then you will you three you throw up your your chosen gang sign that the game

543
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:36,180
You know hopefully shows you how to make and then your character just like whoosh you become outfitted you become black in real life

544
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,300
It's kind of like Final Fantasy 10 to we're like the dress orbs like change your class

545
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:45,820
You throw up a different gang sign and then you get like new abilities based on what gang you're a part of um, I know

546
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,820
everything about gang culture

547
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:56,540
You look like it Ben you really look like an expert on gang culture. I'm an expert on what the fuck I'm talking about right now

548
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,620
Now let's actually talk about the fucking video games

549
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,100
One-two switch. I just I think did you try it as WarioWare for normies?

550
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:13,220
Yeah, one-two switch is not a video game making it the best video game of all time

551
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,740
You don't look at the screen the whole gimmick is that you look into the other person's eyes

552
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,580
And it's a various set of mini games that you are like you're you're first instructed by the screen and then like

553
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,460
I guess you look into their eyes and then you just sense out when to do button presses. I guess I think it's cool

554
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,420
I think it's cool. I don't think it's fucking gay. Yeah. Well, it's it's not a video game

555
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,460
It is quite. It's kind of it's just it's like a video game icebreaker thing. Yeah

556
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,340
It's for normies is the most normie video game ever produced

557
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:50,100
Yeah, like it's it's just like the game itself is just there to keep score while you and your buddies like you know play charades and like

558
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:56,460
With your dick sound do a sword fight. Yeah, you know do quick quick draw things or whatever and play times with each other

559
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,700
And I'm all and I'm all for it. You know, I just sound very negative just then I think I think it's a okay

560
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,340
I think I would I wouldn't buy it ever, but you know what?

561
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,460
One-two switch the first game

562
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,060
But you can shoot each other

563
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:28,140
Don't you understand you play the game by looking into each other's eyes a note that I have for this is face-to-face actual real life death

564
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,740
The gimmick

565
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:41,540
Okay, now let's move on from the gayest game ever to the gayest game ever punch out shit arms looks cool cool

566
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,280
It's okay. Yes, and it's awesome. You don't think it looks like

567
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,540
Retarded all retarded baby shit

568
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,260
Well, it looks like a really great time

569
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,820
No, I thought it looked really neat and

570
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,860
Notice how when they showed the gameplay of it. They just showed the gameplay

571
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:17,140
They didn't show the guys actually playing with it because they're not gonna look like they're doing stuff

572
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,620
No, you're playing it. You're just gonna go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're just gonna be making little like put

573
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,140
But I'm making very minor gestures with my hands. I don't get it

574
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,940
I don't go where they can't just make video games why they have to make a bunch of bullshit

575
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,620
I will agree the motion controls very severely will probably damage

576
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,780
However, yeah, you know what I like I like the idea like like he like the guy on

577
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,860
Presentation described it as like boxing you have to use you have to you have to punch

578
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,700
But it's like shooting you have to adjust where your opponent will be. I think yeah

579
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,940
I think it's a very good game idea the idea of like

580
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,700
Flicking the thing to punch and then turning to like adjust the trajectory of your punch seems pretty neat

581
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,300
And if it felt good, I think it could be because it's not it's not gonna be like that

582
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:07,260
It's gonna be like like that. Yeah, like like the trailer has these guys actually throwing like full-body punches as though

583
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,940
Like it actually controls where the punch goes, which is not

584
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,220
The truth. Yeah, not the truth

585
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,740
But I still think it was fun

586
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:23,780
Okay, my opinion on that is I know a friend who will buy literally every game that the switch pulls out

587
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,100
And I will try it at his house. And if I think it's cool about myself

588
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,900
I'm going to go in with low expectations because I don't like motion controls a lot, but I'm hopeful for the future

589
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,300
I mean, I think I think it

590
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,980
Very Nintendo has done motion controls good a couple of times and if they did it again

591
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:47,020
But not nearly enough times to justify that they've been doing it for like 11 years. That's true. Yeah. Yeah, that is true

592
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,020
It's time to pack it in

593
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Yes, I

594
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,180
I basically

595
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,860
No, I'm excited for arms. I I already got arms

596
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,580
But they're gay

597
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,300
They aren't springs. They are like they only reach like this far man

598
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,820
I want to punch I want to punch a cute girl who's like way over there

599
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,580
I I think a punchy cute girl is pretty much constantly

600
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:16,060
You want to punch women? You've got to allow yourself to get close to them. You can't be a migtail

601
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,300
You can't be a migtail and still beat women

602
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:25,260
God, who's been great at the greatest conflict. Yeah of interest

603
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,380
Next is Splatoon me and Ben Loew Splatoon. I don't think you even know. Well, I'm sure you know what it is

604
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,380
I mean like in different

605
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,100
Yeah, it's fun man. There's all these different weapons that shoot different amounts of paint at the floor

606
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,300
I will say Splatoon would be the best game ever, but the Wii U is the worst Wii game console

607
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,100
It's so bad. Yeah, like like having to play it with the gamepad is the worst experience a human

608
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,340
Yes, Splatoon. It just felt like a game where nothing I did mattered

609
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,100
It was completely random which team ended up getting the most paint

610
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,100
It was the big cluster clock

611
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,180
Okay, it is true that it can feel like you can be feel like you're winning the whole game

612
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,020
And then you lose at the end and you don't know why

613
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:16,060
Okay, most of my experience with Splatoon comes from the competitive mode. They have yeah, which isn't terth wars

614
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,140
It's like a bunch of objective based game

615
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,940
It's and those game modes are very very fun unique and they do involve like putting like paint on the ground in multiple ways

616
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,260
However, they aren't as

617
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,500
Open like open in the sense that you can just paint anywhere. I don't count this boy's routine

618
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:37,100
It's much more again objective based and you feel far far more important in that mode

619
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,340
Wait, you're talking about like the single player. No, I'm talking about the the competitive mode

620
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,020
The there there's terth wars, which is casual and then there I

621
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,740
You should call it's called ranked mode ranked mode. I mean they have different game game modes in that

622
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:56,540
I don't think I ever played any of those. Okay. That's that's good. Um, they're fun. Yeah, uh single player is also very fun

623
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,980
Well, it's a single player single player campaign was kind of fun

624
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,820
It was felt it felt a little hollow the game is definitely meant to be yes

625
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,420
It's not meant for that. Uh, the final boss was very fucking hype. However, the rest is your favorite campaign

626
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,740
I could not fucking care less the final the final I have not actually played the final boss, but I've seen it

627
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:19,020
It's awesome. It is incredible. Um, he's black. He's on octopus and he's my dad

628
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,220
The um, I I love the inklings

629
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:28,940
Yes, I love the whatever their octopus enemies are called the octolings the octolings and the inklings

630
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:34,620
I love that they're like evil beast children. Yes, that hate and eat one another. Yes, I only live

631
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,740
They only live for battle and urban youth fashion

632
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,740
There's two there's two things that drive them in urban youth fashion and murder

633
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,220
Yes, it's true

634
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,220
And that's why I love it. Um

635
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,980
Uh, I like that you can change your hairstyle in this game. I am gay

636
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:57,100
And as such, I like to dress up my fictional character in many ways. Well, here's the thing

637
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:02,220
Here's the one thing that did fucking kill me about splatoon, which was that there was no local multiplayer

638
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
Well, no, there was local multiplayer

639
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
But it was like shitty and bad

640
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,980
Because it wasn't the actual it wasn't like a turf war

641
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,020
It was like who can like shoot the most balloons or something

642
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,620
It was awful

643
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,860
And I think the reason it was implemented that way is because like the real game has all this

644
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,620
Functionality that requires the Wii U game pad and you're only supposed to have one

645
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,460
So if they can fucking cure that well, they they have because the whole point of this which is you're supposed to have two

646
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,740
Yeah, if you want to play with some of these I guess well, I mean, I guess the point is that there's there's so many different ways to play

647
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,540
That's kind of a shit solution because then that's just being like buy another console

648
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,500
I mean, yeah, I could I could play with my friends by buying two. We use already. Okay. Think about this way

649
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:49,260
If you have a friend who wants to play splatoon, they are going to have a fucking Nintendo switch

650
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,700
I guess

651
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,900
No, what if you want to just bring a friend over really? Hey play this fun game that I have

652
00:43:54,620 --> 00:44:00,780
Uh, you're right. However, I think that's far less likely than the scenario I have presented

653
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,420
Maybe maybe I do agree that it should be

654
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:12,380
Not that they should they should have some game mode where like just you you and a friend just fucking give each other

655
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,980
Your joy cons and just like have a little fucking mini

656
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,540
I think it will be like that

657
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,100
I that's what that's all I wanted was just give me the regular game in miniature to play with the friend

658
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,260
Locally on one concept. I I do believe it will be that however, uh, I think it's

659
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,900
Whatever

660
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,820
yeah, anyway

661
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,860
They they didn't they didn't really explain how exactly the multiplayer modes would work in the new, uh

662
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Platoon, but I

663
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:47,740
They'll probably make it better. Um, I'm sure they will and even if they don't I'm gonna be mainly plain ranked

664
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,300
Yeah, and I will have a blast doing so I will be able to dress up my little boy

665
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:58,940
And he will be my son and hopefully I don't have my dick inside of anymore because the police came to my house that one time

666
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,820
It was it was a fiasco. Hopefully my dick doesn't find his way

667
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,620
And then on that note and then there was some anime shit

668
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,460
Uh

669
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,860
Well before the animation all right all right

670
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,460
Before the anime shit, uh a a a game that we all care about the new mario

671
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,940
Oh

672
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:26,380
Yes, you know very accurate. You know I was I was skeptical when I first saw because like the first thing they show is him in that like

673
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,620
GTA world with like the regular people walking around and I think it looks awesome

674
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,820
I thought it looked bad at first, but like the more I thought about it

675
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,460
Like every level of like yeah every level of the game looks so different

676
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:44,140
You said that when watching the trailer and like I don't know it's it's this is I don't feel like it's meant to

677
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,620
Maybe I was thinking a bit more is like the lore of the mushroom kingdom

678
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,860
We're like I don't I don't think that's what they're going for

679
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:57,500
Well, the as they say in the presentation the whole thing is that mario has left the mushroom kingdom because he's bored and the piece of

680
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,500
Shit is that I'd miss that well the game is called mario odyssey

681
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:07,580
Which brings to mind some kind of like weird wonderlandy like he's just totally in a whole different dimension

682
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:14,300
Yeah, he the whole the whole thing is mario is fucking bored and he wants to just walk around other places

683
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,860
Yeah, you know, I think I thought that like the whole game would be set in like a realistic looking city

684
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,540
Which is not definitely not no that would have been very weird

685
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,420
When tom and them were talking about it the other night

686
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,060
They made it out to seem like some kind of hub world like the sonic 06 kind of thing

687
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,660
That it looks like sonic 06. Just if you look at only that part of the trailer it looks like it's just one world of many

688
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,340
Yes, yeah, I think it would probably be like the first world

689
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,740
However, they're like again, there are like a ton of different fucking worlds. Yeah

690
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
and and they and I want to

691
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:51,100
Iterate that none of them look like fucking the gay shit we've been getting for a while now

692
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:55,740
They don't mean like 3d world and stuff. Yeah, well, yeah, they don't look like grassy plants

693
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,500
They don't look like fucking sky world. They don't look like any of that gay shit. Oh, yeah

694
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,620
There's like there's like pastel polygon world and there's like

695
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:09,340
Forest world there's there's a forest world that specifically has like like a rainy backdrop and like mario was swimming in it

696
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,340
And there's like rays of light coming through down from the trees

697
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,100
And it's like fairly like like a like a moody green and blue color scheme

698
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,620
There's also that one world that I can't describe in any other white way than red squares

699
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:27,100
I don't remember that one like it just kind of looks like there's red squares and trees and it's it's it's odd

700
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,180
A whole lot of rebel pixels. Yes

701
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,820
the the communistic

702
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:38,380
Overlord himself the rest of the rebel pixel. Um, um, um, okay, so I just

703
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,900
You know, I was skeptical at first and I was like, uh realistic world

704
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,380
But the more I think about it the more I'm just like man

705
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:50,780
I actually am really happy that they're just making a new 3d mario and it's been way too long

706
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,860
I don't know why they let it go on this long

707
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,940
But I'll fucking play it. Uh, I

708
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:00,540
Okay, I understand you not wanting like not you you but like you some of you

709
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:05,900
Yeah, uh, not wanting to have mario interact with normally proportion to human beings

710
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,500
However, I think it looks hilarious ridiculous and I love

711
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,140
Yeah, if it's him like

712
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:17,900
You know, yeah, if he's on like some interdimensional odyssey and it's just one of many wacky worlds that's cool. Yeah

713
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,740
It's good. Uh, and and I like the idea of being able to run around a city

714
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,940
Uh, and just fucking jump around because I want I I want to jump around in the city

715
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:33,340
It's funny to because like the whole like open world city game is such like a saturated genre

716
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,740
Now so like to have like fucking mario show up to like a world that looks like that

717
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,820
But like do mario style platforming through it? I don't know if that's like the joke

718
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,900
They were trying to make with it or anything, but it's funny to me think about it. I don't think it's a joke

719
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,980
I think it looks cool

720
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:54,620
And they wanted it. Well, definitely some humor in there and putting mario alongside you. Yes, that is true. Yeah

721
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,260
Yeah, I gear in that and

722
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:04,140
Not just the aesthetics of it the gameplay itself looks very fucking cool because there's a bunch of movement mechanics

723
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:08,220
Yeah, like throwing the hat throwing the hat was the big one that everyone noticed

724
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,620
But there are also many other things such as I saw the cake returning from samurai 64

725
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,540
I saw him rolling down a hill that looked like a whole new move

726
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,460
And uh, there's just a bunch of little shit and in at one point he was

727
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:29,180
Riding a fucking lion a lion and also he uh, what he was picking up something that like like a bladed oddish

728
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,820
Not an odd

729
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:37,180
Radish radish. I don't know if that will just be that but I hope it's like a mario 2 thing. Um

730
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:45,580
Not really relevant to anything, but I'll be pretty excited to hear matthew matosis review it when it comes out. That should be fun

731
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,820
Uh, what I really love the mario games

732
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,340
Because like I I like to just move around and it comes from a comfortable environment

733
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,740
Yeah, I like the what's the gay word that you do use kinesthetics

734
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,220
Well, he doesn't make that up. But yeah, well, yeah that he would he is he would use it

735
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,340
Yeah, that's what I because it's the word to describe it

736
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,540
That's gay. Yeah, it's gay

737
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,580
Uh

738
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:18,460
Yes, I like that and I like the idea of being able to maneuver in various different ways because in in in fucking galaxy

739
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,340
And shit, you just you just move and you jump you have like you have less movement options

740
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,420
Yeah, and that's why I love sunshine so much because the the flood adds so many layers of complexity

741
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,500
Yeah, it's the best working game ever made. Yeah. Hmm. Um

742
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:38,460
It's uh incredible, uh, and I'm coming and mario looks good, which is something I'd never thought I'd ever say

743
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,660
Yes, well, you know, uh semen is clogging my entire brain cell

744
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,980
Well, yeah, I mean new mario new 3d mario. It's pretty good. I want to play it. Yeah, what what more can you say?

745
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,500
Um, I'll no no moving on moving on. Uh, there was a bunch of fucking anime shit

746
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,660
Uh

747
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,660
Xenoblade whatever

748
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:09,260
Shin Megami Tensei like dude like anime like what the fuck even is a shin megami tensei

749
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:17,660
Some kind of some kind of some kind of you know creature every year. There's like 17 new shin megami Tensei games even though

750
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,060
People only care about persona. Yeah, I don't know why they even bother with the rest of this

751
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,140
I don't

752
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,340
You know the only thing that I like like the only thing that I know about

753
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,060
Jumagami Hidze that seems even remotely cool is if you kick someone's ass hard enough

754
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,060
They will ask you like a strange riddle and if you solve their retarded

755
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,580
They will join you. Yeah, it's like persona three and four are both great games

756
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:50,060
But there's 50 shin megami games and the rest of them are all hot trash. Yeah, no one do care about

757
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,100
Uh, another note

758
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,100
They got the animeist thing. Yeah, that shit brings all the boys to the yard

759
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,620
Uh, uh, that sucks and that everyone loves

760
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,980
80 games and development. That's a lot of shit. We have games. I promise this is indeed not the Wii U

761
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,140
Please trust me. We have video games

762
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,020
Yeah, remember when when when I remember when reggie fill me was like boy

763
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,220
It's the games that are important and boy what games and I was like, you're right reggie. What games?

764
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,700
What name even one?

765
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,620
Reggie looks like

766
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,540
No, I mean like toad creature. He's so rich

767
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,980
Okay, do you just see it looking at him? He's not rich like wealthy. He's rich like chocolate. Yeah. Yeah

768
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,700
Like he's just he's just dark and like if you like take a look at him

769
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,500
You just need a glass of milk to just wash him. You gotta wash him down. Yeah, I need to dilute him with something

770
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:47,100
He looks like fucking like like lord slug like a big fat Namek

771
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:54,220
Who found his way to earth and is just shitting up the place. He is literally a goblin. He is definitely a goblin

772
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,180
I think he's a hobgoblin

773
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
He's totally a hobgoblin

774
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:07,420
If you could add some kind of an even a third ob to that hobgoblin word like a slob hobgoblin

775
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:14,380
Awful he's a church really. He's a fucking gobb sloblin gobb sloblin

776
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:20,940
He's an everlasting slob gobbster and and then and and then and then you know

777
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:26,460
Shigeru Miyamoto's there looking like a special needs child playing playing nintendo games

778
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:32,780
Which he almost certainly is a special needs child looking like a soccer mom who had a stroke in 2005

779
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,580
And never fully recovered

780
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,820
And then and then and then some other guy pokes around pokes around

781
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:46,140
Yeah, he was totally hiding hiding behind hiding behind a bush as all japanese people are known to do

782
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,420
He jumps out and he's like oh reggie. I'm glad you're right to play a video game

783
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,020
Miyamoto looks like he's aging like benjamin button

784
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,940
But also like a normal person at the same time

785
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:06,860
He's shrinking and getting smaller and his his cheeks are getting chubbier, but the wrinkles just keep getting deeper and deeper

786
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,060
Oh

787
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,060
Truly unfortunate for all parties

788
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,220
Yes, truly a great source of shame for japan

789
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,660
They gotta hide that boy

790
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,580
They have to hide him away

791
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:26,540
They have to lock him away where he can't get out before he turns back into a side goat

792
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:33,900
A disgusting wrinkly sperm floating in a jar before before he regresses to the star child from uh,

793
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,460
Odyssey space odyssey 2001

794
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,300
Oh my god

795
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,300
Floating in a giant like egg

796
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,540
Mm-hmm

797
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:48,700
A game that is undeniably anime though. I was interested in the fact that it looked fucking weird

798
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,420
project octopus

799
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,420
Wait, was that a game?

800
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,060
Yeah, I thought that was like the subtitle for the new fire emblem or something. No, no

801
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,700
Octopath octopodio

802
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:06,860
Starship excel saga project octo mom. You play as octo mom. You beat up all of your kids

803
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,660
No

804
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:17,100
He's gay. Anyway, uh, the game is like it's like final fantasy. It has like pixel pixel graphics

805
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:24,140
However, it's like it's like 3d, but the prick the the pixels not the pixels the pixels are like

806
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,780
They're still like flat

807
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,700
they're like they're like

808
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,700
Like it's like it's like paper mario

809
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,180
What what do you what?

810
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,780
Uh, wait, I I have to pee really bad. Okay. Let's take a break

811
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,460
Okay, okay. I'm back for peeing. Uh, it was like octopath missionary

812
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:51,980
Uh, yes, that sounds right. Uh, it was like if you were playing with magnets like picks like pixel art magnets

813
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,180
Like in a paper mario s world

814
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:03,100
That oh, oh, yeah, it looked like it looked like jrpg. It had like jrpg pixel. I remember that and I didn't know what it was

815
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,940
Weird, I thought it was just like some retro like concept art for the new for the new fire emblem or something

816
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,740
No, it was not even the same game at all

817
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:17,900
Like they all that that anime segment of the whole game of the presentation was just all jumbled together

818
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,900
Uh, uh another anime that we hate uh skyrim

819
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,140
Uh, everyone was joking about how it was in the the original trailer

820
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:30,140
But it wasn't actually officially announced for the switch and everyone's gonna think

821
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,020
Everyone said it was just not going to be there. Yeah

822
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:40,300
Which would have been hilarious. It would have been very high room on there. But but Todd Howard the literal liar himself gets up on stage

823
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,100
In in in the in his aztec temple. He has built into his house

824
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:50,460
And he says that yes skyrim is coming and uh, fuck. Yeah, bro

825
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:56,220
But what I want to know is why anyone likes skyrim or or is pretending to like skyrim

826
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,500
Um, search me man. I don't play Bethesda games

827
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:04,780
Yeah, uh Bethesda is uh, awful and um

828
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,160
Todd Howard can suck my weenie

829
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,580
Uh, yeah, I don't I don't know. I just yeah

830
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:15,980
I know I said before that I like to get immersed and like have like a narrative

831
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,420
Which you would think I would love games like skyrim, but like I don't know

832
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:24,860
They're so big and overblown and like and I'm not they look so fucking bad

833
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:32,060
I I'm I'm not looking I'm not looking to be impressed with the scale of a game. Yeah, you know, I don't care about that. So I don't

834
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,620
Like yeah, like like the idea that a game is like a hundred hours long

835
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:43,820
And like the map is a million fucking miles wide. It's just kind of exhausting more than like exciting for me. Yeah, uh death

836
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:51,580
Uh skyrim looks bad and I've only heard bad things about I hear it's boring. I hear it's dull. Well, I have no reason why I want to play

837
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,660
I I only hear criticism of it

838
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:58,060
But it's criticism that makes me think that it's probably an overall solid game for what it is

839
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:02,380
But it's just got like does lots of little shit wrong that really pisses fans off. Yeah

840
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:10,620
Um, uh either way would never fucking buy it. It's a pc game. I could literally just bar it legally

841
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,100
Was that's like censored? Yes. Yeah, okay

842
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,380
I could yeah, I would never buy this game. I could literally just bar it

843
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,820
I see I see yes

844
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:29,020
Um, uh, then we got to the the crazy no more heroes guy. It was a stumbling mumbling joke

845
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:35,740
Stumbling mumbling fool that's sudo 51. I can't believe that was sudo 51. Is that true? Yes. Is that really okay? Okay

846
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:41,420
Um, I have never played a no more heroes game, but due to there's only there's only one isn't there? There's two, okay

847
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:49,180
Um, it it looks like something I would love and that picture of travis that was like on like the screen was so fucking hot

848
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,340
I'm i'm gay now. I am gay

849
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:55,020
What did his shirt say it was something like travis touched out of strikes bad

850
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:01,180
All right, um, but his face was so charismatic. It's so Japanese. I like I like that

851
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,900
No more heroes exist. I think I played a little bit of the first one was like, that's fine

852
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:13,420
Um, I it looks cool. I like seeing it around. Yeah, I don't feel the need to play it myself necessarily

853
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,140
Want to play

854
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:24,220
Maybe if I were paid to play that game, I'm definitely I mean I I do respect sudo 51's like weird outsider

855
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:29,980
Like auteur fucking game making ethos. I think it's great that he's around. Yes

856
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,620
Yeah, it's pretty sweet. Then after after I was turned gay live. Yeah

857
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:41,660
Uh fucking ea came out to talk about how like they like nintendo and they are going to make fifa

858
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,460
Yeah, wait, I totally

859
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:49,180
Do not even remember that happening. Yeah, I don't recall. Oh, wait. I do remember

860
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,860
I do remember the migtao soccer players appearing very briefly in the like the final trailer. Yes

861
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,500
Uh, he was the guy who had bill trin and narrating

862
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:06,620
The giant he was the the giant he was the giant from uh twin peaks. Yes with that guy

863
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,020
He's happening again

864
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,420
it uh

865
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,420
Literally, no, I don't think I've ever heard anyone say anything cause about ea

866
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:30,540
It's like searching through the library of his mind trying to come up with one thing to repeat that trying to remember what a video game

867
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,700
Is

868
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:38,380
Yeah, yeah, they're evil probably. No, no, do they make do they make any good games that aren't gay? Well, yeah, no

869
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,700
I'm not saying they're evil. I'm just saying they're just they're just gay. Do they no, but serious question

870
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,700
Do they make any good games? No, okay

871
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,140
They make sports games and they make just general gay games like what give me an example

872
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,420
I think they do like some sort of call duty stuff. Um

873
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,220
Okay, so

874
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:01,260
Modern gaming they're modern gaming for some part. All right, uh, then I have a bullpoint that says no games

875
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,260
No games

876
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,660
Yeah, there weren't enough games for sure and the games that there were were a lot of anime bullshits

877
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:12,700
Okay, okay, he there are four games in my opinion coming out for the nintendo switch

878
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,660
Uh, so far I announce. Yeah, uh, two of them

879
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,980
switch one or one two switch looks um

880
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:26,300
Like a look like I'm not on my raid system that ranges from a negative three to a positive three

881
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:32,380
It is a positive one. Yeah, and then arms looks like a positive two. Well, you know what?

882
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,060
Okay, I hope we were saying this as you're watching it

883
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,660
It would be really cool if arms had like a competitive scene. Yes

884
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:43,340
Like like and and corollary to that like for that to happen

885
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,460
It would need to have like there would need to be real depth to the gameplay

886
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:52,860
Like probably there would need to be lots of like builds you could make like customize your characters to behave in different ways and then like

887
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:58,940
You know strategize beyond beyond just the moment to moment dodging punches. Yeah, and just have general

888
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,700
complexity in in the in the combat itself. I mean they they

889
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:09,580
And they introduced the game with by saying like it's a game with lots of depth and complexity and replayability

890
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,780
Which I hope is true. Uh, if that were if that were true, it looks fucking fun

891
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,060
But like the game we actually saw in the trailer there wasn't much there. We didn't see it do very much

892
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:22,860
I heard from a little birdie. I didn't actually watch the nintendo tree house presentation

893
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,860
Which is where they show the old games and death

894
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:30,140
I heard a little birdie telling me that in the tree house presentation where the plane arms

895
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,260
One of the person one of the commentators is talking about

896
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:41,420
Frame inputs and how to save frames and maximize your your min maxing your your inputs like a like a real fighting game

897
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,380
That's pretty cool. It is fucking pretty cool

898
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:49,900
And it makes me think that they actually like care about this game. It's not going to be a shitty it

899
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,140
I like it. I hope I hope that's true. I hope that's true

900
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:59,020
Even though that kind of excludes me because i'm not going to get so fucking good at arms

901
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,700
And i'm going to be worrying about saving the frames, but I still like it

902
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,460
Yeah, uh, I now that jess is out of the room and i'm not scared to death. I

903
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,100
To a three

904
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,700
Thank god

905
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:15,900
Uh and and and fucking splatoon and mario they look incredible. They look like they will be the best game ever made

906
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:22,220
Um, if if splatoon is if splatoon is any better than original splatoon, it will be the best game ever made

907
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:27,980
And I won't accept any future games as valin. I just can't wait for new spot this

908
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,900
I never actually did any splat because I didn't I didn't have a Wii U

909
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,860
I just played it at my like friend's house when I was visiting in the future

910
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,060
If you get a switch, we will become the splatoon boys

911
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:43,740
Oh god, can I oh god? I would love that so much. But can I can I is there a place for

912
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,100
I want to make one

913
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:51,820
I want to make I want to make room for no I want to make room for it in my heart is what i'm saying

914
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,180
Yeah, and in my bed pokemon is out the door besides

915
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:01,020
Well, well that that's completely inaccurate because there's a pokemon game coming out for the switch. Oh, no

916
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,980
Wait, why didn't they show that?

917
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,060
Uh, because it it's like all

918
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,420
Even though like everyone who cares knows

919
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:15,740
Well, like apparently I don't care because I didn't know until you told me, uh, it you know how like there's platinum for diamond pearl

920
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:19,980
Yeah, yeah, the sun the moon is going to have a platinum on the switch. What's it called? Is it called eclipse?

921
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,620
It's called the codename of stars. I hope it's called eclipse. Okay, the codename of stars

922
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,860
Fair enough

923
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,540
Not not happy about it. You're gonna be able to walk with your pokemon. I think pokemon is

924
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:37,260
I hope that's true because the walking pokemon and harkol's soul silver is actually the best thing that ever happened

925
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,660
There's even more reason for it now

926
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,900
Because before you couldn't really do that much with the pokemon. Like it was it was fucking sick

927
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,500
Yeah, but there's not a lot you can do now think about fucking this

928
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:54,140
You're walking with your pokemon you turn around you press a you immediately go into the pokemon uh of me pokemon refresh

929
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:55,500
Oh

930
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,020
Cool. Yeah, turn around talk to them and you pet them and give them the pain. Yeah. Yeah

931
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:04,860
Just a little thing just the little things nintendo. Just give us these little things and then you promote them to uh

932
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,500
Potlitenit and then they and then they die. Yeah, that's right

933
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:13,420
Because I didn't fucking switch out to water. You fucking return because I'm an idiot. Yeah, that's correct. Um

934
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,300
Uh, there's also a curbie game coming. I'm fairly certain

935
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,140
I would hope so. Yeah, I would really hope so god

936
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,220
Every time a new curbie game comes out. I say the same fucking thing

937
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:32,380
But let me say it again. Please bring back powers and power combining from yes from curbie 64

938
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:39,580
Yes, please that would be fucking sick. That would make the switch the best console. Yeah, uh power combines before is

939
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,900
It's so good

940
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:45,180
And there's no reason they couldn't continue to do it forever

941
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:49,420
I I know why because curbie game there there are two eras of curbie games

942
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,940
There's the adventure era and these then there's the superstar era

943
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,980
Adventure era

944
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:01,020
Operate the abilities in that operate. There are a lot more abilities

945
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:06,540
However, that all the abilities have like one use they all have one move that you can execute

946
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:10,700
And a superstar there. Well, I shouldn't say that way more, but there's the same amount of abilities

947
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,540
But each ability

948
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:18,940
Uh is it has an entire move set dedicated to it. Yeah, which was amazing. Yeah, and the best and uh

949
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,420
Two more operates on an adventure

950
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:26,060
Uh style ability. So each thing only does one thing. Yeah. Yeah, you know what?

951
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,300
You know what? Yeah, I think I would if I had to have one or the other

952
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,500
Maybe I would like the the complex abilities that have like whole move sets

953
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,300
But why can't it be both? Yeah? Yeah

954
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:43,660
All the things that nintendo doesn't do yeah when they're fucking nintendo and they could do anything

955
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,820
Yeah, they could do literally

956
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,820
I

957
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:53,180
Hope I hope they do do that that would be crime at least even if it's not that at least

958
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:59,140
Not I don't have anything against like epic yarn and stuff like it is what it is and that's fine

959
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:04,300
But why have there not been new Kirby games that have the power system and like new powers and stuff

960
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,820
Like why don't why have they not made more Kirby games that are about the powers?

961
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,820
I

962
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:15,460
Agree, yeah, I mean like I love that. I mean the problem is is the Kirby games don't come out that often

963
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,420
And that's the problem right there. Yeah, and and

964
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:23,860
Like whenever there's a new like mainland Kirby like like they're two Kirby games

965
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:27,860
They're there are the side games that are experimental weird and have nothing to do with anything

966
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:31,020
Kirby related and they're awesome. Yeah, they're always like air ride

967
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:35,180
Yeah, like air ride like canvas curse shit like math attack. Yeah

968
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:40,740
I shouldn't do that shit cool shit like math attack. Yeah, I haven't actually played any of those games, but

969
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,620
Yeah, I hear air ride is really good. I heard math attack

970
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:49,220
It looks really the math math attack is good

971
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:54,660
Like like the gameplay itself is good, but there's like there's like really like a ton of mini games

972
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:02,860
And like a lot of the Kirby anime characters come up really. Yeah, it's it's odd. It's very odd

973
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:06,900
It's good. No, I like it. I do like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right

974
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,460
And there's the mainland Kirby games. What? Oh, sorry. Just do you do we know what the Kirby game for the switch?

975
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,980
No, right? Well, I don't think it's even confirmed. I just know that howl is working

976
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,420
Okay, and howl doesn't fucking do this. Don't they do Pokemon?

977
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:29,700
It's your scheme. That's right. Well, why did I think there was a no, all right? I'm stupid

978
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:33,340
Anyway, mainly Kirby games are like shit like super star like a vision

979
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,060
And those ones always introduce at least one new

980
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:42,180
And shit like robo bot introduced like the mech system

981
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,580
The mech system in Kirby. Yeah, the fuck is Kirby robo bot?

982
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:51,980
Planet robo bot Kirby has a mech. It literally looks exactly like like like

983
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,940
Gurren

984
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:58,980
What? Oh, no, no, look on. Sorry. It looks exactly like we're gone the big one or the head

985
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,140
Okay, um, what game are we talking about?

986
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,220
Kirby planet robo bot. That's what?

987
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:10,420
What? It came out like two like a year ago. I've never heard of it

988
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:18,260
I've not heard of Kirby planet robo. I swear to God. This is the first time and you're making it up. No, no

989
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:26,580
It looks awesome. Yeah, I mean it is awesome. It is awesome. Anyway

990
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:32,100
What the fuck are we talking about you? I don't know Kirby and just we went on a Kirby

991
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:39,620
The point is Kirby's awesome. Please come to the switch. I love you. Yeah, I can get behind that

992
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:45,020
What games do you want to see like we're over the presentation fucking it was good

993
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:49,700
Yeah, wait, is there with or any like? Oh, well, um Zelda, which I don't really oh my god

994
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:53,140
I forgot about Zelda. I have notes for that. I don't really play Zelda

995
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,940
But if I had a switch would I

996
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:59,140
Honestly, no because it's kind of like Skyrim. Yes

997
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,260
It kind of has the same reasons I wouldn't play it as I wouldn't play a game like Skyrim

998
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:05,780
Even I don't the cutscenes looked really cool like the art style looks great

999
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:12,500
Um, I don't know. Yeah, it looks it looks neat. Uh, my note says hark zelda. It has locations

1000
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:17,780
It has uh goblins and uh, yes, and there was a man with a shark for a head. Yes

1001
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:24,660
Uh as someone who hates zelda that trailer looks fucking sick and I kind of want to play. Yeah

1002
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:30,820
It did look pretty cool. Yeah, I don't I don't know if I would actually do it unless I'm less like multiple people

1003
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:37,140
Independently told me like then you have to play the new zelda. It would surprise you in ways you cannot imagine

1004
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,460
And then I'd be like, well

1005
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,140
Fuck you. Fuck maybe maybe I guess we can't move my cold bitter heart

1006
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,940
No, only only under

1007
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:54,500
Oh man, kid. Did you did you see all the sweet undertails? They're releasing on another nintendo switch

1008
01:10:54,980 --> 01:11:02,820
There's zelda undertale curbie undertale mario undertale pokémon undertale pokemon undertale platoon undertale

1009
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,140
And finally earthbound

1010
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,220
Not never the best under tail never never in the world

1011
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,500
Never what what if they release a new earthbound game?

1012
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,100
Um, it will be shit because he toy has specifically stated

1013
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:21,940
He does not want to do another earthbound and in fact they would give another guy and that new guy would be awful

1014
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:28,260
Yeah, okay. I didn't think about that. That's too bad. All right, never mind then our earthbound doesn't need to be made again

1015
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,260
They just need to release mother three

1016
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,580
Wait, they already released mother three

1017
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:39,140
No, is it only like fan translated? Yeah, what? Yeah, what they still haven't released mother three. No

1018
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,620
Not even like the virtual console. No, what the fuck? Yeah, why?

1019
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:48,980
Why just like like a year and a half ago they released the first mother

1020
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:54,660
And not mother three. Yeah, and the thing about mother one is that it had been fully translated

1021
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,380
Officially by nintendo

1022
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:03,940
Since it since it was made like in 1998 or 1989 or something. So like it had already been released

1023
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,780
Yeah previously and they re-released it. Yeah, they didn't release mother three

1024
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:14,740
Well, like it like basically the idea like it was fully translated and then they just would put it up on a shelf somewhere

1025
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,740
And they're like, oh, we'll release that someday

1026
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,220
Oh, and they just finally got around to it. Yeah. Yeah

1027
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,940
ridiculous

1028
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:25,300
How fucking long does it take to translate a game from japanese?

1029
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:31,540
Well, I don't think very long since the fan translation did it in like a year. Yeah. Yeah, this is nintendo

1030
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:36,980
But this is nintendo we're talking about that can't be fucking bothered to model walk cycles for i don't know

1031
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:40,340
20 pokemon. Yeah 30 pokemon. Yeah, you know

1032
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:52,260
Ridiculous, uh off criminal literally criminal. Yeah, I the police are en route to japan

1033
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:56,020
I've called interpol

1034
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:02,660
They're going to arrest arrest uh miyamoto and the and the ghost of satori wewata. They're gonna send ghost busters over there

1035
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,340
And sakura con

1036
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:08,500
So send them to sakura con to stop all the video games

1037
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:11,140
The source of all evil sakura con

1038
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,340
I mean, there's got to be some mastermind behind it

1039
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:20,100
Uh, you know how like in fiction like industry is often portrayed as like this big like uh

1040
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:25,380
Cloud of black smoke with like giant pipes like lean out the smoke and like there's a bunch of work is being whipped

1041
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,540
That's what I meant to sakura con is

1042
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,660
It's not even it's just

1043
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,220
It's not even related in a fiction anyway

1044
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,260
But still but still

1045
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:45,380
I think all these shit games somebody's making them

1046
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:48,020
It has to be that

1047
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,500
Who else could be so evil

1048
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,860
As as as john sakura con the ceo sakura con

1049
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:01,380
As he famously said I will I will poison video games

1050
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:09,300
No, none of that. I will continue to make video games. I will continue to make video games. He said twirling

1051
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,380
And gnashing his teeth his filed down

1052
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:20,980
It is most who is the most heinous prediction video games will get more realistic

1053
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,700
And real life will become more like

1054
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:27,060
Until you can't fucking tell what's happening

1055
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,860
um

1056
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,820
Then until the switch coming out in two months

1057
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:39,620
Do you have any other games that you'd like to see on the switch? Uh, yes. Let me think I

1058
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:45,780
I I'm very interested in a new shadow pokemon game. Did you play it? Oh my gala of darkness?

1059
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,500
I have not played any of those. Okay. First of all

1060
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:55,940
They're great games in and of themselves, but you specifically would fucking adore those games. You think so?

1061
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:00,020
First of all, they're super fucking edgy. They seem like edgy

1062
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:07,140
Versions. Yeah. Okay. Do they do they have like pokemon battles and like actual normal? Yeah. Yes

1063
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,780
Then why don't then why aren't then why don't?

1064
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:16,740
Okay, what separates a shadow game from a mainline game? Okay, uh, it's much more like an rpg

1065
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:21,940
This is that there aren't like gyms like it's it's a it's a much more involving story

1066
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:27,460
Like like you use pokemon and like there is a story about pokemon

1067
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:32,420
There is there is I have never even considered playing one. Yeah, but

1068
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:38,980
Okay, maybe I was wrong. Okay, uh like like uh in pokemon. There is no story

1069
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:44,180
And if there is a story, it's bad besides seven minutes and then there's a good story. Yeah, uh,

1070
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:48,020
But xD gala of darkness has like an interesting plot

1071
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:54,260
Like and it it basically has a narrative which is something that pokemon games lack completely

1072
01:15:54,820 --> 01:16:00,180
But is it is it missing any of the things that make a mainline pokemon game? Um,

1073
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:05,140
It is missing extraneous details such as like gyms

1074
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:06,660
fine

1075
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,660
Yes, uh

1076
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,140
Like there is no like root system

1077
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,420
Like like the the way battle's working that is

1078
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:19,700
Well, like like if the story needs you to go to a town your character will get on a spike and he will go to that town

1079
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:24,820
And then you will like like the towns are fucking huge and there's a ton of shit to do in each town

1080
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:29,140
Uh, and you can battle people in that town and you have to take down like in the evil corporation

1081
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,900
Do you catch pokemon?

1082
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:36,420
Uh, you can catch pokemon like you can catch normal wild pokemon. Yeah, however

1083
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,300
Uh, it it's not like you don't walk in it. It's

1084
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:43,220
fairly convoluted at least compared to walking into all grass

1085
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:48,980
You you have to there there are specific. I think they're called poke. I think they're actually called poke spots

1086
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:52,660
Poke stops poke spots. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay

1087
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:57,300
And you have to get like I think it's like cheese or something and lay them out for the pokemon

1088
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:01,540
Really and then like come back 20 minutes later, and they'll be like a wild like aggro on there

1089
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,500
What? Yes

1090
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,020
Okay, but that's not how you get pokemon the game the point of the game. How do you get pokemon?

1091
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:14,180
Oh, you don't even know that. I don't know anything. It's it's okay. Okay. It's fucking sick. You're gonna love this

1092
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:19,060
Okay, all right at the beginning at the beginning of xc gale of darkness. I know like this like that's on the game

1093
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:24,020
Yeah, yeah, and so it's called him. Colosseum is the first game in series. Wait, colosseum is a shadow game

1094
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:30,020
Yeah, does it have like a plot? Yeah, it like what? Yes. I thought it was just like a battler. No

1095
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,580
Oh

1096
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:37,620
Uh, but pretty much colosseum is like a like like a like colosseum

1097
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:43,460
Like xc gale of darkness is an erect sequel like it has the same town, but it's like the same plot weird. Yeah

1098
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:45,620
Does it have its own region?

1099
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:51,700
No, well regions isn't it? It's oh, I mean, I don't know. I mean like like both of the games have their own

1100
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:57,860
Like yeah, yeah, but but the both take the same thing. I get it. What what land are they in the or region?

1101
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,340
Or are re yeah, okay

1102
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,820
Uh, it's fucking cool

1103
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:08,420
You catch hope like them your main method of catching pokemon is at the beginning of xc gale of darkness

1104
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:10,420
You're given a snag machine

1105
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:14,740
And you this is like like an arm like grip like like fucking like like dog

1106
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,780
Like like dr. Claw like arm. Okay

1107
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:24,420
And they're at the game. They're like like this this team called human. It's like team cypher. I'm pretty sure

1108
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:30,180
Uh, just has made a bunch of shadow pokemon because shadow pokemon are just like the evil versions of ragan

1109
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:37,700
Well, not even evil. They're more like like they like they injected depression and fucking crazy shit into pokemon

1110
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:40,500
And now pokemon are just fucking

1111
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:45,940
Flailing around and they're just they just can't even function like monsters. Yeah, they're monsters and they're in pain

1112
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,740
Constantly, yeah, holy shit

1113
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:54,100
And like like whenever like like I can't even like describe how cool is when you see a shadow pokemon

1114
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,340
Because like someone throws out a pokemon

1115
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:00,500
And then you get to see like the little animation play and he's like wait, oh man

1116
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:02,980
I really want to have that book like that one looks pretty cool

1117
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:09,620
And then like like like like I came like I'm gonna do like a visual joke for this like you're okay

1118
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:13,380
Like like he throws out the pokemon like someone throws out pokemon and then your kid reaches this

1119
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,380
Like a shock. Yeah. Yeah. He's like what?

1120
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:20,980
And then like like his glasses like like lights up

1121
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:26,500
He's like robot glasses and they light up and like fucking like like like shadow fire bursts out of the pokemon

1122
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:32,980
Like it like it's fucking exploding my eyes are wide with with passion and terror and and and it says a

1123
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:37,220
Shia like like that pokemon is a shadow pokemon in all caps

1124
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:41,940
And and you know what you fucking do? What do you do? This is a trainer battle

1125
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:46,900
Yeah, you whittle that pokemon down and you snag that trainers pokemon with your like mecca arms

1126
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:50,980
And and and for every pokeball and like it has ultra balls and stuff

1127
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:55,860
But the thing that makes this different is that whenever you throw it like and you know when the pokemon

1128
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:59,700
Little when the pokeball opens. Yeah, a hand comes out and it grabs the pokemon

1129
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:04,020
And it drags it fucking in and you know what you do with that shadow pokemon

1130
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:08,660
Shadow pokemon like like are fucking like shit the shadow pokemon like our shit

1131
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:13,300
They have their own like type and shit. Okay, and they only use like shadow moves

1132
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,940
Yeah, and you you have you have to you have to get it to a high friendship

1133
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,980
And then you go to like this like this like like

1134
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,540
mossy cobble area in the second town

1135
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:29,620
And it's like you have to do like a fucking like like up up here like jesus like baptism with your pokemon

1136
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,140
Did like purify them? Yeah. Yeah, you purify you like like it's something like

1137
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:36,180
Like your bedouf opens his heart to you

1138
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:43,700
Yes, exactly. I know my shadow bedouf. Yes, exactly. That's exactly what it's fucking like

1139
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:47,540
Oh, wow, and and you are now best friends with your bedouf

1140
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:52,900
And by the way for I know I know bedouf is june 4. I just I just came to mind first

1141
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:58,100
I don't know why I I just I assume that the shadow that like the shadow pokemon games were like

1142
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,140
Like the pokemon card game video game. No

1143
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:05,700
No, not at all. Huh, they are just normal pokemon badminton

1144
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:08,740
And like you catch with balls and stuff. Yeah

1145
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:12,100
Can you nuzlocke one? Yes, you can oh my god

1146
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:16,180
I mean you would have to like change the nunchuck rules because like

1147
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:23,140
It seems like catching is limited or like yes different or yes, like happens at set story points or something. Yeah, well

1148
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:29,620
Yes, uh, so you would either have to make it so like you just keep the same nunchuck rules

1149
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:33,220
Like you can you can only just catch the first book money see in each town. Yeah

1150
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:39,540
Uh, or you can keep it so you can only catch wild like like legitimate wild pokemon

1151
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:45,220
Or it's just you catch whatever you want or like is random each time you have to look it up

1152
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:51,460
But it is feasibly to be my nuzlocke and the nuzlocke's of that game are very intense due to like like

1153
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:56,660
Like he's shadow pokemon are hard to catch first of all and also the game is just like

1154
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:02,100
Like shadow pokemon you have to really fucking grind it out with them and make sure they love you

1155
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,660
Like you you form like a way deep bomb

1156
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:10,180
Because because you you have to make sure every pokemon loves you or you can't open up their heart

1157
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:14,260
So but you can use them as their shadow. Yes. Yes

1158
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,540
Wow. Yeah. Well, um

1159
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:19,220
All right

1160
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:24,260
I didn't know any of this and now I hope that one does come out in the switch and maybe I'll play

1161
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:28,980
Uh a character who is literally you is named mirror b

1162
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,380
and he is

1163
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:37,060
A very tall man very skinny who has a disco outfit and a giant afro that looks like a pokeball

1164
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:42,420
And I've seen him. He has a team of six pokemon. All of them are ludicola

1165
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,780
And and and all they want to do is dance

1166
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:52,020
Why don't people talk about these games more because people are

1167
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,620
Literally stupid

1168
01:22:53,620 --> 01:23:01,060
But do you know how many times I've heard like there's never been a real pokemon game on a console on a home home home console before

1169
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:08,180
I'm gay people people just are just like don't view them as legit because they're like not handheld or whatever

1170
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:15,140
Yeah, they're not handheld and dude. There's no like gyms dude. Like seriously. There's no gyms in alola. What what yeah? Yeah

1171
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:19,780
Yeah, what now I I swear they are literally just like pokemon games. There's pokemon marty

1172
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:24,580
You have to stop an evil organization. Like it's just a fucking pokemon game. Okay. I'm interested

1173
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:31,540
But in 3d and awesome and sold man. I'm sold now the characters design in that game the character designs are also fucking

1174
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,940
crazy

1175
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:41,220
And it has so much pathos. It is the most autistic game. You know, I love pathos. That's my favorite thing in art

1176
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,500
The the midget you fight at the end is is the best person

1177
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,700
Um and you have to play

1178
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:51,620
I think I should probably play gale of darkness. It's uh

1179
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:54,420
I I mean, okay. Both of them are great

1180
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,900
Colosseum is very fun

1181
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:04,020
And like you'll you'll get all the backstory of because it like it is actually pretty integral to xc gale of darkness

1182
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,420
Like story wise. Yeah, but gale of darkness is a sequel. Yes. Yeah

1183
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:12,980
But but I would say xc gale of darkness is the much funner game and much much

1184
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:19,780
So shadow march lights. No, you can't catch unfortunately. You have no idea how much I cry when I found out you couldn't catch much likes

1185
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,220
I thought you said he was in that game

1186
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,380
He's just looking at pc

1187
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:30,420
Uh, what what happens is, uh, like sometimes when you put down cheese and the focus box

1188
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:35,780
Catch them with cheese. Yeah, and and and when like sometimes they'll come back and much likes will be there

1189
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:42,020
And he'll have eaten like like normally you have like like like like a full like block of cheese slash 20 per hours

1190
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:46,900
Yeah, yeah, but they'll just have just eaten. Yeah. Yeah. Is he like tubs in neko at suma? Yeah. Yeah, basically

1191
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:47,940
Yeah

1192
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:54,580
And and then his his his trainer this like like really sweet old woman will come be like you mother fucker

1193
01:24:55,140 --> 01:25:02,340
You bitch what to the to the munchlax. Yeah, like come back here. I'm sorry for this. I'll give you a revival of her or whatever

1194
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:06,180
Um, I'm a max revive just for you does for me Ben

1195
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:09,140
um

1196
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,540
Great game for the nintendo switch neko at suma

1197
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:16,660
Yeah, definitely come out on the nintendo switch. I mean they are doing like iphone shit now. So

1198
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,220
Yeah, why not? Um

1199
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,020
The way they should make a pokemon runner game

1200
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:27,300
You know what why not actually? Yeah. Yeah, you play different pokemon. You have different moves

1201
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,340
Pokemon is able to be like the most diverse cast

1202
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:37,700
The most diverse like asset of games ever any fucking game at all. Yeah with a different pokemon as the protagonist

1203
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:44,900
Yeah, yep. Yeah. Yeah pokemon flights him ride your charizard around that would legitimately be awesome

1204
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:50,820
Yeah, why not? Yeah, just fucking get your fucking mega latios and power up its fucking hyper plane engines and just

1205
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,260
Uh, a pokemon mystery dungeon games would come out on this bush. It'd be fucking cool

1206
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:00,500
I don't know another side pokemon franchise that i've kind of been meaning to get into

1207
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:03,060
Okay, see the thing is

1208
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:08,260
Everything I have consoles though, right? They're on handheld. Yeah, everything that I hear like like, okay

1209
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:11,700
I was which is a handheld. So whatever. It's all it's all out the window

1210
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:17,620
Uh, I I played all of the all of the games up to sky and then after after sky

1211
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:21,060
Uh, I I haven't played any of the games and everything I've heard about them

1212
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:26,820
Make it seem like they are the worst video games ever produced by men. Why what's what's what changes after sky?

1213
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:34,580
The pokemon mystery dungeons. Yeah. Yeah, they they become so fucking like like sterile and with no personality

1214
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:38,660
And there's almost no like actual like like autism

1215
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,060
I god, no

1216
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:46,180
The the I I I'm serious pokemon was born out of autism. Yeah, literally born out of autism

1217
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:50,100
I feel like like the main selling point of explorers of sky

1218
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:54,580
Is just how autistic can be with it and I love it so dearly

1219
01:26:54,660 --> 01:27:00,420
I I mean it is literally a self insert fan fiction. Yeah done extremely well

1220
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:07,380
Uh, the like you like no matter even if you are ebony's or fucking screws age

1221
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,940
Asian ebony's or screws. Yeah

1222
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:16,180
You will form such a long lasting bond with both your partner pokemon and the people in your explorers guild

1223
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:20,820
You likely has a point in this game where we're like where our tensions become

1224
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:28,340
Uh high intolerably intolerably high just like race mix in the united states america. Mm-hmm

1225
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:33,780
Which is also another huge problem. Yeah, um, uh that you will be heartbroken

1226
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:40,180
Um, this this is how every day ends in that game. Once you get acquainted with the guild. Did you say dates?

1227
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:46,740
No, I I well there are dates. Oh every day like it's count. Okay. Okay. Okay, uh

1228
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:51,620
Uh, you will come home from like like like a like a fucking uh, uh

1229
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:59,300
A a taxing day out on the job exploring and helping people. Yeah, you will come home and this exact same cutscene will play every time

1230
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:03,780
Well, well, sometimes there'll be exceptions for the story. Yeah, but it will be like louder

1231
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:07,060
It'll come out and he'll be like hey, he's back our best friends back

1232
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:11,140
All right, let's have dinner together and then there's like a dinner cutscene where you're all you get the same

1233
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,740
All your friends. Yeah. Yeah, all your friends are with you. Yeah

1234
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:22,820
And and it's like much much much choo choo choo choo. Wow. I'm so glad I get to be friends with you. Today was a great day. Oh my god

1235
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:31,060
And then you're you and your partner pokemon are sleeping like like like like like like head to toe and you're like

1236
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:35,060
And the partner's like ever since I met you my life hasn't been the same

1237
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,140
I'm so glad I met you on the beach that day

1238
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:41,540
I I now have a purpose in my life and I love and I love you dearly chimcharr

1239
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:45,140
Oh my god

1240
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:48,740
And then he'll be like good night. I love you and he'll like kiss it

1241
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:53,460
He'll kiss his treasure and and he'll go to sleep. I don't know how much of this you're making though

1242
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:57,940
I'm not making a fucking any of it. That's why it's the best game ever made

1243
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:04,580
Thanks for listening to the pokemon mystery dungeon podcast for the rowdy fuckers cop killies folks

1244
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:08,020
I really no I really want to play them. Yeah, uh

1245
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:13,780
Red and blue are like red and blue mystery dungeon. Yeah, are also very good. Uh

1246
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:21,380
I I thought that was that was sky. You were just talking. Yeah, it's uh sky is by far the best one, but uh, it okay

1247
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:25,540
Play blue and play sky. Those are those are the best ones of each one

1248
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:29,620
The reason my blue is better than red is because for some weird reason

1249
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:34,900
Red came out on the gameplay advanced and blue was on the ds. Yeah, I don't know why

1250
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:38,900
Coverage coverage. Yeah coverage. Um

1251
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:44,420
Blue just feels better to play and uh blue is like

1252
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:49,220
Like it has just like like it has the same amount of pay posts I feel

1253
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:53,140
But I feel like I wasn't as connected to the characters in that game. Which one did you play first?

1254
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:55,540
I I played sky first

1255
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:59,060
So you think do you think I should play sky first or blue first? Um

1256
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:01,620
Probably blue. I mean

1257
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:08,820
I honestly like like no knowing your busy schedule. You should probably pick one right this guy. Yeah. Yeah, maybe yeah

1258
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:13,460
But but if you have all the time in the world label because like they are different plots

1259
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:21,380
Yeah, uh, and they're they're both worth it. Uh, did you know, you know primal ground on primal chiroger in gen 6 and alpha ruby and alpha saffa

1260
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:23,620
Yeah, I'm familiar with them

1261
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,980
We hang out. Yeah, we have we have coffee twice a month. Uh

1262
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:32,740
Uh primal dialga was in explorers of sky. He's he's the main bad guy

1263
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:39,780
That's not even that's not a thing in like the regular games. No. No, it's not. No primal dialga and he's fucking sick

1264
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:45,380
He's a delicate different gen primal like can't wait. Is there is there primal polkia? No

1265
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:51,620
Wait, why wouldn't it be primal ray quasi? Wait, there's already a mega ray quasi. This is confusing

1266
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,780
Why wouldn't sky be ray quasi be the main guy?

1267
01:30:54,260 --> 01:31:00,180
Well, first of all because it came out in gen 4 and they wanted to push, you know, the new guys

1268
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:02,100
Uh

1269
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,060
Well, and it was just carried over from the past

1270
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,460
Okay, uh

1271
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,700
And sky is like a different story from

1272
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:13,140
Time and space, right? Uh, like it's it's time and darkness

1273
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:19,460
And it's basically the same thing but like like there's different instances in time and space and they're just they're they're both

1274
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:23,940
In they're they're both similar. Yeah, the sky is different. Yeah sky sky is

1275
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:28,100
It's it's different subtle ways. It's pretty much just the ultimate experience

1276
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:35,380
Okay, is it like the heart gold soul silver version? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, uh, they gave it they gave it the remake treatment

1277
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:37,460
that game

1278
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:39,460
Like like literally

1279
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:44,260
There's there's so many subplots with different pokemon in sky. It's pretty much unfucking believable

1280
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:48,500
There's a whole backstory about how you became a pokemon. Yeah, and it evolves

1281
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:54,340
Uh, a a guard of not a guard of war a uh a grow vile and this a motherfucking

1282
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:58,260
George Costanza like like I I hate him so fucking much

1283
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:04,180
The the scum of the earth dust nor that you will come to believe is literally satan

1284
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:11,300
Good, you know, when I'm on when I'm on bulbapedia, right and I'm looking at pokemon entries

1285
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:14,100
Like I'll be scrolling down and looking at all the various

1286
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:19,140
Data and shit and I'll see like I'll see some bits and pieces like from mystery dungeon

1287
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:20,740
and there will be like

1288
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:26,260
And sometimes like I'll scroll past the little thing and be like, oh, yeah, um, um, um

1289
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:33,860
Simon Simon the yeah, I'm on the page for for bulbasaur like. Oh, yeah, simon the bulbasaur

1290
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,580
Yeah, he always dreamed of becoming a gourmet chef. Yeah

1291
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,700
And I'm like what

1292
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:44,740
It's fucking awesome that the game is a much better like rpg than any other pokemon game

1293
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,700
Yeah, because like does house people have personality and they change their opinion

1294
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:55,060
Yeah, basically like like the entire hub world is just like the town and your ventures guild and they change so much

1295
01:32:55,620 --> 01:33:01,540
Like like like each level is a randomly generated thing where like you you just have to help like people

1296
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:08,020
I mean there is like story relevance to the townspeople. Yeah, but the main like meat and bones of the pathos come from the townspeople

1297
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:10,820
Oh, not the pokemon. Oh, wait the townspeople are

1298
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:18,980
Uh, like like like the best thing about it is not everyone has the same opinion to every situation

1299
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:23,540
Which is like basically like like that is how characters are written

1300
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:28,020
But everyone's stupid and no one knows how to write characters and most of the time in shows

1301
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:30,260
characters just agree to do things

1302
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:32,740
Like like like there's a very little conflict

1303
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:35,460
But in book of mystery dungeon, they're like they're like real

1304
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,340
They're real people they're more real than most of the people I know

1305
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,900
Even though they're fictional pokemon

1306
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:46,020
It sounds great, dude. There's there's there's so there's so much

1307
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:49,540
I think like I've been I've been thinking it over for a long time. I think I have no choice

1308
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,940
Yeah to check out the mystery dungeon series

1309
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:55,940
Maybe I'll maybe I'll like play blue and just kind of like blast through it

1310
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:01,620
Just kind of like to get my foot wet feet feet wet and put in the door blue is pretty fucking cool

1311
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:03,860
I won't lie. It is cool

1312
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:08,260
There's a one point where you're you're like running away from home and you have to you have to like like like like

1313
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:12,660
Like you you you have to like face mole trace for whatever reason I forget

1314
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:17,620
Yeah, and your partner turns you and says well, it's been good. We're gonna fucking die, bro

1315
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:22,740
Like it's over like we've been away from home for so long. We don't have any food

1316
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:28,580
We're gonna die to fucking mole trace. Yeah, the thing that's really missing in pokemon is like the real

1317
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:32,340
The real sense of scale of the pokemon because like

1318
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:38,100
Yeah, like they have different stats and like the characters talk about some and some are more story relevant

1319
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:45,380
But really each every pokemon is very comparable to one another in like how big and and important they feel

1320
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:49,940
Like in battle each one is just like one chess piece on your fucking chess board

1321
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,700
whereas like

1322
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:58,420
Yeah in in in the in like a real pokemon situation such as the ones that I experience every night in my dream

1323
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:00,020
um

1324
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:05,940
If a fucking moltres showed up like you're fucking I imagine like your entire town would just be raised to the ground

1325
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,300
Um, you know if he was it was a bad day for him

1326
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:12,340
I remember there's like one screenshot like like that

1327
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:19,220
I always like point to like like to show how edgy those games are and it's of like like an adorable Pikachu and a squirrel

1328
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:24,180
and like there's like little sprites on the on the on the overworld and there's like a giant mole trace

1329
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:28,420
And there's just dialogue box and there's just squirtle looking at you and he's just saying we are going to die

1330
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:32,980
Beautiful

1331
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:39,460
Like like we are like there's no fucking hope just just goodbye. I'm sorry. I'm so I'm sold man

1332
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:43,540
I'm sold play play both of those like like every pokemon game is the best game I've ever made

1333
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:49,620
Agreed. Yes. Wait. Is there any pokemon that isn't the best game I've ever made? Um, there was like that one like weird like

1334
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,620
fire and bloom pokemon game

1335
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:52,660
pokemon conquest

1336
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:58,340
Oh, well, that well, that's okay first. That's not just pokemon. It's like a crossover. Yeah, I saw that

1337
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,340
I thought it looked really cool

1338
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:03,060
Although I didn't care about like whatever it was crossing over

1339
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:09,300
But I thought that like a fire a fire emblem style game with wait, that's kind of what mystery dungeon is isn't it?

1340
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:13,300
A little okay. It's not all right. Well, I thought it was a cool idea

1341
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,860
to for use with pokemon

1342
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:18,180
I thought it's weird that it's like mixing with all these japanese

1343
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:24,340
Yeah, I don't know anything about it. It does look pretty cool, but I don't I I don't even know anything about it's game

1344
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:29,780
And anyway, they fucking ripped off nuzlocke conquest. Yeah, my famous youtube series on the youtube internet

1345
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:33,380
Uh, truly unfortunate. Yeah, truly truly unfortunate

1346
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:36,180
Um, there's like when will I get my due?

1347
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,100
for that

1348
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:43,700
For my contributions, uh, I'm trying to think there's pokemon puzzle league. I don't think that was very good

1349
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:47,940
I have no idea what that is like that one like anime spinoff game for the fucking uh

1350
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:50,340
in the 64 is it like

1351
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:55,540
It's just tetris. I was gonna say is it like uh, dr. Robotnik's mean bean machine. Yeah, whatever

1352
01:36:55,700 --> 01:37:00,660
It barely counts. Uh snap was the best game ever made. Yeah snaps cool snaps neat

1353
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,820
They should make another snap on the fucking switch

1354
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:07,380
Uh, yeah, the the creator of snap said this is the worst inferior thing I've ever seen

1355
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:12,980
Well, like they're like phones. They're like cameras in your phones now, so it's not like special big pictures of pokemon

1356
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,980
Oh

1357
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:21,460
There aren't pokemon in real life you fucking hack. What an idiot. What is it? Oh my god

1358
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:25,620
Wait, there's there's there's cameras in your phone. So

1359
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,620
I can't even remember

1360
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:34,020
So it's not special to take pictures of pokemon because everyone's doing I mean, I guess they're playing pokemon go

1361
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:39,140
To the polls and I'm taking pictures of their pokemon. Sure. It sucks

1362
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:41,540
It's not it's like

1363
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:47,060
The no, I never really played I never really played snap except for like a little bit one time

1364
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:52,180
Snap is very fun. It's neat. I like it. Snap is the funnest if you don't know how to play

1365
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:57,060
Yeah, maybe you don't know how to like optimize. Yeah. Yeah a lot so many games

1366
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:00,100
Yeah, because then often then we'll do something quick in the first level

1367
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:03,220
I remember the first time I saw lapras like out in the ocean. I was like

1368
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:06,820
This is the most complex game I've ever made

1369
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:13,220
This is as deep as video games can go wait. Why because it was like too far away and you had to like figure out how to get it

1370
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1371
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:15,940
Yeah

1372
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:20,340
Like like there is no deeper video game than pokemon snap. That is legitimately what I thought

1373
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,540
Uh and trying to wake up that snorlax

1374
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:28,260
And you have to replay every level you don't have to but like you go back

1375
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:32,980
Yeah, and and to like snap them all pictures and snap snap. Yeah

1376
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:39,620
Yeah, this is yeah pokemon is could be every fucking genre of every game all the time every made

1377
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:45,940
Because it has the most diverse cast of characters ever created. Yes. Yes. And that's and that's it. What else can you even say?

1378
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:50,580
Nothing, uh, what other video games franchise is you want to see in the switch? Oh, man

1379
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,140
you um

1380
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:55,140
Undertale

1381
01:38:55,300 --> 01:39:01,380
What are you telling me from play well on the switch? It would just play like any other game. Yeah, yeah be a jrpg

1382
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:09,140
You know, yeah, yeah undertale under house. Definitely. So what definitely undertale needs to come to the switch so that a new generation can experience it

1383
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,780
Yes

1384
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:19,380
You're ripping up homestuck toby stop toby stop toby stop

1385
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,580
Um, yeah, he did rip off homestuck with his own

1386
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:25,140
His own composition

1387
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:29,460
Maybe he ripped off undertale before it even existed. Yeah, you know what that fucking hack

1388
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:34,740
Someone's ripping off something and it's both and both. Some ones are toby. Yeah, and there's never been a greater

1389
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:41,300
Undertale uh ripoff than lisa. No, no no release a year earlier

1390
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:47,780
But clearly he clearly clearly austin jorgensen got jorgensen

1391
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:52,500
I don't he got into toby fox's like file notes and just like just like stuffed his pocket

1392
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,780
And then bolted out

1393
01:39:55,780 --> 01:40:00,820
Well, he didn't bolt he did he like took out his samurai sword and like sliced the window pane in half

1394
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:05,860
And then did like a kung fu ninja kick out of it because he's a fucking incredible superhuman god

1395
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:13,140
And um unlike toby who was a ninja and then ninja ran all the way across the united states to california

1396
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:15,220
Where I think he lives i'm probably wrong about that

1397
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:17,540
But the name like that probably lives in fucking hell

1398
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:24,100
Um, who's just california? Yeah, he's america. He's an american boy. He's a good american boy

1399
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:30,900
As all he's an all he's an all american ninja. Yeah, the leader of the alt right

1400
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:40,100
He would be he sounds like he could be the leader of the alt right, but no, he's a good boy and a sweet boy. Yeah, um, let's see

1401
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:45,700
I I I want like fucking I want smash to be re-released, but good this time

1402
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:48,340
Which which will not happen have they?

1403
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:52,820
Oh, because like instead of all slow and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, um, yeah

1404
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:58,740
They haven't said anything about a new smash. Have they they said that it is happening, but we don't know anything about it

1405
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:01,620
I mean, it feels like smash 4 just came out

1406
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:04,260
You'd say that but it came out three years ago

1407
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:11,300
That's pretty short for a re-release of smash. I guess but yeah, I mean they could they could do it. Yeah

1408
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:14,260
God, it came out three years ago. Yeah, Jesus

1409
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:16,100
Fucking video games

1410
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:19,220
Video games and life just don't like progress

1411
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:26,660
The same timeline like the two happen completely separate from one another and like and like a week goes by and you look at video games

1412
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:30,580
And like a century has gone by or vice versa or whatever

1413
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:37,060
Like years later you look at you look at games and like they've just announced announced like the new generation of pokemon

1414
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:39,940
Has like 50 new pokemon and that's all that they've done. Yeah

1415
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,100
Ah

1416
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:49,140
Our friend tom tom Oliver said the other day that he didn't want like there to be new pokemon in new pokemon games

1417
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:53,860
That was very infuriating. It was the worst thing i've ever heard before in my life. He seemed

1418
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:56,260
Well

1419
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:58,980
First of all, I didn't understand at all like he okay

1420
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:03,940
He seemed to be saying that other things were more important than new pokemon. First of all, no

1421
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:07,620
Second of all, even if that were true, it doesn't mean that they couldn't make new pokemon

1422
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:11,140
Like yeah, again, he was coming from it like there are more important things

1423
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,900
They should focus on other things, but like they're fucking nintendo

1424
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:21,220
They can do everything and once and once but always always in a state of rage about all the things that aren't being done

1425
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:24,340
By nintendo the literal god of mankind. Yes

1426
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:26,980
unironically our creator

1427
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,980
Is

1428
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:39,220
I'm gonna kill that nintendo. I'm gonna get him. I'm fucking calling up. I'm calling the intergalactic intergalactic space squad

1429
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:44,820
To attend they're going to kill all of japan because it's too hard to distinguish them from another

1430
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:49,620
I need to kill japan. I have to kill. I I have to kill japan before fully cooly 2 comes out

1431
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:54,740
Maybe if I can if I can stop the monster that is nintendo at the same in one fell swoop

1432
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:57,140
That'll be just dandy as well

1433
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,420
If they do do a port of smash bros

1434
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:02,260
First of all

1435
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:04,260
It fuck dude

1436
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:11,060
Second of all, which is like they really smash four on the switch. Yeah, I could see it like like like they're doing that with marikari

1437
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:14,900
Is we gotta call marikari the ones. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I could see them doing

1438
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,900
But they would have to get rid of monster hero sakurai

1439
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:24,740
Be a sakurai is like 10 times worse than Miyamoto in the sense that he ruins game game series

1440
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:26,820
How so?

1441
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:34,260
Well, Miyamoto destroyed paper mario, but so sakurai I get feeling he literally unironically hates video games

1442
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,820
Miyamoto definitely loves video games. Yeah, I don't think anyone

1443
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:43,060
He's a coup. Even though his love is is his love is

1444
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:47,860
Evil. Yes. His love is sick. Yeah. He has the mightest touch

1445
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,260
The mightest touch like

1446
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:55,860
That's a weird metaphor because like yeah, it turns it to gold, but also ruins it completely. Yeah, yeah, exactly

1447
01:43:56,180 --> 01:44:00,340
Yeah, I don't know. I honestly didn't mind like new like super paper mario

1448
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:06,020
Still no no one claims that super paper mario super mario was awesome. Oh, well, what do you mean by he ruined it then?

1449
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:10,820
There have been two games that come out for mario after woods like what?

1450
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:14,660
Sick of star and fucking paint splash

1451
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:16,420
Oh

1452
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:24,420
Right. Yes. I don't think about those. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I forgot. I forgot. Yeah. I forgot those were paper marios

1453
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:32,740
Yeah, they fucking aren't. Yeah, I don't know. I don't mind. I don't mind things like woolly world and epic yarn and sticker star

1454
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:34,100
I don't mind them

1455
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:38,820
but when like beautiful franchises like paper mario and kirby get

1456
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:42,580
Like bastardized and those become what they are

1457
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,820
Benefit well, okay

1458
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:50,900
This meme has been perpetrated by you and your brother ben that epic yarn is not an amazing game

1459
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:56,020
Is honestly disgusting in my hate. I never played it. I played like a little bit of it

1460
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:01,300
I don't know. Okay. First of all, it's a it's a spin-off game. That is literally a one-off

1461
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:05,620
But it's been like there haven't been another that's there hasn't been another main kirby game

1462
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:07,540
since then

1463
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:11,860
Right? Am I wrong? Are you in your own fucking universe?

1464
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:14,180
Yes

1465
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:18,340
Return to dreamland planet robo bot fucking triple deluxe

1466
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:23,620
There's there's there's been more that I can't even fucking recount. There's been so many other games as well

1467
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:30,020
Fucking rainbow curse, but have they resembled the kirby of my you? Yes. All of them have I don't know

1468
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:32,820
Listen munchie. I don't know anything about video

1469
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:38,820
All right, I don't I don't I don't research anything before I say it and I'm proud of that

1470
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:47,060
I'm proud to spread misinformation and to base my and to base my my opinions and my beliefs solely on hearsay

1471
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:52,100
and and complete and complete just invention just

1472
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:54,820
internal invention of events

1473
01:45:55,940 --> 01:46:00,500
A totally self-constructive narrative that there's no relation at all to reality

1474
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:08,660
And this is what you have to know about me. There has been not there's not been a game even similar to epic yarn in any conceivable way

1475
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:12,900
In the kirby series since that day. Okay. All right. You know what? I don't mind epic yarn

1476
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,140
My perception was that kirby was was like not doing

1477
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:21,700
Powers and shit anymore. No, but I guess I'm wrong

1478
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:24,020
Not at all

1479
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,100
In every fucking way

1480
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:33,220
Uh, we talked about this earlier and I said I want there to be more kirby games that are about the powers

1481
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,460
And you didn't correct me that see I

1482
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,700
I didn't think that was weird

1483
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:43,220
But I thought you meant like really bring like the powers themselves to the forefront like in kirby 64

1484
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:46,420
I do want that. I I do want that more

1485
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:50,980
Yeah, I mean, I guess that is still fucking wrong

1486
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:56,020
Okay, okay. Okay. Well. All right. So these new kirby games that I've never heard of and I have no idea

1487
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:00,980
Do they I mean, do they have like what which which kirby games that I would know do they resemble?

1488
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:03,060
But I like superstars or superstars

1489
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:10,580
Superstar, okay. Yeah, are they like are they like that? Uh, they play exactly like that. Uh, do they have new powers?

1490
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:15,460
Yes, well, okay, never mind then kirby's doing just fine. Yes. Kirby's doing exactly what I want

1491
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:19,460
New powers and they've upgraded the old powers and there's so much more shit to do and

1492
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:26,500
You're you you just have no no basis in reality. What's so I've I've been misled for years

1493
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:30,420
And and it's a I'm in a cage of my own ignorance my own self-exposing

1494
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:36,260
Kirby's never gone came in like 2010, right? Yeah, I know it's pretty old by now. Yeah, but it's okay

1495
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:42,820
What what can I say? It's like it's like the last it's like the last kirby game that I heard like major press coverage about

1496
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:44,980
That's that's the only thing I can say in my defense

1497
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,940
I mean

1498
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:54,580
You do live in a trash can bin so that is easily you would not hear the news about these current video games

1499
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:59,540
Look, I'm too busy scavenging for sustenance to pay attention to video game journalism

1500
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:06,820
Well, I'm looking right now on my fucking phone. I'm getting all the kirby games released since kirby's epic yarn. Look, okay

1501
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:11,780
Let me just I'm just admitting that you're completely right and I've been completely wrong this whole time

1502
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,900
I I know but from my own sick interest

1503
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:21,540
I I want to I want to destroy you even more like the last the last time I formed an opinion was when

1504
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:24,820
Kirby's epic yarn was the newest kirby game and I was like man

1505
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,940
I wish kirby would go back to its roots and then I never thought about it again

1506
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:34,180
Okay, kirby mass attack kirby's return to dreamland kirby triple deluxe kirby and the rainbow kerb

1507
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:43,140
Kirby planet robobot all of those have been completely in the fucking style of of super star besides um

1508
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:46,180
What's it called mess attack? What console are they on?

1509
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:53,220
They're on all of them such as the ds the we the we use 3ds. Maybe I'll get the one which ones through 3ds

1510
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:59,700
There too. There's triple deluxe and there is planet robobot. Maybe I'll get one. I love Kirby. Uh, Kirby's the best game in

1511
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:02,100
Yeah, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. Um

1512
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:04,900
Uh, fuck you

1513
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:07,860
What

1514
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:14,820
I'm the worst. You know what would be would be a really like like a really funny joke by nintendo. What's that if they released?

1515
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:16,180
um

1516
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:22,820
Say a star fox game or a metroid game or a f0 game or a donkey kong game or a yoshi game

1517
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:25,140
Go on

1518
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:31,460
Um, you know how like those guys are like the original aid smash bros and like they were kind of like like a big deal

1519
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:37,540
Yeah, you know they used to have like game produced for them. Yeah. Oh, you're saying they don't yeah

1520
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:44,340
Okay, okay. Maybe this yeah, this is part of I guess I just assumed Kirby was part of that trend of like beloved franchises

1521
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:49,140
That don't get games anymore. Yeah. No, I guess that because yeah, like other games are like that

1522
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:51,620
I mean, they are making dk games, but like

1523
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:56,180
Very slowly. Yeah, like well, I I don't think

1524
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:03,620
They did make a dk platformer like just yeah, yeah, uh by just recently if you meet in 2012 then yes

1525
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:06,900
No, no, there was one that was like you played it with like a drum

1526
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:12,260
But that one was that was in like 2005 then what no

1527
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:18,020
That's bullshit. It was on the fucking game queue

1528
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:24,420
That's not true. That that is what it is. That's the most recent dk game. I can even remember

1529
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:31,060
No, no, I know that wait, there was a plat. There was a dk platformer in 2012. Yes

1530
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:37,140
I don't own a nintendo console. I don't play video games

1531
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:41,220
What have I been talking about?

1532
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:48,900
What have I even been talking about? I only I only care about pokemon. Yeah, the only gaming news I pay attention to is pokemon

1533
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:50,980
It's it's sad, but it's true

1534
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:56,900
Yeah, but but uh star fox got a game like a year ago. I think oh, yeah, and it was terrible

1535
01:50:57,220 --> 01:51:04,180
Uh, it was literally star fox 64 again in hd. But wasn't it didn't have like awful controls? I hear that

1536
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,660
Yeah, I yeah, I do I know about that one

1537
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,820
um, so

1538
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:14,260
What what's funny is after star fox 64 people always claim that star fox has just been shit after that point

1539
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:17,780
However star fox, I think it's command. It's either commander

1540
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:21,700
The the one where you're the one where it's a star fox game again

1541
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:28,820
That's fucking awesome. Uh, when was that? Uh, it was in 2000 and in like six. I think okay

1542
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:34,900
Um around like early. So it just is another star fox in the vein of the original. Yes. Yeah

1543
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:42,340
Nobody talks about it. Uh, they must all be suffering from my same delusion of like video games ended after I turned like 19

1544
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:45,780
And then everything else has just kind of been spinning it's wheels

1545
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:48,660
And I won't bother to learn otherwise. Yes

1546
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:54,100
But it's like the exact same predicament with xd go of darkness like people are like complaining about it

1547
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:58,260
But if you just play the video games in the series, then you would know

1548
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:03,700
Why would I ever play a video game? I mean, it's like Nate was talking about kingdom hearts

1549
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:08,020
He gave his kingdom hearts lecture and like I'd never fucking heard of like half of those kingdom hearts

1550
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:12,900
But just because I don't own the consoles. I mean, I don't I don't have a we or we use so

1551
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:17,460
Yeah, I didn't know about anything anything that came out of those. I only just recently got a 3ds

1552
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:21,300
I had a ds before but I never played anything on it. Um, um,

1553
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:23,940
Except pokemon

1554
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,940
Okay, i'm a consumerist pig

1555
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:34,020
Or i'm the i'm actually the opposite of that because I don't buy things except for the one thing that I buy that everyone else buys

1556
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:38,980
Yes, yes, excellent. Yeah, uh, there has been a yoshi game recently new yoshi sound

1557
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:42,580
I literally have only heard intense negatives about it

1558
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,980
Why what's wrong with it?

1559
01:52:44,980 --> 01:52:49,300
Uh, I hear the the controls are unresponsive. It looks like she it sounds like completely

1560
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:55,700
Uh, there's there's one song that's been reposted a lot that literally sounds like someone ripping ass over and over again

1561
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:59,060
Okay, yes

1562
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:04,500
um, and it I and they also just say it shreds old water and there's nothing there's nothing even on me

1563
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:09,300
What game does it most resemble will yoshi's islands? Yes

1564
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:16,740
People like that one. Uh, yes, but it doesn't have to he doesn't have to see martin. Yeah, he's a classic classic game

1565
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:25,620
What i'm seeing i'm serious. I know but the new not related to anything we're saying classic game yoshi's island nine out of ten

1566
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:29,140
But switched by nintendo

1567
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:30,020
um

1568
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:36,500
Yeah, if they make a new game that's not shit and if they make a new metro game that is that that is a metro game and not

1569
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,900
Like like four swords

1570
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:43,620
I don't know. I don't even place four swords, but like it's like a

1571
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:48,740
It's multiplayer, right? Yeah multiplayer is all that done. Have you heard what metroid federation places?

1572
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:52,180
I have heard that it I've heard people that don't like it

1573
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:58,100
I don't know what it is and I and I know that metroid is in a state where they just don't make any new metroid games

1574
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:02,900
And fans try to make games that are like metroid and they get shut down. Yes. Yeah

1575
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:05,060
garbage

1576
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:06,260
metroid is

1577
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:10,260
They're they're too much for games. They're the prime game is just like an fps. And then they're they leave it on my plate

1578
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,260
They're like essentially. Yeah. Yeah

1579
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:13,780
uh

1580
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:15,780
Federation force is a

1581
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:21,940
A I'm pretty sure like over the top third person shooter co-op game featuring

1582
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:27,940
NPCs for pbs games not NPCs as in nameable characters, but as

1583
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:34,100
Generic soldier from from prime. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah all those beloved characters

1584
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:38,580
That I've never heard of interacting with no metroids

1585
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:40,740
characters

1586
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:46,980
Is ridley there? He's the only metroid character I could name. I I don't think so. He's gotta be in there somewhere

1587
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:49,140
Maybe somewhere in there

1588
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:53,300
Uh, why do people hate federation force?

1589
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:59,060
Uh, because it's nothing like any other metroid game. It looks and plays badly

1590
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:02,260
Uh, I don't know if it plays badly, but it looks like a complete shit

1591
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:04,740
And we've been starving for a new game for so long

1592
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:10,420
And they they're like it literally seems like they had just slapped on metroid to another game

1593
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:12,900
That's nothing to do with it. Is it coming out for the switch?

1594
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:15,620
No, it's gonna have to

1595
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:21,300
It was enough. It was announced a really long time ago. Oh, I don't know. I think honest to god

1596
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:23,380
I think the backlash was so big that they just can't

1597
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:26,340
I see

1598
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:31,060
Uh, I don't it might be out that happens sometimes where I like that one game in war

1599
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:35,940
It was like I heard a lot of game and what game and wario for the oh like game and watch but little wario

1600
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:41,780
Uh, I I heard a lot of like like press about it. Yeah, and then like two months later. I was like, hey, wait

1601
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:47,700
Game and worry. Let me look that up. It released like like a month ago. I heard fucking nothing about it. Yeah

1602
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:49,620
Oh

1603
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:52,660
That reminds me game that needs to come to the nintendo switch

1604
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:56,260
No

1605
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:58,580
My favorite game and munchies too

1606
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:03,060
I hate overwatch. Uh overwatch is the worst video game ever made

1607
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:06,100
I've never played it and I never will because I hate it

1608
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:11,300
I hate how it looks like a pixar movie and I hate how it is focused tested to a mirror shine

1609
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:16,980
And I hate that everyone loves it and if you and everyone that loves it is just uh, he's just been duped

1610
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:20,100
You're just a corporate shill. You've been you've been tricked

1611
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:23,940
You've been tricked into liking the game by the fact that they made it so you would like it

1612
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:27,940
God damn it's not not only does it's aesthetic

1613
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,180
Uh, it's aesthetic

1614
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:37,220
Be awful. I also don't like I mean some of the character designs are kind of neat. I guess but the overall aesthetic is dumb and bland

1615
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:45,140
Everything visual about overwatch is terrible. Not only that though the game itself. I think some of them would look cool in other games

1616
01:56:45,860 --> 01:56:47,860
like

1617
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:49,940
Bastion

1618
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:51,940
mercy

1619
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:55,380
I think in a in a game that I think in another game

1620
01:56:55,860 --> 01:57:03,380
Mercy's like robo wings would be really sweet. Yeah, you know what maybe yeah, but but by and large everything visual better than

1621
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,700
Yeah, uh

1622
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:08,580
But the game the gameplay it has very highly

1623
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:13,140
That's a highly controversial opinion that no one will agree with us on but we both feel it really strong

1624
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:17,620
Yeah, it looks very that it looks stupid and we hate it

1625
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:23,220
It does have graphical fidelity. Oh, it's got it's got graphical fidelity in space

1626
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:29,140
It's like i'm right there with all my favorite characters such as a girl. Um, fast girl

1627
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:36,260
There's like a robot dude robot dude and big big pig. Yeah, and big pig my favorite

1628
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:41,220
Big hook guy big big fat guy. He's he's there with him

1629
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:45,540
And I just hate I just hate how it was the subject of so much

1630
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:51,940
controversy about nothing meeting up to its release and it all just propelled itself to just massive success

1631
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:59,460
On the back of the fact that it was focused tested to be something that you the idiot consumer would buy because it looks like other things

1632
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:00,980
You like yes

1633
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:06,100
Not only that but the gameplay itself is so fucking like like dumb down and casual

1634
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:09,700
I've never played it. Okay, and I never will but I believe I have played it

1635
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:12,820
Extensively and and I have a somewhat high sr

1636
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:15,460
Uh, which is like the record

1637
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:21,380
If you compare every single individual like aspect about it to tf2

1638
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:26,820
I know i'm gonna sound like an asshole for sandals, but tf2 is just so much better than it in every fucking way

1639
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:33,300
In like like visual and gameplay. It's pre fucking boggling. Uh, I do like tf2

1640
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:37,220
Although well, I liked it. See I stopped playing it before there were even hats

1641
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:43,060
So like I don't even know what's going on with tf2. Uh, tf2 is a completely different situation in which I

1642
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:49,700
I will have a listen buddy where I talk to myself about how much I hate tf2 and then I will also defend I will also defend tf2

1643
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:58,820
Just to summarize the maps are fucking indecipherable and indecipherable that in tf2. No in in

1644
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:07,780
Uh, and all of them boiled down choke points and all of all of the capture points and I'm objectives are very big

1645
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:11,540
And this seems like a minute detail

1646
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:15,380
But this allows the this is this allows timer stall

1647
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:20,260
And and ask someone who plays pokebomb, then I'm sure you can come. Do you know what timer stall is?

1648
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:23,540
um in overwatch not really I guess

1649
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:27,220
Just running down the clock while your team is still in the lead

1650
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:32,660
Uh, basically what you do is uh do the mechanics of how control points work

1651
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:35,540
if one person is on a

1652
01:59:35,540 --> 01:59:36,820
a

1653
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:41,460
A point and keep in mind in tf2 the points are like the size of maybe three people

1654
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:46,500
Yeah, I don't watch they are the size of maybe 50 people. Mm-hmm. And uh

1655
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:52,740
If just one person, uh, like like say you're on blue team and you're attacking red team, uh, red team is defending

1656
01:59:52,980 --> 02:00:00,580
Yeah, if you're on the final point of red and literally every single human on blue is on red's point if just one red

1657
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:04,340
Uh, like let's say may the worst example

1658
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:11,780
May has an ability where you can shoot up a an ice wall and that takes like 250 health to destroy that

1659
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:14,820
Which is somewhat much you team has to focus on very

1660
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:20,100
Very fast. Okay. Okay. It's going to take like at least like three seconds, which is a lot

1661
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:23,060
So it sounds like what you're saying is that

1662
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:29,940
That the the points are so large that like the defending team like it's just impossible to control the point

1663
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:37,060
Enough to not get the fucking defending team to just be jumping on it and like fucking around and like it's unfairly favors the defender

1664
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:40,820
Yes, yes, and and every it is a slow

1665
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:46,500
Slug and and just go back to main because it angers me. So once the ice wall is down

1666
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:52,900
She can like freeze yourself and ice and make her invincible, right? Yeah, and just capture and just keep the point for six fucking seconds

1667
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:54,260
Yeah

1668
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:57,300
Yeah, I see and then once she's done, I see. Yeah

1669
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:00,420
That's that's fucking me

1670
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:03,060
What that may literally says that

1671
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:04,980
Oh

1672
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:06,980
Oh, no

1673
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:07,940
Oh, no

1674
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:11,460
Uh, then then by that time her team has already

1675
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:16,900
Respond and come back because there are like there are so little respond games

1676
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:19,460
Like respond time

1677
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:20,980
And if you have two

1678
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,420
If you're defending

1679
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:26,740
Uh, and and the blue team is at or yeah, yeah, the blue team is at the last point

1680
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:28,660
You will have a response I can have like

1681
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:36,740
Like 14 seconds. Mm-hmm. These those seconds really fucking matter in fps fps is are like like a millisecond millisecond games

1682
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:41,220
Did they matter but over watched they're like six seconds at most

1683
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:45,380
Which means that you death is so inconsequential in that game

1684
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:50,820
You can just jump right back into the fray with basically like like no like scratches on it won't be that

1685
02:01:53,220 --> 02:01:58,740
It's off I can go on and on about how that game is so fucking poorly designed balanced

1686
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:04,260
I've heard I've heard you talk at length about it. Yeah, and I just I just hate it entirely on principle

1687
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:11,060
Yeah, like I don't have any actual arguments against it other than my feelings. Yeah, which are strong. Yeah, it should be considered valid by all

1688
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,620
um, but yeah

1689
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:21,300
Um, come to the switch, please. I love or watch my favorite game of 2015. Yeah, um, and it will be my favorite game of 2017

1690
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:23,620
guaranteed

1691
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:27,860
If you just rerelease it and just put just put even more unnecessary bullshit

1692
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:33,620
I love it. Please put in uh, even more micro transactions and uh

1693
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:35,460
just

1694
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:42,020
Blizzard, please just come and fucking read me. It's just while I'm asleep. Just come and just and just destroy my ass

1695
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:45,780
Pikmin

1696
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:51,140
Pikmin, uh, I played Pikmin 2 Pikmin 2 is the best game ever made. I've never played a Pikmin. I

1697
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:55,540
It's kind of a thing, right? It's kind of a thing they keep doing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1698
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:57,460
It's all right

1699
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:59,860
Um, Pikmin 2 is about money

1700
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:05,780
Is it and and and greed like by the producers or in the game in the game? Okay

1701
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:07,700
Uh

1702
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:10,420
This is not like a hugely popular franchise. Oh, no

1703
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:15,460
Uh, the first Pikmin is your your name and all maria crash land on the like a planet and there's like the command name

1704
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:18,420
Like they help you but we load your ship and you go back to space

1705
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:26,020
Uh in Pikmin 2 it picks up right as soon as you land on your home planet and and like the the the company you work for

1706
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:32,660
Is like, uh while you were gone our company is is it got foreclosed and we're out we're bankrupt now

1707
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:35,300
And you're like, oh fuck

1708
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:37,140
that's not good

1709
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:40,180
and then uh like like you like like

1710
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:42,980
In Pikmin you like pick up trash

1711
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:48,980
and and so like Pikmin uh all mar is like, oh, uh, also I think like like a bio cap and then

1712
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:53,060
Nice, and I think that's literally the item they use as well

1713
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:59,220
And then the like the ceo's like that's worth fucking five trillion dollars on this plane

1714
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:01,860
Because he picked up a bottle cap on Pikmin world

1715
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:07,860
Okay, and then and then he's like you have to go back to Pikmin world and mine it for all of its resources

1716
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:14,180
In order to reclaim our company. I see and then you proceed to do that and it's awesome

1717
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:20,420
Cool, you just destroy all the natural wildlife and just take all of the treasures from from the planet

1718
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:22,740
Grace

1719
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:29,940
That's pretty good. And you use the Pikmin to do so. It's it's it's incredible. This sounds this sounds radical. Hey, is there a new uh

1720
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:33,300
Uh, what about animal crossing?

1721
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:39,140
