Last month's episode was...

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The topic for this episode is New Year's and Old Year's thoughts.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And, uh, here's a blast from the past. You may remember this guy, Munchy, with his diminutive headwear.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ah, it's time to return to what we all think about when we think about Munchy.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Munchy got a fucking-ticking huge fucking fist at the BCP!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, well, I'm sorry I didn't get ghost of the child this year either.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But next year, for sure, guys, for sure!

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Smash cut!

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Smash cut to 2021.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, to 2029.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey, everybody, it's another episode of the PCP.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Nate's late, like a bitch, but I'm here.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What a didgy bro.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Way to start the new year, never feel.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Welcome to 2020, to the new decade, even, not just the new year.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But, uh, how you guys feeling, Mage, Ben, in the new year?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Um, um, uh...

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's not the new year for us recording it.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It will be when you hear this.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We haven't suffered through it yet.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hopeless, uh, doomed.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There's no light at the end of the tunnel.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're all headed towards oblivion.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I feel grateful.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I am feeling great as well.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm excited.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right on.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Nice.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Happy for you.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
At least in a general sense, in the actual moment, I'm tired, um,

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
fed up with waiting,

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
because we already waited half an hour for Nate to get home,

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but he's still right here.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He did, so here we are.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We really did.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In so many years, he blended up just once.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, that makes it all the worse.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He's tarnished his perfect record.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Uh, it's painful.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's like Lisa Simpson getting a B.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The last episode was the last of the year and decade, technically.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But did you guys talk about that at all on that episode?

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Did we?

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't know.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I think we just talked about the holidays.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you want to talk about it being the end of the fucking decade?

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's do it.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to talk about what you, what you did,

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
what you did during the holidays at some point,

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
because like you were talking while before the holidays, wasn't it?

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I recorded last one.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Who?

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This?

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Us?

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, last episode was recorded on the 22nd, so it wasn't Christmas yet.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now it's post-Christmas.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What did you get for presents?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I need to know.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, it's got a bunch of crap.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't even get, I asked my parents for like one thing,

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and it wasn't even a big thing.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I think they just forgot and didn't get it for me.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What was the thing?

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What was the thing?

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I just, I just, it's just a boring, like I wanted like an adjustable like razor,

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
like for your beard, you know, you put on like the different length attachments

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and hair clipper.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I was like, I could use one of those.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They got me like shoes.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I didn't want shoes.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I remember the shoes.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The shoes saga continues.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They got me a couple nice shirts though, so whatever, it's fine.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It balanced it out.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Got me some stuff.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I got random stuff from May's family and a hundred bucks on Amazon.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I mean, I'm an adult.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Christmas is not exciting anymore, nor should it be.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Although it was exciting because I did my own Christmas for the first time

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
where I had the tree and I had the stuff,

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and I had Epstein didn't kill himself written all over the place.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Did you have your family over to your place?

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is that how you did it?

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I had, I had Vic in shade over.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, that's pretty good.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's pretty cool.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But I mean, you could just go,

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you can learn all about it by watching the fucking video I made about it.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Epstein didn't Christmas himself.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That was what the video was about.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I watched it.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Didn't really have the time.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What else could it be about?

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How should I know?

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Things aren't things that they seem to be nowadays.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So, you know, okay, my Christmas, I had fun because I got this gift.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Like my parents said, it's like, oh, there's not going to be any gifts this year,

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
but I decided to be sent and I got everyone gifts.

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, rather than like, okay, so for my sister and my mother,

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I got, I got the money because they can just buy their own clothes

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
because I'm not really good at buying clothes and they like clothes.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, you know, just money.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I got my dad a computer, but like, it got a bit busted during the shipping,

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but it's okay.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's fixable.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's just going to cost a little bit extra.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But yeah, no computer for that.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sounds expensive.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's okay.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I got a new computer for myself and my old computer,

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that which is still really good for today's standards.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I got it shipped over to my dad.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It did cost a little bit.

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I got it insured.

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thankfully I got it insured.

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So maybe I'll get some of the money back of that because they busted my computer.

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That should be to get it all back, right?

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Isn't that what insurance means?

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Kind of like, you have to put in what you think the computer is worth.

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Like, you know what, what this, what the shipping item is worth.

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I put in 500 quid, though the computer actually cost it like more than twice as much

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
back when I bought it, but I bought it in 2016.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, I didn't buy it.

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I got it as a present.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But yeah, 2016.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So it's been a few years on it.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, you know, I lowered the price just to be fair.

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And yeah, they kind of busted it a little bit, but I'm not sure if it's going to be

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
like, oh, because you didn't pack it properly.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're going to, you're not going to get your refund or anything.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I mean, they have to like survey the damages.

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
They asked for pictures.

139
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No, no, they asked for pictures.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I took some pictures.

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So I don't know.

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We'll see.

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe on the next episode, I'll have a reply.

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's been a few days, but it's the holidays.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, you know.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Anyway, and I got, I got like, like the best give ever.

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I, it's not very appealing looking, but I got my very first onesie.

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And now I am one with the Gremlin.

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I am the Gremlin.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I am wearing the onesie.

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am a Gremlin.

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I love it.

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's so good.

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What, what is, what onesie?

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What Gremlin?

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What is this?

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm wearing a onesie and I feel like a Gremlin wearing it.

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm just, I'm just a big old, big old onesie.

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it's so weird.

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
With your footies?

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah.

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Without, without feet.

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It is just with the, yeah.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's just a one piece for like legs and, and arms.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And, and like, it has a little hood on, on the head.

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And it's really great.

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And this is what I've been wearing around the house now.

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Who needs clothes?

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
One'sies for life.

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I love it.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm a Gremlin.

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And I'm glad you also thought that she meant an actual Gremlin.

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It was imagining like a kid kigarumi, but like with the Gremlins.

175
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because the Gremlins I have are Totoro and Snorlax.

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So.

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I wish.

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Easily imagined.

179
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I wish I would have got something like that.

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But no, my, my families are normies.

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They wouldn't have gotten me something as cool as an anime onesie.

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But no, this is fine.

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's very soft.

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's very warm and it's very pleasant.

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A little short on the legs, but most things are for me.

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Too long.

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Legs too long.

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Amazing.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Amazing.

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I, my, I got boots.

191
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I guess I'll wear them in the snow.

192
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I got Copic markers.

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's pretty cool.

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I never use those, but you know, there might come a day.

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They're good.

196
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They are good.

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So it's makes you feel good.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They're good.

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I should probably use them.

200
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I don't know.

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I guess time will tell.

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I got new hats.

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Got a bunch of new knit hats.

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's pretty cool.

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Haven't worn any of them yet.

206
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But what I mean, you know, whatever.

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
My family has been nagging me about wearing the hat that I wear because they think it's

208
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
super ugly.

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I'm like, I don't care for your Christmas with the giant fluffy thing at the end.

210
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I hate those hats.

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What hat, what hat do you wear?

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's like, it's just a black like hat.

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's a, it's kind of like a beanie, but it's not a beanie.

214
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think it's just, it's just like, it's just like fabric.

215
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's just black fabric with a red triangle on the front and they find it nice.

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes.

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Antifa.

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No.

219
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes.

221
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

222
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

223
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was, I was watching a speed run of Kingdom Hearts two and I cannot believe how fucking

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
cool Halloween Town Sora looks in that game with his goth Santa.

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
His got the goth Santa look is so great.

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I was like, wait a minute.

227
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Was he always goth Santa and Kingdom Hearts two Halloween Town?

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He was amazing.

229
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Great decision.

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You gotta Google that.

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Agreed.

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I want to, I want to have a look.

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Some Googling it.

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Halloween Town goth Santa, you say.

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Halloween Town.

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you watching this?

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you watching the speed run right now, Ben?

238
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, no, I just, this is a thing I've been doing lately, just putting on like GDQ speed

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
runs just on autoplay.

240
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's the one.

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Look at that.

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, it does look cool.

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It actually, the 2D drawn art is cooler than the 3D model.

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I also like this one.

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I like the goth Santa.

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's my shit.

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, there's a figurine for the goth Santa.

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Look at it.

249
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes.

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Is that not just the fucking coolest?

251
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't even play Kingdom Hearts and I want it.

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's such good aesthetic.

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What's the guy's name?

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The guy who did, he did the world ends with you.

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You ever play the world ends with you?

256
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That game's fucking sick.

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I played the elevator back when it came out, but it didn't play too well on the computer

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
so I never actually got to play it.

259
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
No, you got to play that on a dual screen.

260
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's out on the switch now.

261
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Is it?

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, yeah.

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I guess that makes sense.

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Great.

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm glad.

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I was afraid that maybe would, I was afraid that maybe would never get re-released for

267
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
anything because of like, you know, the weird screen setup.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's great though.

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
People should buy, people should buy that on the switch.

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Classic.

271
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Fuck, what's the guy's name?

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What's the character designer?

273
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you guys know?

274
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He's a big shoe boy.

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's a big shoe boy, zipper man.

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You know.

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Trash baby god.

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Rob Liefield.

279
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Lots of pockets.

280
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I mean, you're talking about, you're talking about Nomura, right?

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I am talking about Nomura.

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's correct.

283
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah.

284
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Got it.

285
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We got there.

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Fuck, man.

287
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Nate's turning over in his voicemail grave right now.

288
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He's named Nomura.

289
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He, I'm sure he would have lots of opinions about Goth Santa.

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Goth Santa.

291
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So I spent, you know.

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
God, I hope not.

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You know, I spent the holidays.

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mostly, you know, I talk about, you know, I had to suffer the company of my family members.

295
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Same.

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Who are all, they're all so much taller than me.

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Me and Nate, we're all tiny and everyone else in our family.

298
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

299
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Everyone else in our family is like six feet plus.

300
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They're huge.

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's like, it's weird.

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I have the exact opposite problem.

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You want to trade?

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No.

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No, wait.

306
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Maybe.

307
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Maybe I do.

308
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's do it.

309
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, so I had to do that.

310
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mostly I was just plastered the whole time.

311
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Mostly I just got like roaring drunk and like passed out every single day.

312
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was great.

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It made it go by faster.

314
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You know, I say that like it's a bad thing, like I had a miserable time, but actually

315
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it was fun just getting fucking wasted all through the holiday season.

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I try it sometime.

317
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I had.

318
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have.

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Nice.

320
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tried it every year in fact.

321
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It sounded like I said I had, I had done so, but no, I just wanted to say that I had

322
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
done something else to pass the time other than get plastered.

323
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I do not drink.

324
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Damn.

325
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I got this, I got this game on steam.

326
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
How do you live?

327
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I survive.

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I drink water.

329
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You know, I didn't drink that much until recently and now I drink all the time.

330
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do not.

331
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's bad.

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know.

333
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't think it's good.

334
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think maybe I'm, I think maybe it's weird.

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let me ask you this, Ben.

336
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you like it?

337
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You know, sometimes kind of, I guess.

338
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Good.

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can like a lot of things, but not all the things are good for you even though you

340
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
like them.

341
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, but it's not about good for you.

342
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's about whether it's good.

343
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Actually.

344
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I mean, what good for you is a very subjective thing.

345
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Actually, it's interesting.

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah.

347
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
When I drank less frequently, when I did drink, I would wake up the next day feeling like,

348
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
oh no, I got so drunk last night.

349
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, I must have acted like such an asshole.

350
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh, everyone hates me now.

351
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Now, I've been, I've been drinking like every night for a while.

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I've been, you know, blacking out like all the time.

353
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And everyone loves you now.

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And every, well, I don't, well, I don't care anymore is the problem.

355
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Now I wake up and I don't care what I mean.

356
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Maybe you're too cynical if that's the right word nowadays.

357
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Cynical?

358
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm not sure if that's the correct word.

359
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like just.

360
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, I'm just, I just don't give a fuck.

361
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, basically.

362
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I've just gotten, I've just gotten so used to the feeling of waking up and not remembering

363
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
how, how I fell asleep that I'm just like, yeah, that's fine.

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's normal.

365
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Don't worry about it.

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm highly against that sort of lifestyle, but you do you.

367
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay.

368
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, I'm highly against your sort of lifestyle, whatever that means.

369
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now it's just, I don't particularly, I have, I have a few alcoholics in my family and you

370
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
know, I don't, I don't like seeing their lives go that way.

371
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So just out of concern for your wellbeing, I just say I don't really approve of that

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
sort of.

373
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If you start seeing shit, stop drinking.

374
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Um, I'm probably going to cut back pretty soon.

375
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Like why, I don't know.

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I think it's just a holiday thing.

377
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Like people all, people all get together and partying.

378
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Then I can't remember, did I ever tell you to read the manga Disappearance Diary?

379
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, another diary.

380
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't remember.

381
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay.

382
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Well, it's a manga about a guy named Hideo Azuma who recently died, Rest in Peace.

383
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But he, he had this manga he wrote about the three times that he had disappeared, that

384
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
he ran away from his family and just became a homeless man.

385
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, the first, the first time he ran away, he just became homeless for like 20 days or

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
so before the police found him and brought him back home because apparently they can

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
do that.

388
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Um, then the second time he ran away, he just like went to a different town and started

389
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
up a different job as like a construction worker or whatever.

390
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This guy's a manga artist.

391
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Um, and then in the third part, he becomes a hardcore alcoholic in the 90s.

392
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And in that part, I truly...

393
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
His most lucrative job today.

394
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah.

395
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I, I had never truly understood what alcoholism does to you until reading that.

396
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But it's basically like, you know, if he wasn't sloshed at all times, he would like

397
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
hallucinate freaky shit and like just, just vomiting in the streets and like barely knows

398
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
where he is most of the time.

399
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah.

400
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I mean like, if you're real deep in it, you get like withdrawal and like you're fucked

401
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and you have to like detox.

402
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Uh.

403
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I mean, I know something about withdrawals.

404
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let me tell you, because I didn't have no weed yesterday and it was not easy to get

405
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to sleep, but.

406
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Um, no.

407
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No, man.

408
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No, drinking's gay.

409
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Drinking's for the birds.

410
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Uh, I can't, I can't wait to be above the influence again.

411
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I really, I very, very drink anymore.

412
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And it's, it's funny because, uh, people used to like identify me as the guy who drinks.

413
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I mean, your Twitter profile says like getting drunk and ranting about anime.

414
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I, I, one time I almost changed it to say getting high and ranting about anime or whatever,

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
but, uh, it's just about the way that people respond to those two things.

416
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's really funny how like how normal it is to people to drink or to say you drink.

417
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Um, but not the same when you say you smoke pot, not yet anyway, but people have a very

418
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
different set of assumptions about that.

419
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And like, it was just funny to me how like when I started smoking pot, it started coming

420
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
up a lot in my comments, like, oh, did you use high?

421
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's why this video is like this.

422
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
When like, I was like, but I've been, but I used to be drunk in all the videos.

423
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like what?

424
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is this the trade off?

425
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Like, how do you tell the difference between a high video and a drunk video?

426
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I wonder.

427
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah.

428
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Both of those things kind of, I don't like.

429
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
One is, one is, one is normal.

430
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Equally.

431
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You gotta live a little bit.

432
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I live the way I like to live.

433
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I find, let's, dude, let's peer pressure mage.

434
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No, you will not succeed.

435
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am a contrarian.

436
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How do you know you don't like it?

437
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How do you know you don't like it?

438
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If you haven't tried it, don't you know all the cool kids do it?

439
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I have tried alcohol and my, my family likes to sometimes tease me.

440
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Like, at least they used to, and they were like, Hey, try this, try that.

441
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And I hate it.

442
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
All alcohol tastes the same to me.

443
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I even smell alcohol in deodorant and I don't like it using the deodorant.

444
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So why didn't you keep drinking it?

445
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Huh?

446
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What are you, pussy?

447
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Huh?

448
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You some kind of pussy?

449
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Then it's not gonna work.

450
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Um, I mean, wait, there are drinks that don't taste that.

451
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I have to say, I don't think anybody likes alcohol.

452
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Like, I mean, I could probably full stop that, but I don't think anybody likes it at first.

453
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Like, it's, it's a, it is an acquired taste.

454
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't try not to acquire that.

455
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You got to start with the drinks that don't taste like it.

456
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Right?

457
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You got to start with like your free, like bullshit.

458
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
All drinks tastes like that.

459
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
All drinks tastes like alcohol.

460
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No, no, no, no.

461
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You start with my card.

462
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Ever have like a, like a, like a sex on the beach or something, or like some kind of

463
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
fucking wine cooler or whatever.

464
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It just tastes like juice.

465
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I've tasted like really weak ass ones that they would even give to minors that had a

466
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
little bit of alcohol in them.

467
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I can taste the alcohol in it and I hate it.

468
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Though there were more tolerable than like beer or something like that, at least I'll

469
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
say that much because they had the extra flavors to them.

470
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Nobody likes being unconvinced.

471
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay.

472
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The only kind of alcohol I like is the one that comes in like chocolate candy.

473
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There you go.

474
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There you go.

475
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You just got to drink Kahlua then.

476
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's what you got to do.

477
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No, no, no.

478
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It has to come in candy form and in small doses.

479
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So if I, if I take a, if I take a pot right now and I melt down like half a pot's worth

480
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
of candy bars and then I fill the rest with alcohol and then put it in the freezer and

481
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
send it to you.

482
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Would you eat my alcoholic chocolate?

483
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
No.

484
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No.

485
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
All right.

486
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Well.

487
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Boo.

488
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Worth a shot.

489
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I got some.

490
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What if I made you weed candies though and said no.

491
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hell yeah.

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No, weed smells terrible.

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I hate it.

494
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Like I can smell.

495
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I hate the smell of weed.

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can smell like in the neighborhood.

497
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Whenever someone smokes.

498
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It smells bad man.

499
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't like it.

500
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's beautiful.

501
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It smells like a.

502
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's all like a field of flowers.

503
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Field of.

504
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah.

505
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Have I told the story about how one time in my dorm I was trying to like microwave

506
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
peanut butter cookies with weed on them to like get the weed in the THC into the fat

507
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
of the peanut butter.

508
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I microwave them to I microwave them too much and I burnt the cookies in the microwave.

509
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This was in college and the fucking dorm or TA or whatever.

510
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The RA was coming down to the hall and we were like shit.

511
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We got us.

512
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We got a stash it.

513
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So we just had to shove these like burnt super heated peanut butter weed cookies into

514
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
our mouths and it tasted like ashes and it filled my sinuses with the smell.

515
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The weed smell and it burns.

516
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That sounds like the worst.

517
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

518
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It was awful.

519
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't like.

520
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's what I think of every time I smell.

521
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I wouldn't want to smell weed emanating from my own body.

522
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
From my own like inside of my mouth which is currently burning.

523
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's I understand why that would.

524
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

525
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That would be traumatic.

526
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The smell of weed.

527
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It was.

528
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It really was.

529
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Also there was a time there was one time in college when I smoked weed and it I must

530
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
have had something in it because it made me fucked up.

531
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It like it made me.

532
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Probably did.

533
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah.

534
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It like I remember I smoked some weed and then I went to a party and I was at the party

535
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and I could like it was like a bodily sensation and I could feel the fan like the ceiling

536
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
fan was on above me and I could feel that the air blasting down at me on the ceiling fan

537
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
like I was in a wind tunnel and it was like drying me out and dehydrating me and I couldn't

538
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
move and I thought I would die which doesn't sound like what weed is supposed to do.

539
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know.

540
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Curious what drug.

541
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah.

542
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I would.

543
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'd be interested.

544
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This was not.

545
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This was not normal.

546
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But anyway.

547
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You know I tried C.B.D. and by tried C.B.D.

548
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I mean that I walked into a store that was giving out tiny little paper cup samples of C.B.D.

549
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
lemonade and they don't even ID check.

550
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Lemonade.

551
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah.

552
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Just they don't even ID check.

553
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You don't have to be above 18 to do C.B.D.

554
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I didn't.

555
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I didn't know that.

556
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah.

557
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They gave.

558
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It doesn't have any psychoactive properties.

559
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I guess it makes sense.

560
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And you know what?

561
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It didn't do anything.

562
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So there you go.

563
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean it seems like a huge meme to me.

564
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Like I guess Tom has had some good experience with C.B.D.

565
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
because it's meant to basically have the physical effects of weed without the mental effects

566
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
essentially.

567
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I mean it's already in weed.

568
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah.

569
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But it's you know it's the C.B.D. without the THC.

570
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Tom was taking it as a way of helping with his back.

571
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Although he was also just smoking weed.

572
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So I don't know which he did more of.

573
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Did Tom smoke weed or did he start using it with the C.B.D.

574
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
vape?

575
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Was he a smoking weed kind of guy?

576
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
No.

577
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's because of the fact that when he went to New York to hang out with his friends

578
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
they had they gave him weed and because he had back problems he realized oh I need this

579
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and started smoking.

580
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Liz in Boston where it's legal so it's not impossible to acquire.

581
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So it's way easier to buy C.B.D. so you can just get it on Amazon so I would assume he

582
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
did more of that.

583
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I actually had I actually had everyone I had I had Tom and I had Zen over to my house

584
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the other day for friend's mess.

585
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
My roommates we had a feast.

586
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
There was antipasto.

587
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
There was lasagna.

588
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There was chicken parm.

589
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
No pasto allowed.

590
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We were totally antipasto and everyone was like hey Tom you're walking again.

591
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Nice.

592
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And you know what?

593
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It was great.

594
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Honestly the best part of the holiday was friend mess.

595
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It was magical.

596
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That boy completely wasted.

597
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He stays on his feet the rest of his life.

598
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Never sits down again.

599
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah.

600
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And I don't remember going to sleep.

601
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And I never will.

602
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Never will again.

603
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Fuck sleep.

604
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

605
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So yeah that's been my holiday season.

606
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I had I worked a lot and then did a crimbus.

607
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So but you know we could we could reflect on the decade that just ended.

608
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh my God.

609
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Was it a good one?

610
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Was it a shit one?

611
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We all met this decade.

612
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The whole PCP happened this decade.

613
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Was that a net positive or a net negative?

614
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

615
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It was an experience.

616
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If I look at the whole decade I would have to say it's been pretty good.

617
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah overall.

618
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I mean before the PCP before doing any of my shit online I had no direction in life.

619
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Frankly the last 10 years was a third of your life a almost a third of my life.

620
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And it's kind of hard not to like I mean it's the first it's the first third where we were like completely independent adults.

621
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So it's like it's almost not a competition between this and previous decades at least for me.

622
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah it's like before.

623
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I mean for me it's I shouldn't say it's almost it's definitely not a competition for me.

624
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Like the 90s and 2000s don't have fuck at all on the 2010s.

625
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Wait a decade ago yeah a decade ago I was still in college so like I had basically had no life.

626
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I basically had like made no choices in life whatsoever so.

627
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
For me for me it started off really really shitty but things have been going up since then

628
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and are continuing to go up I think.

629
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So I'm pretty happy with the decade overall.

630
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Up and away.

631
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Indeed.

632
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah.

633
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Ben's thinking he didn't end this decade on the on the highest point of the decade.

634
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't feel like I don't feel like I've ended it that strongly.

635
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I feel like I'm.

636
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's fine.

637
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's fine.

638
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No it's a disaster.

639
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
No no it's fine.

640
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
No it's a huge nightmare.

641
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No no.

642
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I've been feeling very I felt very stagnant.

643
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I felt very stagnant the last maybe in the last couple years I guess.

644
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I feel like I haven't made as much progress in my life as I wanted to.

645
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
If you if you're if you're healing blues put a splash of red make purple.

646
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Purple makes things better.

647
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh my god.

648
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah I guess I'll give it a shot.

649
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Splash of red huh.

650
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Fucking stab stab stab.

651
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That'll fix it.

652
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I was wondering if you'll come to that conclusion.

653
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Ben turns around to his entirely blue painted room considering maybe a splash of red will.

654
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Holds gun to my head.

655
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No.

656
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Maybe that's just what the doctor ordered.

657
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That is not where I was intending for it to go.

658
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Hey what stinks in here.

659
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh my god.

660
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes.

661
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Ben was just talking about killing himself.

662
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh yeah that sounds good.

663
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Hell yeah.

664
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I was not encouraging this.

665
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Now there's a New Year's resolution we can get behind.

666
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You know Ben what is it form follows function or whatever the fuck because you just died in my nuzlocke just yesterday.

667
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I heard yeah I heard it.

668
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I heard that Ben's.

669
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It was a slaughter Ben.

670
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
His hypnosis didn't get the job done.

671
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay you know.

672
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Hey Nate what if we did a tribute to the dead Ben saint by on after I count to three we all just say Ben saint and then we'll do the same thing again.

673
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Oh good idea.

674
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So here's our tribute.

675
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
One two three.

676
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Ben saint.

677
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
One two three.

678
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Ben saint.

679
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Alright great tribute.

680
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Pour one out for my little my little my little man man.

681
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And just that very day I had retweeted some adorable art of the brothers united.

682
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh god.

683
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I also retweeted that.

684
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Did you follow my instructions and never switch him out under any circumstances.

685
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You know I actually did switch him out for pure strategic benefit but he died nonetheless.

686
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Well he's probably glad to be dead then.

687
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Better to die than a hero than live a coward.

688
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's so unfortunate I got into a situation where I switched in sheep over I won't go on about this but like sheep over my Zubat.

689
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I switched in just to die.

690
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It was like a level five Zubat so that I could get that you know you get the turn in with somebody else whatever after it dies.

691
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And if only I had had Russell on my team who's yearning for death.

692
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Who's craving death as a rat attack to be reborn as a ghastly one day but we'll see.

693
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We'll see if that happens.

694
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Anyway tune in on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

695
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Twitch.tv slash definitely best gamer for the Nuzlocke adventure.

696
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Alright anyway.

697
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So Nate we were talking about whether or not we thought the last decade went good.

698
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I think we all pretty much concluded that it had little competition since it's the first decade where we were like autonomous adults.

699
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That is a totally fair metric and yes there's nothing to compare it to for us.

700
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You know I did happen to hear.

701
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Well except for childhood.

702
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I was saying a decade ago I was in college so I hadn't done anything.

703
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It's such a different experience of like I can take no ownership over how good or bad my life was the previous decade really.

704
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Because I like I guess I did my homework.

705
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So you know life was better than if I hadn't.

706
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But currently I mean yeah we've all been kind of building up careers in one avenue or another.

707
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So we can actually have some autonomy over it.

708
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm pretty happy with how things are going.

709
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Life is generally pretty good.

710
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But sounds slightly more optimistic than bad.

711
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But yeah I would think so.

712
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You know that's fine.

713
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's fine.

714
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's cool.

715
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Just remember the splash of red and then I'll feel better.

716
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I don't know.

717
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm in a stage as everybody knows about trying to do a YouTube thing full time.

718
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I have not gotten where I need to be yet with that.

719
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But I'm making some changes and I think in the bonus episode I talked about this a little bit more.

720
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah because that was our New Year's resolution one.

721
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So if you want to hear more about it you should go listen to that.

722
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Or be pledged to me.

723
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm going to do a fucking update on my Patreon too.

724
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Whatever.

725
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm making some changes in order to do that for the new year.

726
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So I'm feeling pretty positive.

727
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think some good things are coming in the future for me.

728
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And for me the worst case scenario is that all this YouTube shit completely falls through.

729
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And then what's the tragedy of my life?

730
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I go find some pretty cushy programming job again.

731
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And I just do that while doing YouTube on the side.

732
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So am I that worried about how things will go?

733
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Not really.

734
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm going to still be doing stuff online so I'm not going to go anywhere pretty much no matter what.

735
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And I feel generally secure that financially I'll be okay.

736
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I guess so yeah I'm feeling pretty decent.

737
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't mind getting a real job if I have to.

738
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Which I did for a long time before doing YouTube full time.

739
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So that pretty much sums me up.

740
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yeah well the 2010s for me.

741
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Excellent fucking decade.

742
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The other decades I was miserable and depressed.

743
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So there wasn't much competition from those.

744
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But this was like a honestly just a pretty much clean upswing across the decade for me.

745
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I mean there's rough patches in different areas.

746
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But like the overall experience is like pretty much as good as I've had it right now.

747
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So I'm feeling pretty good about going into 2020.

748
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's a little like oh man this decade was almost too good.

749
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Could it really be better?

750
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Or will it inevitably get worse?

751
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But who knows.

752
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm going to try to make it better.

753
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You know one particular aspect that is a definite decline.

754
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay actually you know what this is fascinating because I don't know if you guys talked about like our Christmas time

755
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and visiting the folks or anything.

756
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But me and Ben were back at our parents place for a little bit.

757
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You know Ben gets there I think a little more regularly than I do.

758
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But going back there like my parents live in a wonderful house in excuse me in like I guess you'd call it a suburb

759
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
of relatively rural Massachusetts near the Cape.

760
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So it's like a beautiful location.

761
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You know it's cold as Massachusetts is.

762
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But it's a great house.

763
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You know they've been saving up their old lives.

764
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They've been very financially responsible.

765
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So they've got a great little place there.

766
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Very similar to our old house.

767
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But like when I'm there I feel the icy grip of my father's authority

768
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
wrapped around my fucking throat.

769
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And it is suffocating.

770
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It is truly suffocating.

771
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Nothing is harder than going back to living under your family in my opinion.

772
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's so true.

773
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And one example like we've had so many.

774
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Our dog Sessho sleeps with us like in our bed on the end most of the time.

775
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm always fucking kicking him because he's leaning against me.

776
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I kick the shit out of that dog every now while I'm sleeping.

777
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But generally it's nice.

778
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But like it was unthinkable that the dogs would even be upstairs.

779
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And like while it was funny we all got we all drank and we were all having a good time.

780
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And like in like on the night of Christmas or whatever.

781
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Grace brings up my parents dog Beanie and like sleeps with her in the bed.

782
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And like it wasn't like a huge deal.

783
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But like that was something unthinkable in our youth.

784
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And I think my dad was at least mildly off put by that reality which is just.

785
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I get it.

786
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You know you understand the reasons for it.

787
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You gotta put you gotta fuck with your parents.

788
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You gotta do it.

789
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Like I mean speaking personally I you know my relationship with my parents is such that I respect them.

790
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But I will also just dig into them if they you know are being annoying or you know or making my life more difficult.

791
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So you know when I'm around my my family like it's not that my my dad's not really a problem.

792
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
He's also kind of off in his own world and just a 80 D reading his phone or whatever.

793
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Like everybody else is the ones you have to like snap into into focus and organization.

794
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So you know I try to basically be like all right I'm the man of the house now bitch everybody's gonna listen to me you know.

795
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:11,000
As much as I can just because like yeah being in a in a being used to being your own you know man of the house I do what I fucking want.

796
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Everything's on my schedule in my terms and then you go to some you know either your parents or you know when I go to May's parents house which is more often by far.

797
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Which she doesn't mind at all because you know she's not usually the one setting all the timetables and everything anyways.

798
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
But when I'm at her dad's house it's just like well I am no longer in control so I just kind of like completely let go you know.

799
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I just like achieve a Zen state and I just turn my brain off as best I can and veg veg around.

800
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah right approach.

801
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's the right approach.

802
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Being at your parents place you just kind of give your permission to just ignore everything just like you know whatever they're taking care of it.

803
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Don't even think.

804
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Not my house.

805
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Not my problem.

806
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh you guys can't decide what you want to do.

807
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Well I don't care what we do so I'll be over here.

808
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm not going to argue.

809
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm not going to sit around and fight with everybody.

810
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm not going to try to take any authority.

811
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Y'all figure shit out.

812
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I mean I'm just a kid.

813
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm just a baby.

814
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I haven't talked about so many times like when you're a content creator or whatever like all your time could be devoted to that.

815
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But like this is why I noticed like there's a couple of aspects like I rarely think about like how to have fun like actively.

816
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Like sure I'll veg out and watch a movie just to like distract myself.

817
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But when I'm on vacation anywhere that's when I like I exercise more.

818
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I like actively do fun relaxing things more like with intent and therefore I enjoy them more because I'm like I can't even do work even if I fucking want to.

819
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So I have to find enjoyable things to do.

820
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So it's it's good.

821
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I don't know.

822
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's a good thing to have for me.

823
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It can be hard depending on where you are to find things to do.

824
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I mean like I said if I'm at like a maze house for instance you know yeah first of all it's in Rochester.

825
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's a frozen tundra.

826
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
There's snow everywhere because we went for Thanksgiving and I did drive around a bit.

827
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But like when we were our plan when we went was like oh we're going to go all over town.

828
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
We're going to like revisit everywhere we've been.

829
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But it's like when you're trying to also do things with other people it's just like you can't force anything.

830
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You know it's not so simple as like all right everybody in the fam we're all going to go to this place at seven o'clock and that's what we're going to do.

831
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's like somebody's going to be like I'm not going to show up and say I can do eight and then it's just like you know what we're just going to hang out at your dad's house to let people come and go as they please.

832
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You know like I'm not going to fucking try to do anything.

833
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So I had a good time though.

834
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah I mean I had a great time too.

835
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But like you know we were talking about like I don't know we all gave ourselves each other our little gifts.

836
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I mean I got like my parents like some chocolates and stuff with a whole session of diarrhea sagas famously everyone knows but whatever.

837
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So like the gifts don't really matter anymore.

838
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So we were talking about like maybe for next Christmas just doing like a destination holiday or something.

839
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I mean you know we put out Hawaii or who knows where we could go.

840
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Hold on.

841
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Are you telling me Nate that you told a story about a diarrhea saga on this podcast and it was not the title of one of the episodes.

842
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
What are we doing.

843
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I guess that's a fair point.

844
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's not any of our diarrhea.

845
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That's right.

846
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I mean how long did the story go on for.

847
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I never think it was that long.

848
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I think that's why the story is just that Seshio ate some chocolate and got diarrhea.

849
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah in a nutshell.

850
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Well you can boil any story down to a boring story.

851
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I mean what difference does it make right.

852
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We name the podcast always after one thing in three hour discussion.

853
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Diarrhea Saga.

854
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That's a title.

855
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Perhaps he's right.

856
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Who suggests the titles these days.

857
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Thought that would be off putting.

858
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't know.

859
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You know I didn't correct him.

860
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
No off putting is what we is on brand for the PCP.

861
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Well that's true.

862
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Anyway Seshio ate chocolate.

863
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Got diarrhea everywhere.

864
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's a nightmare.

865
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It still haunts this place to this day.

866
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's a good thing he survived.

867
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Now that I think about it we could easily change the name of our podcast to Diarrhea Saga.

868
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And I don't think it would be a bad idea.

869
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
We're already the poop craps denators podcast.

870
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So you know we have a storied history of poop related stories.

871
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
We should do the poop episode and just go all in.

872
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm definitely down.

873
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That's a great idea.

874
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I can't believe we never did that actually.

875
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Have we done that?

876
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah we've done hygiene and I think that was discussed but not at any length.

877
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So I don't know.

878
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Poop episode is genuinely a great idea and we should do it.

879
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's a real money maker.

880
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You know what?

881
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You're not wrong.

882
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
People in the comments will finally be satiated.

883
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
They'll finally stop clamoring.

884
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Easily talk for three hours.

885
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I bet we could rope Jesse into that one too.

886
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I bet we could do it.

887
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Oh I hope.

888
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I mean I don't think we could do it without him.

889
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I think it would be unright.

890
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It would be.

891
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It would be a wrong.

892
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Uncool.

893
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm ready.

894
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Every comment would be where's Jesse.

895
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay well let's toss that one out and see which fish we can reel in from our little pond here.

896
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh I was going to say though.

897
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
This is kind of unreliable.

898
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I was just talking about vacations or whatever.

899
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So me and Michelle were talking about we're probably going to take another trip out relatively

900
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
soon to see her folks in Hawaii and like generously they are like I don't know like her dad got

901
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
some money so like he's willing to pay for the tickets but like because it's like it's

902
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
not during the holidays.

903
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We were thinking about like in February sometime that's like the prices are like so discounted.

904
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's going to be probably like 12 to 1300 or so for like both of us for a round trip

905
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
which is way better than it has been previously so that's pretty sick.

906
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But like when I'm there I cannot wait because I can't do work there and I have to relax

907
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and I have to do fun activities.

908
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't know and I'm just going to go surfing in the middle of fucking winter when it's

909
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
like hell here in Cincinnati and I'll be able to escape the horrible lifestyle that we have

910
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
there.

911
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh you know what I was making a point about that which was just that like the environment

912
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
we live in here is so much shittier than like the house I grew up in in you know back east

913
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
with my parents or like obviously when we take a trip to Hawaii or anything like that

914
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and like this is the one way that my life has like gotten worse I would say.

915
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Right now me and Michelle live in a decent apartment in Cincinnati it's fine.

916
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
We're in the ghetto which sucks.

917
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
This very day I was walking around just walking sesho and like he's just pooping.

918
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
He's holding a bag to pick up the poop and like a lady drives by and just yells at me

919
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and says like hey you can't let him poop there like on a neighbor's lawn.

920
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think she doesn't think that I live here because I'm white and this is like an all black neighborhood

921
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
basically.

922
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But I'm just like oh no I have a bag and she's like that's still rude and I just yell why.

923
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Why?

924
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And she just drives off before answering the question.

925
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
She had no fucking answer.

926
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
No I mean I'm prepared.

927
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I will not leave a mark.

928
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm being very responsible.

929
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
This is my neighborhood.

930
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But I mean people you know.

931
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
What do you recommend doing about the fact.

932
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What do you recommend I do about the fact that our next door neighbor lets their dog

933
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
seemingly shit all over our yard.

934
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

935
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It may that would probably count as littering.

936
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I think you should you should in a friendly way if you haven't talked to him about it

937
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
before I would I would fucking never spoken to them in any way.

938
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Okay.

939
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I think here's what you should do.

940
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You should.

941
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
This is what I would do.

942
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I would actually get a like a friend gift kind of thing like a pie just like and go over

943
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
and introduce yourself first because you want to get off the right foot and be like hey

944
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
we're neighbors never came over just never from the time but like here's a little gift

945
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
you know we move into the neighborhood just want to you know be friendly neighbors.

946
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's been six months.

947
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I think.

948
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It's never too late.

949
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's never too late.

950
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Just do what I did.

951
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Just get high on Molly and go over to your neighbor's house at four in the morning knock on the door.

952
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Easy peasy.

953
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm trying to get a solution.

954
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah.

955
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Don't and ruin any.

956
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
All right.

957
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Hold on.

958
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
What do you think of this idea that I had.

959
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I had an idea of putting a sign in the yard or on the porch.

960
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
No.

961
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Don't do it.

962
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Okay.

963
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
All right.

964
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
No.

965
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Finish your plan.

966
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
All right.

967
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Well I was going to have a sign that says if your dog shits in my yard I'm going to

968
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
eat your dog.

969
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Okay.

970
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Look that's funny and I like it but what that won't do is make your neighbors like

971
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
you more.

972
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't want them to like me.

973
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I want them to make their dogs stop shitting in my yard.

974
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I also thought about just putting up an electric fence.

975
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The two problems are one and the same.

976
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I think those two problems are linked because if they, if they, right now you're a faceless

977
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
nameless creature who lives in this thing and you're not a human being to them.

978
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
But if they know you and they know your name and they don't think about you at all.

979
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
What if I took a shit on their porch in the middle of the night.

980
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Well you'll just start a gang war.

981
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
You'll start a shit war.

982
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
A shit flinging war.

983
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I like where that's going.

984
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Which would be good.

985
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I don't want my speed.

986
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm telling you.

987
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
This is what you do.

988
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Apple pie shit.

989
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,400
You put on your Sunday, you put on your Sunday best pajama pants and you trot yourself over

990
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,000
there and you knock on the door and you say, hi, I'm, I'm Mr. Digi bro.

991
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You may know me for my wonderful, my little pony reviews.

992
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And you introduce yourself and you say, hey, you know, hey, I'm going to be honest.

993
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
There's a little bit of an ulterior motive now that we've met.

994
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm just wondering if your dog's pooping lawn.

995
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I just wanted to kindly ask if that's you.

996
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
This is, no.

997
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I don't feel like this will even work.

998
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
They're going to think you're a fucking little bitch who buys things for people who let their

999
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
dog shit in their yard.

1000
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
They will appreciate the courtesy and the neighborliness.

1001
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I guarantee you they're not thinking about the fact that their dog shits in your yard.

1002
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
They will not, they will not connect those two events and they might, until you explicitly

1003
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
make a thing out of it.

1004
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I mean, I'm just going to burn their house down.

1005
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You don't, you don't go in hot saying like, hey, your dog shouldn't hear, stop that,

1006
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
because it might not even theoretically be their dog.

1007
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
You phrasing the form of a question, I would say.

1008
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I think you should.

1009
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But I would, I would talk to them.

1010
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And it doesn't have to be, it could be perfectly nice.

1011
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You could make a friend in the act.

1012
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I, I think.

1013
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't want to be friends with those people.

1014
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I know.

1015
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I want to drive a monster truck to their house.

1016
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It opposes our generation's, you know, state of mind.

1017
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We don't like to do these things, but.

1018
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's not about what I like.

1019
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
They just seem like, you know, those people.

1020
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You know what I mean?

1021
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Are they normos?

1022
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Disgusting normies?

1023
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I don't even know.

1024
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Boomers?

1025
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I actually have, I can't like picture them well enough to think what, what I think they

1026
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
are.

1027
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Well, fair enough.

1028
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You gotta open your heart.

1029
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You gotta open your heart, did you?

1030
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Well, I live, I live in the fucking city.

1031
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't know any of my neighbors and we all just have a general animosity towards each

1032
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
other, which is unfortunate.

1033
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That's fucked up.

1034
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You know.

1035
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
That's fucked up, man.

1036
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I don't like it.

1037
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I, yeah, but I'm not going to do anything about it because I am a loser and I just

1038
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
stay in my apartment.

1039
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And that's, that's life.

1040
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That's life.

1041
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
What a nightmare.

1042
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I could knock on these fucking people's doors and introduce, like if I lived in a suburb,

1043
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I would do it, but I live in the ghetto.

1044
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So I'm going to, I'm going to avoid that.

1045
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
All right.

1046
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Here's non sequitur, but I'm interested in you guys' thoughts on this and the audience's

1047
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
thoughts on this idea.

1048
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I, I brought it up in the chat the other day, but nobody responded.

1049
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So I had this, this vision of like what if the PCP was given like a budget to make a

1050
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
show?

1051
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Like if we were given like one million dollars.

1052
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Like Sam Hyde was back in the day?

1053
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Like even, I was thinking more like when Casey Neistat got funded to make that show that

1054
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
they sold to HBO for two million bucks.

1055
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You know what I mean?

1056
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Like just having somebody who was like, who looked at our group of people and said, I

1057
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
have money.

1058
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm going to give you guys money to make something and we're going to try to sell it to a network.

1059
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Right?

1060
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Like if we had a budget of even just like half a million dollars, maybe not even that much.

1061
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
One, three IRL arena.

1062
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That idea alone, I think proves that we've got chops to do cool shit.

1063
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yeah.

1064
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Well, here's my idea.

1065
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
All right.

1066
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So if we have a big enough budget, what we're going to do is first we buy a house outright

1067
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
with the budget, then we just spend like a month near this house.

1068
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Like we can either stay in it, around it, wherever we have all this money to fuck with.

1069
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So all the money is going to be about keeping everybody in the vicinity of this house for

1070
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
a month as we just destroy it.

1071
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,440
Like just completely demolish this house.

1072
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,360
So like we would start the first week would mostly be us like live streaming and taking

1073
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,080
behind the scenes footage as we decorate the house.

1074
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,760
So first we would just like paint all over the walls, floors everywhere, draw shit all

1075
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,320
over the place, fucking just do whatever we want to the place to make it into like a bunch

1076
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,400
of sets.

1077
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,280
And then we would film a whole bunch of shows on these sets and in the process of course

1078
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,080
just destroy them as soon as we're done, get tons of footage of us just breaking this

1079
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,400
house until finally when we're done, we just lay it to the fucking ground like we either

1080
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
burn it down or demolish it.

1081
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,400
Bulldoze it.

1082
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Yeah.

1083
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
You know, I like this.

1084
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
I have a pitch.

1085
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,080
I think we should paint a daisy on the front door or on the top of the house and we name

1086
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,320
this project Daisy's Destruction 2 and what is that in reference to?

1087
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,320
You don't know.

1088
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,640
You don't know Daisy's Destruction is this horrible like, like I think it's like a pedophilic

1089
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,320
like a snuff film about like the execution.

1090
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
All right.

1091
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,800
Well, let's not name it.

1092
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:23,320
I still think it's a solid idea, but I think we should name it Diarrhea Saga.

1093
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:29,720
Yeah, it's no Daisy's Destruction, but I guess it'll do the job.

1094
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,720
Yeah.

1095
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,080
Well, it sounds amusing.

1096
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,040
I would do it if someone wants to come along and give us, how much you think we have to

1097
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,040
get for this?

1098
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,960
I think we could do this for 30 grand if we get a small house, maybe 40 grand.

1099
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
I have no idea.

1100
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,160
It depends on how much it costs to outright buy a house that we have no intentions of

1101
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,160
reselling.

1102
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,720
And we could do that in the middle of nowhere, like cheap real estate.

1103
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,720
Right.

1104
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,080
That was what I was thinking is it would be because down in, you know, in like Western

1105
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:01,160
Virginia or North Carolina, there's just tons of these houses that are just isolated.

1106
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,200
They're just on random plots of land in the middle of fucking nowhere, you know?

1107
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,120
So yeah, we could easily find a house that nobody cares about on a plot of land nobody

1108
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,000
cares about and just lay waste to it.

1109
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,680
I think I'd have to look into the legality of all that, but you know, I think it would

1110
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,120
definitely be a hell of a lot of fun.

1111
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,800
I mean, I definitely agree.

1112
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,400
But you know, that reminds me of, go on.

1113
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,160
We would probably risk serious injury if we were actually like, like breaking the house

1114
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,080
down to the point that like, to the point that like, anything was like actually falling

1115
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,080
apart.

1116
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,440
We would be in serious physical danger.

1117
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Yeah.

1118
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,720
Yeah, you're right.

1119
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,440
We just got to be careful about the structural integrity of rooms that we're in from top

1120
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
to bottom.

1121
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,960
We have to go top to bottom.

1122
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,840
If the things we break are more like walls and we start on the top floor and then make

1123
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,360
our way down, that wouldn't necessarily interfere with the structural integrity like, like, like

1124
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,360
you say.

1125
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,000
Actually, it would be kind of funny if maybe we were like only allowed in like the attic

1126
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,960
for a while and like we had to like destroy it as fast as possible and only when there

1127
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,960
was just was no attic left.

1128
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,520
Are we allowed to go down?

1129
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Yeah.

1130
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,920
I mean, I was thinking more like using like the destruction of the house over the course

1131
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:25,240
of the span would be more minor, like more like just wrecking things inside the house.

1132
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,080
Wrecking the house itself would come more towards the end because we want the whole house to

1133
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,600
be a bunch of sets that we can film shit on, you know, but like just make a huge mess.

1134
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,000
Kind of like what we did with the plebe and the weeb, you know, where there's at the end,

1135
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,200
it was a fucking just total disaster zone, you know, but just do that except also we

1136
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,120
tear down the whole structure of the building at the end.

1137
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
Yeah.

1138
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,920
Depending on the format, maybe we could all wear destructo cams and kind of have it, you

1139
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,760
know, Radcon Arena, IRL style.

1140
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,840
I imagine like you watch you watch it out of sequence and just like some episodes like

1141
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,840
there's a door there and other episodes, there's not.

1142
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,120
Sometimes there are more windows than others, you know, something when did the when did

1143
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
the rug?

1144
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,400
Haruhi, Suzumiya release style.

1145
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
Yeah.

1146
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:17,240
I just I always think back to there's this series from I think vice called thumbs up.

1147
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,760
I might have talked about this before about two guys who like hitchhiked their way across

1148
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,640
the country and there's one bit in one of the early episodes where they stop off in

1149
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,320
like a ghost town because there's all these, you know, there's always like random derelict

1150
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,400
buildings and towns on the railroad tracks that aren't used anymore.

1151
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,480
So they decided to just like sleep in one of these random derelict buildings.

1152
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,760
It's like all covered in graffiti and stuff.

1153
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,120
And then the next morning they're like, now let's tear shit up and they just like pull

1154
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:50,040
out a gun and start just like shooting windows out and just like they kick a whole wall over

1155
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,080
and it's just like, oh man, you can fucking do whatever you want to a house that nobody

1156
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,080
cares about.

1157
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,080
Like, that's true.

1158
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,720
I don't know about the legality of firing guns randomly inside house, probably fine.

1159
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,880
If you own the house, you could definitely do it, depending on the state you live in.

1160
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,160
I'm worried about like the bullet travel, but fuck it, whatever.

1161
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,160
I'm sure it's fine.

1162
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,400
It sounds like a great time to me.

1163
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,720
Fucking Hunter Thompson used to fire guns on his property all the fucking time.

1164
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,720
That's fair.

1165
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,720
That's fair.

1166
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,320
As I'm sure many people still do.

1167
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,920
You know, this reminds me of a thing I've been thinking about, which is the premise

1168
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
of this thing.

1169
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,200
Which incidentally, if we're doing that show, got to buy some guns.

1170
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,200
Probably yes.

1171
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Got to buy some real guns.

1172
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,200
I was thinking about, you were saying like the rocket launcher, if we can find one.

1173
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
That would be nice.

1174
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,200
That would be nice.

1175
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,480
The initiating thing that has to be there is like an investment from like some benefactor

1176
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,400
or studio or something like that.

1177
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,480
I'm all for that.

1178
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,800
But what I was thinking about was like, it's interesting to note how most of us are out

1179
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,280
here doing our shit and we're trying to survive on Patreon.

1180
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,240
At this moment, I mean, let's be real.

1181
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,560
The only one who's truly succeeded financially in this model is Digi.

1182
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,560
I'm working on it.

1183
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,560
I'm hoping to get there.

1184
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,080
But, you know, not there yet, but whatever.

1185
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,080
We're working on it.

1186
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,160
The rest of us are kind of scraping out various degrees of what you call survival in quotation

1187
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,560
at, you know, at a lowly state.

1188
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,240
But it seems to me like the dream of Patreon and all these things is like the people fund

1189
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,560
you because they like your work and they keep you afloat, blah, blah, blah, and we're all

1190
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,560
working on that.

1191
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,560
That's what I'm trying to do too.

1192
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,480
But it seems that like the vast majority of people require like, there are like these

1193
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,000
little micro-sponsorships that go around now from like fucking Audible and stuff and that's

1194
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
fine.

1195
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,880
But like there's lots of like big donors necessary for even what seems like like indie businesses.

1196
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,160
When you look into it a little bit, you find out that there's like a large, like a billionaire

1197
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,880
or like a large corporation like funding the success of this business.

1198
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,760
And when I learned that, it's like, oh, I guess they didn't.

1199
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:00,160
I mean, they didn't really make it just on like the strength of their product.

1200
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,520
I mean, I don't want to be an asshole because some of these started before Patreon had distanced

1201
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
stuff.

1202
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,360
I think it would be almost unreasonable to expect anybody doing anything that involves

1203
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,120
pre-production to not be backed by somebody.

1204
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,800
The kind of work that we do has so little pre-production that and even when we have to do it, we do

1205
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,360
a whole Kickstarter for it.

1206
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,760
We'll do a Kickstarter just to fly people out to a location to do work that doesn't

1207
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,000
require any setup.

1208
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But I really think that investment is the only way you're going to get like the ability

1209
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,440
to do something bigger than what you can just do by yourself with your own money.

1210
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,960
And I mean, technically Kickstarter is meant to be an investment platform.

1211
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,780
The idea is that the people supporting you are investors in this thing just to some degree.

1212
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:55,760
But even if they're not getting like money back from it, but like I do have to think

1213
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,760
that...

1214
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,200
I was thinking about this recently that it's baffling to me that there is not more investment

1215
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,680
going on like in YouTube, in internet creation.

1216
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:11,040
And maybe it's just because of the fact that it has worked so little in the past.

1217
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,840
Like that, you know, previous times they've tried to have YouTubers do that kind of stuff.

1218
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
It just hasn't worked.

1219
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,920
And most YouTubers just think, oh, well, I make way more money just doing my own daily

1220
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,520
content instead.

1221
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:28,520
But like I think that what people are missing is that the people who need the investments

1222
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,760
are the smaller channels.

1223
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,800
Like the big ones who already have millions of subs who already are proven successes,

1224
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,200
they don't need to do anything that involves pre-production.

1225
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,200
They're already successful.

1226
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,960
But like the potential in let's say a group like the PCP, and I don't even know if we

1227
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,200
would succeed or if anybody would care about the product we produce.

1228
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:56,560
But like a group like ours will very much conform to what we have, to what we can do.

1229
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,540
When we do Radcon, we do basically whatever we can afford and whatever we have the time

1230
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,200
for with the people and the place that we have.

1231
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,640
So like a group like ours, if we did have an investment from somebody, you know, we

1232
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,000
would definitely find a way to use it to make something unique.

1233
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,840
And I think it's surprising that there's not more like talent scouts trying to like

1234
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,360
search the internet for people who could do things like that.

1235
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,720
But I don't know, maybe it would have to be us who would have to approach somebody about

1236
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
it.

1237
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:32,200
Maybe we could find some fucking freaky billionaire who loves anime and just wants to give us

1238
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,200
a million dollars to destroy our house.

1239
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,600
I know Baron Trump's a big fan of the animes.

1240
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,240
Oh fuck!

1241
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,440
I gotta reach out to Baron Trump.

1242
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,000
I'm not even joking.

1243
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:54,280
That's my 2020s resolution is to get Baron Trump to bankroll a PCP house destruction project.

1244
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:01,680
I guess I wonder like for them, like how they would get a return on investment with

1245
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,680
them.

1246
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,880
I mean, when you're a billionaire, your concern is probably at least preserve the money I

1247
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,480
currently have, which seems relatively easy if you're investing in smart ways.

1248
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,920
Our production would be so cheap, though, like we wouldn't need, all we need is to be

1249
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,800
able to buy a house and destroy it and maybe, you know, buy materials that we could use

1250
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,800
for it.

1251
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,240
But we're not going to want anything crazy, like, I think that as long as they could

1252
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:30,400
sell our show to, like, anywhere, it would be fine, you know, like if they could even

1253
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,960
sell the show to a network or an internet network or something for the same price they

1254
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,720
spent on doing it, then, you know, profits would be guaranteed.

1255
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,360
But see, that's the X factor right there, because of course the thing we haven't really

1256
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,040
talked about that I wanted to bring is like, when you do this, there's two separate issues.

1257
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,600
One, there's kind of a like, this doesn't matter as much, but like I personally feel

1258
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,600
a little squirmy.

1259
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,600
I still want to do it.

1260
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:57,240
I still love to get a sponsor for the PCP, and we should actively pursue one, I think,

1261
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,440
one that we all like and are comfortable promoting.

1262
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,680
There's just no reason not to, in my opinion.

1263
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,920
But whatever, it doesn't matter, like, but when you have investments of this kind in

1264
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:13,240
any capacity, like, not morally, but like in terms of like self-esteem, I start to be

1265
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,880
like, oh, like, I guess I didn't do it all myself.

1266
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,480
I guess I needed a big, big dick to swing in and help me.

1267
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,480
Okay, but that doesn't matter.

1268
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,120
But even more importantly than that, is this idea of like, like you said, if like a sponsor

1269
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,720
is helping you, and is like, involved to any degree, and is helping you like pitch the

1270
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,360
product to like a network or something, or even if you just have someone over your head

1271
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:39,480
at all who like, wants to see how production is going, you suddenly get into the murky

1272
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:45,800
realm of like editorial control, and what, of course, what you would want is like some

1273
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,160
sort of agreement that the people get to do whatever they want.

1274
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,880
What I want is just money.

1275
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,160
Just give me a fat slab of money and let me do what I want.

1276
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,680
I mean, I just feel like it's inevitable if people put in money, they're going like fucking,

1277
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,440
you know, Kickstarter back or whatever.

1278
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,000
Of course, it's right on in black and white that like, when you pledge, you're expecting

1279
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,240
a product.

1280
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:09,640
And if it like, as long as you deliver what it says, they should be relatively satisfied.

1281
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,520
But like, what if the product is just not as good as they wanted, people could get mad.

1282
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,560
I mean, I don't, I don't remember the total saga of mighty number nine, but to my mind,

1283
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,520
the biggest problem with mighty number nine was that it just wasn't that great a game

1284
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,720
and was delayed a lot.

1285
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,720
I think.

1286
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,040
And also the people who made it were insulting to the fans of the thing.

1287
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,520
I don't give a shit about that, but I get why people do care.

1288
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,360
That's, I mean, I mean, I understand.

1289
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,160
It's like, what, what is their development of this game, a fucking hug box, or you need

1290
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,720
to have your, you know, feelings, respect of the whole, you don't want to disrespect

1291
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,720
your investors.

1292
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,600
These people paid money, you know, to support your thing, and then you turn around and you

1293
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
shit on them.

1294
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,560
They had wrong think they were damn white sis patriarchal mails.

1295
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,360
That's not what I'm talking about.

1296
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,880
It's just like you don't insult the people who support you, you know, you're not wrong.

1297
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
You're not wrong.

1298
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,880
Okay.

1299
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,880
So that's fair.

1300
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,680
But like, so even with like a Kickstarter model, you, you still have like a quote unquote

1301
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,880
boss over your head.

1302
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,120
And when it, let's say you have this billionaire investor, it just seems like inevitably, and

1303
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,800
this is the thing that so many like fucking the Pink Floyd song have a cigar or whatever,

1304
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,240
you get pulled into the smoke filled room and you sign the contract to get the money

1305
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,440
to make your album.

1306
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,560
But then when it comes to make the album and you make your song, you're all loved, they

1307
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,640
say, ooh, I don't exactly like the message behind this song.

1308
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,360
Why don't you tweak this and ooh, you know, I don't like this thing.

1309
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,600
I'm just going to shelve all this work.

1310
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,040
Bottom line, I would not sign.

1311
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,360
First of all, I probably wouldn't sign a contract at all.

1312
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:42,320
But if I did, I would have to be that I really knew exactly what it was, you know, like,

1313
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,720
I, like you said, you don't just work with any sponsor.

1314
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,920
You work with the ones that you actually think are good.

1315
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,600
So it would be difficult.

1316
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,760
It wouldn't just be a matter of finding somebody who's willing to throw money at us.

1317
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,440
It would be willing.

1318
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,560
I mean, just considering this.

1319
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,720
I mean, why would anyone throw money at us unless they already knew what we made?

1320
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:05,280
I mean, I mean, currently, currently Googling sponsors that will let me say the N word

1321
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,520
and trying to find if we're even, we're even on target for this.

1322
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,640
That who, who can say?

1323
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,960
I mean, yeah, I guess that's fair.

1324
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:19,080
But I feel like considering like the group and like kind of we make money here on the

1325
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:23,080
show and doing what we do, but like still relative low amounts, digits in the strongest

1326
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,080
position to like negotiate because he's making the most.

1327
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,720
But like if someone came to me right now and said, hey, Nate, trying to make it as a

1328
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,880
contact, don't sign the contract.

1329
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,840
Well, I'm just I wouldn't, but I'm just saying that like there sure is a strong

1330
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,760
temptation when like your financial problems will go away if you sign this contract.

1331
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,640
But now you have a totally new, a new problem of, you know, selling your soul and not be

1332
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,160
able to make what you want possibly.

1333
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:48,960
What are they going to do?

1334
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,960
But I'm just saying it's tempting.

1335
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,680
What happens if you break the contract?

1336
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:57,640
I mean, typically with things like that, you like sometimes you have like, I forget

1337
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,560
the name of the clause, but like, like you aren't allowed to do work in that field for

1338
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,560
like X number of years.

1339
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,480
That's bullshit.

1340
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,720
That's not real.

1341
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,640
That's not a real.

1342
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,360
That's not a real thing.

1343
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,360
It's impossible.

1344
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,360
How could they stop you?

1345
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,680
I mean, I'm pretty sure it exists.

1346
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,600
I guess I could be wrong.

1347
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,240
But I mean, it could just be the bad man the other day.

1348
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:22,320
I would think that they would blacklist you from getting jobs in that field.

1349
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,000
But the very OK.

1350
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,240
There's got to be some sort of general repercussions to breaking contracts.

1351
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,920
I would assume I think it's mostly you would get blacklisted.

1352
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,200
You probably get fined.

1353
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,840
You would not be able to work under them.

1354
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,360
Isn't yours anymore, probably.

1355
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,360
And you don't need money.

1356
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,400
They can't find you.

1357
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,640
They're not a how would they find?

1358
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,800
I don't understand.

1359
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,320
I don't I don't get it.

1360
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,560
OK, would they just take it out of your next paycheck?

1361
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,240
Well, they just stop paying you, right?

1362
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,680
That's that's the problem.

1363
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,880
So you just get it all up front.

1364
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,280
What if you just get it all up front and say, huh, nice job, losers.

1365
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,520
OK, but here's just a thought.

1366
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,080
If you're responsible, this wouldn't be a problem.

1367
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,320
But maybe you've spent some of the money on production costs or whatever.

1368
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,200
And if you now decide, oh, well, I'm not going to finish this project.

1369
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,640
They're like, OK, give us back the money you spent.

1370
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,360
And then it's like.

1371
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,120
Let's not even speculate on how this works.

1372
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,920
And so none of us fucking idea.

1373
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,200
But, you know, generally, I just say, don't sign the contract.

1374
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,960
DIY forever.

1375
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,040
I haven't signed any contracts ever up to this point doing except,

1376
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,200
I guess, the YouTube Partner Program and, I guess,

1377
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,360
Patreon's agreements and Kickstarter's for those things.

1378
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,360
But those are, I mean, generally pretty good.

1379
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,080
And the YouTube.

1380
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,520
So yeah, I would definitely consider for all of those.

1381
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,480
I've been. And we've all signed in blood.

1382
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,160
We all exist only at the whims of Amazon

1383
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,400
and Google and only for their for their benefit.

1384
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,040
Yeah, that's pretty much true.

1385
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,720
Yeah, well, Twitch on Twitch, at least, yeah, to a degree.

1386
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,240
Well, I don't know.

1387
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,680
I mean, I'm I would love to have a sponsor personally,

1388
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,880
but I just hope to find one that is reasonable.

1389
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,360
I'm still working on the Nattaku, dude.

1390
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,000
New time. Yeah, I mean, you know, I was watching some

1391
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,440
county care videos lately, probably right.

1392
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,640
I was I was watching Count Dankula videos, his Mad Lad series,

1393
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,960
which I find interesting.

1394
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,560
I fucking hate that guy.

1395
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,160
How dare you?

1396
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,240
OK, fair enough.

1397
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,320
But I mean, he's he just he didn't want to.

1398
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,080
He's awful. He's a monster.

1399
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,600
But go on. OK, sure.

1400
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,640
Yeah, how dare he make his dog do something funny?

1401
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,680
What a nightmare.

1402
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,200
How dare he tell a joke?

1403
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,600
Hey, hey, fuck you.

1404
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,480
He did other things beside that one thing.

1405
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,840
OK, so some real shit takes on Twitter the other day.

1406
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,480
He's a meme, Lord.

1407
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,720
OK, guys, let's not get it.

1408
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,960
I don't care about this at all.

1409
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,720
The point I was making was that he was shilling

1410
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,520
Raid Shadow Legends on his videos.

1411
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,680
Oh, boy, I'm ready to sign up.

1412
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,200
And I like it just makes me be like, oh, I hate this video now.

1413
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,240
As long as that's I mean, I feel that way every day.

1414
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,640
And almost like fucking probably 50% of all videos I click on.

1415
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,000
I'm just like, if I have to hear about fucking Nord VPN

1416
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,200
or Dollar Shave Club, I'm going to kill somebody.

1417
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,960
Yeah, yeah, I have the same thing was just like,

1418
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,080
I mean, you know, of the app for the phone, right?

1419
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,560
Yeah, I think they offered everybody.

1420
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,440
Yeah, they even reached out to me.

1421
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,840
I politely declined because I don't like Amino

1422
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,760
and I don't want to support them.

1423
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,680
I've got a fucking VPN guy.

1424
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,600
I'm asking me I've never heard of before.

1425
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,520
I don't know. Can these people solve my financial problems to any degree?

1426
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,680
That'd be nice.

1427
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,200
Is their product worth shilling in order to do so?

1428
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,560
I don't know.

1429
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,640
I mean, I haven't done it.

1430
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,000
I just who will save me?

1431
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,240
Who will be a good sponsor?

1432
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,200
Huel, please, I love your product.

1433
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,200
I believe in you. Believe in me.

1434
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,280
Let me show for you your new, your new Huel Black product

1435
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,160
that has less carbs and more protein is the perfect thing

1436
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,240
for the modern lifting man.

1437
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,280
Let me let me sell it for you.

1438
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,160
I got to fucking reach out to those guys again.

1439
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,680
I don't know, whatever. It doesn't matter.

1440
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,720
These are complicated, moral quandaries.

1441
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,680
I feel one day I will find the solution.

1442
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,080
I would love just to make more money,

1443
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,400
imagine, on Patreon so I don't feel any desire to do these things.

1444
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,720
But that's not happening right now.

1445
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,000
So fuck me, I guess.

1446
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,440
Well, she well, shit.

1447
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,960
I pretty much sums it up.

1448
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,400
I don't know. Left turn.

1449
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,440
Anybody got anything else they want to discuss?

1450
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,200
Christmas times or?

1451
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,320
We're ready to have somebody get cool gifts.

1452
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,600
We already discussed that.

1453
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,760
It's your turn if you want to say something.

1454
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,200
I got some wonderful new boots.

1455
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,440
I got my Christmas shoes.

1456
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,560
I put my money down on the counter and got Christmas shoes.

1457
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,920
And it was great.

1458
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,640
They are wonderful boots and they have this beautiful zipper on the side.

1459
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,720
That's it. I love my boots.

1460
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,720
They're my favorite thing I got at Christmas.

1461
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,960
My Christmas shoes.

1462
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,000
I got a onesie and I feel the same about it.

1463
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,600
I love my onesie.

1464
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,000
I got Michelle a onesie that you seems to like, which is very nice.

1465
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,800
Yes, that's good.

1466
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,880
But tragically, it doesn't have a butt flap.

1467
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,840
And I was thinking about this.

1468
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,440
That probably is really annoying if you have to go to the bathroom

1469
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,960
to not have a butt flap.

1470
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,240
That is inconvenient.

1471
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,920
You know what I'm saying?

1472
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,400
Well, that's life, baby.

1473
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,840
In the big city, no butt flaps.

1474
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,440
It's tragedy strikes constantly.

1475
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,840
All right, I'm out of shit to say, I guess.

1476
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,520
Anybody else got anything we can do that we got the voicemails.

1477
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,120
That's why I spent the beginning of this podcast.

1478
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,320
Go for it, dog.

1479
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,360
Go for it, dude.

1480
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,200
I just want to reiterate.

1481
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,040
Fuck you.

1482
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,720
It's not about the dog thing.

1483
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,560
Count Ankyla's a bad man in many ways.

1484
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,920
Oh, no, bad man said.

1485
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,760
And there you go.

1486
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,600
He's a very bad.

1487
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,400
But he looks cool.

1488
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,560
I don't understand how he's bad.

1489
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,680
Does he look cool?

1490
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,960
He's got a commie star in him, Ben.

1491
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,360
You should love that.

1492
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,320
No, he doesn't.

1493
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,080
Yes, he does.

1494
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,560
He has a tattoo of the fucking hammer and sickle on a big star.

1495
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:45,960
Yep.

1496
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,160
Does. OK.

1497
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,040
Is it ironic?

1498
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,520
Well, it wasn't at the time, but he's changed his belief since then.

1499
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,760
So now it's just, you know, an epic goof on himself.

1500
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,640
I don't know.

1501
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,280
All right. OK, whatever.

1502
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,200
I know you guys don't care.

1503
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:01,920
It's fine.

1504
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,520
Go on.

1505
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,320
Yeah, that I know I am that's fair, Ben.

1506
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,120
I shouldn't have jumped and assumed it was the dog thing.

1507
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,280
That's just the thing I know the most.

1508
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:09,960
So fair enough.

1509
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,760
You can have other reasons to dislike.

1510
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,720
And he wasn't trying to be an asshole here.

1511
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,200
There's that.

1512
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,200
I haven't seen his tweets, but from what I've seen,

1513
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,480
I haven't seen anything too awful.

1514
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,160
He's he's real bad.

1515
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,320
I know he's a meme, Lord.

1516
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,680
He says offensive things.

1517
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,920
I hurt.

1518
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,520
He he likes fascism.

1519
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,760
He really hates.

1520
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,400
He really does not like fascism.

1521
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,120
He really hates justice.

1522
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:36,640
Oh, my God.

1523
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,800
He's definitely he's definitely like conservative ghoul.

1524
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,000
Which makes you which makes you a bad person,

1525
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,160
which makes you a bad person.

1526
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,880
I like how you're like absolutely wrong.

1527
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,880
No, I don't really think so.

1528
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,600
I really don't.

1529
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,920
I think so.

1530
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,400
OK, well, I don't fucking care.

1531
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,440
I mean, he ran he ran for UKIP, right?

1532
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,880
He ran for UKIP.

1533
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,200
And then he left because they were stupid.

1534
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,120
OK, all right, that's true.

1535
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,280
That's fine.

1536
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,720
It's all good.

1537
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,640
Well, that's luckily for you.

1538
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,360
The political discourse is about to be solved.

1539
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,520
We've got speak by voice mails.

1540
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,160
We need to listen up.

1541
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,000
We've got a couple of voice mails

1542
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,760
that are all about this issue.

1543
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,360
Our first message is from the one and the only

1544
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,960
centrist Sam is calling in with everything

1545
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,120
we need to know about politics.

1546
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,480
Let's hear what he has to say.

1547
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,240
Take it away, Sam.

1548
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,760
Hey, guys, it's me, centrist Sam.

1549
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,640
Yay.

1550
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,000
Want to know what I think about politics?

1551
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,640
I do.

1552
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,240
Please.

1553
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,480
What are they?

1554
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,240
Great.

1555
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,080
Oh, my God.

1556
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,200
We're clarifying.

1557
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:43,840
He's right.

1558
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,920
What are they?

1559
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,120
He's so right.

1560
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,440
OK, let's not pause on this.

1561
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,200
We've got to keep going because this is followed

1562
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,200
by a hero of the people.

1563
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,000
Leftist Larry is following up on this message.

1564
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,800
Let's see what he has to say.

1565
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,720
How many of these fucking guys are there?

1566
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,280
Endless.

1567
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,600
All right, Larry, what have you got for us?

1568
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,280
Hey, guys, it's me.

1569
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,240
Leftist Larry.

1570
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,800
Want to know what I think about white people?

1571
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,120
No, I don't.

1572
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,360
What are they?

1573
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,160
Oh, damn.

1574
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,760
You're saying all the right things, Larry.

1575
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,560
You got me, but I didn't expect it somehow.

1576
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,680
That's incredible.

1577
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,520
All right, and now.

1578
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,960
I thought he would never go for it.

1579
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,680
It was brave and true.

1580
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,280
What a brave take.

1581
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,160
We've got a final message from our girls.

1582
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,880
I think I've heard enough.

1583
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,040
Right wing Richard has to balance the scales here.

1584
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,800
Let's hear what our friend Richard

1585
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,840
has to say on the other side of the political spectrum.

1586
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,840
Rich, Dick, take it away.

1587
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,120
Hey, guys, it's me.

1588
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,800
Right wing Richard.

1589
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,760
Want to know what I think about North Korea?

1590
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,320
Thanks, Rich.

1591
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,360
No, what are they?

1592
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,120
That's it.

1593
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,640
No, he did a subversion.

1594
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,400
He did a subversion.

1595
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,040
I guess he didn't blew up North Korea.

1596
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,320
Nobody likes North Korea.

1597
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,640
That's something we can all agree on.

1598
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,520
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1599
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,160
I don't know.

1600
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,920
I think he's fine.

1601
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,880
Consider the literacy rate.

1602
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,680
Consider the hospital system.

1603
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:15,800
I don't know.

1604
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,160
Something, something.

1605
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,800
They're pretty bad.

1606
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,480
Is this a hot take that North Korea is bad?

1607
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,120
North Korea?

1608
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,760
Not that bad.

1609
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,960
I don't think so.

1610
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,320
Well, I don't know.

1611
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,680
How much can you blame the people of North Korea

1612
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,200
as opposed to the leaders of that?

1613
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:34,920
It's not as bad as you imagine, but it's all so bad.

1614
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,600
That's what I hear.

1615
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,520
It's impossible.

1616
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,640
I mean, I don't like the idea of my family being gulagged

1617
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,200
if I speak against the state.

1618
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,840
And like three generations of my family,

1619
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,120
do they breed them in captivity?

1620
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,440
Don't they have like a total media blackout

1621
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,000
from media outside of North Korea?

1622
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,040
That's not as true as it seems.

1623
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,640
That's what I mean by like, there's stuff that you hear.

1624
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:00,200
But if you investigate it, it's like halfway between the truth

1625
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,040
and not.

1626
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,040
But I mean, it is still, you know,

1627
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,640
it's still North fucking Korea.

1628
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,840
I mean, it is what it is.

1629
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,320
You know, I don't remember the details,

1630
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,440
but didn't Kim Jong-un like kill his brother who was like

1631
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,720
on the run or something?

1632
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,520
Didn't that happen?

1633
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,720
I have no idea.

1634
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,200
You know what?

1635
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:20,080
I will say this, at least in the main city of North Korea,

1636
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,200
they have one thing that we need to copy,

1637
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,200
which is that their buildings are all like pink and blue

1638
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,120
and shit.

1639
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:26,600
That sounds nice.

1640
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,680
They paint all their buildings and it looks really good.

1641
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,920
Is North Korea saying trans rights?

1642
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,360
Guys.

1643
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,240
Oh my god.

1644
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,800
North Korea just said trans rights.

1645
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,120
It's good.

1646
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,120
Thank you, North Korea.

1647
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:36,880
You know what?

1648
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,680
You wear, huh?

1649
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,680
What?

1650
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,600
The buildings are pink and blue, man.

1651
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,000
The buildings are pink and blue.

1652
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,680
So obviously they're saying trans rights.

1653
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,600
We need to get a Kim Jong-un bumper sticker.

1654
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,440
It's just his face.

1655
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,400
It says trans rights under it.

1656
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,840
Maybe we can get a nice picture of the city.

1657
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,200
Yeah, that sounds great.

1658
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,480
That sounds great.

1659
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,360
All right, moving over.

1660
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,040
OK, here we go.

1661
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,880
We've got an open letter to a certain Conrad.

1662
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,880
Let's hear a certain magical Conrad.

1663
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,000
Who the fuck is Conrad?

1664
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,920
To no one knows, but let's hear him out.

1665
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,400
Go.

1666
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,480
Conrad is either the bravest person alive or the stupidest.

1667
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:13,200
His fucking obsession with trying each and every restaurant

1668
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,640
surrounding whatever place he happens to be absolutely

1669
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,720
baffles me.

1670
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:24,200
The first Avengers movie came out in 2012, seven years ago.

1671
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,600
And the post-credits scene, we find our heroes enjoying

1672
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,800
a delicious-looking meal of lukewarmah.

1673
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,800
Flash forwards to now, seven years later.

1674
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,680
I go into this shop I've been driving past in my town

1675
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:42,360
for 20 years or so, where I pay $9 for an underheated, thin

1676
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,080
breaded, autistic taco-looking motherfucker

1677
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:49,040
with crunchy chicken and overbearing cucumber,

1678
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,000
which I painfully vomit up that night,

1679
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,320
a vomit seven fucking years in the making.

1680
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,760
And I just can't fathom how he's

1681
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,840
how he can waste his life like this.

1682
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,440
And it fills me with inboten rage.

1683
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:15,040
Well, I mean, it sounds like he saw the Avengers

1684
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,160
and it incepted him to want a schwarma,

1685
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,120
but he did not try it until recently,

1686
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,960
and it made him puke his brains out.

1687
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,160
First of all, I've never tried a schwarma.

1688
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,880
I don't really fuck with Greek food that much.

1689
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,240
The word sounds terrible.

1690
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:27,800
I don't want to have one.

1691
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,600
It doesn't sound.

1692
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,960
I don't like euros.

1693
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,360
In general, I don't like that weird sour cream.

1694
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,880
Does anyone else associate the word schwarma with swamp ass?

1695
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,360
In my mind, the two terms have overlapped completely.

1696
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,960
And I think of them at the same time.

1697
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,560
OK, maybe just a second.

1698
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,760
Well, now I will.

1699
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,920
But I mean, OK, I don't think that guy,

1700
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,400
it's not that I like literally systematically

1701
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,320
start from my house and in a radial motion

1702
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,600
go to every restaurant nearby.

1703
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:01,640
I try out all the ones that sound good.

1704
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,240
If I'm on Google Maps and it's like two stars,

1705
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,880
I'm like, hmm, don't know what you

1706
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,920
have to do to get two stars on Google Maps,

1707
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,360
but it can't be good.

1708
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,760
But I mean, there's hundreds and hundreds of restaurants

1709
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,600
in any given city.

1710
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,440
Well, I mean, this guy's hot take is, yeah, hot take.

1711
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,800
Don't try new things.

1712
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,680
Yeah, fair.

1713
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,880
I have never had an experience as bad as what

1714
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,120
that guy sounds like he had.

1715
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,000
So I'm sorry that your one roll of the dice

1716
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,080
came up snake eyes.

1717
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,240
Me and Michelle, when my parents were in town,

1718
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,560
I mean, did you, when you were here,

1719
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,600
we went to like that great steak place, the fuck what's

1720
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,400
it called, the precinct, right?

1721
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,840
So a famous steak place in Cincinnati.

1722
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,880
It's fantastic.

1723
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,720
It's expensive.

1724
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,400
When my parents were here, I upped the ante

1725
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,920
to the number one rated fucking place in Cincinnati,

1726
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,880
which is the Orchard, it's some fucking,

1727
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,280
it's a hotel restaurant and it is amazing.

1728
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,200
Like, we all loved our food, but Michelle fucking puked

1729
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,800
afterward because something just didn't sit right

1730
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,880
at the most expensive fucking restaurant,

1731
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,800
the number one rated place.

1732
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,760
Like, maybe they undercooked something?

1733
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,480
Probably just didn't agree with her.

1734
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,080
I do feel like there's no account.

1735
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,760
After a certain price point, there's just no real correlation

1736
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,960
of quality to price.

1737
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,800
That's not true.

1738
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,640
Kind of.

1739
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,480
It is true.

1740
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,320
That is where God.

1741
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,680
That is entirely dependent on the individual place

1742
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,760
and the food.

1743
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,360
I mean, you're playing for atmosphere here to a large,

1744
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,680
like they got a live van going, it's the atmosphere.

1745
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,560
It depends, cause like, I mean, there's some places where,

1746
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,320
yes, everything is overpriced.

1747
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,440
And then there's other places where it's not.

1748
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,160
And I mean, you just gotta, you just gotta suss it out,

1749
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,160
you know, with the, I mean, it's hard to do that

1750
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,080
with like really expensive restaurants.

1751
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,480
Like take a, you know, take a roll of the dice on that.

1752
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,640
But I mean, I absolutely believe that there are,

1753
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,080
you know, steak houses that are charging you $70,

1754
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,040
where I will not like that steak as much as I'll like,

1755
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,440
like, you know, $8 Thai food dish.

1756
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,440
Like, I'm sure that's a thing.

1757
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,520
Yeah, always possible.

1758
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,920
I like all those YouTube videos that compare like the,

1759
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,840
it's like the $20 billion Strativarius violin.

1760
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,680
The Epicurious videos.

1761
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,000
Versus like a $20.

1762
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,440
I don't know who does them, but yeah,

1763
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,040
anything comparing cheap shit versus expensive shit.

1764
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,400
Well Epicurious does a show where it's like,

1765
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,000
they'll have an expert in like mustard come on

1766
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,160
and like test out cheap versus expensive mustard.

1767
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,000
I like those.

1768
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,840
I like those.

1769
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,680
Yeah, I watch all those.

1770
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,000
It always comes out that like the price difference

1771
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
does matter.

1772
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,920
It's just not that it necessarily matters to you.

1773
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,560
It's like, hey, yeah, you could definitely tell

1774
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,880
the difference between these two things,

1775
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,080
but the cheap one is still good.

1776
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,280
You would still enjoy it.

1777
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,600
There's no reason to spend $12 on noodles,

1778
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,160
you know, like they'll often say shit like that.

1779
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,600
But except for the steak episode,

1780
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,760
that was the only one where the steak episode was like,

1781
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,520
look, when it comes to steak, you know,

1782
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,320
there are seven grades of beef.

1783
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,360
And if you want to buy the highest grade beef,

1784
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,080
it will cost you a fucking lot of money, you know.

1785
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,880
Is it worth it at all in that case?

1786
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,600
I mean, according to people who eat steaks, yes.

1787
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,400
I mean, this was a huge argument on the old

1788
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,560
biggest problem in the universe where

1789
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:03,560
Maddox thought that any steak over $30 was not any different.

1790
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
That like, it was $30 was the cap,

1791
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,600
and Dick was like, no, like not at all.

1792
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,800
Cause he goes to steak houses and, you know,

1793
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,320
I would probably be like,

1794
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,040
I probably could tell the difference between

1795
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,000
like a $60 steak and a $30 steak,

1796
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,720
but like, there's no way,

1797
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,680
there's no way that I'd be like, boy,

1798
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,880
sure, I'm glad I spent $30 extra on that steak.

1799
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,920
Right, that's the rub is that like,

1800
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,360
it is diminishing returns no matter what,

1801
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,720
cause like, I mean, 80% of the way there

1802
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,120
is just having steak at all, you know,

1803
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,520
like that's most of the battle.

1804
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,560
Consider the situation from the perspective

1805
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,920
of a person with infinite money,

1806
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,600
and then you have all like, of course,

1807
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,880
sure, get the most expensive one.

1808
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,320
Yeah, I mean, and not even just the most expensive,

1809
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,800
but you could experiment with all the expensive ones

1810
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,320
and figure out which one's actually the best, you know,

1811
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,360
which is what I would do if I had like,

1812
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,840
you know, if I was super rich

1813
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,440
and I could just flip on whatever,

1814
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,480
I would definitely try like every piece

1815
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,960
of expensive cuisine, but I would never just like be,

1816
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,240
oh, this one's the most expensive,

1817
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,840
so that's where I'm going every time, you know,

1818
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,040
or this is the most famous,

1819
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,640
which is how a lot of people think.

1820
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,400
If I was rich, if I had the money to do it,

1821
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,400
I would get a personal chef to prepare me

1822
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,720
both delicious and nutritionally,

1823
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,840
macronutrient and micronutrient satisfying meals

1824
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,520
for every meal of the day.

1825
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,440
Oh, that would be, that would be the greatest gift.

1826
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,000
That's my Kokoro wish.

1827
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Make it happen, people.

1828
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,400
Okay, by going to patreon.com slash theprocrastiners,

1829
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,200
or better yet, patreon.com slash bestcamer.

1830
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,320
Okay, next voicemail we've got, who is this from?

1831
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,960
This is, oh yeah, you have to get out Nate.

1832
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:40,800
Okay, go.

1833
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,080
Okay, so it's came to my attention

1834
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,360
that something needs to be addressed,

1835
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,880
so I just wanted to have a little pow out with you guys,

1836
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,040
a little sit down if you will, you know, me, your dad.

1837
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,040
Good.

1838
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,080
Everybody says about how mage grew up

1839
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,560
in this dystopian fucking nightmare hellhole,

1840
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,760
but no one really mentions the fact

1841
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,200
that Nate is living in one right now.

1842
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,040
Yeah.

1843
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,200
Especially in like Fairfield and like Over the Rhine

1844
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,120
and shit like that.

1845
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:08,960
That's true.

1846
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,600
As kind of a little example,

1847
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,880
just the other day in Coleraine,

1848
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,880
a group of I think like 150 to probably like 180 underage teens

1849
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,080
decided to have a battle royale at Northgate Mall.

1850
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,120
I don't know, I'm not talking about no Fortnite bullshit,

1851
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,720
I'm saying like an actual, they went in

1852
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,480
and whooped each other's ass just because.

1853
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,320
It sounds fucking awesome.

1854
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,240
Not only that, but when I lived there,

1855
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,960
I think I was like either nine or 10,

1856
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,480
I was in Fairfield.

1857
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,880
I was just riding my bike down the road,

1858
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,720
you know, being a good little fucking boy

1859
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,480
and I seen a guy, it was a bad drug deal,

1860
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,520
but one guy stabbed another guy in the fucking neck.

1861
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,360
Damn.

1862
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,800
So yeah, point of me calling in

1863
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,520
is just to kind of tell you guys,

1864
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,640
get the fuck out of Cincinnati, Nate.

1865
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,680
There are nice neighborhoods, but I don't live in them.

1866
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,640
You don't have much nice to say about Cincinnati, Nate.

1867
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,480
You know?

1868
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:10,760
It's a fucking, first of all, ugly, ugly city, dirty,

1869
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,600
grimy.

1870
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,000
It looks nice from a distance.

1871
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,280
It looks ghetto even in the parts that aren't ghetto.

1872
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,040
It's way too spread out.

1873
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,560
I thought Virginia Beach was spread out,

1874
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,680
fucking Cincinnati is like another level.

1875
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,520
Oh, I guess.

1876
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,320
Nate drove like what, 25 minutes to the fucking Walmart?

1877
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,720
There's one like 15, 20 minutes away, something like that.

1878
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,720
It's not the closest in the world.

1879
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,600
On average, if you have to drive anywhere,

1880
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,480
how long will you be driving for?

1881
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,160
I would say 10, 15 minutes, maybe 20 for things.

1882
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,160
So for me, it's like 30 seconds.

1883
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,600
It's like the average driving time, you know?

1884
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,760
Okay, okay.

1885
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,960
Well, I mean, you know, I don't like to encourage her

1886
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,880
because I think it is bad for both of our psychological help,

1887
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,120
but Michelle moved here from fucking Hawaii.

1888
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,320
So naturally there was, which I'd like to think,

1889
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,840
means she really cares and she really values my presence.

1890
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,480
I guess so, she moved to the fucking ghetto.

1891
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,160
I guess she was, right?

1892
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,600
Yeah, and man, my first apartment, you saw it, Digi,

1893
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,760
my first apartment, that's where Michelle moved in with me.

1894
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,400
It was a sweltering hell of fucking-

1895
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,080
It was a nightmare place,

1896
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,960
but we lived there together for like six months

1897
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,000
before we moved.

1898
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,040
I cannot believe she did that, which again,

1899
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,920
I guess she likes me, that's pretty cool.

1900
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,080
But I don't like to encourage her,

1901
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,000
but Michelle's like, Nate, this place kind of sucks,

1902
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,720
and like we should definitely leave.

1903
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,920
And now that I don't, my job doesn't tie me here,

1904
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,040
but we should, we should in fact.

1905
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,440
We're literally planning to do this, right?

1906
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,880
Like we're planning to do a Kickstarter.

1907
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,720
Yeah, this is the plan.

1908
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,560
This is the plan.

1909
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,960
Cansheds, move Nate out.

1910
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,360
So if anybody heard that voicemail and was like,

1911
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,160
wow, we need to get Nate the fuck out of there,

1912
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,360
well, there's an easy way to do that.

1913
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,200
It's called-

1914
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,040
Set aside your pennies.

1915
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,880
It's called five grand.

1916
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,760
I'm keeping it at four, but yes.

1917
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,600
Five would be nice.

1918
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,720
It's called four grand.

1919
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,360
All we need is four grand, get Nate out.

1920
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,160
Somebody could probably fund that by themselves, honestly.

1921
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,600
Russell, you're our main benefactor around these areas.

1922
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,360
You want to just, somebody wants to drop me.

1923
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,960
Just drop 4K on moving Nate out.

1924
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,520
Next time I'm streaming, Russell, next time,

1925
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,560
we can set aside rules.

1926
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,400
You'll be a gasman.

1927
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,640
Or anybody, so that we can, you know,

1928
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,720
leave this open.

1929
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,520
Only 400,000 bits will do it.

1930
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,720
Indeed, well, right, 400,000, you're right, you're right.

1931
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,160
Sounds good to me.

1932
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:27,160
Mr. Beast, do you like to give people money?

1933
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,440
Call in, call into the show.

1934
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,840
Okay, anyway, let's move on to the next one.

1935
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,560
Oh, okay, we've got speaking of Nate's streams.

1936
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,840
We've got a message here from some mysterious individual

1937
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,200
just called to the left, to the left.

1938
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,200
Let's hear what he has to say.

1939
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,040
Take it away.

1940
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,960
A, B, C, B.

1941
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,920
Sorry if you've heard this one before,

1942
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,400
but voicemail god is feeling pretty fucking smug right now.

1943
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,920
I just killed four of Nate's Pokemon in his Nuzlocke.

1944
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,440
SMH, bro, took one step too far to the left, got fucked,

1945
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,680
and I didn't kill a bad saint, so, yeah.

1946
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,520
Anyways, get fucked.

1947
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,080
Is this Sean?

1948
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,040
This is Sean, a.k.a. voicemail god,

1949
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,080
and a.k.a. my rival in this game.

1950
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,760
I fucking hate that guy.

1951
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,320
You know, let me just frame this,

1952
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,560
because this is hilarious.

1953
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,600
We gotta fucking, we gotta do something about him.

1954
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,920
He killed you, Ben.

1955
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,840
He killed you.

1956
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,000
Yeah, first he stole,

1957
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,440
first he stole my status as rival,

1958
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,160
and then he killed me on top of it.

1959
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,520
You know, it's funny, Ben.

1960
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,360
Everyone was saying-

1961
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,800
What does he have against me?

1962
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,280
Well, he believes in capitalism.

1963
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,840
It served him well to be the,

1964
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:36,880
he believes in the free market,

1965
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,880
and that's no good.

1966
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,720
I guess so.

1967
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,560
I guess so.

1968
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,640
Well, you know, that lovely art of you and me,

1969
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,600
together, my hoot hoot, Ben's saint,

1970
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,040
and I, the trainer, going around, having a great time.

1971
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,520
Everyone was saying, don't let Ben's saint near you.

1972
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,320
He's whispering leftist ideology into your ear, Nate.

1973
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,760
He's dragging you to the left.

1974
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,080
He's dragging you to the left.

1975
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,800
Well, good thing I died, so.

1976
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,720
I said, it's fine, it's fine, but then,

1977
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,800
I mean, I don't know if you were actually there,

1978
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,080
but literally, literally, in the game of Pokemon,

1979
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,520
I was just wandering around the city,

1980
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,600
getting ready to do the gym.

1981
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,800
I took one step too far to the left.

1982
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,440
It triggered, it triggered the fucking voicemail

1983
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,760
god, Rival Battle, and I was slaughtered

1984
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,760
by a level 18 croc knot,

1985
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,040
or the second totodile level, who there is.

1986
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:19,880
I'm glad.

1987
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,720
Who's a nightmare.

1988
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:21,560
You know what?

1989
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,400
So, I learned my lesson.

1990
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,240
I probably meant-

1991
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,960
Don't let Ben whisper near.

1992
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,560
Don't go too far left.

1993
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,840
Even one step too far will kill you.

1994
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,080
That sounds like something I would do, so.

1995
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,640
I'm glad, yeah.

1996
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,840
All right.

1997
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,920
I died doing what I loved.

1998
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:39,280
A radicalizing, radicalizing my fellow PCP members

1999
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,440
and causing destruction.

2000
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,680
Well, you know, he went out of martyr, I would say,

2001
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,880
so congratulations, everybody.

2002
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,680
We had a great time.

2003
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,120
You know, and the good news is, it's now a real nuzlocke.

2004
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,320
There has been the first genocide.

2005
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,280
Things are getting serious now.

2006
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,520
Oh, god, it's a nightmare.

2007
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,240
Okay, moving on from that, we got two more left.

2008
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:04,240
This one's from I'll Die on smart goals

2009
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,960
for New Year's resolutions.

2010
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,160
Okay, I'll Die, take it away.

2011
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,880
Hey, Nate, so you were trying to remember an acronym

2012
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,320
at the end of last episode for goal setting,

2013
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,920
which was smart goals.

2014
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,120
Some people may not know about it.

2015
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:15,960
That's right.

2016
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,800
I figured it's worth mentioning.

2017
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,040
It stands for specific, measurable, attainable,

2018
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,040
relevant, and time bound.

2019
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,120
So something like I will lose this number of pounds

2020
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,120
by this specific date,

2021
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,080
which is what you're doing,

2022
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,240
it gives you a metric of success.

2023
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,920
It's relevant to something that actually benefit your life,

2024
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,520
has a deadline to keep you motivated.

2025
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,480
As opposed to I will exercise more,

2026
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,400
which doesn't establish any point of action.

2027
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,840
And once you say it, you're not actually

2028
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,120
moving to anything.

2029
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,720
If resolutions come up on the podcast,

2030
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,560
you probably agree it's worth putting out there

2031
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,800
in case it helps anyone out.

2032
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,800
You don't even need to play this voicemail.

2033
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,960
You can just write down the acronym

2034
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,320
and bring it up if you want.

2035
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,440
Or not if you don't want to,

2036
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,880
or you could play the voicemail

2037
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,840
and waste everyone's time.

2038
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,680
Don't tell me what to do!

2039
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,840
I think it's the end of it.

2040
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,560
Or you could just thoroughly and not waste anyone's time.

2041
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,480
That's all I'll buy.

2042
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,640
I choose to do so.

2043
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,680
Yes, it's great.

2044
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,840
All right, hey, I put a little image in the thing

2045
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,480
he said is like, whatever.

2046
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,920
Relevant, as opposed to realistic,

2047
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,040
doesn't matter, both are the same thing.

2048
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:09,880
Yeah, smart goal.

2049
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,600
That's what I was trying to think of last time.

2050
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,520
Just like me, Ben and Digi, our goals are,

2051
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,840
okay, my goal I think is good.

2052
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,800
Work out three times a week,

2053
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,520
for the month of January.

2054
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,520
Like, that is attainable, that's specific,

2055
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,000
and I don't have like a, it's time-bound.

2056
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,840
I think it checks all the boxes.

2057
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,960
This nebulous goal of stick to a diet

2058
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,160
is perhaps a little vague,

2059
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,600
but I think you and Tom know what you're doing,

2060
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,940
so I'm not too worried about you.

2061
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:37,120
But for other people who are starting something,

2062
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,640
use these, use this as your measure.

2063
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,140
It is, I learned, oh, you know what?

2064
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,160
I was gonna say about this.

2065
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,240
The first place I heard about smart goals

2066
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,480
was from my boy, Scooby 1961,

2067
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,040
my big, gay fitness god,

2068
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,120
who I love like a father and a son,

2069
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,800
and he's my favorite person in the world.

2070
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,000
He's such a hero.

2071
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,840
Did all this fitness shit for free.

2072
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,680
And actually, you know what?

2073
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:56,960
He was one of like literally one of the first YouTubers.

2074
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,480
We know Nate, we know about Scooby, fuck.

2075
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:04,040
I swear you've given this exact spiel many times before.

2076
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,000
I'm not giving a full spiel.

2077
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,400
I was just gonna say that,

2078
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,800
did you know that this guy before YouTube existed,

2079
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,560
he actually paid to host his videos

2080
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,000
for people to download,

2081
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,480
and when YouTube came out,

2082
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,040
he was like, wow, I can't wait to save money

2083
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,480
by not having to pay to host my fucking videos on YouTube.

2084
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,840
Isn't that what everybody was thinking

2085
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,320
when YouTube came out,

2086
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,080
who had videos on the internet?

2087
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,240
He's the oldest one I know.

2088
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,080
Okay, it doesn't matter.

2089
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,920
Anyway, there is actually news about Scooby,

2090
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,760
I wanted to say, which was just that

2091
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,760
it seems he is in fact retiring

2092
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,400
from like fitness videos on YouTube,

2093
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,640
and he's changing his channel to like,

2094
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,120
it's like Scooby's travel vlogs,

2095
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,000
which he's been doing for a long time,

2096
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,600
and it's the fucking end of an era, it seems,

2097
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,360
with like his fitness uploads,

2098
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,960
and instead he's just kinda gonna be taking it easy

2099
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,560
and relaxing more, and I just wanna give my thanks.

2100
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,120
That dude's like, hold his balls, right?

2101
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,320
He's in his 60s. He's in his 60s.

2102
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,520
He's in his 60s, he's deep in his 60s now,

2103
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,240
and he's been doing this for so fucking long,

2104
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,920
like at almost no benefit,

2105
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,880
and you know, whatever, retire early, he's a great guy.

2106
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,120
And I just wanted to say, guys,

2107
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,320
here's maybe the last time I'll mention Scooby

2108
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:09,160
on the podcast, but he's created such a wealth

2109
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,880
of content on his channel,

2110
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,000
and like on his website,

2111
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,560
I think it's Scooby Workshop.

2112
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,400
Go there, if you're looking for fitness help,

2113
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,520
there's so much of good to help you achieve these things.

2114
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,440
I learned about smart goals from him.

2115
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,760
There you go, he's a great guy.

2116
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,600
I'll love him forever.

2117
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,240
Thank you, Scooby, for everything you've done.

2118
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,320
I'm feeling a lot of like, end of the decade,

2119
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,360
end of era stuff going on right now,

2120
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,560
and it feels like this is one of them,

2121
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,480
so thanks again, Scooby.

2122
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,560
All right, anyway, we've got one last voicemail coming

2123
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,640
from, who is this?

2124
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:42,000
Oh yeah, it's Whispering ASMR Style,

2125
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,920
so mom doesn't hear.

2126
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,320
Okay, let's hear what this hat say,

2127
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,720
hang on, bear with me.

2128
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,800
Gonna get my dick out for this one.

2129
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,920
Yeah, it's time, boys, lube up.

2130
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,360
All right, here we go, and go.

2131
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,000
I have something to get off my chest, that is.

2132
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,880
Other than this twink, teensy-beed groupies,

2133
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,120
BBC, I'm being tit-fucked by,

2134
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,560
and well, that's the problem.

2135
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,440
See, I'm a freshman in high school,

2136
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:09,040
and as would be assumed, I'm trying, man,

2137
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,320
I'm in the trenches.

2138
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,000
It's in full-on Vietnam shit, I've got yellow malaria.

2139
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,960
So, here I am, going hard in the taint,

2140
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,400
talking to mad girls like a real human being.

2141
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,800
That's when it hit me.

2142
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,120
After becoming kinda close with a couple of them,

2143
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,320
I realized that I'm just the token gay.

2144
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,520
It's hurting, I'm pill-battle being shorn,

2145
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,920
and a Jewish, but no matter how hard I try,

2146
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,280
I'm unavailable, cause they think I'm gay.

2147
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,080
Either they treat me like the gay-eye-friend

2148
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,240
in a group of girls, or they think I'm gay

2149
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,360
and fully off the market.

2150
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,360
Please, PCP, as the gayest council of individuals,

2151
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,760
I could find, help me swallow my pain,

2152
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,880
and find a solution to this AIDS epidemic.

2153
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,000
I know the solution.

2154
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,520
Yeah, I know the solution.

2155
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,160
Yeah, you just tell them you wanna fuck them.

2156
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,000
Yeah, just help them make-

2157
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Just whip your dick out on the table.

2158
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,520
Ask one of them out.

2159
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,760
Oh, yeah.

2160
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,960
Just like, bro, this is teen CP, I think, calling in.

2161
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,560
I just, like, here's,

2162
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,320
consider the way that you're framing this.

2163
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,200
You're like, after getting close

2164
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,160
to a bunch of these girls,

2165
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,000
then they started to think I was gay.

2166
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,480
So, look, you're a young man, I understand this.

2167
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,160
I was far worse than you, probably.

2168
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,400
I didn't do anything until I was like,

2169
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,240
fucking 20 with any girls.

2170
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,520
But like, just consider the fact

2171
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,200
that you're not making any moves

2172
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,920
until you are already friends with them.

2173
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,760
If you are even-

2174
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,600
That's a terrible approach.

2175
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,560
If you're even speaking to a woman,

2176
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,960
you've already made it past every hurdle.

2177
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,160
That's the only thing you're supposed to have to do

2178
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,200
is speak to them, and then if it either,

2179
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,280
you figure out within, like, very quickly

2180
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,920
if that's supposed to go anywhere or not.

2181
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,560
Like, if you're not figuring out where it's going quick,

2182
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,200
you gotta swerve to the next one.

2183
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,040
Like, if they're not-

2184
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:55,880
I understand.

2185
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,320
If they don't seem interested, gotta move on.

2186
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,400
Yes.

2187
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,360
We're in a delicate social marketplace right now,

2188
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,480
a sexual marketplace.

2189
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,160
I understand that I, too, was absolutely confused

2190
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,440
and had no fucking idea what I was doing growing up.

2191
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:12,600
But like, get to this, it's not sexual assault

2192
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,920
to let a woman know you are attracted to her

2193
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:16,760
or interested in it.

2194
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,120
Who said it was sexual assault?

2195
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,320
I'm exaggerating for comedic effect, Ben.

2196
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,520
This is the point of what I'm saying.

2197
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,560
But like, the point is, like, you can say to a girl,

2198
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,720
like, hey, I think you're cute, wanna go out sometime?

2199
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,760
If you just say that sentence, boom,

2200
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,440
they know you're not gay, so you're over that hurdle,

2201
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,280
at least.

2202
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,600
And if they say no, then you're like, okay.

2203
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,800
Let's talk about this,

2204
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,760
let's talk about this wanna go out sometime meme.

2205
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,600
Okay, sure.

2206
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,520
What does that mean?

2207
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,360
I feel like-

2208
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,520
It's a social dice breaker.

2209
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,880
I feel like that's a dumb line.

2210
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,760
I feel like that's a shit line.

2211
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:47,600
Cause I feel like-

2212
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,880
Well, you gotta get her alone, you know,

2213
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,440
to have your way with her.

2214
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,800
I think that it's way,

2215
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,120
I think you need to have a specific plan.

2216
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:54,960
Sure, sure.

2217
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:55,800
I think that if you're like,

2218
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:56,640
why don't we go out sometime?

2219
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,480
Like, what is that?

2220
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,480
Oh, no, yeah, it's better if you come in-

2221
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,480
Oh, you're right, Ben, you're right.

2222
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:02,000
With already a date and time and a, or a, or a,

2223
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,400
you start with a suggestion,

2224
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,480
then you follow up with the date and time suggestion.

2225
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:07,000
So like, don't think about it.

2226
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,760
I'm gonna do this at this time.

2227
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,120
Do you wanna do that with me?

2228
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:14,360
Or, or it could be like, hey, let's go see a movie.

2229
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,040
I'm free Thursday at six, how about you?

2230
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,200
Then it's like, you know, you've already set up,

2231
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,640
you don't, the onus is not on her

2232
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,320
to come up with a date and time,

2233
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,840
but if she can't do Thursday at six,

2234
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,880
then, you know, then she,

2235
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,680
maybe she has another time in mind, you know,

2236
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,640
but like you gotta start off with a time in mind.

2237
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,240
What do you think about doing this?

2238
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,160
Here's when I wanna do it.

2239
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,400
Are you available?

2240
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,240
No?

2241
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,440
Well, fuck me.

2242
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,920
But like, you know, you gotta, you gotta make it,

2243
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,760
you gotta send some kind of clear signal

2244
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,600
in the early developmental stages

2245
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,520
because I do think that,

2246
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,880
I think a lot of guys think of women as like,

2247
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:55,200
oh, I'll befriend a girl and then I know I like her,

2248
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,880
so I'll start dating her.

2249
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,880
But I don't think that-

2250
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,560
Wrong direction, wrong move.

2251
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,400
Yeah, I don't think,

2252
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,640
I especially don't think girls tend to think that way.

2253
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:03,840
I think they tend to think like,

2254
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,400
I'll date a guy and find out if I like him,

2255
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,480
because you don't find out what it's like

2256
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,160
to date somebody by being friends with them.

2257
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:11,680
It's a totally different experience.

2258
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,320
So like, you need to approach it like,

2259
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,440
it's not about dating a friend,

2260
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,520
it's about dating someone and, you know,

2261
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,080
figuring out if that's gonna be good or not.

2262
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:22,320
If you become a platonic friend with someone,

2263
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,560
then you have established your relationship

2264
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,360
as a platonic one.

2265
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,200
Yep.

2266
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,880
It's not impossible to break out of.

2267
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,760
You know, I guess I'm-

2268
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,760
Mage, your advice sounds terrible already

2269
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,600
and it's totally wrong.

2270
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,440
No, fuck you, Mage.

2271
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,400
What does Mage think about it?

2272
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,240
It's irrelevant.

2273
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:40,600
I mean, I still wanna know.

2274
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:45,600
No, I think I'm just a little bit different from most people,

2275
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,440
but back when I used to like guys

2276
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:50,360
that are not my current boyfriend,

2277
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,360
I would, it was usually people I befriended,

2278
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,440
like guys that were my friends and I was like,

2279
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,080
oh, I get along with him so well

2280
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,840
and I kind of would develop a crush

2281
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,960
just from being friends with them.

2282
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,520
That's a fine perspective, Mage,

2283
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,720
but frankly, your position there

2284
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:09,680
is from the female perspective, which I get,

2285
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:12,400
but for a guy who's trying to get a girl,

2286
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,920
and you don't have a girl you love right now or whatever.

2287
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:15,760
Mage, Mage, Mage.

2288
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,600
Well, I wanna know.

2289
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,880
I mean, from that perspective,

2290
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,120
what should this guy, what should the caller do?

2291
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,040
I don't really wanna give advice because like he said,

2292
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:24,880
I don't feel like I should.

2293
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,880
He's been gays-owned, Mage, help.

2294
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,480
I mean, if you're friends with her

2295
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,360
and you're getting along with her,

2296
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,680
I think asking her out is a fine enough advice.

2297
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,520
Yeah, I think it should be a new experience.

2298
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,520
So we all, even Mage, who is completely

2299
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,760
on the exact opposite spectrum, right?

2300
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:44,680
It has the exact opposite perspective.

2301
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,760
We all just think, we'll just ask him out.

2302
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,240
Just tell him you wanna fuck.

2303
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,240
I mean, that's the bottom line,

2304
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,720
it's the only way to do it.

2305
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,200
There is no beginning of a relationship

2306
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,680
until somebody says, let's start a relationship.

2307
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:01,560
Like it doesn't, you will just fall into a groove

2308
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,200
of being friends and hanging out until somebody says,

2309
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,080
like we have to take this to a new level

2310
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,120
or else it's not what I intended it to be.

2311
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,640
It will not progress until somebody puts their foot down

2312
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,960
and says something.

2313
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:18,000
Stop me if I'm crazy, but I feel like there's a pattern here

2314
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,560
wherein like every time someone calls in

2315
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,720
to ask a relationship question or a dating question,

2316
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,640
the answer is always just fucking tell him

2317
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,480
you wanna date.

2318
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,320
You're absolutely right.

2319
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,320
Just tell him you wanna fuck.

2320
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:34,520
Because the bottom line is that communication is everything.

2321
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,520
It's 100% of what a relationship is, is just communication.

2322
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,720
So you need to be as clear as possible

2323
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:44,280
in your communication if you want people to understand you

2324
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,160
as a just general rule of life.

2325
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,160
At all times, if you want anybody to know

2326
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,240
what you're thinking, if you want them

2327
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,520
to figure out your intention, fucking tell them.

2328
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,360
It's not that hard.

2329
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,400
And make sure that the person you're asking out

2330
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,680
is receptive to communication because there are some

2331
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,560
awful people that don't like to talk things out,

2332
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,160
are sneaky about it, are not honest.

2333
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,800
And he's like, oh, I'm fine.

2334
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,320
And then you don't text them

2335
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,000
and then they're angry about it.

2336
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,040
It's just awful.

2337
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,840
Yeah, stop talking to those people.

2338
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,400
Just don't hang out with anybody

2339
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,840
because you're that level.

2340
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:20,840
As a separate piece of advice, don't talk to those people.

2341
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,480
If they play mind games, don't play with them.

2342
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,920
You go to another table, play with other people.

2343
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,640
Another mind games crap.

2344
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:33,840
Be a person of action and press through these things.

2345
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,000
Don't get yourself stuck in the mud,

2346
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,560
slaving over some, I don't know.

2347
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,760
I mean, obviously you don't want oneitis,

2348
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,840
but you also don't want, like I'm not saying be callous,

2349
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,280
but like don't waste your time either.

2350
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,120
So I don't know.

2351
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,320
From the way he told that story,

2352
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,800
it sounded like he kind of became friends

2353
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,880
with like a group of girls or something

2354
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,680
and became, they see him as the token gay.

2355
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,240
I mean, step one, break them off from each other.

2356
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,360
You can't have them in a group.

2357
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:01,880
You have no, like you will be seen as a token gay

2358
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,600
if you're just surrounded by girls.

2359
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,600
Isolate them from their social groups, right?

2360
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,200
Inflict emotional pain on them

2361
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,280
and then establish yourself as the only one

2362
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:13,200
who can provide relief from that same pain, right?

2363
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,400
That sounds like a, isn't that something that like,

2364
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,080
what's his name would say?

2365
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,440
Dennis.

2366
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,040
Roosh, Roosh V.

2367
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:24,040
Yeah, yeah, well, yeah.

2368
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,680
Ben, I'm curious, how do you feel about Roosh

2369
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,400
now that you've turned your,

2370
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,760
I know you had met him before and maybe thought he was okay.

2371
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,760
I feel, you know, I don't know.

2372
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,480
I haven't like read his stuff in a while.

2373
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,320
Yeah, I used to.

2374
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,960
He's very, very against anal sex.

2375
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,760
Okay, okay.

2376
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,840
Very not a man.

2377
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,160
He thinks that anal sex is a sign of paternosal gay.

2378
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,000
Oh God, why did my fucking headphones

2379
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,200
have to die right now?

2380
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:55,920
Okay, modern Roosh, I'm sorry if I'm talking over anyone.

2381
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,280
I legitimately can't hear anything.

2382
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,400
I'm just gonna go for a second

2383
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,640
until I get my headphones back working.

2384
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,360
Modern Roosh is a fucking mutant.

2385
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,120
He is a creep and a monster and I hate him

2386
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:09,640
and detest him and he has become bad and scary

2387
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,680
and dark inside.

2388
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,160
I think back in the day when I used to read him,

2389
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,920
he wasn't, okay, I mean,

2390
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:19,480
he mostly just offered some pretty normal advice.

2391
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:22,240
He would occasionally say some kind of fucked up shit

2392
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,520
but he always kind of said it with a wink and a nod.

2393
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,440
So it was like, oh, he's just joking about that.

2394
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,000
Now there's no winks and nods.

2395
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,560
Now it's just fucking weird.

2396
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,040
Like as so often happens, later on,

2397
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:35,880
the truth comes out,

2398
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,200
he's like, I think some of,

2399
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,720
maybe a lot of it wasn't jokes.

2400
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,520
Like he maybe wanted me to think.

2401
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,560
I mean, it's gotten strange

2402
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,560
because he called into the dick show one time

2403
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,800
and even within his appearance, it was very strange

2404
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,320
because again, he was like railing against anal sex

2405
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:56,160
and talking about how porn is trying to turn us all into-

2406
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,560
Is this just like an anti-gay thing

2407
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,720
or is this between men and women too?

2408
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:59,760
It's all kinds of shit.

2409
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,640
He's one of the, he's like a very traditional values

2410
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:03,480
in terms of-

2411
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,800
He didn't really used to be like that.

2412
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,480
Not at all, not at all.

2413
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,960
He's become like that.

2414
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,160
Yeah, I think he's,

2415
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,040
I think he might on some level be one of those

2416
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,880
like a preserve the white race kind of guys.

2417
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:17,960
I think there's a little bit of that.

2418
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,800
Is he white though?

2419
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:19,640
Well, it doesn't matter, I guess.

2420
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,160
I think he's, I don't know.

2421
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,240
I think he is technically-

2422
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:25,080
I don't know.

2423
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,560
I mean, he's very traditional values.

2424
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,960
He's very Judeo-Christian values.

2425
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,520
But from like a weird robotic place.

2426
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,360
Like you read his tweets-

2427
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,280
And there's a big overlap,

2428
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,160
There's a big overlap between those people

2429
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,840
and the ethno-staters.

2430
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,960
Well, like you said, Ben,

2431
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:39,840
when you read his stuff,

2432
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,040
it feels like weirdly robotic and alien.

2433
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,080
It doesn't sound human.

2434
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,680
It's like somebody who-

2435
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:45,520
It does.

2436
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,560
Who's like extremely concerned about human values

2437
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,080
while having no humanity.

2438
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,400
I feel that I understand Ruse's progression pretty well,

2439
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,080
which was just that, I mean,

2440
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,720
I'm sure he would say it as a matter of road.

2441
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:58,080
I've listened to some of his stuff out of interest in this.

2442
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,680
I didn't read his books, but I don't know,

2443
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,520
I would kind of watch it.

2444
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,360
I knew Ben had read them,

2445
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,000
so I thought they were in my sphere.

2446
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,160
I remember he was a big go around,

2447
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,400
like fuck as many women as possible,

2448
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,920
but then at a certain point in his life,

2449
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,800
he was like, I'm not getting much emotional

2450
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,800
or personal fulfillment from this anymore.

2451
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:19,320
Like what I now want is a long-term lasting relationship

2452
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,160
with a woman or whatever.

2453
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,000
But he's also like-

2454
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,840
I guess he's Armenian.

2455
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,000
Because I went to his Twitter and the first thing it says

2456
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,440
is Armenian Orthodox with one of those little cross-logos on it.

2457
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,280
Cool.

2458
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,120
Hell yeah.

2459
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:30,960
I guess that's where he's at.

2460
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,440
I'm gonna try to scroll to his Twitter

2461
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,760
and find some of his anal sex tapes.

2462
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,920
I remember there's a bit in like one of his books.

2463
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,600
Oh, here's a cheater take right away, so what's that?

2464
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,440
Really?

2465
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,040
Oh no.

2466
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,440
Is he Roushvi on Twitter?

2467
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,840
Yeah, just Roushvi, I believe so.

2468
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,680
Roushvi.

2469
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,400
Looks like him, 64K followers.

2470
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,480
Yeah, that's probably him.

2471
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:55,120
Five Orthodox Jews,

2472
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,480
you wounded in Hanukkah machete attack

2473
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,960
by blackmail in New York.

2474
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,000
A certain, Roush says,

2475
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,200
a certain tribe is losing control

2476
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,600
over their frontline soldiers.

2477
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,960
What the fuck does that mean?

2478
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,800
Wait, what?

2479
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,480
I'm looking at his, I just see anal sex is not natural,

2480
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:15,960
it's disgusting, while linking to an anal sex article.

2481
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,960
He's just really against anal sex.

2482
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,780
But whatever dude, I don't, fine.

2483
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,640
Yeah, and he also thinks you should not have sex

2484
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,840
out of wedlock now.

2485
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,000
I mean, so true.

2486
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,960
Yeah, yeah, and it's not just him thing,

2487
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,600
he just thinks people shouldn't do it.

2488
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,680
When he spent like his entire life doing it.

2489
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,440
So his response to somebody talking

2490
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,520
about the conversation on consent is,

2491
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,320
you're on the road to hell if you're concerned

2492
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,560
about consent, get married if you wanna have sex.

2493
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,760
Oh my God.

2494
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:47,760
I mean, the outspoken atheist thirsts for God the most.

2495
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,400
He cries out in anger and despair,

2496
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,720
please someone help me receive the faith,

2497
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,920
help me be humble, help release me

2498
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:57,080
from the thoughts of demons.

2499
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:58,820
Is this for real?

2500
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:00,820
I told you dude, he's gotten really weird.

2501
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:03,020
This is worse than I thought.

2502
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:05,380
I wish I could have, I don't know,

2503
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:06,420
I don't wanna be an asshole about it,

2504
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:08,580
but I wish I could have any respect

2505
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:11,900
for like the argument for religiosity

2506
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,940
outside of like a society does better

2507
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:15,780
when it has religion.

2508
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,300
Okay, maybe true, fine.

2509
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,820
Maybe atheism will lead to death,

2510
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:20,340
but I'm still not fucking convinced

2511
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,580
by the argument at all.

2512
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,820
There's no reason. Make up a better religion.

2513
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,100
That I mean, that's the solution.

2514
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:27,340
Make up a better culture that has some totems.

2515
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:31,100
I mean, there's tons of countries and cultures out there

2516
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:33,460
who really treat like their,

2517
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:37,500
like they treat their own morals as a sort of religion,

2518
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,900
like there's this, I was watching this video

2519
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:44,020
about like five extremely small towns

2520
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:46,300
and there's this one extremely small town in Japan

2521
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:49,260
who has become obsessed with recycling

2522
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:51,860
because they decided to have a,

2523
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:54,020
they used to burn all their waste

2524
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:56,540
just like in their fucking yards, I guess,

2525
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:57,700
like they just didn't give a shit.

2526
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,660
They found out how bad and dangerous this was.

2527
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:04,420
So their town implemented a zero waste policy.

2528
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:08,140
There is no trash out of this city at all.

2529
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:11,180
Everybody is obsessed with like separating their trash

2530
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:12,500
into like 18 or no,

2531
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,500
it was like 30 something different categories of trash,

2532
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,820
but like everybody does it and they all like got into it.

2533
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:19,900
You know, like once they realized that like,

2534
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,980
hey, as long as I just think about the stuff

2535
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:24,020
I have differently, like I realized

2536
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:25,580
none of this has to be wasted.

2537
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:26,940
Like this can all go back in.

2538
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,860
So like everybody in this town treats recycling

2539
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:31,220
like a religion.

2540
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,700
That's all people need.

2541
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:34,940
They just need that kind of guidance.

2542
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:37,540
They will turn it into a religion themselves, you know,

2543
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:38,380
by obsessing over it.

2544
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,220
You might be right.

2545
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:42,220
If you're gonna make people have some kind of moral compass

2546
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:44,140
to cling to or give them something,

2547
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:48,340
like don't make it some weird random fucking made up

2548
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,020
bullshit from 3,000 years ago.

2549
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:51,340
Like, fair enough.

2550
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:52,940
You know who was into zero waste?

2551
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:56,740
Michelle was literally like a vegan and an actual zero waste.

2552
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,100
What is zero waste?

2553
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,740
Where your whole perspective,

2554
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,620
like everything you consume in life

2555
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:04,820
should produce no trash, just recyclables

2556
01:43:04,820 --> 01:43:07,740
and you recycle everything such that, you know,

2557
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:10,860
I mean, you can't control what the recycling people do

2558
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:11,940
once you give them the bottles

2559
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:13,180
and they don't recycle everything,

2560
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:15,300
but you can, you know, do your part to get it

2561
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,660
as best you can.

2562
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:18,420
And like, here's one thing I never thought of that.

2563
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:21,820
I always thought like, how am I gonna, like, okay, straws.

2564
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:23,740
Straws always confounded me

2565
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,900
because there's no way you could recycle the straw, right?

2566
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,540
It's too small, but then Michelle fucking moved in

2567
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:31,620
and she brought her, was he, her reusable straws

2568
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:33,980
with their special scrubber that you use to go

2569
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:37,060
into the straws to clean the inside of the straws.

2570
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:39,460
And now half the dishes are straws

2571
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:41,660
that need to be scrubbed out from the inside.

2572
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:44,100
She's not zero waste anymore, but we still have those.

2573
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:45,740
And frankly, I think they're pretty cool.

2574
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:46,580
I like them.

2575
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:48,820
I enjoy scrubbing out those straws.

2576
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:49,660
It's fun to be.

2577
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:51,500
I'm glad.

2578
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,580
I see, of course, Roosh had a shitty take about J.K. Rowling.

2579
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,420
That's great.

2580
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:57,260
That made me realize.

2581
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:58,300
Are you still scrolling through this?

2582
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,140
You should stop.

2583
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,740
And you'll just get mad.

2584
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:03,060
You know, I was already mad.

2585
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:06,780
So yeah, this is just, I'm just, okay.

2586
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,860
Here's some more Roosh tweet for you.

2587
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:10,140
Porn should be banned.

2588
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:12,940
It serves no purpose, but to destroy the mind, body,

2589
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:13,780
and soul.

2590
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,180
I guess freedom is not good or allowed, fair enough.

2591
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:21,180
Okay, I mean, if that's your perspective, then fair.

2592
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,540
Oh my God, porn is human trafficking, guys.

2593
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:25,380
Did you know that?

2594
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:28,460
Oh my God, consenting adults can't consent to things.

2595
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,300
What a nightmare.

2596
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:33,580
This is the luck that you have run into, Ben,

2597
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:36,340
by not following any right-wing stuff,

2598
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:39,380
because this is what's going on in the right-wing sphere.

2599
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,620
No, I'm aware.

2600
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:45,100
I'm aware that the alt-right is anti-porn now.

2601
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:45,940
Yeah, cause like, out.

2602
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:46,780
No, it's not that.

2603
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,580
It's that there's a huge war,

2604
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:50,300
and that it's really like,

2605
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,100
only five or six fucking insane people

2606
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,740
who really hate porn,

2607
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:55,940
who are like, rallying against it,

2608
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,820
and everybody else raising an eyebrow and going,

2609
01:44:57,820 --> 01:45:00,260
what the fuck, like, why are you guys bringing this up?

2610
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:01,620
I think it's a Psyop.

2611
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:02,940
I think it's an attempt at it.

2612
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:05,180
Well, gab-band porn, right?

2613
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:06,260
That's part of it, right?

2614
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:08,700
Yes, it was at the, well, the guy who runs gab,

2615
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:11,740
went on this like, gigantic anti-porn tear,

2616
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:12,580
and just like-

2617
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:14,500
How can you be a free speech platform,

2618
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:17,500
and then just like, they did Lolliporn a while back,

2619
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,220
they did all kinds of fucking shit.

2620
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:21,300
These people don't give a shit about free speech.

2621
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:22,140
No, they do not.

2622
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:22,980
They don't give a fuck.

2623
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:26,100
I mean, just, you can make an argument that like,

2624
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,100
oh look, pragmatically, free speech is consequential,

2625
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:30,340
so I'm not ultimately for it like, completely,

2626
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:32,780
like, okay, fine, but then you can't have that as your,

2627
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,620
whatever, well, no, no, shit.

2628
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:36,300
You can't make the free speech alternative to Twitter,

2629
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:38,420
and then fucking ban speech off of it.

2630
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:39,260
It's no longer-

2631
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,100
It's just-

2632
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,100
It's allowed on fucking Twitter!

2633
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,180
It's just, it's just-

2634
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:43,020
So in name.

2635
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:45,740
The conservative platform now, you know, that's fine.

2636
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:46,580
You can do that,

2637
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,100
but it's great, whatever, fucking.

2638
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:51,380
I'm honestly like, a little mad that even Bitshoot

2639
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:53,500
doesn't have porn on it, honestly.

2640
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,620
Like, you can't post explicit sex on there.

2641
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,460
Why not?

2642
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,860
A fucking medic, or can post like, fucking surgery,

2643
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:00,460
fucked up, but porn is not allowed,

2644
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:01,300
are you fucking kidding me?

2645
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:02,140
Shows dicks.

2646
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:03,900
Shows fucking dicks and stuff.

2647
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:04,740
It just can't be said-

2648
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:07,980
I mean, they have a not-safe-for-life tag

2649
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,980
that you can like, you can have your video

2650
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:13,620
be not-safe-for-life, but you cannot show explicit sex.

2651
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:14,820
That's retarded.

2652
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:15,660
It's retarded.

2653
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:17,540
What the fuck, all right, you know what?

2654
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:18,620
Is it maybe there's some sort of law

2655
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:21,380
wherever they're being hosted or something against it?

2656
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:22,980
Not that I know of, but it could be.

2657
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:24,940
Maybe, maybe.

2658
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:27,060
If so, then I guess I understand it pragmatically.

2659
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:30,260
Okay, by the way, just going back,

2660
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:31,500
I was just gonna say one last thing

2661
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,420
to our whispering ASMR teen CP guy

2662
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:38,060
about the whole gay girl getting a girl thing.

2663
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,300
Have you ever asked a girl out in your life?

2664
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,340
Not to be an asshole, but just consider that question.

2665
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:45,780
Have you ever, ever in your whole fucking life

2666
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:48,300
said to a girl anything that made it clear

2667
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,660
you were interested in her

2668
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:52,340
and that you wanted to spend time with her?

2669
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:54,740
If not, consider that.

2670
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:57,060
Because I didn't for my whole fucking life

2671
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:00,420
and then I figured out, oh, I'm just not doing anything.

2672
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:01,700
I'll fix that now.

2673
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:02,700
So consider that.

2674
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:05,300
I made the same mistake and I,

2675
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:06,500
well, I can't even call it a mistake

2676
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,060
because I still have never asked a girl out

2677
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:09,100
or done any of that shit.

2678
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:10,700
I just got famous.

2679
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:12,940
So that's another method.

2680
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:14,500
It is, don't do that.

2681
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,540
That's a retarded method.

2682
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:16,380
No one should do that.

2683
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,180
Don't wait your whole fucking life.

2684
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,340
Okay, anyway, that's done.

2685
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,500
And I think we, oh, that was the last one.

2686
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:22,700
That was our last fucking voicemail.

2687
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:23,540
So there you go.

2688
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:24,380
We're all done.

2689
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:25,980
Here's what I wanna tell you guys about.

2690
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:29,340
One more thing, one more of my revolutionary ideas.

2691
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:30,700
Here's what I think.

2692
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:32,980
This is my big goal going into 2020.

2693
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:35,340
I hope you all will consider it as well.

2694
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:39,340
Which is to go torrent.

2695
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:40,300
Go and torrent.

2696
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:43,820
I like, I like, you know,

2697
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:45,700
I like a little bit of what bidshoots going on.

2698
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:46,540
It's a little slow.

2699
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:48,860
It takes forever to upload on there.

2700
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:52,180
You know, YouTube, obvious dumpster fire.

2701
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:56,220
Where can I post literally whatever the fuck I want?

2702
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,660
Torrents, I could just send people torrents.

2703
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:00,820
Did you know that it takes like two seconds

2704
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:02,980
to turn something into a torrent?

2705
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:03,900
I've never done it personally.

2706
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,300
All you do is you open up your torrent tracker

2707
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:09,460
and click create torrent and then just select a file

2708
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:11,140
and it's a torrent.

2709
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:12,820
Does it come from your computer,

2710
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:14,500
like hosted in a certain file location or something?

2711
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:15,340
Yeah, it will be, I mean,

2712
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:16,900
if you have that file on your computer,

2713
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,180
you turn it into a torrent,

2714
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:20,900
somebody downloads it from you directly,

2715
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,940
but now, you know, they are seeding,

2716
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:25,100
assume of Lee if they decide to seed.

2717
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:28,220
But I'm gonna make probably a video about it.

2718
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:30,260
It's just called like, why aren't we torrenting everything?

2719
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:33,660
But like, torrenting has come so far.

2720
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:34,800
It's super fast.

2721
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,600
You can actually play torrents.

2722
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,880
Like you can set your torrent thing to,

2723
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,480
yeah, to download from start to finish

2724
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,720
and then play it in the thing while you're downloading it.

2725
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,440
So like, it's basically streaming.

2726
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,760
The main reason I don't use torrents that much,

2727
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,120
even for things I should,

2728
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,120
is because it's not as immediate.

2729
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,080
I like being able to just like type something in and go.

2730
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:58,040
But now, more and more streaming sites are disappearing.

2731
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,800
It's way harder to find illegal sites on Google

2732
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,560
and shit like that.

2733
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,600
So, you know, torrents are, I mean,

2734
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,880
as the internet fucking devolves into a police state,

2735
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,600
torrents are the only way you can maintain

2736
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,480
your fucking freedom.

2737
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:14,160
And it's all on your servers, your hard drive,

2738
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,520
so nobody can do anything about it.

2739
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,360
And once it's spread to other peoples,

2740
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,160
they'd have to individually take it off

2741
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:20,820
of everyone's fucking computer.

2742
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:24,260
So, you know, if you're backed by something like Patreon,

2743
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:27,520
it's totally reasonable to release shit through torrents

2744
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,240
that you can't release through any other platform

2745
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,640
because your audience will see it.

2746
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:34,680
And it'll be, it'll stay up.

2747
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:35,880
So, that's what I wanna do.

2748
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:39,020
I wanna buy a server and start fucking

2749
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:40,720
releasing shit through torrents.

2750
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,400
It's a good idea.

2751
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,240
It's a good idea.

2752
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:48,240
Uh, I mean, you're gonna have a limited install base.

2753
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:50,960
It's true, but like, the thing is,

2754
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,200
I think that we're punking ourselves with YouTube

2755
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:57,520
because you can only really be successful on YouTube

2756
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,120
by making formulated content at this point.

2757
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:02,120
I mean, YouTube doesn't even recommend me anything

2758
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:04,360
that's not like the same shit I've seen.

2759
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:07,960
Like, it's all 10 to 20 minute videos

2760
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,920
in the same like analytical.

2761
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,880
I mean, I know this is partly

2762
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,640
because that's just what YouTube recommends me

2763
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,880
because I've watched so much of it.

2764
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:18,880
But like, I do not find anything on this platform anymore

2765
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:22,000
that is not heavily steeped

2766
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,600
in what YouTube has always been.

2767
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:27,640
Like, it's just whatever, everything that comes out now

2768
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:30,800
as an echo of something that's been on YouTube before.

2769
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,880
You could make something wholly new,

2770
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,080
wholly unique in the video format.

2771
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:37,240
Put it on YouTube, nobody's gonna care.

2772
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,340
What difference does it make

2773
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,440
if you just make it a fucking torrent, you know?

2774
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,520
Like, and I mean, nothing stopping you

2775
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,920
from advertising your torrent.

2776
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:48,040
You know, you can make YouTube videos about your torrents.

2777
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,080
So, yeah, I guess so.

2778
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,760
I mean, if they find out what they're torrent,

2779
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,160
I suppose they could always remove you

2780
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:53,920
for some of these things.

2781
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,180
I mean, if you're hosted to the Piles on a server,

2782
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:58,980
the server host could decide this is problematic content.

2783
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:01,740
We are not going to host your fucking files.

2784
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:04,620
I mean, what I would do is probably like,

2785
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:05,980
you know, make a YouTube video being like,

2786
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:08,420
hey, here's a new content I have out.

2787
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:10,660
You can torrent it on my website,

2788
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:12,140
you know, give a link to my website.

2789
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:14,940
Then on the website, you can find the list of torrents,

2790
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:16,620
you know, you're downloading them straight from me

2791
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:18,260
or people who are hosting them.

2792
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:19,700
So, yeah, I don't know.

2793
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:21,260
I don't know what they could do.

2794
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:24,580
I don't know what new forms the world would take

2795
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:25,660
to try to deal with that.

2796
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:27,500
But I really think that's where,

2797
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,820
I think that's where people are just gonna end up going.

2798
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:31,980
Like, I think that we've tricked ourselves

2799
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:33,780
into thinking we need a YouTube alternative

2800
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:35,680
because we think the audience is too lazy

2801
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,080
to go other places.

2802
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:40,640
And that's partially true,

2803
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,980
but I think people are lazy about stuff

2804
01:51:42,980 --> 01:51:45,020
because they're consuming the same shit.

2805
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:46,860
Like, if you go to YouTube,

2806
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:50,140
would I leave YouTube for a YouTube video?

2807
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:50,980
No.

2808
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:52,260
Would I leave YouTube for something

2809
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:54,300
that couldn't be posted on YouTube?

2810
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,140
Yes.

2811
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:58,540
That's what I think the mindset needs to be,

2812
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,940
is like, hey, we don't have to make content

2813
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:02,300
that's for YouTube.

2814
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,060
We can make content that's whatever we want

2815
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:06,300
and then figure out how to market it afterwards

2816
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:07,340
once we know what it is.

2817
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:08,260
I suppose that's true.

2818
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:09,860
I suppose that's true.

2819
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:11,580
And by the way, and if you're torrenting folks,

2820
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:14,100
you're gonna want to have a VPN.

2821
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:19,100
So go, if you don't have a VPN, everybody, promo code PCP.

2822
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,140
We don't have that, please NordVPN.

2823
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:23,700
Please pay us to show your product.

2824
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:26,140
Or there's a bunch of VPNs, that has to be Nord.

2825
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,060
Or any of the other ones.

2826
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,660
Not that I use VPNs, but.

2827
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:30,500
Well, it's too late.

2828
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,100
We just advertised Nord for free,

2829
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:33,900
so now they don't have to pay us.

2830
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:35,660
Ever since, you know, ever fucking since,

2831
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:38,900
I got like a fucking notice the other day

2832
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:39,860
about torrenting, like, I don't know,

2833
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:41,340
some fucking movie or something.

2834
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:42,940
I torrent everything, I don't give a shit.

2835
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:44,180
I'm gonna torrent until the end of time,

2836
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:45,100
as long as I can.

2837
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:46,860
I don't fucking care.

2838
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:48,140
I just got a VPN.

2839
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:48,980
And you know what?

2840
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:50,740
Since then, I've been torrenting like a madman

2841
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:52,860
and it's been not a problem at all.

2842
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:54,740
What kind of notice did you get?

2843
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:56,580
Like from your ISP or what?

2844
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:59,180
I got a letter from my ISP saying like,

2845
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:01,220
we have detected that you were downloading.

2846
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:02,860
It was actually something I think like a movie

2847
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,340
I downloaded on Michelle's computer,

2848
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:06,300
but I didn't mean we were doing it or whatever.

2849
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:08,580
And I mean, look, this is the rub.

2850
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,240
What are VPNs for?

2851
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:12,740
So they can't track you when you're downloading shit.

2852
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,540
This is what they are fucking for.

2853
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:16,140
They won't tell you that on the other shows,

2854
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:18,220
because they're like, they can't say that.

2855
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:20,900
But that fucking video by Tom Scott or whatever,

2856
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,020
he's absolutely right.

2857
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:22,860
This is the point.

2858
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:25,020
Yep.

2859
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,780
Anyway, that's it everybody.

2860
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:29,460
So you leave us more voicemails on the speak pipe link

2861
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:30,860
down in the description.

2862
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:33,500
And we got a lot of discussion out of that last one.

2863
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,340
We sure did.

2864
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:35,180
We sure did.

2865
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:36,780
It goes in a lot of places.

2866
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:38,660
So yeah, leave us fucking voicemails.

2867
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:39,500
Love to have them.

2868
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:40,340
Make quality.

2869
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:41,180
Everybody was good.

2870
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:42,020
Thanks for leaving them.

2871
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:42,860
I was happy to see.

2872
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:46,220
Oh, you know, a fucking real mass Batman called in,

2873
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:47,620
but it's basically just an advertisement

2874
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:48,900
for his upcoming content.

2875
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:50,740
So we await that happily.

2876
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:53,700
You know, riddle my ass Batman.

2877
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:54,540
Looking forward to that one.

2878
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:55,380
Love you.

2879
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:56,220
Love you.

2880
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:57,060
Love you buddy.

2881
01:53:57,060 --> 01:53:57,900
Love you.

2882
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:58,740
Happy to have met you.

2883
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:00,980
And other than that, hey, patreon.com slash

2884
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:04,940
the procrastinators $1 discord fucking talk to us

2885
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:07,940
and all fucking shit like that $5 bonus episodes.

2886
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:08,780
When you hear this,

2887
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:12,260
there will be a new bonus episode out about year and review

2888
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:15,500
and about our plans for the upcoming year in detail.

2889
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:16,860
So a bunch of us all talking about that shit

2890
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:17,980
that we touched a little bit on here,

2891
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:19,620
but way more in depth.

2892
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:21,740
And I've got, I make a little announcement in there

2893
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:22,740
that people might be interested in.

2894
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:25,500
So give it a, give it a listen if you care.

2895
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:26,340
What else we got?

2896
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:28,540
At tbcrastinators on Twitter, updates, et cetera, blah, blah,

2897
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:30,420
blah, and that should do it.

2898
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:32,060
Oh, and also if you want to play Minecraft with us,

2899
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:34,460
there'll be another stream coming before too long.

Canton.

2905
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:43,620
I was happy to see while we were on our little hiatus

2906
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:45,180
that crossed over 7,000.

2907
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:47,260
So it's still, it's gaining pretty steadily as it goes.

2908
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:49,940
So I'll be happy when it keeps growing

2909
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:52,300
and more content is coming on canton.

2910
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,100
So keep your eyes peeled.

2911
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,180
Anyway.

2912
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:57,060
My day is ruined.

2913
01:54:57,060 --> 01:55:00,940
I am going to be, now I'm poised to enter,

2914
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:04,860
to exit the decade at the lowest point of all.

2915
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:07,540
After having, after having a meteoric fall.

2916
01:55:07,540 --> 01:55:10,420
Just scrolling through route, route,

2917
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,260
let's just talk about it.

2918
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:13,060
Roush's Twitter and just being pissed off.

2919
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:14,300
Is that what you're going to do this year?

2920
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,500
Yeah, among other things.

2921
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,260
That was the straw that broke the camel's back.

2922
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:23,820
Well, I think social media is a cancer

2923
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:26,500
and guns and destruction is the solution.

2924
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,460
So we'll more on that next time, everybody.

2925
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,420
We'll see you soon.

2926
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:30,500
Have a wonderful week.

2927
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:31,660
Happy New Year.

2928
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:33,820
And we'll see you next time with another happy,

2929
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:35,100
slappy episode.

2930

See you then.

2931
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:36,860
