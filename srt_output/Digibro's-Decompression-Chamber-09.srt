1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,560
Let me tell you a little story about an audience member.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,080
The worst kind of audience member, the one that every creator fears the most.

3
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:42,040
If you're a creative, this story will be an absolute nightmare, a torturous tale from

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,320
your worst, your scariest dreams.

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,480
It's about a friend that I used to have back in high school.

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,400
We'll call him D for the sake of this story.

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:03,320
Now this guy, he had a really interesting taste in art, because most of what he liked

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:13,120
was great stuff, and yet, I could tell he had no fucking idea what was great about it,

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,480
and would completely misinterpret the intentions or just consume things in such a way that

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,720
would make someone like me very frustrated.

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,840
You know, I guess it's fair if you're enjoying yourself than whatever, but like, for some

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,800
of us, especially creative people, this is an absolute nightmare.

13
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,280
This guy, his favorite video game series was Metal Gear Solid.

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,880
He would skip the cutscenes.

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,160
The first time he played through Metal Gear Solid 4, the first time he played through

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,840
it, he skipped all the cutscenes.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,520
Now Metal Gear Solid is a game that's mostly known for its story, for its cutscenes.

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,640
I mean, the gameplay is important as well, but the story is like what people really come

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,800
to it for, and the thing about it is that it's not like he was one of these guys who

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,640
says, I don't care about the story.

21
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,360
He would insist that he did know the story.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,400
He would insist that he could follow the story.

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
He would insist that he knew everything about Metal Gear, and that he was a big fan of the

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,760
game series.

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,880
But if you ever, you know, if you asked him, like, oh, you know, have you really watched

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,120
the cutscenes in the other games, he'd say yes, but then if you were to ask him specific

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,000
details, he'd always be off, but he'd never admit he was off, he'd just be like, you'd

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,480
correct him, and he'd be like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's how it was, you know.

29
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,000
And he seemed to have no self-awareness about this at all.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,720
He was an absolute nightmare.

31
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,000
You know, he was a huge fan of Ghost in the Shell, and just based on, I mean, I know the

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
guy.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,600
I know there's no way he understands half of what's good about Ghost in the Shell.

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,560
Like, he just likes it because of the aesthetic and because the major is hot, you know, and

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,120
he just likes that sort of military action kind of story.

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,360
But I'm almost certain he doesn't really get any of the deeper philosophical implications

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
of the show.

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,800
You can enjoy whatever you like, but this is also the kind of guy who would complain

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,320
about stories where his complaints are obviously based on misconceptions because he wasn't

40
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,200
paying attention.

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,000
But he would never, like, he would say something like, you know, oh, that movie was really

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,160
stupid, you know, and you'd be like, why, and you'd be like, oh, it's just dumb.

43
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,440
But you could tell, like, he would insist that it was a bad movie, even though if you

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,240
ever watch a movie with him, he never pays attention.

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,120
He sits there on his fucking PSP through most movies, he talks through movies, you know,

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,640
he doesn't pay any attention to movies.

47
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,800
But then he'll go and talk about them as though he's seen them and insist that he was paying

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
attention.

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,440
This guy would just insist that he followed what was going on, you know, at one point

50
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:09,080
I'd loaned him my Boogie Pop novels, and he read them, and he said he liked them, and

51
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I told him, like, well, you know, with Boogie Pop and others, the first book, you kind of

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,960
have to read it more than once to really get the full picture, you know, because I asked

53
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,280
him, like, did you understand all of it?

54
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,600
Because you kind of have to read it again before you're going to totally understand

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
what's happening.

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,400
He was like, no, no, no, I understood it all, you know, I got it.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,240
And I was just like, how do you even fucking know that if you haven't read it the second

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
time?

59
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,040
Because it's not until you read it again that you realize what you don't know.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,200
I loaned him Boogie Pop at Phantom, the TV series, and he said that he really enjoyed

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,160
it, but he skipped one episode, and I was like, why?

62
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,160
And he said, I just didn't want to watch that one.

63
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,840
And the one he indicated when he pointed at the box was like one of the most important

64
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,360
episodes in terms of understanding the fucking story of Boogie Pop Phantom.

65
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,920
And I was just like, how can you be this way?

66
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:13,120
Now the reason I bring this up is that that guy, D, will never speak to any of the people

67
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
who created any of those things.

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,120
You know, he'll never talk to Hideo Kojima, he'll never speak to Kohei Kodono, he'll

69
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,080
never speak to Masamune Shiro.

70
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,680
You know, he's never going to talk to the creators of those things and bewilder them

71
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,720
with the fact that he paid so little attention.

72
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,280
You know, he'll never be able to criticize the shows based on false information that

73
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,200
is the result of his not paying attention to what he was watching.

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:55,920
I on the other hand, will frequently interact with everyone who watches my videos.

75
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,520
And I can tell when some people did not pay any fucking attention.

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,560
And then they complain on the basis of misunderstood information.

77
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,120
Now it's weird for me, I think it's a little weird, it comes off a little weird even to

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,480
me when I talk about my videos as art.

79
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,560
Because my videos feel so direct, like to people who get them, you know, you watch it

80
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,320
and I'm just kind of explaining a point, right?

81
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,600
Like how could that be, how could there be a boogie and pop skill for that?

82
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,000
Cause I always make that comparison that like, you know, on some level you come to the audience

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,040
and on some level the audience comes to you, right?

84
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,520
And it's like if the whole audience doesn't understand, it means that I didn't dumb down

85
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,360
the point enough.

86
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,960
And to a lot of my viewers, it seems like how could it be more dumbed down, you know?

87
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,240
But I do write with a stylistic flourish.

88
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,840
I like my videos to make a point in a fun and succinct way.

89
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:08,840
I like writing in this sort of cheeky, kind of pseudo collegiate intellectual way, but

90
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,680
not in a way that's like using big words and fancy language so much as, I like when I get

91
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,840
to the point in a kind of a, like an aha moment or like a gotcha almost.

92
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,280
So referring to my latest video, the hiding sex appeal of anime in plain sight, the first

93
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,640
half of the video is me like deconstructing the idea that there's a fan service in, or

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,280
presenting the idea rather, I don't know why I said deconstructing, presenting the idea

95
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,480
that there's fan service in Flying Witch and Amanchu, you know?

96
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,440
And I'm talking about how no one's really criticized it and that's interesting.

97
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,920
Now if you're an inattentive viewer and you don't, you haven't made it to the end of the

98
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,760
episode but you're already, you already think you know what the video is about, then you

99
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,000
start making assumptions that I'm criticizing these shows for having fan service.

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,880
But that never happens.

101
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,920
The whole point of it is a build up.

102
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,040
It's alluring you into this idea but then the point of the video is at the end of the

103
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
video.

104
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,920
The point of the video is when I have this sort of aha reveal that like the reason this

105
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,400
is interesting is because of what it says about how people think of fan service, you

106
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,680
know, how this is not really more mature than nudity and how that's a conversation that

107
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,560
I think would be interesting to have.

108
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,400
But if you're not paying attention to the fucking video or you don't make it to the

109
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,440
end or you don't consider the whole point of it all at once, then you won't get it.

110
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
And I could write the video differently.

111
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,240
I could write it with clarifications up the fucking ass.

112
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,160
I could make the whole video by the way, I'm not saying fan service is bad even though

113
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,880
I say that in the video, you know, but I say it in a way where I say, you know, if you

114
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,200
ask me to step up to bat for a show that's blatant about its fan service, I'll show up

115
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,640
to the plate with a road sign like Shizuo.

116
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,000
That sentence will go right over a lot of people's heads.

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,480
What the fuck does that mean?

118
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,020
Some people don't know what it means to step up to bat.

119
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,280
Some people don't know, I just don't get it at all.

120
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,840
You know, I could have dumbed it down.

121
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,400
I could have said every, you know, stopped every sentence and made my point very clear.

122
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,760
But that's not how I want to write.

123
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,000
I like videos that have this kind of cheeky aha nature to them.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,560
You know, my writing style is heavily influenced by ghost lightning who wrote like that.

125
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,040
Like a lot of his posts were like that, you know, he loved that video and I'm not surprised

126
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,360
because it's the kind of thing he would have written about in the same way he would have

127
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
written about it.

128
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:01,920
It's a very ghost lightning video and granted he would have probably had less defensiveness

129
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
over fan service even than I would have or less willingness to be defensive of shows

130
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,360
like Seiko and No Quasar.

131
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,920
But yeah, like, and only because he has less reason to, he's not as interested as I am

132
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,280
in those shows.

133
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,600
But you know, that's the style I like writing in.

134
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,000
But then the problem is that I also like reading comments and so I kind of have damned myself

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,080
because I'm going to have to read the comments of the people who don't pay attention, you

136
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,400
know, and the same thing happened with the Kill La Kill video and I made a whole clarification

137
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
video after that just because it was driving me fucking crazy.

138
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,360
And I'm tempted to do it with the Flying Witch video.

139
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,680
I'm tempted to make a clarification thing, but then I have to take a step back and be

140
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,960
like, hold on, you know, the reason you didn't write this dumbed down is because it's not

141
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,280
about the audience.

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,480
It's about what I wanted the video to be, you know, it's not about the mass appeal.

143
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,040
That's why I'm a boogie pop guy.

144
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,880
You know, that's why I say that.

145
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,480
Even though people might look at my videos and think, well, is this really like an artistic

146
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
statement?

147
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,760
Like what's so, you're just like describing what's in a show.

148
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:20,280
Yeah, but you know, even then there's a level of abstraction there of, you know, writing

149
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,160
with the expectation that the audience will pay full attention and watch the whole video

150
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
before they come to any conclusions.

151
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,480
And even some people who I can tell are fans of me and, you know, and wanted to understand

152
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,840
the point didn't quite get it.

153
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,920
And I had, I had a lot of conversations like on Twitter and other places with people who

154
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,760
just they seem to have gotten out of it.

155
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,320
Like what they like, like, like at some point in the video, they thought, well, now I get

156
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,040
the point and then, you know, didn't listen to the whole thing.

157
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
Like my videos have to be consumed as a whole entity.

158
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,640
There is no like, there's nothing you can break off of it and it'll still make sense

159
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
as a whole.

160
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,560
You know, it's why the Astroscore sucks is so misunderstood by people who don't watch

161
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
the whole thing.

162
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,400
You know, people who watch like little bits and pieces of it and like, he's just trashing

163
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
some show.

164
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,480
It's like, yeah, there's always a greater point to why I built up to this, to this ending.

165
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,440
You know, the video is a complete piece of work.

166
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
It's not just a string of random ideas.

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,160
I get why people think that way because so much of what's out there, so many videos are

168
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:36,780
just formulaic, you know, strings of fucking comments on things that are all taken at face

169
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:43,200
value, that don't have a greater point they're getting to in the end, you know, and I, if

170
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,720
I just had written the video in such a way, like if I just reversed it, you know, if I

171
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,720
reversed the point, made it very explicit in the beginning, what my point is about to

172
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,000
be and then explained the point, then more people would have understood where I was coming

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
from.

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,280
But it doesn't have that same flavor to it of the fun aha moment that comes at the end

175
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,200
of this build up, you know, it's, it's more dramatic the way I write it because I want

176
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,280
it, I want it to feel cool, you know, I don't want to just fucking describe something.

177
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,800
I don't want a drab analysis of something.

178
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,400
You know, there's a reason I would never write in the style of like Matthew Matosis

179
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,960
and not to say that I don't like his style, it's fun to watch his videos, but they're

180
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,920
very much a cut and dry start from the beginning, work your way through, describe every single

181
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,560
thing, you know, make the point very abundantly clear from the beginning and I would never

182
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,040
be able to write in that style and I don't like it as much, you know, I really prefer

183
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,840
like a Mr. B tongue video where he deliberately strings you along and keeps like hinting at

184
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,520
you that maybe you're going to get to see the point, but you really got to make it through

185
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,680
all this other stuff, you know, and then when he finally brings it all back, it's tight

186
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,040
and impactful, you know, and it's a lot harder to like rewatch a Matthew Matosis video than

187
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,640
it is to rewatch a Mr. B tongue video or one of my videos I'd like to think, you know,

188
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,680
I write them in a way that's meant to be re-consumable, that they're meant to stand

189
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,880
alone as articles that are interesting, that you reread multiple times and that are engaging

190
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,320
on their own, it's not just what I'm talking about that's interesting, it's the way I'm

191
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,360
talking about it that's interesting.

192
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,720
That's why those are the videos that, you know, that I mark on Patreon that I feel proud

193
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,920
enough of to try to make money off of it, because to me, that's more of an artistic

194
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:49,000
video, and that's why I love writing so much, but you know, if a lot of people are going

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,080
to misunderstand it and like at some point I have to decide, do I want to, you know,

196
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,960
just make another fucking video, re-clarifying the points just so that the discussion will

197
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,760
be better, or do I want to just like ignore the discussion like a normal artist would,

198
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,000
you know, because most artists are not dealing with this problem, most people don't have

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,200
to hear from D, they don't have to hear him talk about their work and be just bombarded

200
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,960
with the knowledge that they didn't pay attention, you know, and then get so bothered by it that

201
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,720
they feel the need to clarify again and explain their own art, most people don't have to explain

202
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,680
their own art, you know, and yet somehow I keep finding myself in that position and

203
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,080
it doesn't help that my art is basically explaining art, you know, so it's kind of

204
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
cyclical.

205
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,440
There's a reason I don't send my videos to the people who make the shows, you know,

206
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,680
because even though I feel like I get it, I don't, you know, it's just all opinions,

207
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:01,440
it's just, it's its own thing, it's not even relative to the artist's intention and I'm

208
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,400
sure there's a few artists I've talked about their work who would absolutely hate me if

209
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:12,720
they had to watch one of my videos, you know, but um, yeah, that's the sort of suffering

210
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,960
that I feel in the comments sometimes.

211
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:23,760
And so without further ado, just to clarify, that video was not criticizing fan service

212
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,920
nor was it criticizing the fan service in those shows except for the fact that clingy

213
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,120
clothes bother me personally.

214
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,160
It was a criticism of the way that people talk about fan service and how people don't

215
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,880
seem to appreciate that these shows are blatantly featuring the most attractive characters and

216
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,240
putting them in the most attractive outfits because that's appealing, you know, and how

217
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,800
it's funny to me that that's not criticized as immature in the way that showing tits would

218
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,840
be even though it's basically the same thing.

219
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,960
That's the point of the video.

220
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,400
For anybody who didn't get it, who might be listening to this now, um, I doubt that's

221
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
too many of you.

222
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,800
Oh God, alright.

223
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:19,160
This was actually a real decompression, uh, issue, so glad this show still exists.

224
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,360
Maybe this whole decompression chamber podcast is gonna stick around for longer than I, uh,

225
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,560
just thought because man, I've gotten to a point that I almost need it.

226
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:38,280
Today I had a moment early this morning that was so powerful in making me want to talk

227
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,840
about it on the decompression chamber that it's had me anxious all day.

228
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
It's Christmas Day as I'm recording this.

229
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,760
I, um, I had planned to spend Christmas with my parents, get drunk all night and spend

230
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
the night at their house.

231
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,560
I ended up going a day early and doing that the day before, um, so I was there Christmas

232
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:05,120
Eve night, woke up on Christmas, you know, hung out with them, um, felt weird all morning

233
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,000
for reasons I'll get into later, read this comment that really set me off and I really

234
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,120
wanted to decompress about it, um, but I ended up being there till 10 at night, finally drove

235
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,960
home, um, and I'm gonna talk about it.

236
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,520
I don't, it's hard to know where to start with this, but I'm gonna start by explaining

237
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,720
something, a concept I came up with a couple of months ago.

238
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,160
I don't remember if I've talked about this anywhere, but if I have, I'm sorry.

239
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,400
It's called the good person fallacy, fallacy, if you will.

240
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
I know I say it wrong, because you know there's all these, uh, argument fallacies that people

241
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
talk about.

242
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,600
There's one that, that I find comes up all the time, which is the fallacy that the opponent

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,760
in your argument is trying to present themselves, present themselves as a good person.

244
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,920
Because that's not something I try to do.

245
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,520
I don't believe myself to be a great person.

246
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm not a bad person, but I don't believe myself to be a great person.

247
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,640
I don't believe very many people to be great people.

248
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,360
You know, to me, being a good person is, is b- like, okay.

249
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,400
You know, good and bad, like, most of us are 6 out of 10 people.

250
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Let's put it that way.

251
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
You know?

252
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,480
If you're a good person, you gotta be a 7 or 8.

253
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
You gotta be putting a little effort in.

254
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
You know?

255
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,160
You gotta be greasing the fire of the good person, you know?

256
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,360
And bad people are, are, you know, doing something real wrong, basically.

257
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,880
Fundamentally, something's broken.

258
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I don't think I'm a good person.

259
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,440
I think I'm like a 6 or 7 out of 10, you know, really depending on who you ask.

260
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,680
In terms of moral quality.

261
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Maybe even a 5.

262
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,880
I actually might be a 5 out of 10.

263
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Or maybe lower.

264
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,120
It really depends on who you ask.

265
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Uh, you know, I think to be considered a, a good or great person, you have to be a

266
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
good person.

267
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,480
You have to be someone who's self-sacrificing and helpful and kind and, you know, having

268
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,040
the qualities of a good, a good individual.

269
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,400
I don't have a lot of that.

270
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,760
You know, I have it, maybe I have it more than a lot of people.

271
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,280
Um, I, I have a lot of empathy.

272
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,400
I understand other people pretty easily.

273
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I feel a lot for other people.

274
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,360
I don't do a lot for other people.

275
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,720
I feel a lot more than I do, you know?

276
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,840
I feel really bad about all the hardships in the world.

277
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,440
I don't do a lot to help them.

278
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,160
I, I've, uh, often said I have a Ruroni Kenshin policy when it comes to helping people, which

279
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
is I help the people I can see.

280
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,080
The ones who are right in front of me.

281
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,600
The ones who I understand their situation and what needs to be done to help it.

282
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,320
You know, I don't give to charity.

283
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,240
I don't try to help out on a global scale or anything like that.

284
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,520
And there are people out there who do those things.

285
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,320
Those are great people.

286
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,760
You know, my dad is a much better person than me.

287
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,120
He does a lot for charity.

288
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,160
He does a lot for helping people.

289
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,800
You know, he gives a lot of both time and energy and money and love and care.

290
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
He gives all that.

291
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
I don't give that.

292
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,880
I'm not a great person like my dad, you know?

293
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:33,200
And when I get into an argument with someone, I'm not trying to prove that I'm great.

294
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,160
I'm not trying to prove that I'm morally righteous.

295
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm just trying to prove what I think, you know?

296
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,880
I'm just trying to state how I feel on the matter and support my claims and make you

297
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,560
understand how I feel.

298
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,280
It's not about convincing you that I'm right or good.

299
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,600
It's just about convincing you that I understand my own position sort of.

300
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:03,440
So this also, you know, this sounds a lot like my usual moral, my objectivity versus

301
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,600
subjectivity arguments.

302
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
It's very similar.

303
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,560
I feel the same way about morals, you know?

304
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,800
And I've been described as a moral relativist by some people.

305
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,040
I don't know how much I agree with that though.

306
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,720
It's not that I think, I mean, yeah, there's no objective standard of morals because that's

307
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,800
fucking ridiculous, that mere idea.

308
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,440
But you can have a pretty clear consensus on what's good and bad, right?

309
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,920
My version is anything that brings you closer to life is good.

310
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,140
Anything that brings you closer to death is bad.

311
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,600
If what you're doing has a net gain for humanity, it's good.

312
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,960
If what you're doing is a net gain for humanity, that's negative, it's bad.

313
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,120
And you know, you can never predict what it's actually gonna be.

314
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,040
There's no way to actually like predict what effect, you know, what ripple effect your actions

315
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
will have.

316
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,720
But on a case-by-case basis, we can say like, you shoot a guy, that's bad.

317
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,560
You know, you do something that endangers people, that's bad.

318
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,760
You do something that helps people, that's good.

319
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,880
I think that's pretty clear.

320
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,880
I think that's pretty fucking cut and dry and nobody's gonna disagree with it, you know?

321
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,640
So yeah, I do have a standard of what I think is good or bad morally.

322
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,080
I just don't hold myself to that standard.

323
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,040
I don't go out of my way to paint myself as a good person, nor do I think of most people

324
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,540
as good people.

325
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,440
You know, like, it's not that I think of myself as worse than most.

326
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,760
I think there's probably a lot of people who think they're good, who I would disagree

327
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,640
with them on that.

328
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,740
Because the way I see it, every resource we use, you know, is a resource we're not giving

329
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,040
to someone else.

330
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,040
You know, someone who needs it, doesn't have it and we're using it and we don't need it.

331
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,000
That's a thing that is just, that's a part of Western society right there.

332
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,080
If we gave up our conveniences and used those to help the impoverished, we'd have a lot

333
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,120
fewer impoverished and we don't do it because, and for good reason, we wouldn't be happy

334
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
if we did it.

335
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,860
You know, we're not raised in such a way, we don't have such a mindset to make us people

336
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,360
who can do that.

337
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,600
There are people who can do that out there.

338
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,880
Those are great people, but you know, they're not great because they made this unbelievable

339
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,280
decision to be great.

340
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,400
They're great because they have the state of mind to be great.

341
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,560
They're people who, you know, were raised in a certain way and have a certain set of

342
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,440
beliefs that leads them to do great things.

343
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,680
But that's not me and that's not most people.

344
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,400
I wrote about this in my song, Seeth, you know, I'd be hard pressed to name two guys

345
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,160
that I like unqualified or any that I find to be good, as I say, said in those lyrics.

346
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,720
A lot of these thoughts, a lot of these kinds of thoughts are more present in my song lyrics

347
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,280
than they are in any of my writing or podcasting and stuff like that because I tend to get

348
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:10,980
out more of my anger and vitriol towards humanity out in my music.

349
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:21,100
But I have to talk about this and this boils down to really my sub versus dub video I did,

350
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,300
my video about my stance on dubs on multiple levels.

351
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,380
I almost responded to this when I talked in that last section where I was talking about

352
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:36,940
comments, but I forgot to get to this because I got a certain accusation a number of times

353
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:43,700
on that video of being very biased and unfair and ignorant about the dubbing industry.

354
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:50,940
And when I got those comments, all I could think was, well, yeah, this is not a review

355
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,300
of the dubbing industry.

356
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,700
This is my stance on dubs that I somehow still haven't made a video about.

357
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,940
I never said my stance on dubs was not ignorant.

358
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,420
I never said it was fair and balanced.

359
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,640
I never said I'd done research.

360
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,020
Never said I had any investment in the dub industry.

361
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,180
I don't give a fuck about dubs.

362
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,940
I don't even like dubs or respect dubs as I said at the beginning of the video, you

363
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,500
know, some there are some people who said they turned off right there and I'm like fair

364
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:30,180
enough, you know, I don't like or respect dubs didn't say I was going to be fair about

365
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,180
it.

366
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,780
So that's part of the criticism.

367
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,900
Now I also wanted to talk about this because there's a part in the video where I say that

368
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,700
I hate Vic Minyona both as an actor and as a person and I got a bunch of questions like

369
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,220
asking why why do you hate Vic Minyona?

370
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,620
And I real quickly realized I can't answer all of those and this is one of the difficulties

371
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,140
of doing videos is that I feel like I constantly have to re clarify and explain things.

372
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,300
Every little thing I say I have to then make another video about or make a thousand comments

373
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,780
explaining it and at this point I was like, I don't like a lot of the times it's something

374
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,140
I don't care that much about, you know, I just said it as a one off line in a video.

375
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,660
I don't want to have to go and explain.

376
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,380
I'm not that invested in my hatred of Vic Minyona.

377
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,460
I just think it's really funny because I think he's a douchebag and I hate his acting,

378
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,920
you know, which really should be enough of a reason to hate the guy because he sucks

379
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,100
at acting and I don't like him.

380
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,940
I've hated people for less.

381
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:40,860
So I was answering people on my Reddit board who asked, you know, I explained myself.

382
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:48,700
I said, well, he's a weird Christian fundamentalist who has said at a panel before that he doesn't

383
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,340
think that Edward Elric is actually an atheist even though in Japanese Edward Elric literally

384
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,180
says I'm an atheist.

385
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,020
They changed that line in the dub, possibly as a result of him not being comfortable with

386
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,340
it.

387
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,660
That to me is more than enough reason to hate the guy, you know, I don't know him.

388
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,060
I don't care about him.

389
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
Maybe he's a nice guy.

390
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,420
I don't fucking care.

391
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,580
Still hate him.

392
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,140
You know, it's not about whether he's a good person or even whether he's a better person

393
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
than me.

394
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,020
It's just about what pisses me off.

395
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,580
That pisses me off.

396
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:27,300
He refused to sign a picture of his character from Free like making out with another guy.

397
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,860
I was like some Yaoi fan art and he wouldn't sign it because, you know, it just made him

398
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,820
uncomfortable, whatever.

399
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
Fuck him.

400
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,820
Fuck that guy.

401
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,060
Fuck him for being uncomfortable about some gay shit, you know.

402
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,860
Fuck him for being weird, a weird 50 year old guy who dresses like a teenage heartthrob.

403
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,140
And there's there's a thousand rumors on the internet about misconduct he's had with like

404
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,500
underaged fans of his.

405
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,780
I don't know how true any of it is.

406
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,980
I've been hearing these rumors for years, forever.

407
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,860
You know, every time someone brings up Vic Mignona, someone else brings up, oh, he might

408
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,420
have molested a bunch of fucking 14 year olds or something.

409
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,820
You know, you hear something enough times, you think it's probably true, maybe it's not

410
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,260
true at all, maybe it's just a bunch of bullshit that's out there on the internet.

411
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,860
I don't give a fuck, you know.

412
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,860
Don't like the guy.

413
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,620
I'm not out to lead a smear campaign against him.

414
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,220
You know, I'm not out to ruin his career, I've just made a decision about how I feel

415
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,460
about him.

416
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,780
And I think it's funny, so I keep saying it.

417
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:33,060
Now I got a comment in response to this, that pissed me off on a lot of different levels.

418
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,900
And it tends to be that the comments that pissed me off the most are the ones where there's

419
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:45,460
some element of it that I agree with, but it's packaged in a way that I vehemently disagree

420
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
with.

421
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:52,100
They never have those people who say like, fuck you, I hate you, your content is awful,

422
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,340
and then they rant about all these different reasons they don't like you and all of it's

423
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
a bunch of bullshit.

424
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,380
But then there's that one nugget in there that you're like, if you had just said that

425
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,300
and you'd said it politely, we could have had a conversation about this, you know, but

426
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,180
they don't.

427
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:13,420
So this guy gets mad at me because he says, you know, while I don't know Vic Minyona,

428
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,540
I have, you know, talked to him through emails and stuff, and he seems like an upstanding

429
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:24,660
guy in a cool chill guy or whatever, and I think all those rumors about him doing all

430
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,420
that misconduct is a bunch of horseshit and like a smear campaign against him.

431
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,900
And that part, he was obviously mad at me because I was talking shit about somebody

432
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,700
without having a lot of information about him, you know, without knowing the guy.

433
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,940
And he might be an okay guy, and maybe it's fucked up for me to sling mud at people I

434
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,060
don't know.

435
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,840
That's a fair enough argument, you know, I would have been willing to have a conversation

436
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,980
about that.

437
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:57,180
But it was packaged in between, oh, and you're such a good person, you think you're any morally

438
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,180
superior to him, you fucking, and then he goes on about like these problems he has with

439
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:07,380
me and how he thought I was, I was intellectual enough to be above all this kind of stuff,

440
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,460
but you know.

441
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,140
So obviously, that part of the argument just pissed me off, so I told him to fuck off.

442
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,820
Um, I said fuck off, he said I was attacking, I said I'm not attacking Vic Minyona, okay,

443
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:26,540
I'm just being a dick over here on my subreddit, you know, explaining myself, I've made a statement

444
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,060
that I don't like the guy, I've explained why I don't like the guy, this is not an attack,

445
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,340
I'm not waging an internet war against fucking Vic Minyona, you know, there's a reason I

446
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,660
didn't make a video about this, I don't want to go around spreading rumors about insinuations,

447
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,020
it's just what I've heard, and I have no reason to doubt it, I don't have any reason

448
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,560
to believe this guy just because he talked to him in a couple emails that he suddenly

449
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:57,580
knows what Vic fucking Minyona's like, you know, and the candor of the comment sort of

450
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:03,560
clued me in that this guy is probably also a Christian guy who probably likes Vic for

451
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:09,040
those reasons because he said that he thinks the reason that Vic gets these accusations

452
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,760
is from people who don't like that he's Christian and have a problem with his beliefs, then

453
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:23,240
the things he accuses me of are weirdly things that a Christian would have a problem with,

454
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,120
so I thought okay, this guy's probably defending Vic because he's sick of seeing Christians

455
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:34,440
get beat up on for being Christians, you know, and I get that, that's also fair, I don't

456
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,160
like Christians, don't like their belief system, don't like the fundamentalist mindset,

457
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:55,880
you know, I think it's a fucking willful ignorance to know scientifically why something

458
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,120
is untrue and to go on believing it anyways, it's like well, you know, it's one thing

459
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,000
if you just don't know any better, but it's a whole other thing if you've been shown

460
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,520
the evidence and you still keep going on believing what you want to believe just because, especially

461
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:17,040
if it affects other people, you know, when you have religious people who, you know, are

462
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,200
like uncomfortable with or have a problem with gay people because it goes against their

463
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,440
doctrine, even though their doctrine is not couched in any kind of scientific reality,

464
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,120
then that's just being a fucking willfully ignorant shitbag, you know, not saying that

465
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,980
everyone who's Christian is that, but a whole lot of them are and I don't see any reason

466
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:46,320
for the religion to exist, I don't see how it helps anybody for it to be around, so yeah,

467
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,000
to me, can't say I have a whole lot of respect for it, sorry if that offends you, but this

468
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,360
brings me to the next interesting thing about this comment and about being an internet content

469
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,920
creator or any content creator.

470
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,240
Well, I guess this is mostly true on the internet because most people wouldn't get to witnesses.

471
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,920
I have had these moments all throughout my career where I get to literally watch someone

472
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,640
become disillusioned with me as a human being.

473
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:23,960
I get to watch people go from thinking I'm good to no longer thinking I'm good, you

474
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,480
know, hearing something I've said that they find questionable and then deciding that they

475
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,600
like me less because of it and I've gotten to watch this happen a number of times and

476
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:42,040
it is a deeply fascinating and in some ways frightening experience because it's always

477
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,160
sad to know you've let someone down, but at the same time it's not my fault that they

478
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,920
are getting let down, you know, I can't control what they believed I was going to be or what

479
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:02,920
they want a person to be, you know, let's take for example, I mean, I think it's pretty

480
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,800
clear to most people who get into me that I drink a lot, you know, I've made that a

481
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,960
part of my identity, I do a show called the pub crawl, I have alcohol and all my avatars

482
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,800
and banners, I drink it on camera, I talk about it all the time, you know, I want it

483
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:24,000
to be clear that like, I'm a I'm a drinky guy, you know, it's a thing I do.

484
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,560
So I don't think there's a lot of people who come in and but I did see this before when

485
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,080
I first started drinking more where people started being like, you know, it makes me

486
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,640
uncomfortable that you drink so much because some people aren't comfortable with alcohol.

487
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,600
Some people aren't comfortable with this or that and it's not even always on a moral

488
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,320
level sometimes it's just on an experience level and I totally get it like when I was

489
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,720
a teenager, I was very straight laced, you know, I didn't do anything illegal.

490
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,280
And when other people did those things, I felt more disconnected from them.

491
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,160
When I heard people like talk about like all the weed they were smoking, you know, some

492
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,380
content creator talking about like weed and shit and like fetishizing it and talking

493
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,400
so much about it, it just put a little bit of distance between me and them because here

494
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,160
I was as someone who was deliberately not doing those things, you know, and then hearing

495
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,800
somebody else talk about it, it just feels alienating on some level.

496
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,360
And I understand that, but it's it's interesting to watch it happen because there's other

497
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,080
people who will be less alienated.

498
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,880
If I say something, if I go on here and talk about smoking weed, there's some people who

499
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,240
are going to be like, yes, this is exactly what I want to hear.

500
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
I love you more than ever before.

501
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,920
You know, please talk about this all the time.

502
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,480
It really makes me happy.

503
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,600
And there's going to be other people who are like, I'm so uncomfortable hearing you talk

504
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,040
about smoking weed that I, you know, it makes me want to tune out or I skip those parts

505
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
in the video.

506
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,120
You know, it's divisive subject matter and everything I talk about is divisive.

507
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,440
It's just on different levels and different different levels of people caring about it.

508
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,240
You know, it's one thing to be divisive about your opinions of anime, but it's a whole other

509
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:09,680
thing to be divisive on like a political or social issue that people might feel more strongly

510
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:18,760
about, you know, it invites a different level, especially when there's people who completely

511
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,880
agree with you on one front and then totally not on another.

512
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,800
You know, some people who are like, man, our taste in anime is exactly in sync, but the

513
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,560
way you live your life completely disgusts me, you know.

514
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,360
And it's funny when people equate the two.

515
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,480
Like this guy who left this comment, I don't know what the fuck he could have seen from

516
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,360
me that gave him the idea that I'm like this above conflict intellectual, like just because

517
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:53,080
I analyze anime and sound smart, I somehow am also, well, I must be like some kind of

518
00:37:53,080 --> 00:38:03,480
fucking, I don't know, through through anti violence, anti being mean to anyone guy.

519
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,040
Not really the case, you know, I can be mean spirited.

520
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,840
I can be insulting.

521
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,080
I can be a dick.

522
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,400
I don't hold myself to that kind of high standard because I don't think I'm different

523
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,400
from most people, you know.

524
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,880
I'm not exactly trying to present myself as an amazing guy.

525
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:35,800
Um, again, not that I think I'm an outright supervillain or anything, but sometimes I

526
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,080
do feel like a bad guy, you know.

527
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,520
I relate to a lot of bad guys.

528
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,200
I relate a lot and I appreciate art from a lot of bad guys.

529
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,720
And that's another thing like part of the reason that I'm not willing to hide those

530
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,440
elements is that I respond well to those things.

531
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,240
I really love listening to Kanye West talk about how much of a shit person he can be,

532
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,880
you know, or a lot of rappers who rap about similar things.

533
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:13,200
I like, you know, I like listening to people who are outsiders who feel like they don't

534
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,120
agree with society, who feel out of place, you know, because I've always felt that way.

535
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,280
So that kind of shit resonates with me, you know, and that's the kind of stuff I want

536
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,560
to put out there.

537
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,880
I'm not out there to put on a squeaky clean image for people who want to fit in, you know,

538
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,280
it's not me.

539
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:36,760
So so I get to witness these things and I want to pull up this list of things that that

540
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:45,000
guy called me on my phone, because I found this to be a fascinating list of accusations

541
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,240
that he called me in this comment.

542
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,520
You can find this on my Reddit, by the way.

543
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
All right.

544
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:03,480
He says, he says, I don't see why he needs to continue to be personally attacked by degenerates,

545
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,440
which I never personally attacked Vic Minyona, but I find it interesting this implication

546
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,600
that I might be a degenerate, as if you or anyone else who attacks him is in any way

547
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,280
morally superior, while I certainly never claimed moral superiority to Vic Minyona.

548
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,480
As what qualifies one for virtue today are masturbating to porn and being a morally relativistic,

549
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,120
carefree libertarian who smokes the occasional blunt and voices some hate for a religious

550
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,000
person every now and then for good measure.

551
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,160
So I thought it was really interesting.

552
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,320
I'm not entirely sure if he's talking about me because some of that stuff just seems like

553
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:50,200
smokes the occasional blunt is such an odd out of place sentence and sentiment in here,

554
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:57,080
as is the masturbates to porn, really, because first of all, I've never had a blunt before.

555
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:05,400
I've smoked weed exactly twice in my life once a year ago and once last night, leading

556
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:12,960
into that as well, and I don't understand why that's coming up in an argument about

557
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,880
whether or not I'm a morally upright person because there's literally nothing wrong with

558
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,080
smoking weed.

559
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,160
But again, this is a matter of perspective.

560
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,040
For some people, if I talk about smoking weed, it's like, you know, like to them that's

561
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,320
like totally affirming, it makes me a better person, whereas others would think I'm worse.

562
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,080
Masturbating to porn, if you have a problem with that, I'm fucking sorry, but you're

563
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,520
a complete moron.

564
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,160
And then what was the other one?

565
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,800
Morally relativistic, which I already talked about, carefree libertarian.

566
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,760
I don't think I'm a libertarian.

567
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,680
I mean, I have so many socialist ideas.

568
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,520
I've said this before, I'm Aberdorf Linkler politically.

569
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,600
I completely see both sides of the issue.

570
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,840
If I'm libertarian, it's only to save my own ass, you know, it's just that like I think

571
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:11,440
libertarian belief systems and structures support my lifestyle better, you know, if

572
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,720
I was living in such a way that I thought socialism benefited me, I'd probably be more

573
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,600
of a socialist.

574
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,480
But that's all neither here nor there.

575
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,360
I don't consider myself a moral person.

576
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:34,440
I don't think I have to like people who are morally better than me, you know.

577
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,520
That is not my basis for judgment on people.

578
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:45,600
It's more about whether the things they do piss me off or not, you know.

579
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:52,480
I get a bad vibe from Vic Minyona, not a bad vibe as in he's a bad person, but a bad vibe

580
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,680
as in he does things I don't like personally.

581
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,360
So that's why I don't like him.

582
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,520
And maybe that's completely unfair and maybe I'm actually the asshole in that whole scenario.

583
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,400
I don't care if I am the asshole.

584
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:18,400
I am through with the notion that I am cool, as I say in the song Seath once again.

585
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,000
So I did get super duper high last night.

586
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,240
I started off normal high, which I hadn't been before.

587
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,480
It was all right.

588
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,160
I just ate everything.

589
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,920
I got the munchies super hard and ate everything in sight.

590
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,160
Then I just felt really chill and I was like, okay, this is probably the state of mind most

591
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,400
people are in who like getting high is just being chill and listening to electronic music,

592
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
you know.

593
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,960
Listen to Frank Jev C's volume two and then a bunch of Pogo music and it was Trill is

594
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,960
all fucked.

595
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,200
Then I got way too high and then my brain started being a thousand thoughts every second

596
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,800
and nonstop analysis of everything happening around me and things were too fucked up.

597
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,200
And then I thought it would be hilarious to watch Shrek.

598
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,040
I thought for the memes, I'll watch Shrek.

599
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,280
Well hi, that was a fucking nightmare.

600
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,160
I'm going to read you my Snapchat story.

601
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,840
If you don't follow me on Snapchat and you want to see things like this by all means

602
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,240
follow me on Snapchat.

603
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:37,280
My handle is digibroni after D all one word because one of my dumb ass friends made the

604
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,480
account.

605
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:45,720
So let me go through my story on Snapchat because I live blogged Shrek while I was watching

606
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,720
it.

607
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:54,880
All right, first we have feeling 840 and it happening as you can hear Smash Mouth playing.

608
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,600
Holy shit Shrek is the ugliest animated film ever made since Food Fight.

609
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,160
Every word in that sentence is spelled wrong.

610
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,080
This film is a waking nightmare of awful.

611
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,040
There is one good line in this movie.

612
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,000
This film is a cultural forced meme.

613
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,280
I am trapped in the most thorough analysis of my life.

614
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,040
To be fair there are some little but solid gems in here.

615
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:26,840
This scene is a Trump commentary referring to Shrek trying to build a wall around donkey.

616
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,120
This film is about convincing libertarians to be socialists or converting libertarians

617
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:38,400
to socialists and the nightmare is over which I should have typed ogre but you know I wasn't

618
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,480
in the best state of mind.

619
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,320
So that's my very high analysis of Shrek.

620
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,640
While I was high that was the worst movie I've ever seen.

621
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,000
The animation is like just all very stiff and shitty looking.

622
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,400
The character models are hideous, absolutely hideous.

623
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Everything is very generic, low poly, it all looks like a fucking PS2 game like an early

624
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
PS2 game.

625
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,960
The movie just looks like dog shit as no aesthetic sensibility at all.

626
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,400
Everything is as standard and stock as it could possibly be.

627
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:24,680
A bunch of canned musical appearances, no cinematography at all.

628
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,320
The voice acting all sounds like it's recorded line by line.

629
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,600
Like it doesn't sound like the characters are reacting to one another.

630
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,880
Every line sounds like it was recorded multiple times and they chose a take or even constructed

631
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,200
a line from multiple takes.

632
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,080
And the music is generic.

633
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,480
The non-licensed music is generic.

634
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:53,040
So it's the worst movie ever according to me when I am feeling 840 as I put it.

635
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,440
So that might be a fun story for some of you and for some of you it might just sound like

636
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,000
an uncomfortable, self-destructive whatever.

637
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,680
See it's funny because I'm followed by a lot of nerdy types.

638
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,800
Nerdy types who often don't get into a lot of these things.

639
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,280
These illegal substances or substances at all.

640
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,360
People who don't drink.

641
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,760
And it's funny for me because even though I grew up super straight laced, everyone I

642
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,200
knew was super not.

643
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,360
My parents are fucking punk rock people.

644
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:36,480
My parents grew up going to shows constantly, smoking and drinking.

645
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,120
My dad never smoked much but he was always a big drinker when he was in his early 20s.

646
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,800
My mom smoked tons of weed with bands and shit.

647
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,360
And that's who my parents are.

648
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,040
I didn't really know that stuff growing up but my parents are fucking very loose people.

649
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,040
They swear constantly.

650
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,440
That's why I swear so much because my parents swear absolutely constantly.

651
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,000
As badly as I do.

652
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,520
And the people I knew in high school were all fucking stoners.

653
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,640
You know I was roommates with two of them at the same time.

654
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,720
They never smoked around me.

655
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:22,000
I never saw weed once until like last fucking Christmas the first time I even saw it.

656
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,760
I lived with two stoners.

657
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,320
They literally collected High Times Magazine.

658
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,640
A magazine about weed.

659
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,880
I guess I'd seen weed in that context.

660
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,560
But I'd read those magazines.

661
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:42,880
I'd sit on the toilet and read High Times or these weed books they had laying around.

662
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,120
I just grew up around a bunch of stoners and most of them had done other harder drugs and

663
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,000
drank a lot.

664
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,080
I didn't do any of that stuff but I was familiar with it.

665
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,240
So to me all that stuff is very normal.

666
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,760
It's all very like this is what everyone does.

667
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,280
I've grown up around media that represents those things.

668
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,040
I watch lots of movies where people do all kinds of drugs or listen to music that's about

669
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,040
drugs.

670
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,160
Most of the music I listen to is probably about drugs.

671
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,400
So to me that stuff all seems very natural and most of the people I know do it way more

672
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,540
than I do.

673
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,520
To people who don't drink at all I might seem like an alcoholic.

674
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,520
To an alcoholic I seem like a lightweight who barely drinks at all.

675
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,720
To people who've never smoked a cigarette I probably look like I'm addicted to cigarettes

676
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:44,800
which was true this past month or so but I'm quitting again but for years I smoked one

677
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,680
cigarette a day which is people who are like serious smokers.

678
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,160
My dad for 30 years smoked a pack to a pack and a half a day.

679
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,840
That's 20 in a pack by the way.

680
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,000
It's a world of difference.

681
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,560
My grandma was smoking four packs a day for most of her life.

682
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,520
She's still alive by the way.

683
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:13,120
She's like almost 80 and she had to quit eventually because she couldn't like she physically can't

684
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,720
even smoke anymore.

685
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,800
I did so many bad things to her lungs.

686
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:26,720
But yeah so to me that stuff all seems like babies first and again there's a divide in

687
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,780
the audience here.

688
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,920
Some people listening to this are going to go like yeah I know.

689
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,600
I know you don't do anything.

690
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,200
I know you're a fucking pussy baby and some people are going to be like yeah but you seem

691
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:46,360
like you're just a whirlwind of debauchery and nihilism which is you know I present

692
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:52,240
myself that way sometimes because I think it's funny but again I'm not I don't know

693
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,560
it really is a matter of perspective.

694
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:23,660
I've probably said that sentence 40 times now.

695
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:29,700
I guess to make a long story short if there's one thing I'm not interested in doing it's

696
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:36,660
policing myself publicly and I do it a lot more than it probably seems like I do given

697
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:42,500
the kind of stuff I talk talk about online just because I have very much tried to rein

698
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,740
myself in as a person who posts every fucking random thought I have because a lot of that

699
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:55,180
stuff is not relevant to many people and would actively make me seem like an idiot and I

700
00:51:55,180 --> 00:52:00,900
try to avoid that because if you read my old like if you read my Twitter circa like 2008

701
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:07,980
or 2009 or like read my old anime blog like it was just so much unnecessary information

702
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:17,420
so much extraneous bullshit that didn't need to be there and you know it really made me

703
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:24,100
come off as like this dumb kid who was constantly shouting every thought I had and it's like

704
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,940
obnoxious to read that kind of shit even though a lot of the Twitters I follow do practically

705
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:35,180
the same thing you know but um so I do rein myself in because I have a lot of stupid

706
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:41,420
thoughts that that you know that I think for a second I should tweet and then I don't but

707
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:48,220
I don't want to be the kind of person who is constantly concerned about the overall

708
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:55,860
moral presentation of my character you know again I am a gonzo journalist because it's

709
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:05,700
about the experience of like what is it to be me what is it to be an otaku you know who

710
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:11,780
works online it's not about presenting that as a good thing it's not about presenting

711
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,740
otaku as something you want to be you know if anything I'd rather portray it more like

712
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:22,220
welcome to the NHK as kind of a living hell and waking nightmare you know that's not how

713
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:28,460
I feel my life is but it can be that and I don't want to hide those elements you know

714
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:36,700
and I guess I would feel better about it if there was a squeaky clean guy you know if

715
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:42,780
there was a version of me who who did all the same things but just was a better person

716
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,500
or maybe another guy well there's plenty of people who do the same thing as me but are like

717
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:54,060
you know actively more like like I see someone like endless Jess as like me with no scruples

718
00:53:54,060 --> 00:54:00,300
about presenting myself that like you know I'm willing to go all out and just be you know the

719
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:07,340
monster that people want me to be in some cases now I absolutely love Jesse for that and I think

720
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:16,380
he's amazing for being so willing to put himself out there you know and and not be concerned about

721
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:22,380
trying to meet anyone's taste he does not give a fuck about your taste if anything he doesn't

722
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:29,260
respect you for the fact that your taste is not his you know and I think that's powerful and I

723
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:38,060
gravitate towards that um and on some level I because I feel like I'm such a spokesperson for

724
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,020
a lot of the ideas I'm talking about because of the fact that I present a lot of new analytical

725
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:50,140
ideas and I try to you know be a guy who also is talking about creators and also is trying to get

726
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:56,300
people into the media but I'm trying to be like this tour guide like that character you know gets

727
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:01,820
farther away from the gonzo element where it's like on some level I'm just trying to fucking just

728
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:08,540
introduce people to new concepts in anime that part of me can be more clean can be more polished

729
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:15,420
and doesn't have to be so gonzo but I'm not going to abandon the gonzo part and this creates a sort

730
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,460
of conflict of interest and I think this is part of why some of my videos go so misunderstood

731
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:27,660
because when I make a video like what is the appeal of anime or something like that is meant

732
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,220
to be as broad as possible it's really meant to be something everyone can appreciate and everyone

733
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:40,460
can learn from um whereas a video like flying witch uh in its fanservice is not broad it's not

734
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:47,500
for everybody it's not a video that is going to concern everyone it's almost academic it's very

735
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:53,180
like uh you know it's like a post made for other people who write about anime it's like

736
00:55:53,180 --> 00:56:01,660
criticizing the way that criticism happens so it's a little too meta for for for it to be mainstream

737
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:08,780
and you know reconciling those two different elements of my work can be difficult and I kind

738
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:16,300
of wish there was somebody else who wasn't gonzo who was presenting those you know those more

739
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:21,260
cleaned up versions but then again that person would probably be boring as shit you know because

740
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:28,540
in my opinion everyone is actually biased and you know are we actually going to care what someone

741
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:39,340
who's so presentable has to say I don't know I just know that it it's um it's really it's really

742
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:49,660
weird for me when my lifestyle and moral choices have to come into conflict with my public persona

743
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:53,180
and the idea of who I am and how certain people perceive me

744
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:09,660
but it's always gratifying at least to know that there are members of my audience who

745
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:15,260
absolutely buy into everything I'm doing and saying you know not to say that they like fully

746
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:21,740
support all of it and they're like oh yeah by all means be a degenerate monster it's just that like

747
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:30,220
they get it and they see me as a human you know not as a collection of ideals or as like a moral

748
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:38,940
figurehead or or someone who's trying to present facts and you know in unbiased stances they just

749
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,660
see me as like yeah he's just a he's just an interesting guy you know that's all I want to be

750
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:51,180
is an interesting guy a guy who you look at and you go man that guy's lifestyle is fascinating

751
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,700
and and and I know that people can do that because there's so many creators who I don't

752
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:03,020
agree with on so many things but I love them you know film crit hulk one of my favorite

753
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:10,300
writers of all time you know top five easily top five most influential and favorite people for me

754
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:18,540
I adore film crit hulk but you know he has a he has a lot of political opinions that I'm just

755
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:28,140
kind of like come on dude you know he's he he can go like really hard on that like uh like social

756
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:33,820
justice kind of angle that I don't you know don't resonate with that strongly not to say that I

757
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:38,460
completely disagree with everything from that camp but sometimes he goes down that road and I

758
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:45,260
don't feel like I can follow but I don't care because he's a flawed person he's a guy you know I

759
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:51,740
don't expect him to reflect my ideologies or like my moral stance I just want to read his really

760
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:59,580
interesting writing you know um and there's so many people I feel that way about uh and it can

761
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:05,420
there can be breaking points you know there's enough that I don't respect about movie bob that I

762
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,740
can't really watch him anymore without just getting pissed off because it creeps into everything he

763
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:16,780
does a lot of it being production and presentation that I just have problems with uh but also is

764
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:22,300
just like fucking shoving his political beliefs down your throat constantly and generally talking

765
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,620
like an asshole I could get into a whole other thing about movie bob I'm sure I've ranted about

766
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:35,820
him on the pcp a few times but uh but yeah like I just hope that more people can watch me

767
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:43,660
and think of me as just as just an interesting person who they they like hearing talk and

768
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:53,980
not trying to uh view me through a moral lens because it's it's unfair in a way that I can't

769
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:01,180
refute that guy because I don't know him you know that guy who left that comment who is you know

770
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:06,380
slagging off all these things he knows about me but I don't know about that guy because I'm sure

771
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:11,900
if I had him describe as much of his life to me as I've described to him I'd find a lot of fucking

772
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:19,500
shit that I don't agree with that he's done you know but what can you do other than telling

773
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:30,620
to fuck off and ban him from my subreddit piece of shit I suppose that's about it for this one

774
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:38,220
I don't really have another thing to decompress about I've had a few ideas of of things to talk

775
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:45,900
about on this show but um they're kind of more topical and I don't know it's it's weird to just

776
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:51,740
like jump into some topic that's on my mind on this show uh at least if I haven't fully fleshed it

777
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:56,940
out and some of those are maybe things for other videos or other places I don't know I'm still

778
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:02,300
kind of finding what the decompression chamber is exactly so I guess it's probably gonna live for

779
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:07,580
longer than I previously thought like aside from the fact that it's nice to actually have it when

780
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:15,820
I do need to decompress I also am not completely sure um what stuff does or doesn't go in this

781
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:25,420
and that's always an exciting kind of feeling um likewise digi bros might not end as soon as I have

782
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:31,580
been saying it would just because there has been more interest a little bit and like once I talked

783
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:35,580
about it you know people spoke up about it and I looked through and realized that the view counts

784
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:41,420
are not actually any worse than they have typically been and a lot of people pointed out the the rather

785
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:46,780
obvious reasons that I guess I just kind of forgotten about why the show is not very popular but I'll

786
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:58,620
get into that um on the next digi bros probably so um so yeah uh that about wraps up this decompression

787
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:05,100
chamber stick around on my after dark channel for something that's kind of like a decompression

788
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,940
chamber because you know I kind of want to keep this to one a week I don't want to have two come

789
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:15,500
out um less than a week apart but I do want to do a big end of the year sort of summary of what

790
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:23,020
things have been like for me kind of video like you know a capping off vlog so expect that to come

791
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:38,940
and be similar to this but uh yeah that's it uh have a nice day

792
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:54,860
um

793
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:24,860
um

794
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:54,860
um
