1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You appear to have caught me by surprise, hello I'm Dan Huxable and I'm taking over this

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,240
channel. Unfortunately the first 20 minutes of my audio was lost because although many

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,760
things are very good, nothing is perfect. My new laptop for some reason wasn't recording

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:34,960
the audio. So I'm going to improvise as I'm often known to do. Enjoy the show.

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:12,040
I don't think illustrious is the apt word to describe him. I'm more of a shadowy, shrouded

6
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:21,320
in a fog. A mist shroud. The barely perceptible Ben Saint. Just the way I like it honestly.

7
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:29,200
We're talking about Pokemon this episode. New Pokemon, absolute garbage. Let's talk

8
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,200
about communism. There's no new Pokemon. They're all gone. All Pokemon are gone. There's no

9
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:47,440
more for anyone. It's a Poppers Pokemon thing. Who cares? I was in London today. I met with

10
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,160
LeMantart who is a person you may know from RFCK and General Discord stuff. He's going

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,640
to be there at RFCKCon London. Let's talk about that a little bit. Why did you meet

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,000
him? What were you guys just saying? He just landed this morning. Yeah, I was just to say

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,640
hi. So he actually flew in for this? He's from Spain. I met him in Madrid when I went

14
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:23,400
to Madrid. He's in London for a work thing. It's perfect timing for him to be at RFCKCon.

15
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,680
Assuming he can get that one day, that day off. I just met up with him and it was nice.

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,200
London is really big. Oh, that's great. That makes me happy. I understand this might be

17
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,360
like a cliche and make sound like something that I say and it's fake and meant to get

18
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,080
your eyeballs on to me and rub your juices all over my sinful, sinful corpse. But genuinely,

19
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:55,960
I actually like meeting fans because kind of inexplicably is the newest Pokemon that

20
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,000
was just announced. You know what? That's a great name. Anyway, they're all like cool.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,680
RFCKCon is like only people who I genuinely like and would genuinely consider my friend.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,720
AJ Shoop and Connor and Paradox Crux. People like that literally just like them. Here's

23
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,800
why. Because in order to be into RFCK at all, there's a certain threshold of general personhood

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,280
competence you have to rise above as well as commitment to the organization of RFCK.

25
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,680
That is a perfect segue. I should just say that Potat was also there. I didn't mention him

26
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:42,000
because RFCK people may not know Potat. I know Potat from the PPP, the PPKP. Yes, we talked

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
about that a little. Oh, wait, who is it? I don't remember. The Potat PAPES Kevin podcast.

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,440
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. I know Potat from sounding vaguely similar to Tadpo. Anyway,

29
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,480
I was going to say, actually, it sounds more like Lotat, who we all famously met at that one

30
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,880
RFCK meetup. Stop talking about Pokemon. Stop even trying. Lotat tweeted at us. No,

31
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,200
no, Nate's actually the real fan in the scenario because I can't believe you would remember that

32
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,840
occasion at RFCK. It was a legendary moment. Lotat was so honored that we would acknowledge his

33
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,640
existence. Wait, it was great. Anyway, I want to talk about how I- You mean the Lotat? Yes,

34
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,120
the Lotat Twitter. In the flesh? In the flesh. Obviously, I wanted to get more people going

35
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,800
to specifically the London meetup because I feel it's like a PCP London meetup, a PCP

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,560
adjacent meetup. That doesn't happen a lot in Europe. That's a rare beast. I feel like it would

37
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,120
get people a little bit mad that they did not know this was happening. I thought it would just

38
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,480
be a nice gesture to post on the PCP that that was happening, the London comm was happening.

39
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,200
And so I decided to denounce the other ones as well, Baltimore and San Diego. And so I do that.

40
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,160
And then income flooding the PCP heads into the RFCK meetup. And I knew this would happen,

41
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,480
but the rate and the ferocity that which it did was simply like, I can't describe it in another

42
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,680
way than disgusting. Let me describe literally every single PCP fan to you. They're an anime avatar,

43
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,000
they're smug, and they think it's okay to be mean for no reason and just like just viciously bizarre.

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,560
So they're just coming here with no personality and no tact and no just like willpower. They are

45
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,920
pure leaders, not followers and their role play skills infantile, frankly. When you see

46
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:43,760
a PCP fan next to an RFCK fan, the PCP fan with their just some random anime bitch, no personality,

47
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,920
versus the level 100 boss, literally, yes. And then you and then you look just one thing over

48
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:57,440
to a frame, the paragon of RFCK culture with his completely original art avatar made for his

49
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,200
character, depicting a moment in RFCK in the game that happened in real life. It's not,

50
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,280
it's not a lifestyle, a noteworthy person as opposed to, you know, just an average RFCK,

51
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,720
you know. It's imbued with spirit. This has so much lore and context and history and culture

52
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,560
just imbued into this one aspect of his avatar where the PCP fans have literally never known

53
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,800
culture or history in their entire lives. It's because there's, there actually, there is a

54
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,240
barrier of entry to PCP stuff, but it is far lower than RFCK stuff. And that's why it doesn't

55
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,360
weed out the chat. Well, it's because PCP fans are all named DigiHeads, aka like I can't imagine

56
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,840
it in words fate. That's funny because PCP is like there's, it's so niche. It's so niche already.

57
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,560
It is. It is. RFCK is like niche within that. But you need to go even niche here. That's the way

58
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,520
to the, to heaven. Yeah. Anyway, I'm trying to pacify them and civilize them at the same time.

59
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,040
I'm just like continuously spamming the invite link to the main server in this meetup side

60
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,080
server that I created for the meetups. And so I'm going to try and save them. I mean,

61
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
I think it's a long shot. I think, I think they're going to reject it. I think they're going to be

62
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,600
like, what's the text command? It's way too hard. What's reading? Oh God, it's way, there's way too

63
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,640
much personality here. Please take me back. You sound like an actual cult leader. The only way to

64
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,440
save these people is to get them into RFCK and civilize them. Literally, yes. That's what I believe,

65
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:32,960
Nate. That's what I believe. Please just read my text. Read my Bible. It's way better than the

66
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,200
real Bible because it's got a little bit of a slimy touch to it. Just a little bit. We should

67
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,400
actually write one. We should actually just write one. There's a newspaper, right? But maybe those

68
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,920
people could be reappropriated to write an actual one. Or maybe the PCP should write one. You know,

69
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,720
I was reading, my friend John lent me this book called the, The Chapo Guide to Revolution

70
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,920
by the Chapo Trap House, which is another sort of podcasty collective, not entirely

71
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,760
dissimilar from us, but vastly more successful. Impossible. You can call getting into politics

72
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:18,560
success. Nate, you of all people cannot say that, die. Would you call making money success?

73
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,440
No. Okay, well, I guess. Who are you and what have you done to Nate? Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tom.

74
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,320
Nate said lying through his teeth. Yeah, yeah.

75
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,320
Nice. That's all I have to say about that, I guess. Did you read it? Did you like it?

76
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,080
I am reading it now. So far, it is a little bit too world history-y for me to get it. I'm a little

77
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,560
too dumb. You stabbed me. You stabbed me. I'm not, I'm not, Ben's no history buddy. I'm saying,

78
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm saying this as a like, I am ashamed of myself. You know what, you know, that's fine. You know,

79
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,560
you know how it's like funny and like quirky to say online, like, oh, I'm so like bad at math,

80
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,960
or at least it was in like early 2010s. Yeah, no, I'm not trying to be like, I don't know any

81
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,000
this world history. It's like, oh man, like now I wish I knew more about world history so I could

82
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
laugh at these jokes. Yeah, I feel that. You know what? It's wasted on, it's pearls before swine.

83
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,120
It's, it's just anime. Absolutely true. It's just anime. I've said this a long time, but it's just

84
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:28,480
anime. I mean, I know what the war on terror is in theory. But do I experience it day to day? Do I

85
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,960
participate? Did I live it? Do I facilitate? Do I facilitate it? Yes. Do I continue to vote? Absolutely.

86
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,240
But if you walk outside, you saw Modica Magica anime girl right there and like in the flesh.

87
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,200
It's like that. Hey, you're ready for a hard left turn. Here's a hard left turn. So I bear the singular

88
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,800
distinction of being the first PCP individual to acquire the legendary silver play button,

89
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,360
which I now have. You've got it. I have it. Yeah, it was in my, I showed it off in my,

90
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,000
my last video of me a math of a two. Digi should have rightfully gotten his, but just years and

91
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,320
years ago. Absolutely. But, but the thing is Digi is so incompetent at life and such a hack

92
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,160
fraud at basic organizational skills that he has not put his two brain cells have not collided

93
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,720
to produce in the production and speaking to the, uh, actually, you know who helped me out. I

94
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
didn't know how to get it. I talked to, um, uh, the gaming Brit and he was just like, yeah,

95
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,560
just message these guys. And I was like, Oh, okay. I did instantly solved and they got it rolling

96
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,840
immediately. Sounds, sounds, sounds about right. I'm all, I'm all for trophies and knickknacks and

97
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,920
just things to put around your house and just have clutter to just, you know, seize up your brain

98
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,080
and make you unable to function whatsoever. I'm going to hang out next to my diploma from school.

99
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,320
I mean, the diploma is far more impressive, but, you know,

100
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,440
I'm down for stuff like that. Oh, yeah. Do you like it? Do you like it?

101
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,480
Anybody can get a fucking diploma. Anybody can get a diploma. It takes work to get a hundred

102
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,520
thousand subscribers. You know, that's actually an interesting one's one's an accomplished more

103
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,280
impressive because like, I mean, just for example, look at the case of the, of the, the furtive Si.

104
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,760
Si is not, you know, he actually was pretty successful on YouTube for a while. But like,

105
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,480
but the question is like, what did it turn into long term? Because it wasn't like sustainable,

106
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,880
but he did get the play button. So as opposed to like a degree, a degree is something tangible

107
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,880
that you can have forever and used to to apply for jobs. Are you talking about Si all the time on

108
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,040
this show? This is something that if your diploma is something that if all goes according to plan,

109
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,400
you will never need again. Well, that is true. That is true. Then we can't hear you if you're

110
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,200
talking right now, if you're saying something. Yeah, you're dead. I don't hear a thing from Zen.

111
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
Having some audio. Maybe try rejoining or something. Oh, no. I don't know. No, no.

112
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,760
We have not even the last couple of minutes, at least for the past 10 minutes. I don't know.

113
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,320
Try restarting Discord, dude. Try. Doesn't make any sense. He introduced the episode and then

114
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,800
died. Is it just your mic? Is it recording into audacity correctly or something?

115
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,400
I don't know.

116
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,680
Is that dance text status or that damn voice status?

117
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,360
I guess restart your computer. I don't know. That's all I got. Delete your computer. Delete

118
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,200
your account. Discord complications. Delete system 32.

119
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,920
We're all docked up and ready to go. Hey, here's here's a fun fact. What's up,

120
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,720
Tony? The PCP has been getting just so fucked with demonetization recently,

121
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,560
that it simply was not the case up until very recently. But now I'm used to every episode.

122
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,520
Add Pocalypse too, baby. I mean, maybe. I'm used to every episode initially

123
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,520
getting said it's going to be demonetized. And then I do an appeal and they say, oh,

124
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,440
that's actually, you know, now it's fine. We understand. Like, sure, you guys were a little

125
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,240
bit silly, but you've been demonetized. Every fucking piece, literally every PCP episode

126
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,200
until late, like late April has been demonetized. And I don't think they were at the time. I think

127
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,000
they've been changed since then. And these have all been confirmed by manual review. YouTube changed

128
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,920
their their policy. And then they just, I don't know, man. They said no low quality podcast allowed.

129
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,320
Well, no, it's because of the fucking swearing. Yeah.

130
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,960
Yeah, because I've been seeing a lot of people complain about getting demonetized.

131
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,200
Carlos Mazzo started a whole fucking thing with Vox and they came down on YouTube hard.

132
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,960
I mean, sure. But like, we are in no way, I mean, people could be offended by what we say,

133
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,800
but we're not like in any way attacking people. We just swear. No, it has nothing to do with that.

134
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,240
They just they just doubled down on everything. And there's like hundreds of channels.

135
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,360
Just for the sake of clarification, the Vox thing was completely coincidental,

136
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,640
like the timing with at which YouTube changed the terms of service.

137
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,640
You think so? That was actually the case, because like they had it

138
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,360
like a while in the making. And like, you know,

139
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,320
well, regardless of the cause, it's fucking bullshit because there's nothing

140
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,360
unfamily friendly about this podcast. And they should be begging us to line up to serve ads on

141
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,040
our podcast. I was going to say that it's about time they finally caught up to our shenanigans.

142
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,920
They finally caught up with the times, demonetized the menace that is the procrastinators podcast.

143
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,320
I mean, I get it. If you got like a family friendly company, you probably wouldn't want to be on a

144
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,480
rather crass podcast, which is this one, I guess. It doesn't make sense to me because of the fact

145
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,000
that you can target ads to people based on the data you get from their computer or whatever.

146
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
So give us the fucking big titty enhancement surgery ads or whatever, you know?

147
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,960
People who are not children also spend money. Like there's lots of people who

148
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,160
adverts are going to be useful to for them to see.

149
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,120
Like fucking like Dick's Razor sponsors, you know, like they themselves sponsor fucking,

150
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,160
what's his name? Harry's Razor.

151
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,080
Maddox X co-host, Dick Show, Dick Show. Okay, I understand those guys,

152
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,200
I don't think they have like ads on YouTube, but like people like those are obviously showing

153
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,360
that like they're perfectly happy to be on like rude, crass stuff.

154
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,720
So where's the why not why not have a category for that kind of stuff?

155
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,400
Yeah, we've got YouTube kids. What about YouTube? Not kids.

156
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,920
I don't know. Maybe maybe like YouTube dark red YouTube.

157
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,880
After dark YouTube after dark the whole site.

158
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,440
It's just in dark mode.

159
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,520
Dark mode has to be enabled always.

160
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,880
It's mandatory.

161
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,080
I don't know. Maybe it's like a kind of worms that they don't want to open for some reason.

162
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,400
You know, yeah, that's probably true. And I get that like YouTube,

163
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,640
you know, a lot of people will find it really easy to shit on YouTube.

164
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,280
I'm actually pretty sympathetic to a lot of these things that they're being forced to do with.

165
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,600
No.

166
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,360
Because these are questions that like no one in the world has been had to like sort out the

167
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,960
exact nitty-gritty of YouTube now.

168
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,800
Except for fucking television.

169
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
How come you're not sympathetic?

170
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,600
I want to know.

171
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,800
To YouTube?

172
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,440
Yeah.

173
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Because like, I don't know. I mean, it's not even something that's like super like based in logic

174
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,560
to be fair.

175
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,440
It's just like, yeah, just like an emotional reaction.

176
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,560
Like, like we have, we have TV and we have radio.

177
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,840
These other mediums that existed forever.

178
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,760
And like they've sorted all this shit out.

179
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,400
It's not that difficult.

180
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,160
Right. But like the sheer amount of content that YouTube has as opposed to those other mediums.

181
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,800
It's just like.

182
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,680
I think it was.

183
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,080
What does that have to do with setting policy changes?

184
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,720
You know, like a policy.

185
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,200
Whether there's five channels or five million, your policy affects them all the same.

186
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,800
Right.

187
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,200
Yeah.

188
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,760
I think that the manual review thing, that's kind of bullshit.

189
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,360
The fact that you guys got the monetized form.

190
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't think there even should need to be manual review.

191
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,200
There should just be simple policy that affects everything.

192
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,400
And it's like, okay, if you are, if you, if we detect swearing or whatever in your fucking thing,

193
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,640
we'll have, we have something for when you're an advertiser and you get on YouTube.

194
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,120
It's like, do you want your stuff in front of adult content?

195
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,080
Yes or no?

196
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,720
They check.

197
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,360
Yes.

198
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,480
You just go on whatever.

199
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,960
They check.

200
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,520
No.

201
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,760
If the system scans and figures out anything.

202
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,640
I mean, I would love that.

203
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,360
You just aren't put on those videos.

204
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,600
So that's why I have no mercy.

205
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,480
No, but like the thing about that is like, it's such an easy solution that like,

206
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,960
I, I, I can't help but think that they actually have a good reason for not doing it.

207
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,240
You know, because they probably make more money with the convoluted system they have right now.

208
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,200
I guess.

209
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,560
Well, I mean, maybe.

210
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,760
I mean, it seems to me.

211
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,320
But has money always been like the motor's operandi for YouTube?

212
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,640
I thought that the thing that they value most is like the advertiser information,

213
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
as opposed to like making, because like, aren't they always in the red?

214
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Yeah, they never, they've never been profit.

215
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,680
From what I understand, hosting the videos puts them in the red,

216
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,120
but I'm sure the data that they're skimming now lets the rest of their business,

217
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,080
such as search and ad words, make way more fucking money.

218
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,840
I don't know how it all balances out.

219
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,280
Like the, so of course they're not going to make that data public because they don't want you to.

220
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,080
The idea that you had.

221
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
So everything speculation at the end of the day.

222
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,200
The idea that you had, Tom, about like advertisers checking if they want things,

223
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,040
like that would be great.

224
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,680
But I think the reason YouTube doesn't do that is not because YouTube like is good.

225
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Like none of this is like, oh, YouTube's, you know, I'm not like

226
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,560
saying that any of these things means that I respect and trust YouTube,

227
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,120
because ultimately they do stuff that I don't like.

228
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,600
And even if they can't help but do it, I don't like it.

229
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,480
But it's probably just because big advertisers, because of various news things with like PewDiePie,

230
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,760
have this idea that YouTube can be like a really horrible place.

231
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,640
And so YouTube has to like double down on getting rid of adult content,

232
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,520
even if it's like not that bad, even if it's just a fuck word every so often.

233
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,080
They have to like, they have to be seen to be pushing that so hard

234
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
so that they can get the biggest advertisers back.

235
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,800
Don't you think it's stupid, right?

236
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,480
That YouTube costs, like the Carlos Mazda thing is like the newest like example of this,

237
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,560
but like YouTube has a history of doing this where the legacy media will like

238
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,600
write hit pieces about YouTube and they'll capitulate,

239
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,680
even though the legacy media is their competitor and they're just like allowing their

240
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,040
competition that's already like basically dead already.

241
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,800
Like YouTube won, like it is a bigger, more powerful platform.

242
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
But all these small sites are just like,

243
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,080
well, if we just keep writing hit pieces and we still have this like

244
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,560
image of power or whatever our influence, we can force this company to do what we want

245
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
to put us in a better position.

246
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,080
It's just like insanity to me.

247
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,240
Like there's a really interesting video series by PSACich talking about the last adpocalypse

248
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,240
and how it was all like, like purposely designed in order to

249
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,880
I saw that video.

250
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
It was fucking great.

251
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,440
Or one of them anyway.

252
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,640
There's like two of them, I think.

253
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,200
Wasn't there one that you were talking about with like Rupert Murdoch

254
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
being sort of like the market value?

255
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,920
That's the one, dude.

256
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,280
It's fucking fascinating.

257
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,400
You're like, he's behind it all.

258
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
And it sounds like you're in a beautiful mind room.

259
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
But at the same time, it sort of makes sense.

260
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,320
Right.

261
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
It's like one of those crackpot conspiracy theories that it's like,

262
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,240
yeah, but like the pieces really do kind of fall into place.

263
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,080
Like it's pretty compelling.

264
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,880
Well, I mean, when it comes to YouTube's action specifically,

265
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,920
like I it's your world.

266
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,080
We could all sit here all day and talk about like the things that we think are a better

267
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,880
policy for them.

268
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,240
It's just that like I feel that I don't want to be ungrateful.

269
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,160
Really is what it comes down to great.

270
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,240
And I have lots of sympathy for how like I was saying before,

271
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,880
like how complicated some of these questions really are about like,

272
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,960
like advertisers have expectations.

273
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,840
And then I think it's true like the media class will kind of try to swoop in on things

274
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840
if it doesn't just have good optics.

275
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,160
So they have to like take that into consideration and like think,

276
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,880
OK, well, we can't.

277
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,760
Because the only reason advertisers are on YouTube is because they realize it's more

278
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,360
effective than traditional media platforms to get bigger reach for less money.

279
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,800
That's like the whole thing.

280
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,280
So if they don't want to play by the rules of being like,

281
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,080
yeah, new media is all about crazy fucking uncensored, insane content.

282
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,360
And you don't want to be a part of that.

283
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,040
Then just don't advertise on YouTube.

284
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,880
Like YouTube had all the power here because they were the ones.

285
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,760
They are the second biggest search engine on the Internet.

286
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,880
They are the single biggest website in existence.

287
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
They have all the eyeballs.

288
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
They had the power.

289
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
They could have said, you know what?

290
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,960
This is how the game is going to be played.

291
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
If you don't like it, have fun.

292
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,120
Advertising and like People Magazine are reaching seven people,

293
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
but they didn't do that.

294
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,520
They let themselves get co-opted by interests that are counter to their platform functioning

295
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,400
properly.

296
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:47,600
I would not give YouTube a free pass for like doing stupid shit on the regular

297
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
because of how stupid it is.

298
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,440
But I will say that there is some sort of like,

299
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,400
there's an element of like entitlement to being paid on the Internet.

300
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Like this was not a thing that could be done like a decade ago,

301
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
or maybe two decades ago at this point.

302
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,000
So like I won't give YouTube a pass for being stupid,

303
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,880
but I will praise YouTube for at least existing as a free video

304
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,840
uploading site that has a large amount of people to see.

305
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm not going to say here that like, oh,

306
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,840
YouTube like sucks and is the worst thing ever.

307
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,680
I just think YouTube is making shitty bad decisions in terms of running.

308
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,560
Perfectly fine.

309
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,680
Perfectly fine point.

310
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah.

311
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,200
Well, I don't know.

312
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,920
I mean, if they keep on capitulating, what is why then?

313
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,320
You know, is it because like they want the image of being like a legitimate source?

314
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:48,640
Because I mean, there's a lot of a lot of just evidence of Google and YouTube

315
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,760
wanting to be seen as in a certain political light.

316
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,440
Political might not even be the right word for it,

317
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,400
but just like social light like they want.

318
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
Yeah, like friendly stuff.

319
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,160
The quote unquote right side of history or whatever.

320
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,600
Like that's just like the zeitgeist, the cultural zeitgeist right now.

321
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,560
And because they're like a company that's like affects everybody,

322
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,800
they kind of have to like try and ride that wave just to be like, I guess safe.

323
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,560
I'm not really sure.

324
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,840
But like, but like, you know, it just seems that I mean,

325
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm obviously biased in my assessment of this because I'm not like into the whole

326
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,520
politically correct thing.

327
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
So like when you capitulate to those ideas,

328
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,640
it just inherently pisses me off because I think they're bad ideas.

329
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,400
So I can't sit here and like be the objective arbiter of what YouTube is doing

330
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,840
and what Google is doing.

331
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,160
So my opinion obviously isn't the greatest in this sense,

332
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,280
but it just seems to me that like this site was built on the backs of people

333
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,240
doing weird fucking shit you wouldn't see on TV.

334
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,320
And in response, because TV is getting fucked and all these legacy

335
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
medias are getting fucked, they're trying to turn YouTube into a platform that

336
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,240
supports that kind of content at the expense of everyone who made the site

337
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
what it is today.

338
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,120
Without fucking crazy weird people, you wouldn't have this platform

339
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,360
to even get ruined like this in the first place.

340
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,520
And it's like you like YouTube should be in my opinion.

341
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,040
And I think most people would agree to me not TV.

342
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,880
It should be something else.

343
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,080
If you want to get a TV experience, you should go get a cable subscription.

344
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,440
If you want to see people in profitable and YouTube isn't.

345
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,680
Well, is it not profitable?

346
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,280
YouTube isn't profitable in terms of like hosting all the video, right?

347
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,000
So Google's responsible.

348
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The question is why does Google continue to subsidize YouTube at all

349
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,120
if it's so unprofitable?

350
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,360
Well, I mean, I think there are many reasons why.

351
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,160
Yeah, I mean the data they're getting from it must be insane.

352
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
But like here's another thing.

353
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,040
Instead of like trying to like court advertisers and change what the product is,

354
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,280
like we have a small site like BitShoot, which is built on peer to peer

355
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,800
instead of having servers.

356
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,360
And they're drastically undercutting the cost of hosting video

357
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,920
because they're not hosting any videos really.

358
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,000
They're hosting the the torrent files.

359
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,080
So like it's not if like a bunch of people who are pissed off with YouTube

360
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,440
can make a quote unquote more efficient system.

361
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,200
I don't see why a massive multi-billion dollar company like Alphabet couldn't be like,

362
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,680
hey, maybe we should try and change the way that YouTube's underpinnings work

363
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,360
to make it more profitable for us short term.

364
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,080
Well, there's always going to be cultural inertia at the company

365
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,320
and a desire to change as little as possible.

366
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,160
Like like in order to do that, they might need to like go even further down the fuck

367
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,760
the common people and, you know, suck up to the big companies that can pay them to have.

368
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,520
I mean, but here's the thing, it's like you can suck up to the big companies all you want.

369
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,120
But are any of us going to say that Google is smaller than like the New York Times?

370
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,000
Like Google is the biggest company?

371
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,120
Well, what I mean by that is like investors, like an individual human being who makes a

372
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,240
YouTube channel and can make it big is more than it just being really nice as an idea.

373
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,760
It is kind of a marketing thing.

374
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
They want to keep that alive.

375
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,680
And I think if they need to make money short term, they're going to have to like

376
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:21,120
cut a lot of the people who are trying and like hogging up a lot of the, you know,

377
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,600
the data on the servers by not being that good.

378
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,240
They're going to need to like cut because it really is not profitable to have all these people

379
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
a free platform.

380
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,360
And like to keep, they have to keep that going because that's the gimmick.

381
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,400
But, you know, how do they do this is like it could be considered defeatist.

382
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,320
At the same time, I call it pragmatic.

383
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,520
It's just like, I'm not going to get mad at a business for being a business and trying

384
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,640
to attain more capital.

385
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,360
It's like, yeah, that's what it's always been like, whether it's social or monetary.

386
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,640
It's like, yeah, this is what I expected from the get go.

387
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
And like people getting mad at it.

388
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,800
It's like, well, you're just fighting like a, a, a Sisyphean struggle and not even that.

389
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,880
It's just like, you're not going to get to, you're not going to appeal to the morality,

390
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:09,840
you know?

391
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,560
Sure, of course.

392
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,680
Like, like I can be righteously indignated all I want, but I'm not going to expect YouTube

393
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,880
to make better decisions.

394
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,120
They clearly have their agenda.

395
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,800
You've got guys like Carlos Mazza making an explicitly moral case for changes to the contrary.

396
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,440
And it's not like he had a ton of influence, but at least the one thing that was done in

397
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,320
response to that was, you know, like Steven Crowder being demonetized, which I mean, I

398
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,880
didn't, I don't know the exact details, but I think that they said first, he hadn't violated

399
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,320
any rules, but they changed it.

400
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,960
Violate rules?

401
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,040
No, no.

402
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,320
It's so weird.

403
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
They said that they didn't violate any rules.

404
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,760
It just goes to show, like, how, it's like, how, how, you know, the way that they do it

405
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,360
is so case by case, they don't even follow their own guidelines.

406
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,880
Like if they had, well, that's why I want to follow, they just be like, okay, yeah,

407
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,240
he either did do it or didn't do it, but then they like flipped on the decision.

408
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,200
Right.

409
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,920
Like what do they do?

410
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
Because of the public outcry.

411
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,720
They're just trying to protect the room to be able to take whatever position is the

412
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,560
most convenient at the time.

413
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,920
That's why they don't want to convict, could like commit to either being a publisher

414
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,160
or a like a free, you know, open platform for everybody because they want to be able

415
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,760
to take whichever position works for them.

416
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,680
Well, all of social media has that problem.

417
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,120
It's not just a, and I get it.

418
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,560
I want to do the same thing too.

419
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,200
If I was them, it's the most interesting thing with Carlos Mazza.

420
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,040
How I had nothing to do with that in the first place.

421
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,640
And they were just using that as a leverage to fuck over Fox to get more money because

422
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
there was a huge strike going on at Fox.

423
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,480
And anyway, that, that, that's true.

424
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,440
And they're trying to hurt YouTube as a platform because that's how Fox makes their

425
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,120
money, but they don't care how fuck YouTube is because Fox pays them.

426
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
It is a coincidence.

427
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm, I'm a pretty anti-conspiratorial guy though, which is sometimes I probably miss

428
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,160
things because I'm so like not.

429
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,240
I really don't want to be that guy, but like there may legitimately be some connection

430
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
between the fact this attack came at that time and Fox was trying to negotiate.

431
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,640
Or like Carlos Mazza was talking about how fuck Fox is and how they need to change their

432
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,320
shit and then does this.

433
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,800
It's just like, I mean, I'm not in his head.

434
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,600
I can't, I can't say for sure that that was what happened, but it just, you know, looking

435
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,600
at the evidence, it's like there is a case to be made there and who the fuck knows.

436
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,240
All I know is that YouTube is going to do what it does.

437
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,840
I don't expect it to ever get better.

438
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,920
I only expect it to get worse because that's been the trend for the last 10 years.

439
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,360
I don't see it changing.

440
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,560
And so I'm just waiting.

441
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,000
You can't even remember a time when we weren't talking about how YouTube is fucking up and

442
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,720
making terrible decisions and ruining everything.

443
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,760
I mean, back in like 2007, like it was pretty dope.

444
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,120
Well, no, I think people always complained, but the complaints they had were like, oh,

445
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
why did they change the layout?

446
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,520
Right.

447
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,880
It was really very smooth.

448
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,320
People like to complain.

449
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,640
It's just like, we didn't know how good we had it.

450
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,120
Yeah.

451
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
All we had to worry about was shit.

452
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't know where my buttons went.

453
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,360
You know, it hasn't been until the last like five plus years that any of us were even on

454
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,320
this side of the fence.

455
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,440
Yeah.

456
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:03,680
Yeah.

457
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,240
That's true.

458
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,880
That's true.

459
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,440
So I didn't give a shit about monetization back when I wasn't even thinking about it.

460
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,720
You know, right.

461
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,680
And I'm sure this would be a more common case if because like what site is there like YouTube

462
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,080
where it's this big and there are this many people making money from it.

463
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,560
You know, Uber, Uber, Uber, I'm talking about like a YouTube, YouTube is video Uber.

464
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,920
Maybe like Instagram only Instagram doesn't pay its people.

465
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,960
Instead of taking you from point A to point B, you're taking them on like an like an emotional

466
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,000
like video journey.

467
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,320
Like I'll let me teach you about like precisely something like hey guys, we we we the company

468
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:53,120
will pay you some like piddling amount of like what your what your what your videos are worth.

469
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,080
But like, you know, you can just but the sky's the limit.

470
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,680
Like it's you know, it's like a fuck it.

471
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,080
I don't know.

472
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,680
I can't I can't wait.

473
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,920
We'll give you the tools to make content for us.

474
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,720
It's like they do that with like the music catalog that they make available.

475
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,160
And you know, of course, all the tools to just uploading and premiering and

476
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,920
super chats and that kind of stuff.

477
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,280
Yeah, which of course they benefit from.

478
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,320
I can't wait to get into my Uber.

479
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,880
I can't wait to get into my Uber and the guy to look at me and be like,

480
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,360
hey, Tom, sorry, I haven't driven you anywhere in a while.

481
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,080
Oh, yes.

482
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,040
Oh, now I want that.

483
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,520
Now I want now I want an Uber driver to be like vlogging while Uber driving.

484
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,120
Now that's doubling up on content.

485
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,840
That's just smart.

486
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,200
That's just the way to do it, man.

487
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,400
Hey guys, I got some freaks in the back right now.

488
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,920
I'm just trying to make a YouTube channel about being an Uber driver.

489
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,000
And you just it's like Uber is like playing Russian roulette.

490
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,240
But instead of dying, if you get the bull, you actually just have an extremely euphoric

491
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,920
experience of talking to some bizarre absolute freak.

492
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,920
For instance, most of the time, let's get like a nothing burger, just absolute like,

493
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,880
oh, guy with glasses or guy with hair.

494
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,800
But then if you're out on the prowl late at night like I am, you know,

495
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,880
scrounging for trash on Newberry Street and you call your guy at like 2am, then he'll come

496
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:22,240
and he'll be fully dressed and drag literally in dominatrix gear, dominatrix gear, not a joke

497
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,120
and offer you candy, which you will of course accept with a whole open hand.

498
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,640
You will just get poured candy candy from this man.

499
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,840
And it will be a great time and you'll talk to him about his ex wives.

500
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,720
Literally just the best experience I've ever had.

501
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,440
Uber drivers are the weird Uber drivers specifically are a treat to the world.

502
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,360
Truly.

503
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,040
I haven't had many experiences like that.

504
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,440
People just talk about crazy taxidrivers and stuff.

505
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
But I don't know.

506
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,920
Mostly they're just like quiet, older guys who clearly do not want to be doing this.

507
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,920
But I don't know if they've fallen on hard times, their their corporate job got,

508
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,760
you know, shipped off to China.

509
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,440
And so now they had one Uber driver who was really into his car and he was just like,

510
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,480
hey, check this out and just kind of a little bit.

511
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Imagine if he does that with every single passenger.

512
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,560
Dude, check out how I can rev with fucking engine, bro.

513
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,280
Look at my car, how fast it can go.

514
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,080
Just a little bit.

515
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,280
Just a little bit, just enough to make me uncomfortable.

516
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,960
My favorite thing about Uber drivers though, they are the exact archetype of character

517
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,080
that I enjoy, which is to say people who are really like enthused about bizarre things that

518
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,360
don't matter at all.

519
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,800
For instance, there was one Uber driver I was in the car with who just was,

520
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,960
just completely hung up about Hangover Part 2.

521
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,280
And he just loved the Hangover Part 2 specifically.

522
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,120
And the entire time he was just talking to me about how, you know,

523
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,640
oh, it's kind of dangerous on the street, you know, like in Hangover Part 2,

524
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,800
they got into a lot of trouble back out of there.

525
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,920
And I just think we got to be real careful nowadays, you know.

526
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,440
You know about the combat zone back in Boston, there used to be a combat zone.

527
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,760
People would be, they'd shave your back for a nickel and put the Hangover Part 2.

528
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,720
They wouldn't do that if you gave them a $5 bill.

529
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,920
I'm like, oh, God, let me out.

530
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,840
I think you remember too much of that.

531
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,560
I think you're destined to become an Uber driver.

532
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,600
You know what?

533
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,240
Maybe so.

534
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,720
And if I am, I accept that Disney with open arms.

535
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,760
Because I love it.

536
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,880
Could you imagine having Munchie as an Uber driver?

537
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,160
Oh, God.

538
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,320
Munchie is famously post job, along with his whole generation.

539
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,400
Being an Uber driver is definitely post job.

540
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,760
Oh, 100%.

541
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,240
Buckle your seat belts!

542
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,800
We're going on a bumpy ride!

543
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
Goes two miles an hour because I'm scared of driving.

544
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:51,200
Just be a Boston Uber driver and not respond to any locations in the real world,

545
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,560
but simply use, you know, slime city locations.

546
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,080
Are they going to say not respond to people when they talk to me?

547
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Just like open the door and just like if they try to speak to me.

548
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,760
Just like say, oh no, I can't do that.

549
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,360
You know what that reminds me of though?

550
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,160
When I was in Japan, there were these restaurants that you, before you enter,

551
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,880
it's like a vending machine on the outside where you select the food you want.

552
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,920
And you put it in and you put your money in, like a vending machine.

553
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,240
It gives you a ticket and it also prints it on the inside.

554
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,480
You just go sit down and the guy behind the counter, like he got the ticket on his side

555
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,960
and he just like, you know, brings it where you need to be.

556
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,080
There should be, actually now that I think about this is exactly how Uber works

557
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,960
because they are given the location that you're going to ahead of time.

558
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,600
And so they know beforehand before they even pick you up

559
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,280
if they want to drive you there or not.

560
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
So the future is now, I guess.

561
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,480
We did it in Japan.

562
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,960
Truly.

563
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,600
I missed those restaurants though.

564
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,400
They were the best.

565
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
I didn't have to talk to anyone.

566
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,520
Oh, that's the way.

567
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,440
Do you think this is the way to de-populate Japan?

568
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,360
I don't want to be presumptuous in assuming that you all have,

569
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,880
you've all had the experience of having a bad computer or laptop.

570
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,840
Is that true?

571
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,240
Of course.

572
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,920
I mean, I think it exists without having that experience.

573
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,200
So that means you can truly appreciate that I recently, yesterday,

574
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:22,960
got a beautiful 28 gig RAM, 512 SSD, 512 gig SSD laptop yesterday.

575
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,800
Oh, it's beautiful.

576
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,440
It runs.

577
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,120
I bet Minecraft runs like a dream.

578
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,640
It runs like a dream.

579
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,360
You have no idea.

580
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,160
I love it so much.

581
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,240
And that's exactly the reason.

582
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,120
I got that feeling the other day.

583
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,440
Or like a couple of months ago, I got my new desktop.

584
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,880
Oh, this will feel like, dude, when you can open up Firefox

585
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,320
doesn't take literally like two and a half minutes to load.

586
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
Dude, it's fucking beautiful.

587
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,320
It's like the contrast between like the old laptop that you had the day before and like this one.

588
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,280
Oh, oh, yeah.

589
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,520
Beautiful.

590
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, yeah.

591
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And it's like, that's exactly why I offered to edit this episode because of that.

592
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,880
Oh, just for the sheer joy of doing the end of the process.

593
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,920
Oh, seeing the render off.

594
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,400
That render bar fill up like way faster.

595
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:08,400
And just like, oh, my pet peeve with my old laptop was the fact that when I was rendering,

596
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,800
I couldn't do anything else with the laptop because I took up all of the RAM.

597
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,000
So literally, I uploaded a video that was like four minutes yesterday,

598
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,680
and it took an hour and a half to render.

599
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:21,840
All right.

600
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,560
That's insane.

601
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:22,640
Absolutely.

602
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,360
That's insane.

603
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,920
I rendered a video today about the same time.

604
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,120
Took a minute.

605
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,520
Beautiful.

606
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,320
Took one minute.

607
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,120
Oh, my God.

608
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,080
Oh, my God.

609
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,800
Oh, yeah.

610
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,440
Yeah, that's insane.

611
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,520
You know, I don't know if this is just me, but I feel like, I mean,

612
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,440
this definitely happened with my old computer.

613
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,560
I've got a relatively new one.

614
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,360
It's pretty great.

615
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,400
Tom helped me build it and stuff, or help me pick out the parts.

616
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,440
And I moved stuff Tom as well when I made my computer, so.

617
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:47,680
Indeed.

618
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,400
God bless, Tom.

619
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,440
I feel like it's taking longer and longer for renders to happen.

620
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,720
And I'm just wondering, like, what processes can I do to clean this up so it stays pristine?

621
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,520
Oh, yeah.

622
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,920
I've been wondering about that as well because I've noticed my computer is like taking like

623
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,360
five minutes to boot up now.

624
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,120
It's a long time.

625
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:11,040
I think I need to like defragment or something or like clean up some stuff.

626
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,760
Because it was, I hadn't really added that much more things.

627
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,120
I don't think.

628
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,040
Yeah, yeah.

629
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,080
I mean, I just, I assume it's just like adding junk to, I mean, I don't know,

630
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,880
when you install stuff, sometimes there's just like, not installers, but like run,

631
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,160
like it was start up processes, just start up, and then they just eat up.

632
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,800
Yeah, I got, I went to settings to like turn off the things that happen on startup,

633
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
but it wasn't even that many things.

634
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,320
And it's still taking a little longer than I would like.

635
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,600
I just assumed that it's like, it's like a big bag.

636
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,920
My computer is like a big cloth bag.

637
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,720
And I just throw software in there and they all got piled up.

638
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,520
And then it's like on Christmas day, when you're at Timmy's house and you got to give

639
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,200
him his present and you're reaching around.

640
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,840
Oh, there's so much.

641
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,640
I can't find it.

642
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,080
Why is the fucking, why are you at Timmy's house on Christmas?

643
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,280
Because I am Santa Claus.

644
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
Your parents kick you out.

645
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,040
Okay.

646
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,440
There you go.

647
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,880
I am Santa.

648
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,040
And it's very unfortunate.

649
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,800
This is how I imagine computers work.

650
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,480
I actually do know how they work.

651
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
I did, in fact, go to school for this, but none of that.

652
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
No, computers are like magic, dudes.

653
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,960
You know, you put a weasel in a box and he makes it go, wha!

654
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:14,960
Exactly.

655
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,760
True or anything, exactly.

656
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,040
I built an OS once in college.

657
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,960
I mean, it was very simple OS, but it worked.

658
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,000
Oh, temple OS?

659
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,120
Oh, best OS ever.

660
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,720
I know about allocating RAM and shit.

661
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,440
Is it, was it, was it you call it best OS ever?

662
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,440
I, oh, actually what it was was, it was a, no, I did not, but it's an OS that the,

663
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
like they give you like, here are the specs.

664
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,640
Make this in Python.

665
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,840
At least I think we use Python.

666
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,360
And just like have it run with exactly these parameters.

667
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,400
So it's not like we let like come up with like an original OS.

668
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
They gave us one to make and it was like,

669
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,920
everybody's is going to work pretty much the same.

670
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,840
Oh, so you were a sheep.

671
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,200
You didn't, you didn't make it yourself.

672
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,160
You know, you were just following orders.

673
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
Well, that wasn't the assignment.

674
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,880
Now was it, Munchy?

675
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,760
I'm not Jim.

676
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm not here to learn.

677
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm here to do.

678
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,640
I am Nate does his homework best man.

679
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,200
That's me.

680
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,120
Can we all just talk about how great Jim Microsoft is?

681
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,000
I love that guy.

682
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,080
He's really done good work.

683
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,680
I like Jim Microsoft, but I hate when I go to the Jim Microsoft

684
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,040
and he starts beating the shit out of me just because I entered his domain.

685
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,680
Wait, I go to the Microsoft gym and I push computers to gain muscle mass.

686
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,280
That's the right thing.

687
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,800
I like Microsoft penis.

688
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,840
I, my penis, yes.

689
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,600
We can all agree on that one.

690
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,880
When you're running on fumes and your bryos start to shut down,

691
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,600
I have experienced that multiple times throughout this past week.

692
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,560
Throughout this call.

693
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,040
It's wax and wane.

694
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,840
I like, you know, I would start curing, becoming disheveled.

695
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,440
Then I would like wake up a little bit, you know,

696
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,480
someone would say something.

697
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,040
Then I would just recede back into the annals of just

698
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,600
docking foreskin and other man's penis.

699
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,640
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.

700
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,560
But for the past like week, I have been creating and have released

701
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,160
and it's already all done in a series of updates for endless war

702
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,360
that have involved an ARG.

703
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,320
And there's this out of cash.

704
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,040
This is oh, see guys, sorry.

705
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,840
So don't worry about that.

706
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,000
There's no way this is going to top the Japanese juggalo.

707
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,360
I'm just putting that out there right now.

708
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,880
We've nothing, nothing can.

709
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,200
Nothing can in society, like not just like the Japanese juggalo ARG,

710
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,360
but just like, you know, in general, the Japanese juggalo.

711
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,800
We've hit peak culture.

712
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,080
I remember, I remember when I first met Econ,

713
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,360
we first met Econ at Anime Expo like 2017, I think.

714
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,800
I don't like, like, like the first thing that we said to him

715
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,640
is just that he was asking, you know, like what we did.

716
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,240
And you said that you had a YouTube channel.

717
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,160
I was like, oh, yeah, I did anime videos too.

718
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,080
Then I put on the Japanese juggalo form.

719
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,720
He didn't know what he was in for.

720
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,560
Anyway, so I did a, I hosted a successful, I'll say, ARG.

721
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,080
In, in this war.

722
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,560
And it was a great experience.

723
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,040
And like, legitimately, like it's a really like

724
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,080
enchanted magical feeling.

725
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,800
When you have constructed this puzzle for people

726
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,960
and you hit the sweet spot of not too hard, not too easy.

727
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,160
And you can hear them do like their, their brains rattling off.

728
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,640
Like, you know, like their CPUs overheating,

729
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,080
trying to figure out the puzzles that you said,

730
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,520
but they are exhilarated by it.

731
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,440
They're not just absolutely defeated by it.

732
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,240
And you can see them like work through and like just discover

733
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,200
and like soak up all the lore that even viewed into each image.

734
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,080
And that was incredible.

735
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,840
The payoff of it was great.

736
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,560
And I'm extremely, I'm just happy with how it turned out.

737
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,160
However, the preceding hours of my life,

738
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,560
I can only describe as just literally the Majora's Mask commercial from 2000,

739
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,320
where it is a faux radio announcer saying the world's ending

740
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,160
and that he is pressuring this kid who's playing Majora's Mask

741
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
to win or else the entire world will die.

742
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,920
And then there's spliced an interview of various people in real life

743
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,600
saying that they missed their parents.

744
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,320
That was literally what my life was.

745
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,760
I don't know how to say this kid, but there's not a lot of time left.

746
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,040
Play hard, will ya?

747
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,760
So literally for the, like previous to me releasing that,

748
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,920
I had been awake for several days and unironically,

749
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,800
just going fucking ham.

750
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,320
The amount of things that I had written in that time

751
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:28,320
were akin to maybe 500 clay slash stone tablets,

752
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,120
depending on the mining quality that I could possibly achieve at the same time.

753
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,120
And etching those runes into that stone was a difficult process.

754
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,960
And I'm going to spare you the details

755
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,840
because I'm not here to suck my own dick or take up the show for any longer.

756
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,080
But I just want to say that to set up for my real anecdote here,

757
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,240
just know that I, this is our, I believe, 27.

758
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,080
I'm almost done.

759
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,560
I've written mountains and mountains of work.

760
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,200
I'm almost, the end is in sight, mere hours.

761
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,560
Literally two hours before it's set to go live.

762
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,360
And I have a hard day.

763
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,440
I released a video on the PCP you might have seen

764
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,800
in coming Slamtorp Transmission.

765
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,440
There's a hard date set on there for an in-game event

766
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,480
that would be happening to set out.

767
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,240
So yeah, I had a hard date that I,

768
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,680
or rather a hard time in that date that I had to achieve.

769
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,240
Or else things would go fucking south.

770
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,880
So, two hours until that time.

771
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,360
Almost done.

772
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,880
Make it, you know, make it, make it a good time.

773
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,440
I mean, I'm feeling good.

774
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,160
Make it count.

775
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,880
You know, you know, I-

776
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,640
So that's by the time people hear this.

777
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,000
It will have been several days.

778
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,880
Oh, oh yes.

779
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,520
No, yeah.

780
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,400
Yeah, of course.

781
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,680
The time thing always fucked me.

782
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,240
Okay, I'm with you.

783
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,640
I'm with you.

784
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:34,880
Say it.

785
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,040
Um, and so, you know, I'm doing good,

786
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,480
but I can't take any more breaks, you know.

787
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,000
I've had my mandatory one hour every 12 hours where I go to eat.

788
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,840
I've already had that.

789
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,480
I can't do anymore.

790
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,000
But I'm on track, and then I get a phone call.

791
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,280
I answer.

792
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,400
It's my mom.

793
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,000
She says the following words to me.

794
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,200
Hello.

795
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,280
The cable band's here.

796
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
He needs to see the modem

797
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,960
so that he can install a camera on the front door.

798
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,200
Okay.

799
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,520
And then she hangs up.

800
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,400
And then she hangs up.

801
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,120
And then, like, I just slow pan out to my room,

802
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,080
which is a disheveled tornado mess.

803
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,440
Literally corpses in here, as far as I can tell.

804
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,240
There's just blood and shit smeared on every single surface.

805
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,000
And the amount of quake energy cans that are just crumpled up near me

806
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,720
could, like, just recycling.

807
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,360
Done.

808
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,280
The moment that I turn these cans in.

809
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,760
We don't need to do it anymore because I've done it enough.

810
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,440
Metal is saved.

811
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,800
Renewable resource found.

812
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,080
And so I haven't showered.

813
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,640
I'm just a complete mess full of wax and brimstone.

814
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,840
And I have to just open the door for this cable man who, of course,

815
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,040
I did not know this person was coming.

816
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,600
Of course, there was no, you know, hey, hey, Anthony, there's a dude coming, by the way,

817
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,360
most important day of your life.

818
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,800
The most important day of your entire social experience online.

819
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,400
All this guy coming to ruin it.

820
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,400
So I had to open my door.

821
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,120
I just had this man violate my personal space.

822
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,160
Violate my room.

823
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,520
Just fuck around with my modem.

824
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,280
You know, just drill a hole into it.

825
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,080
Stick his dick and come in and say, oh, this is fine, right?

826
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,760
No, it's not fine.

827
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,400
It's not.

828
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,880
And I get to work up into a tizia.

829
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,680
Just walk downstairs.

830
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,520
I allow him to do his work in my room.

831
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,800
I come downstairs and I say, hey, I say, hey, what's going on?

832
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,720
What's this about a camera on the front door?

833
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
And they're like, oh, actually, we misheard him.

834
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,000
We don't even want him to do this.

835
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,960
Like, we just got a bundle.

836
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,840
So we had to let him do it.

837
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,440
But we don't even want the features in time.

838
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,200
But he's installing smart lights.

839
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,320
So we'll get an app on our phone where you can dim the light smart phone.

840
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,360
Well, with that being neat.

841
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,800
An hour goes by.

842
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,160
An hour of time lost.

843
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,160
I do not have this time to spare.

844
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,880
I do not.

845
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,560
I just walk out to my farm and I want to plow the field.

846
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,200
I do not want to plow the seeds of the ocean.

847
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,360
I don't know if I get against the waves of the world.

848
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,240
And yet I am fucked.

849
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,880
I do so.

850
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,880
And I go and I and I and I must have the words flow from my finger at this point.

851
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,000
I have exiled cable man and it's coming down to the fucking wire.

852
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,600
I release the video like mere like minutes before it's set to go off.

853
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,320
Basically, no one knows what's happening.

854
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,040
But the fact remains that I did it technically correct.

855
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,320
I'm seething and I'm panting.

856
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,560
And I and I log in to my alternate account that the character,

857
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,760
you know, blah, blah, blah character, ARG stuff.

858
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,160
And I do it like within 10 minutes from the event happening.

859
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,160
But I do it.

860
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,920
But I do it and it's glorious.

861
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,200
And I just wanted to share that little story with you because I hate cable man

862
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,400
and I hate modems and I hate smart lights.

863
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,160
And I hate all of you.

864
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,080
If you're listening to this, play hard kid, win this one, will you?

865
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,800
I appreciate that.

866
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,000
I appreciate that.

867
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,760
I will say in my dad demeanor that one really should never find themselves ever

868
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,640
if it can be avoided in a position where an hour of distraction will make or break

869
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,920
some great enterprise.

870
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,320
It should be ready significantly ahead of time

871
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,800
so that you don't have to be in a crunch time like that.

872
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,000
But I'm not one to talk having literally failed me a math of a two.

873
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,880
Now am I?

874
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,920
So, you know, I will say a point, Nate.

875
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,680
There's something oddly like I find like perversely erotic about crunch time.

876
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,560
And I know it's bad.

877
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,760
And I know that everyone's gonna cancel me on Twitter.

878
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,040
I know everyone's gonna-

879
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,120
I know what those game devs are complaining about.

880
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:52,240
I'd be jacking my at full mass the entire time while boss man whips me into submission

881
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,240
as I crank out that last, you know, animation on the bull testicles

882
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,520
in Red Dev Redemption 2.

883
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,160
I know like five minutes after release this episode,

884
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,400
Super Bonnie Hopkins in a release of Angry Video that has me as the subject.

885
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,320
But like I'm just saying that like crunch time,

886
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,080
looking it ruins my body.

887
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,720
It like it literally like makes me like ill and like I felt sick for like a day or two

888
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,200
afterward.

889
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,920
And it wasn't cool.

890
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,320
I was a very unhealthy man during me a math of a two.

891
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,720
Just just in general as a lifestyle thing for sure.

892
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,440
But like there's something about like dude, I'm getting shit done.

893
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Like I'm achieving goals right now.

894
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,200
Literally like I see a goal and I'm running towards it.

895
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,760
Like it feels good in that way.

896
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,520
Obviously there's a lot of downsides, but it feels good just-

897
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:45,600
It's the classic Shonen trope in which the MC obtains a retarded power that gives him

898
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,440
extra strength, but at the extremely nebulous cost of like quote,

899
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,360
some of his lifespan or quote, it's shortening his life.

900
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,040
It's just the most, you never have to worry about that while the series is going on.

901
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,440
It's a total like Deus Ex Machina piece of shit answer to give a false cost to whatever

902
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,000
the characters are doing, but it's pretty sick.

903
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,320
I kind of literally agree that like okay, I've recently come to the conclusion that like

904
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,960
basically no bodily harm is that bad.

905
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,280
Like you know you can treat your body poorly and like you know it's not good,

906
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,480
but like you know like it's it'll be fine.

907
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,640
Like I've taken it just not eating.

908
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,160
We may reevaluate that.

909
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,640
I've taken it just not eating because like you know like whatever, like you don't eat it.

910
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,280
Whatever dude.

911
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,560
What's the worst that could happen?

912
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,160
Yeah, you know literally.

913
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:32,640
Die.

914
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,720
That is the worst.

915
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:42,000
Munchy, I have like not necessarily for like the like I know exactly that feeling,

916
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,880
but like not exactly for because um because the the the prospect of like producing stuff

917
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,120
still like or doing good work because sometimes I just feel like shit

918
00:50:53,120 --> 00:51:00,000
like everything is going wrong and I am so ragged like run ragged like I smell like shit.

919
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,160
I feel like shit like I've got both legs broken like blood everywhere piss everywhere

920
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,680
like nobody knows how bad I've got it um and I'm just like I'm standing there like with all my

921
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,440
skin like falling off like I'm I'm dead like I'm a zombie from from Dark Souls and I have like

922
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,160
one arm that can work and I'm looking at like a sheer cliff face and there's like

923
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,840
there's you know I could just sit down but there's there's something there's something really cool

924
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:33,920
about like just continuing like even though every bone in my body aches and like I'm just

925
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,800
not feeling it and I feel like shit and it's terrible and everything sucks I'm I'm just climbing

926
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,040
that mountain I'm climbing and I like nobody will know that the like there's something like

927
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,240
um uh there's there's a way to describe it but it's like

928
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,680
like the the the feeling that even though I'm not going to boast about having done this I know I've

929
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:04,400
done it right and and like I I I like the fact that nobody will uh like care that I done it

930
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,560
you you like the fact that I don't care I don't know why it's like it's some some sort of weird

931
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,440
dad thing like dad's like just doesn't matter dad's like complaining about like things not being fair

932
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,200
and things being fucked up and like everything sucks um but they don't really do anything to

933
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,640
make it better they just like to complain well I think just inherently like like everyone in the

934
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,760
entire world can agree that doing something that's dumb but doing something that's hard sexy as hell

935
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:41,360
that's so cool well true America loves winners the whole world does really uh yeah yeah I don't

936
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,040
know like I don't know whether other people understand this like the lack of recognition

937
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,880
because I'm I don't I don't usually bag a bragging boast um no no no I I totally understand where

938
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,280
you're coming from and this is sort of tangential but it applies so uh I was I was leasing a place

939
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:06,560
for a couple years and uh it came to the point where uh my roommates were uh starting to get a

940
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:13,120
little messy little messy you know and uh you know I I decided to become the house mom I did all

941
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:19,440
the dishes I uh I cleaned the tables I uh sweep the kitchen you know what it is and you know what

942
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,800
I never asked for gratitude I was like yeah this is what the house mom does and I just felt good

943
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:32,560
knowing that they see they see the kitchen next time and uh something that they left on the table

944
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,320
is no more there because I cleaned it up and they could have done it but I did it

945
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:44,240
because I'm the house mom you got you got taken advantage of my friends that's unpaid labor right

946
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,800
there my it is it is you got a demand compensation you know my compensation is feeling good about

947
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:56,960
job well done what a worthless currency if ever there was one the way I would explain the feeling

948
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,000
is like if I'm like really tired after doing a lot of work and stuff and then somebody says

949
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:08,480
hey we're going out to this thing and I'm like not in the mood at all but there's this there's this

950
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:14,640
you know it's good to be social like it's a good idea even if I'm not really feeling it I may as

951
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:21,920
well so I go to this thing um and nothing good comes of it and I come home no and it's like

952
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,240
at least I tried I guess that's the somewhat of the feeling sure yeah absolutely like doing

953
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:34,320
doing stuff even though you're not in the best of places it just feels good rather than than

954
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:39,760
than appeasing your base instinct to sit and do nothing and watch anime and play video games or

955
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,760
whatever it is yes yes which by the way this reminds me of I so I mentioned it before about my

956
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,760
quote-unquote failing me a math of a two I mean you know I can I can see why people consider that

957
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,400
because I did not succeed at getting one video out every day but uh there's one interesting

958
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,040
thing about it um so I heard a bunch of people shitting on like the last episode of me a math

959
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:05,840
of a two for one you know uh being a piece of shit begging for money uh you know bragging about my

960
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,520
vast internet success by showing my play button uh doing a terrible tier list section and then

961
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:17,440
playing a terrible cover of a uh boring hacky song wait Nate hold on it's all champion super

962
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,400
okay can we please smash cut to me earlier today scrolling through the comments of that video

963
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,160
specifically saying like Nate your singing voice is amazing ha ha wow even though I can't give money

964
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:36,080
you're an inspiration me Nate tee he well okay it's all about the human tendency to focus on the

965
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,840
negative absolutely absolutely true absolutely true but but I'm not even I'm not even saying that I

966
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,080
particularly think it was an overly negative reception but I'm just saying that there were

967
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:51,360
some voices that were critical there was a dude that had the same avatar focusing on it oh yeah I

968
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:58,000
appreciate that thanks a lot um but okay but my point was I what I what I felt was that like I had

969
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,320
made some very specific mistakes that led people to being uh critical of that and it was like by the

970
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:10,400
thing about me a math of a is just that it was set up to be one day one video so that even people who

971
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,360
hate me a math of a which I'm sure there are some or you know people who find my more I don't know my

972
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,200
less heavily edited content which I've been doing the last couple years is like less interesting than

973
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,680
like a best anime ever like they want smash videos they want that stuff where is it Nate so I totally

974
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,400
get why those people would like not be interested want to tune out any of that stuff and but the

975
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,400
thing is the the conceit on the ground is that you're getting 30 days of a 31 days of like a video a

976
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,080
day and after that you're free and after that you your debt is paid to society viewer subscriber

977
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:45,520
and you don't have to sit through any more of this the problem is by me getting off my schedule

978
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,320
one I'm pissing off those people who are like can we just be done with this um two by taking longer

979
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:58,080
to make videos it inherently raises expectations for what those videos are going to be so people

980
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,720
like with that last they were like wow like we waited three days this was the last episode of me

981
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,920
in MAFA not everybody said that but you know some people did and then finally the other problem and

982
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,720
this is the biggest one that ties into Gibbs Gibbs thing is that I personally like feel bad about all

983
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,080
this and I the thought comes into your mind of like can I like just not release anymore because I

984
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:24,960
don't think anybody like there's diminishing returns on me in MAFA too uh like this was evident

985
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,520
from the start um but like I owed it to like the promise of the of the of the program I guess

986
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,880
to get all the videos out but once you're past the deadline by like 20 days and you know people are

987
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,800
getting a little ornery and they want you to get back to your other stuff it's like what's the use

988
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,000
in continuing this and I mean I had to do it but it was like it was like a weird self-doubt

989
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,880
position I found myself in of like I know people just want me to move on to other stuff but I

990
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,080
promised I would do this and you know for all these reasons there are these negative consequences

991
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,480
that are going to come no matter what so so the answer simply is you know maybe I'll do a me in

992
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,640
MAFA again in the future but I I have there is no choice but to stick to the schedule for all

993
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:12,400
those reasons and uh I don't know and like because the original conceit is just to motivate me to

994
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,760
make content to to exactly feel what you were talking about kid to like feel like I'm doing

995
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,920
something as opposed to nothing like I because the original me in MAFA was maybe I can actually

996
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,720
make a fucking video or maybe I'll actually make a fucking video like me doing something as opposed

997
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,160
to nothing not these six month long projects um but now people know I can make a fucking video

998
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,200
so there's not a lot to prove um I don't know I don't know I was just reflecting on this and

999
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:44,960
I thought the whole the idea of like how it getting off schedule had a myriad of negative

1000
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,480
effects both for me and for the people watching um it was it was a good learning experience if

1001
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,240
nothing else um but I but I don't know I don't know it ties into all this stuff I realize I hadn't

1002
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,120
watched your final episode all the way through I go over to it and I'm I'm seven minutes in

1003
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,200
and I like the first seven minutes but then you start doing a tierless and I guess I just

1004
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:11,440
was like oh lol who cares and I start joke but it is like a 15 minute long segment so that's I

1005
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:18,720
get why some people are not a joke yeah well but okay it's a joke but it's also substantive

1006
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,480
because it is a reflection on the entire me in MAFA two experience so you know sure there's an

1007
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:32,000
I actually haven't watched it yet because uh my subscription feed is just it's so weird well it's

1008
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,680
it's completely normal but the way that I interact with it is weird like I just well as that tier

1009
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:43,120
list will tell you oh yeah sorry but as that tier list will tell you not every video is a gem so

1010
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,960
don't feel you know any burning need to fucking sit through it all uh but some are but some are

1011
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:55,040
the the fairy tale is dead featuring Zach Rittner oh no I've watched me a man for a

1012
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,320
I just haven't watched the last one you know this is a this is another weird thing do you ever

1013
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:05,120
okay this is just a general thing with all of us people we all make content we all make videos

1014
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,800
isn't it kind of a weird thing when like you're talking to your buddies or whatever who like

1015
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:15,040
know you make a content of some kind and it's gonna make you make it a content yeah like like I'm

1016
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:21,040
talking about this thing like I I never feel this I really don't well okay I suppose in a little bit

1017
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:26,720
I do but like I never feel like anyone needs to watch my content or owes me watching my content

1018
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,440
or anything like that but you can tell when the conversation goes that way there's like a you

1019
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,360
know there's like uh oh of course I've like seen some of your stuff I'm not even trying to show

1020
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,840
and use then I just mean like I've noticed this over the years many times right and it's uh I don't

1021
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:44,640
know like like right now I'm just like I have not watched Zen stuff in a while and I really like it so

1022
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:51,600
I I should but like you know I it's almost kind of like a guilt thing I'm so sorry sir I please

1023
01:00:51,600 --> 01:01:01,680
forgive me a real a real fan would have watched uh insert fucking video name here yeah you don't

1024
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,640
even know right exactly that's the thing shameful and it's like that's the thing about my content too

1025
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:12,240
because it's literally whatever I want and that's true yeah I'm sort of uncapitalating in that sense

1026
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,360
and you know that's probably not best in the business sense but uh it's a gratification on

1027
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:22,960
what I'm making I love it it's a it's a grand old time I literally just release like two covers of

1028
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,960
songs just cuz you know I have a second channel where I could have put it but the way I uh you

1029
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,800
know choose what content to put on what channel is literally just a gut feeling I just look at the

1030
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:38,080
video for three for three seconds and I'm like okay this channel or this channel and like there

1031
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:44,800
there's no real distinction between the quality between the channels just like okay yeah uh I

1032
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,680
just feel like it goes this way or this way it's like I love it you know it's like and I feel that

1033
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:55,040
people subscribe for that experience just like oh it's a random grab bag what am I gonna get next

1034
01:01:55,040 --> 01:02:00,000
I went to I did a live stream where I just went to the museum of fine arts I was like okay hey

1035
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,440
yeah that's all very good course stuff I think people who like who have stayed subs do you I mean

1036
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,880
I don't know how uh how big you are now but you you're getting a pretty sizable following now yeah

1037
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,640
and um it's uh I think those people definitely are on board for like the the eclectic zen experience

1038
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,120
at this point so yeah so you you I think you've seemed to have really broken through any kind of

1039
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:23,920
barrier like if there's people like a couple hundred subs and they upload like random stuff yeah I mean

1040
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,280
I could certainly understand them thinking like uh geez if they've been doing it for a long time

1041
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,520
what do I need to change but you I mean you seem well past that now so yeah I'm gonna make a I'm

1042
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:39,840
gonna make a video on the world fair the 1964 world fair why that one I would I like I like I mean

1043
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:46,240
that's I like that tell me tell me you tell me about that well I mean later yeah in the video

1044
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,480
I don't want to follow too much because it ruined the incentive to come to the video but yeah yeah

1045
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:56,480
okay yeah it doesn't to my knowledge it doesn't happen annually and um

1046
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:03,680
um that's the one that uh come uh I caught wind of I don't know why exactly that one's important

1047
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,640
but uh hey that's what research is for and that's what I'm going to do if we're calling like Disney

1048
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:16,240
dates correctly that is relevant to Epcot I don't oh yeah that's it that's correct yes yes

1049
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,760
did they like build Epcot for that or something well Epcot's well sort of kind of a little bit

1050
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,880
in a roundabout way yes Epcot currently is sort of like a permanent world sphere because Walt was

1051
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,160
always fascinated by them as a kid and and yeah okay so on and so forth I could go on all day about

1052
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,760
Disney it doesn't matter here's a here's a slight left turn but not quite it's that uh hey Vapors

1053
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:46,320
3 is out and I have read it oh my god sure why would you do that I I did it I did it and I mean

1054
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,000
I don't know how much uh you would want to talk about I mean I would certainly encourage everyone

1055
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,680
to go read it uh it's very in keeping with uh the Vapors style and uh a lot of great artwork

1056
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:01,360
interested in magda focus story this time which is a magda chapter uh here's the thing about um

1057
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:09,680
whenever I make anything I'm embarrassed about it instantly I put it out there I put it out there

1058
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:16,080
and all I can think is like why did I do this you know I totally know what you mean it's like

1059
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,680
it doesn't serve my own interest because I know that the thing to do is get out there and like start

1060
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:26,800
talking about it and promoting it and pushing it but my instinct is to recoil away from it

1061
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:32,880
as though in horror uh you know what I mean I totally get you and I think the problem is like

1062
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,680
with somebody like me I have the advantage of my content being like a video thing that YouTube

1063
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,160
just kind of helps me I don't have to go out and chill it really it just kind of you know

1064
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,000
out there which is very convenient yours is a little bit different because you gotta

1065
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,880
pound the pavement more and you gotta do something is magda just like rule 63 ben

1066
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,480
they both are not entirely both Vincent and magda are both rule 63 ben ben I was very

1067
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,480
think about it think about it I was I was really thinking about um uh Vapors in general after

1068
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:11,120
reading that I was doing some reflection and I of course uh Vapors has always had a fairly um I'm

1069
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:16,720
I'm not trying to say negative but like a fairly dark tone to it yeah I mean yeah everything about

1070
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:23,120
like a desperation of their lives and I don't know things of that nature yeah yeah you could uh

1071
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,880
you could say that I def I when I was reading this one I not only felt that that was the strongest

1072
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:36,160
in uh in chapter three here uh and I I know was played for laughs but I felt a deep profound

1073
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:42,160
like concern for magda's well-being yeah based on the events of this chapter and and you know what

1074
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,240
like they're they're absolutely would have been a way for like these same events to be written in

1075
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:51,440
the exact same way but to it to feel more light-hearted and like not serious but that really is not

1076
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,680
what it's just not that's not what happens it felt deeply concerning about her state of mind

1077
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,320
I've been all the things she went I've been thinking about this a bunch and I think yeah maybe

1078
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,320
one way to describe the Vapors is like the opposite of a superhero story and that it is

1079
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:14,880
stories about people of exceptionally low capacity just like people who are capable of the least

1080
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:24,800
possible a super zero story yeah of course I could never tell you what to what to do with

1081
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:30,960
the stories or anything but like the super relatable story yeah they are certainly relatable

1082
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:38,000
although the thing magda goes into like almost it she's superhero level of incompetent at life

1083
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,240
kind of and it is it is a sight to behold I think the fact that the entire chapter was like silent

1084
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:50,400
like there was no dialogue really helped with the atmosphere that's kind of I mean um one and two are

1085
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:56,400
largely like that as well the dialogue is really minimal there's there's no text maybe I mean I

1086
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:02,160
I guess that's true but I mean I'm reading it now Mike magda always felt like like the sort of person

1087
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:09,360
who like thinks in her head but it's like mostly nothing and then like there's nothing that she

1088
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:13,840
thinks to say all the time she's a real cloudy head if you know what I'm saying look at her look at

1089
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:19,520
her hair just like if somebody asked her a question she'd be like uh do I have to do I have an answer

1090
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:26,160
to this I don't know doesn't seem to have a lot of self-confidence that's true um though you know

1091
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,400
at the end of chapter two there's that moment and actually even at the end of chapter one

1092
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:38,080
my my Nate senses gets so amped up to fucking 11 I get rock hard my veins bulged from my neck

1093
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:43,440
when like for example at the end of chapter one Vincent goes to this event has a terrible time

1094
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:49,840
but but he signed the form so he will be notified of future events I'm like yes a redemption is

1095
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:57,120
he did it this character yes that's what I like to see motherfucker yeah I mean what's he gonna do

1096
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:02,480
and maybe sign it he's fucking defeated he has no he's not defeated there's hope and then and then

1097
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,640
chapter two he throws the book in the trash he has this horrible social experience because he's

1098
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,120
got no competency but at the end he's reading the book again yes he didn't give up he can

1099
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:18,320
got it he got it out he got it out of the trash he did that I'm like those moments of hope think

1100
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:23,440
about it that's that's what I really I mean I love seeing the being such terrible pieces of shit

1101
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:30,800
I love how he keeps on saying think about it think about it well that's just think about yeah well I

1102
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:36,800
mean that's it that's all I want just think about it okay fair I but but in chapter three I'm glad

1103
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:44,000
like I'm that is a super amped that you do think about that's all I want that's why I want people

1104
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,400
to read it and just think about it think about it yeah but the difference with the end of three

1105
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,720
it was good and I guess I won't go people should absolutely go read it but like it ends there's

1106
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:01,760
there's no exactly the same kind of moment of like possible hope there although it does feel

1107
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:05,920
like just kind of silly at the end which is good I'm glad the tone lightens a little at the end

1108
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,680
so it gives me a similar kind of slight upbeat note at the end and I don't know the fact that magda

1109
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:16,800
kind of overcame all the stuff in here that was kind of hopeful like wow this bitch can really walk

1110
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:25,360
she can really walk she she really she really did it um I respect that uh well you know I mean

1111
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:31,440
what choice did she have very well she you know when when faced with the possibility of like well

1112
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,800
do I walk home or do I die in the streets she overcame she overcame I'll tell you what I'm

1113
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:42,080
looking for Ben yeah I want to see in the future when it comes to the vapors I want to see more

1114
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,120
magda not even necessarily like like winning at life but I want to see her strengths I want to

1115
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,920
know what is going on in her head yeah because mostly it's been like she of course did drawing

1116
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:58,000
stuff in in chapter one which I appreciated but like I want to know more about her her thoughts on

1117
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,920
life aside from just her kind of general disposition um yeah that's well you know what I have what I

1118
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:10,400
have to do now is I have to write a bunch of short um a bunch of short uh vaporette stories for uh

1119
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:16,080
guest artists to draw for uh Kickstarter to for book two and I don't know what those are going to be

1120
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:23,280
at all um uh they've got they've got parents I could have them like talk to their parents or

1121
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,480
something I've been thinking about I don't know what they would say I don't know what the content

1122
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,280
of that would be but that's like an aspect that's an interesting idea I haven't been really listening

1123
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:37,200
but I have the mysteriousness of just these oh yeah I go on I just finished reading it uh I almost

1124
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:45,120
did this exact thing in real life yeah yeah wait tell Elizabeth what do you mean tell me more uh

1125
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,800
well it was yeah which thing it was like uh the the walking around aimlessly not knowing what to do

1126
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,080
and then just walking all the way back home I was hoping I meant lying inert on the grass

1127
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:02,080
not that stuff I mean I think I've done something like that before but like walk outside before and

1128
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:08,400
like done things before and then walk no no no like walking to the point of like I've gone places

1129
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:21,280
man I don't know what I'm doing I uh uh and then like yeah like yeah you know like uh same I get

1130
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,280
that I get that like like you could maybe ask someone for directions or help but you're just

1131
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:29,840
like no I don't want to interact with anyone I'm just uh well it's not even just that it's not even

1132
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,640
just that I didn't know where I was going it was just that I had no direction in life literally

1133
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,600
and I would walk oh I went I walked for a really long time and it was cold and it was terrible I

1134
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:48,640
literally I literally guys I literally can't even um but I literally can't even uh like look at it

1135
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,000
or think about it without feeling embarrassed or something yes it is nothing to pain for me to

1136
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:59,520
constantly you know I think Ben all the things that I have done and made it's a small small point

1137
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,880
but it's you know Ben I people always talk about how you know much they like my like

1138
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:09,520
login reviews and stuff the fact of the matter is I have done like what five of my like big

1139
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:15,680
staple videos like total in my entire video making thing yeah and frankly the ideas of making more

1140
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:20,960
is extremely intimidating that I won't be able to like live up to it or that and releasing those

1141
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:26,720
was always terrifying yeah and I remember when when Galco first came out um like I knew it was

1142
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:32,560
like a less substantive overall video it and like people were like not I remember you these people

1143
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:38,720
in this very call were not impressed with it I absolutely hated the Galco video yeah yeah and

1144
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:43,360
and that's fine that's totally fine yeah but I just I have that same fear about like important

1145
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:49,040
stuff I make and I think with it with both of us the more we make I think the more comfortable

1146
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:55,200
will be just like well with it hasn't improved it hasn't gotten any better for me but that's my

1147
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:01,120
point you haven't made that many maybe you if you get like five there's there was someone once said

1148
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:06,240
that fear points true north and I thought that was an interesting fear points true north when it

1149
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:10,160
comes to when it comes to creativity the thing you're most afraid of doing is definitely points

1150
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:15,520
to our insecurities that's for sure I wait to elaborate on that I don't really I tell me if

1151
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,720
this is right I think what you mean is that like um I mean I've heard this before that like if you're

1152
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:27,120
afraid of something then like the thing to do that like that means you should do it like to grow as a

1153
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:32,560
person or whatever yeah that was like the general idea of the quote that in the context they were

1154
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,120
talking about like creativity and stuff is that like if you're afraid of doing something uh it's

1155
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,840
it's the one like you're the most the most afraid of fucking it up because it's the one you're most

1156
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,920
passionate about yeah hey give it I'll tell you I'll tell you what uh I actually do that that thing

1157
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:54,000
where I just walk around aimlessly and I actually do it to my benefit because uh I'm I'm very much a

1158
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,400
homebody so sometimes I'll just leave the house walk in any direction till I get lost right dude

1159
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,360
it's fun I like that idea it's very fun I like that idea but like the time I was talking about is

1160
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:12,160
right it was a bad time right it was a bad time in my life uh like uh bad like before even like

1161
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:18,640
pony youtube this is like early early life like oh what do I do I'm gonna die I'm saying like do it

1162
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,800
in a more neutral context it's great you get to see more of the city places you've never even seen

1163
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,640
yeah I mean I I generally I generally I generally default to play pokemon go bro just play pokemon

1164
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:34,240
go just literally just play pokemon go I mean I generally default to walking around rather than

1165
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:40,000
getting transport because I don't like spending money and I think like my legs like could use the

1166
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,600
exercises and it's free like it's better and for free so I'll walk it's an it's an hour's walk but

1167
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,880
you know what I'll walk I'll have to walk back but that's fine I haven't talked to you in a while

1168
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:57,680
and I just want to say that you stood me up you you you stood us up no I was broke and I'm here to

1169
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:03,600
be funny I think I literally had two dollars in my bank account at that time there's no more embarrassing

1170
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:09,280
excuse that I'm poor I hear people say this all the time just buy some money

1171

let's get a good deal on some nuts yeah it was pearls before swine really oh was it Ben Ben Ben

1187
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:53,120
it was terrible scallop was the one that scallop was the one good thing yeah that's why I meant the

1188
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,880
scallop he was he was trying to use the forest and people to eat scallops against their will left

1189
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:03,120
scallops right just like this is like how ben did the 180 uh when I came up like what like three weeks

1190
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:09,040
ago when you specifically told told ben that it was an hour earlier to meet up than we actually

1191
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:15,200
were going to assuming he was going to be late and then he woke up right when we were supposed

1192
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:20,160
to be there and didn't even come to the uh to fire nice for you because munchie told me that you

1193
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:27,040
guys were like already leaving I said that I was already I was like I was like I was like a little

1194
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:32,240
bit late and I was like a little bit late yeah like that's like less than an hour and I was like hey

1195
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:36,400
should you get should I still come and you were like nah we're already eating we're basically done

1196
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:43,120
and then like four hours later you get to my house we did we did well wait this is not the

1197
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:50,000
story how I was told munchie told me that he said to you we're meeting at 11 yes and that's yeah

1198
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,600
no no I was I was like but we were actually but I could have still come the thing is we were actually

1199
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:01,600
meeting at 12 he told you an hour earlier assuming you were going to be late no exactly that just

1200
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,960
makes it worse because then it was like 12 and I was like should I come and he was like no it's

1201
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,680
like two hours away from you I didn't think that you would want to do that you hung out for like

1202
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:17,840
four more hours before you got to my house you told me this is vastly inaccurate most of that was

1203
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:23,200
uber time because we got stuck in traffic in uber oh you're a fucker but but but you didn't

1204
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:32,960
why am I a fucker because you lied to me what did I lie about you betrayed me well I did like you

1205
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,120
saying to get there earlier than you were supposed to yeah and you didn't accomplish that I did I

1206
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:44,320
know what what's the point of telling me to come an hour early and then so when I'm an hour late

1207
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:49,440
and therefore on time you're like nah it's too late don't show up that's technically not on time if

1208
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:56,320
the idea is to me yes at that time yes that's not on time at all you know but the point was that you

1209
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:01,440
were just rolling out of bed and you were rolling out of bed an hour after you were like you thought

1210
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:09,600
the time was supposed to be listen that's all fine that's that happened whatever I was at that point

1211
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:15,360
at that point there was a choice at that point there was a choice to be made do I still come

1212
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:23,760
and the right answer was yes but you told me no you did not care about your facts yeah that's

1213
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,320
right I was I was going to say though that Ben Ben turned the day around because he was making

1214
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:33,280
keto donuts and they were made those keto donuts and they were meat flavor and they were protein

1215
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:39,440
flavored yeah okay I'm sourd forever a happy ending the black the blackberry ones were an experiment

1216
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:46,880
and it failed and I and I and I copped to that I respect the effort though yes by the way I'm

1217
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:52,480
enjoying this image that zen posted in the chat that I'm assuming your dad sense no I don't know

1218
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:58,080
who that is no you don't know who it is no no I know Steve I don't know who sent me the

1219
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:04,320
picture oh okay so wait Steve Aoki isn't your dad I'm confused now I'm getting lost in the story

1220
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:11,280
put that where's where's the other people which chatter is in general general general yes

1221
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,840
well when it comes to art block I mean yeah the the only thing I have is whenever I oh actually

1222
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,480
we're talking about this before but it's like whenever I am stuck and I don't know what to do

1223
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:32,640
I simply try to to find the smallest possible atomic version like step forward on whatever

1224
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,160
the project is and I find that once I am in the mode where I do that one thing that's super easy

1225
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:43,600
the next thing just is much easier in general so that's that's my yes I mean there's there's all

1226
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:52,560
this sort of like just do it a sort of helpful advice that I that I hear um but you know all of

1227
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:58,480
it horse shit all of it horse shit I think my point is a little more nuanced well no here's here's

1228
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:04,640
the thing I was thinking about though um I I was getting on like from this from this uh

1229
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:10,720
annoyance that I can't be bothered to like work as hard as I would like to I was getting on like

1230
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:19,360
oh depression and then also um thinking about like uh what I want to do with my life maybe I

1231
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,080
don't even like comics maybe I don't even like drawing maybe blah blah blah this like all stupid

1232
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:31,040
shit that has no actual basis and it's just me being frustrated um that's a real and it is real

1233
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:40,800
shit but I was thinking like the the the way that motivation like comes about is as a result of

1234
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,520
something going well like you do something and you don't think much of it and if it goes well

1235
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:53,520
then you're motivated by that to continue doing it and I guess I just feel like comics bail jpeh

1236
01:21:53,520 --> 01:22:00,640
it was good but for some reason it doesn't feel like it was a good like idea to I mean it was nice

1237
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:05,200
that I finished it you know I know what you mean that scathing review I gave you last pcp where I

1238
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:11,040
said it wasn't the best comic in the world and he said he he he's his hand quit around his

1239
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:18,720
stylus and cracked in an ass so sorry so sorry tablet but like I mean it was mostly my own

1240
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:24,560
thoughts about it and then it was I was asking people in my discord uh or rather like they

1241
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,680
read the watch the pcp and heard that I wanted more criticism and they gave me criticism I was

1242
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:34,240
like yes I agree with all these things and that's true and I was thinking like yeah that's good and

1243
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:38,400
the fact that the the punk Kickstarter is like I know it's an inexpensive plush and not everybody

1244
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:43,680
has the money but if it was popular it would just work it would just you know there would be

1245
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:49,840
more fans if it was more I suppose like more marketable or I was better at spreading the word

1246
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:55,840
or just it was if it was like from the beginning if it was like nicer to look at because the first

1247
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,400
few panels are like complete shit and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere it's like that was the

1248
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:06,160
nature of its creation that I didn't care about it initially and then it it sort of grew from

1249
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,600
you know a very small thing but it's certainly got more impressive in it makes it difficult to

1250
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:17,040
get into it I think punk is great but I mean I have put my money down on a plush I want everyone

1251
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:22,800
go give money to the same fucking make it it it would start to be over by the time this comes out

1252
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:28,160
or with the I think it will be over I don't know maybe maybe like a day just go check just go check

1253
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:32,560
it I think there's like a day I think there'll be like a day or two left when this comes out

1254
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,160
but um give not to be pessimistic but if it doesn't work out is it possible to do one

1255
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:42,560
like of a smaller scale that would also make the plush real because I still want the damn plush

1256
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:48,080
no matter what happens um I have been thinking about that the the possibility like what was

1257
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:54,480
what's the cost now is it like it's like 50 right like six grand or something is that including

1258
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:59,440
delivery uh well I just know that your kickstarter asks for something oh no no like

1259
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:04,880
individually like what what the like 40 bucks 40 to 50 I think something like that like 50 something

1260
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:11,920
if I scaled it back to like I don't know 50 plushes because there's like 50 people already

1261
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:17,920
that want them or at least 50 backers so like potentially I could get 50 people again but

1262
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:23,200
that would mean the plush would be like a hundred and something dollars plus shipping oh which would

1263
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:28,400
which would like reduce the amount of people and then I won't probably won't even get 50

1264
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:33,200
and then it would just be the same thing again I'm not sure okay okay but nonetheless people

1265
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:39,360
go fucking pledge please help me get my plush yeah I put my money down god damn it I deserve a plush

1266
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:46,960
do it for me do it for Nate Nate deserves his pump plush that's what I want beautiful but guys

1267
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:52,720
it is just sort of a thing like seeing it not succeed sort of confirms my suspicions that it's

1268
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:58,160
not that big I mean obviously I knew that it wasn't huge but it doesn't feel like it doesn't

1269
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:03,600
motivate me to continue making comics not that I'm gonna stop but it's difficult now to like

1270
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,080
I thought it wouldn't affect me the Kickstarter not working I thought I had like in my head

1271
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,560
oh you know maybe it works maybe it doesn't doesn't matter I'll keep working and then I suddenly

1272
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,560
find myself that I don't want to work and I thought it might be related to Kickstarter when

1273
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,960
you started on this topic but when the when the PCP Kickstarter was going and you guys know I mean

1274
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:27,200
we were all heavily invested in that I was worked a lot on getting that going I was terrified

1275
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:32,560
dude we all were I was fucking worried I was just like I was like oh my god if this fail like

1276
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:38,000
I'm just gonna feel like such a failure and feel so bad but the reality is like even if it hadn't

1277
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,880
say I mean it vastly like doubled what we wanted to get you know due to the stretch goals and stuff

1278
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:47,200
and that was great but even if it had failed I mean it's always scary because like you have a

1279
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:51,360
vague idea of like how big your audience is and how much they're invested but like you never have

1280
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:56,800
the exact amount or otherwise you you wouldn't be scared so it's like every time you go into

1281
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,720
that venture of starting to kickstart it's like what's gonna happen but but you know like your

1282
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:07,360
Kickstarter and Kickstarter is in general like obviously it's not like oh it's either you succeed

1283
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,720
and you win or you fail and like now you're shit and everything you've done is bad yeah I mean it

1284
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:17,760
shows you the real life the real situation that like you know there's currently a little bit less

1285
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,920
people willing to put down money on it and that's just a good reality to be aware of

1286
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,000
and like I mean I was just thinking I was thinking of this before like I was thinking that like

1287
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:33,760
maybe this is one of your like ms paint adventures now deleted and homestuck.com but like maybe this

1288
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:39,600
is like your I don't know what was the thing before before problem sleuth barred quest jail

1289
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:46,240
and jail or whatever and I just I mean I I've been filled with hope and like Gibb's really done

1290
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:50,000
cool comic stuff here I can't wait to see what he's gonna do next time I bet it'll be even better

1291
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,840
and even cooler it is so if I may have the floor for a moment hippo I know you're a smart guy and I

1292
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:01,520
sure you've thought about this before so I speak now purely for the audience's sake but you say

1293
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,600
at the beginning of the conversation that you're making you know you're writing you're doing character

1294
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,480
layouts is not the point of bail jpeg just that you were supposed to fly by the sea of your handle

1295
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:16,560
by the by the by the seat of your pants by the pants of your pants not very but very marketable I

1296
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:22,400
suppose I mean that's that's very slapdash and not very uh but possibly you know impressive

1297
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:27,200
but that was the point that you were supposed to you know just kind of get it done and I just

1298
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:33,120
want to say that you may want to you know increase the marketability may want to increase the overall

1299
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:38,960
popularity of it for purely like a non you know oh great you are bad optic scenarios just you know

1300
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,800
you want people to enjoy the art you create and you want people to be happy with the stuff that

1301
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:49,520
you make and I think those are noble and fine but I just there's no reason to make a comic unless

1302
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:56,720
you want to make a comic you do not have to rely on jail babe for your for your patreon you don't

1303
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:01,920
have to rely on those comics to be to have a house over your head they are just purely nice and maybe

1304
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:06,720
you want to make a career out of it and that's a different story but if you are having such a hard

1305
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:11,520
time making a comic then we will probably see that in the result and I don't know if that's

1306
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:19,200
necessarily something that just needs to happen you know well it's it's it's it's I don't know

1307
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:26,960
whether it's that I don't want to work on it it's just that I find myself not you know I wake up

1308
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:32,720
and then I watch youtube videos for a really long time and I just don't give myself a time

1309
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:38,560
like um I mean I'm always like this even with things that I do like this is when schedules come

1310
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:45,280
in handy because I actually also make comics and uh you know I also spend a lot of time on youtube

1311
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:51,040
and I cut down by making schedules and adhering to it and punishing myself if I don't physically I

1312
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:56,800
know Zen's a big schedule guy right like like with the cat and I entails no I hit myself I I think

1313
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:07,760
yeah well no I mean I it's not I'm not Jesus Christ you by yourself yeah I just cut myself

1314
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:15,120
with a claymore you cut yourself into pieces it's your last resort I decided to hang a literal

1315
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:20,240
sort of Damocles above my head no but but seriously it's like night and day when you

1316
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,520
apply a schedule and actually adhere to it and like make the effort to you know

1317
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:28,080
follow the it's so hard for me to upstick to schedules though because no one's enforcing it

1318
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:33,760
but me and I'm a oh yeah that's the thing tell us you I want to hear about zen's like enforcement

1319
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:38,720
measures and what what how does that work for you what do you do with that what do I do well yeah

1320
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:46,320
like if you fuck up what do you do okay so uh one is like the I do physical repercussions right

1321
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:53,760
and then second of all uh there are things that I like right like um there are four can relate

1322
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,480
they're like foods that I like or sometimes I'll I'll often go to the store to get candy and like

1323
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:06,960
if I don't do something if I if I don't stop within like if I go like 20 minutes over right

1324
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,280
right like I'm watching YouTube like two hours or something but I go two hours and 20 minutes

1325
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,880
instead well I won't go to the store to buy the candy or I won't make myself that pizza you know

1326
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:23,600
because it's like stuff like that that's and it's like the trouble the trouble there but yeah the

1327
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:29,040
trouble there is you know finding something that you care about to the point that you know it's like

1328
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:34,720
this is actually it'll actually motivate you to do yeah exactly what what I find I mean this could

1329
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:42,400
just be maybe a lack of discipline on my part but I find that like actively trying to like just like

1330
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:47,360
destroy yourself doesn't motivate me in the same way that it might for you I feel like everyone

1331
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:52,240
gets motivated differently and and punishments don't work for me but what does work for me

1332
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:58,400
is just removing as many options as possible so instead of punishing myself for doing something

1333
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:04,240
bad I just will set up my life in a way where I can't do bad things and so it's not a question of

1334
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:10,160
will or I want I and if I do something bad then I have to punish myself it's it's a matter of oh

1335
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:15,680
there is no option here because either the easiest option is to do something that's beneficial to

1336
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:20,720
me and productive or it's not the most easiest solution but it's the only solution that is

1337
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:26,000
available to me for instance a perfect example right now I was fiddling around with my schedule

1338
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,640
and and and my and my auto blocker that blocks various application on my computer and I messed

1339
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:35,760
up so right now I'm recording my laptop right now and not on my desktop like I would because I

1340
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:41,680
literally locked myself out of my desktop and I cannot access it anymore because I misclicked

1341
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,680
and I literally like that's one of the functions I employ every single day as my computer will

1342
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:52,000
auto turn off at various points in the day okay right it's like whenever I'm doing something like

1343
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:58,000
essay or something like that I'll just turn off the wi-fi on my computer yeah man I tried that once

1344
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,680
one time I tried like shutting my my internet off and it worked really well for getting me to do

1345
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:09,760
stuff it yeah I mean it works really well until until you realize I mean when I'm drawing stuff

1346
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,480
I'm like oh I need a reference I gotta turn it back on and then I forget to turn it off

1347
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:20,400
oh it's always just a fucking nightmare like I I mean I tried the youtube challenge

1348
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:28,400
the hashtag youtube challenge of like not watching youtube ever ever again and I completely failed

1349
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:36,320
but you know and I'm back on I'm back on you know look at watching like multi hour videos every day

1350
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:41,440
and I mean they're fun videos and they're sort of background videos and I can play a game at the

1351
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:49,040
same time but I'm not working at like it's it's really just I'm wondering if that that whole thing

1352
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:57,120
just ultimately doesn't work but what does work is you know a good thing that I'm doing is like

1353
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:02,880
going along like getting getting the motivation like I was saying it it comes from a success it

1354
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,120
doesn't even need to be like I put it out and people like it it's that I drew something good

1355
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:13,600
and it's good so I'm motivated to to continue working on the thing getting started on anything new

1356
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:20,320
is so difficult because you have to make the initial good thing like if I do a sketch or like

1357
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:26,400
or if I think of like a really cool way of the story could go then it won't matter how much many

1358
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:31,840
distractions are in front of me I will want to be doing the thing because it's so cool in my in my

1359
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,920
head and I'm like I gotta do this at the moment though it's just sort of like I've got lots of

1360
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:40,240
ideas that could be good but I don't know whether any of them are going to be good and I'm just

1361
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:46,240
sort of like avoiding starting the only way to know is to try though which I'm sure you know

1362
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:51,520
so like I've just been feeling stupid for a few days and I'm usually a few days is all it takes

1363
01:33:51,520 --> 01:34:00,560
for me to like finally be like no no more video games and then I try and it it works for me it

1364
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:06,240
so often it just like it always it always gets preceded by me feeling like a depressed idiot for

1365
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:11,440
a few you know I must have said this on the podcast before so please stop me if I if I repeat this

1366
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:17,520
exact same line before but making a schedule is creating the perfect harness for yourself that

1367
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22,960
is not it does not cut too close to your skin you want to shear the sheep not to skin it so you

1368
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,680
want to make it you want to make a harness around yourself that you know enables you to be productive

1369
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:32,800
and direct you towards a path but also isn't too heavy that it makes you pissed off and want to

1370
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:38,480
die and piss and shit that's true that's very true it's called it's all part of the setting

1371
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:43,520
appropriate goals or setting realistic goals for yourself and if you say like just for example if

1372
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:48,160
you are a new youtuber and you say uh just like you've never done it before I want to hit a million

1373
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:54,000
subs by the end of the year like that goal is is purely unhelpful now it's so stupid because there

1374
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,000
can be some things about that and people have done this before but you're setting your sights in the

1375
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,080
wrong way you need to be way more specific and way more I don't know have a plan and I so I linked

1376
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:12,560
a video setting fitness goals by my hero scooby 1961 he's got a whole okay this guy is my favorite

1377
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,760
person in the world he taught me everything about fitness that I know but beyond that he is a he was

1378
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:23,360
he is a successful retired engineer who is let's just say extremely financially secure

1379
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:30,320
and uh he uh he retired at age like 50 or 60 or something just so he could he was doing his online

1380
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:38,640
youtube stuff yeah he's this guy is he is one of my favorite people on the planet uh he's a hero

1381
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:44,320
and by the way all yeah all his fitness tools he so he has made he like I said he's a software engineer

1382
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:50,000
he makes many fitness tools he releases them for free to the public to be used by anyone

1383
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:56,000
surely because he wants everyone to be able to benefit the way he has from fitness uh and to be

1384
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,680
able to like you know work on their goals and stuff it like to anybody who follows this guy you

1385
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:06,480
know what I'm talking about okay but specifically this video is part two of his of his series on

1386
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:11,680
setting good fitness goals but it applies to any goal at all so everybody you should watch it

1387
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:17,520
and the rest of the series because like setting goals in appropriately it's it's not just like I

1388
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:24,000
was saying before there are many ways to gauge if a goal is good or bad there's an acronym I cannot

1389
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,520
remember what it is right now it's like there's like four criteria and it's like measurable uh time

1390
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:37,760
bounded uh like not doing too much there's like words for it but like all those should be frankly

1391
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:42,080
if everyone's at work like optimally you should have those goals for like basically

1392
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:47,040
everything you're doing in life absolutely no no I'm totally with you yeah like the word of the

1393
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:52,480
day for me all the time is compartmentalization it's like yeah break it up into smaller more

1394
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:59,120
consumable chunks for you to understand and then the ostensibly daunting task just becomes a cake

1395
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:03,680
well not a cakewalk but you know you know something plausible that can actually be done by you

1396
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:08,320
absolutely during during me a math of a two I had a big backlog excuse me building up of

1397
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:13,760
things that I needed to do I simply couldn't do uh because I was too busy doing videos and stuff

1398
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,160
and now now that it's done I've been going through them one by one checking them off I've got a I've

1399
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:23,040
got a huge list of individual small tasks and I gotta say I don't know if everybody else feels

1400
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:29,840
the same way it feels so fucking good to one by one put my big done sign next to each of those

1401
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,160
tasks and soon I'm gonna have a big fucking list with nothing but guns and I'm gonna be an

1402
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:39,040
accomplished heroic individual and I can't wait it's so exciting this is the not this is the

1403
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:43,760
number one arc in my life that's giving me excitement and I can't wait to be done but

1404
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:49,680
go back to your to your new comic and stuff like that again I would just say I mean I don't know

1405
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:55,680
I don't even know if anyone else feels this way but again comics aren't what define you they aren't

1406
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:01,440
they don't have to be you're like a new thing oh god hey everyone the hey everyone in the village

1407
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:07,040
come over hippo crits doing comics now this is what he does now ha hey new comic please ha hippo

1408
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:12,160
please new comic that's not what's happening right now you don't have to be be held into really

1409
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:19,600
any standards I am in me and you are somewhat similar though you have a uh a different uh history

1410
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:27,440
but like our incomes are not online really uh or yours you you have like a writing job that

1411
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:36,400
assumably is like a job that sustains you correct uh yeah pretty much so you don't have to do anything

1412
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:43,280
you don't have I know I I was thinking about this it nobody has to do anything nobody has to

1413
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,520
die with with money that's not what I mean you can just you can just homestead your whole life

1414
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:56,560
you can just go live in the woods the thing is I don't like I don't really care about um making

1415
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:03,120
comics a career I would just like to have a few because I have some in my head well that's a great

1416
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:08,160
reason to do it that's a great reason and I'm not saying don't do it I'm just saying like I know

1417
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,720
what how it is to have people expect things from you and when it's your career you know you got to

1418
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:18,240
do it but yeah like when you literally promise a comic four years you know that's you know it

1419
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:22,320
could happen you can find yourself in that situation I mean I mean yeah I've done that exact same thing

1420
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:28,480
and I mean I I haven't talked about explicitly for literal years because I I have not I've not

1421
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:35,040
once brought it up in like a very very very long time because I'm not doing it duh I mean how could

1422
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:41,200
you think I possibly still would be after all these years you'd have to be insane yikes well now they

1423
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:48,720
know that they already mean now they know that's not a revelation yeah well I mean that's true anyway

1424
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:57,200
I decided that I mean I don't have any want to do comics really the the thing that was animations

1425
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:07,920
pathetic like I feel this this you know some sort of like kicking the butt of my of my own self

1426
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:14,560
to get started on it rather than to just wait until I feel like it because that never really comes is

1427
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:24,080
is just because I think it's nice to have something going on like it's it's nice to have a project

1428
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:29,040
that I'm working on if I wasn't thinking of writing a new comic I would be doing nothing really

1429
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:35,040
and aside from like the the writing thing which is like it's not insubstantial amount of work

1430
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:42,000
and I do enjoy that as well but it feels very separate from like internet online things and I

1431
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,240
know I don't have to make a comic I don't even think people are that interested in the next

1432
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:51,600
comic I make maybe a few people are well you got to get us interested of course you know yeah I mean

1433
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:57,280
I've got to get me interested in it that's that's indeed I don't say what I say to promote laziness

1434
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:01,840
or to say like oh you know like don't worry about just you know you just don't try and do anything

1435
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:07,040
that's obviously not what I'm trying to say yeah you are you know that's what I'm saying that's what

1436
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:12,320
I'm telling you mom position uh which is fine which is a totally appropriate one but I'm advocating

1437
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:17,760
the dad position uh human beings are beasts of burden and I very much believe that we do better

1438
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:23,120
when we have tasks assigned to us so well it's totally it's totally well he has but but as he's

1439
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:28,400
saying he's not that's not enough he's not satisfied if he didn't want to do it anymore

1440
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:35,360
that's totally fine but I mean I would absolutely advocate that like you shouldn't just always I mean

1441
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:41,200
I'm not saying Gibb thinks this but just in general like uh one shouldn't always like feel that when

1442
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,080
there are things that you know raise obstacles and I know Mudgey isn't saying this either but

1443
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:50,560
but just to state the general point when when obstacles arise and you feel uncomfortable

1444
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:56,800
the answer isn't necessarily to shy away sometimes it can be to rise and overcome that fear we'd all

1445
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:02,800
agree on points true north right we talked about that pretty much pretty much so uh so yeah so like

1446
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:08,720
sometimes in Gibb's situation I based on what he said it seems like he does have at least a interest

1447
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:14,560
in making comics so I would say you know whatever like try things power through etc find the solution

1448
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:20,320
all that bullshit you know you know yeah so if you have ideas for a comic I would be more than

1449
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:24,480
happy to see because because I like your so even if the idea is to make a comic like you did before

1450
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:28,480
where it's just like you know just literally make it up as you go I because that's great that's that's

1451
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:35,440
just like my problem is not uh no you go ahead I was gonna say if um if you have a couple ideas

1452
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:39,760
and you don't know which one you want to do like you can always just start doing them and not post

1453
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:45,200
them like if you want to just do like the first couple pages of each idea privately and be like

1454
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:49,440
if this isn't clicking for me then you don't have to like risk starting it putting it out there and

1455
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:56,000
then my my my brain is like not set on any of this exactly I bring it up because the the problem

1456
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,480
at the moment is that I feel like I have no direction and no motivation and no passion for

1457
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:07,280
anything and so the to try and make one of these things that I have ideas for will hopefully give

1458
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:11,600
me a purpose and then I will continue doing that but but you know though Gibb it's it's interesting

1459
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:15,680
because this is actually exactly I mean it sounds to me like you're a little bit down about the

1460
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:20,160
Kickstarter which is totally understandable one of the things that Scooby says I mean you know

1461
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:24,080
this is a very well said just this is where I heard it is like well like when you set yourself

1462
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:29,440
with expectations that are too high and like frankly like you asked for more money for your

1463
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:33,440
a pump Kickstarter uh and of course they get a more tangible thing of like the the thing

1464
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:38,960
than like we even did with Radcon and I mean just doing the math that's like uh like with all of us

1465
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:44,160
involved who are at Radcon we we were able to drum up a lot of money all our combined efforts

1466
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:49,280
and for you to do it on your own to ask for I mean we made like 9,000 I'm not saying that's a

1467
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:54,240
tall order I already be demoralizing if you don't reach a goal yeah you know I I did know going

1468
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:59,200
into it that it would be a quite a big ask and I wasn't expecting it to do well obviously not

1469
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:04,080
trying to be amazing I mean it's it's it's just the reality of like how much the thing costs to

1470
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,920
make yeah like like you said on the thing like you're not out you're not trying to make money

1471
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:14,480
like those just this is what it's this is what it's gonna cost to turn this thing into a physical

1472
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:21,120
product which uh yeah I mean I was making t-shirts it would be easy but t-shirts aren't as cool

1473
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:28,000
can I can I ask uh like what's like like how do you want to talk about like how you arrived at

1474
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:34,640
the number like what's the arithmetic behind it uh I detail that in the Kickstarter description

1475
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:41,520
uh okay yeah there's the there's the there's the base cost of like manufacturing the things and then

1476
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:49,760
them sending it to me so it's delivery cost and manufacturing costs then uh it is uh the customs

1477
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:57,040
import tax that I will be charged with once I receive it and then uh what else is it oh yeah

1478
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:02,880
and then there's five percent Kickstarter fee on top of whatever the big number is right right and

1479
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,680
shipping really fucked us with ride con three that was like a big expense I mean on on the Kickstarter

1480
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:13,120
like you you input the thing and then you say where you're from and then that uh the amount that is

1481
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:18,240
delivery cost I calculated how much it would cost to send something that that size and that

1482
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:26,080
weight and uh it's about ten dollars for america so that's yeah ten ten bucks plus on top of however

1483
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:35,520
much it is divided by 150 uh and then that's how I came to the thing so it's like uh yeah I could

1484
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:41,680
I could like I was thinking like I know this is not like literally allowed in Kickstarter

1485
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:47,600
but I was like thinking if it gets pretty close but it's like a couple hundred uh just off you know

1486
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:54,000
off the mark I was considering just like paying through some account for the rest of it yeah

1487
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,760
yeah you can do that well what what is Kickstarter gonna gonna get mad that you contributed more

1488
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:05,760
money to the campaign that they skim off the top of no yeah I don't know but um yeah I don't know

1489
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,480
if there's a rule I'm not I'm not really down for like putting like more than half which is where it

1490
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:16,560
is at the moment yeah yeah for sure for sure that's a big chunk of change I I I just want to say

1491
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:22,160
just at the end here just say the reason I say all that I say is simply that to say don't make

1492
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:26,000
shit art just because you feel like you have to because I don't want to read bad things so don't

1493
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:33,120
make a bad thing they don't want to oh no I feel that and there yeah okay it's just like you were

1494
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:37,280
saying I you don't really feel motivation and a lot of time I don't feel motivation too until like

1495
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:42,240
it's a really an opportune time to have motivation because I can't write down the idea and I forget

1496
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:48,000
it like you know when I'm I'm in bed or in a shower so I always have a notepad next to me you

1497
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,560
know so it's like I can write it down and this isn't necessarily to you because this might not

1498
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:56,800
be the case to you but so I'm just talking in general so it's like yeah I just always have

1499
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,200
something that you can write something down on even if you're sleepy and it's like you have to

1500
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:12,320
you sort of have to um what's what's the word not domesticate uh you have to uh uh discipline

1501
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:22,000
yourself to to do it you have to be really tired you'll be like uh it's a good idea but I don't

1502
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,880
want to write it out you have to do it you just have to do it I have definitely ruined my sleep

1503
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:34,240
when I had sort of a cool idea and I was like I gotta I gotta write that down I turned my phone on

1504
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:39,120
the light blinds me and then I have no eyeballs but then I type it down in like a google doc

1505
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:43,520
that's literally how I made my first youtube video yeah it was like it was like 12 o'clock

1506
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:47,600
in the morning and I stayed up for seven hours because I never edited before and I made a video

1507
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:53,680
okay this is this is how much joy in the square feels me with every single day of my life this is

1508
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:58,560
how much like creative juices are flowing when I work on that shit because every single day I'll

1509
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,720
code a little bit and then I'll write a little bit and then I'll get into bed and then I'll think

1510
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:08,400
myself oh dude what if like just to myself over and over again like dude what if just like just

1511
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:12,640
constantly thinking of ideas and then it gets a brilliant point where I think I gotta write all

1512
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:17,120
this down and I just I just get on like a google doc for like five hours make a ton of shit yeah

1513
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:24,480
feels so good feels great that's great you know what felt that I had like a big like typing of a

1514
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:30,480
type storm the other day did you made his video like why I play games and I was like oh dude I love

1515
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:37,120
thinking about that I love like um thinking about why I like things and so I try to figure out why I

1516
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:43,040
like playing games and I typed in a notepad document like for like 20 minutes straight like

1517
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:49,520
as in like that my my fingers were not leaving the keyboard to think I was just like so much

1518
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:55,520
info is like getting like put to paper and it felt great uh but it was like spelling errors and

1519
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:00,480
like really disorganizes like good thing I'm not a youtuber anymore because this would be a nightmare

1520
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:05,600
to like go through and make into something presentable there there are days where writing

1521
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:10,240
feels so fucking hard for me but then the days just like spontaneously having words just words

1522
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:17,600
flow from your fingers ah oh yeah that was me last night I started writing a script like in bed on

1523
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:23,920
my phone for a video and it was like three pages worth of stuff just on a tiny little phone screen

1524
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:28,480
and like why am I still going I should be sleeping right now it's weird when it just like hits you

1553
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:19,680
played they all know it Nate no no no no no no no that's a rumor there's no evidence

1554
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:27,280
before we start voicemails I want to I want to point out something funny about the voicemails

1555
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:32,800
in a medicine I went to speak pipe the website a couple days ago because I wanted to start a

1556
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:38,640
speak pipe to help with the community show that I want to do for my patreon the free plan doesn't

01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:44,000
exist anymore I have no idea how we're out paying for the money wait what doesn't exist anymore the

1558
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:50,640
free plan for speak pipe doesn't exist anymore it's only on the wire lads so I have no idea how

1559
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:56,320
they're not charging us for this yet but uh there you go yeah you know the weird thing is when with

1560
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:00,960
speak pipe there is a limit to the number of voices I think it was like like 50 or something

1561
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,600
it's like 50 a month and we do way past that and they've never charged us yeah we haven't

1562
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:09,600
been charged is there is there someone is there someone else is getting charged and they just

1563
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:15,760
don't know what's going on I hope so we're by the way I know exactly what number we're up to or

1564
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:22,240
okay we like the messages we're up to we're up to we've had over 1068 before this meeting we had

1565
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:28,480
exactly 1068 messages that was the last one before I started uh get the voicemails this time

1567
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:41,040
this whole meme of lack of quality it's it's a lie and I'm gonna prove it to you right now

1568
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:48,720
we've got a voicemail from my hero he's called you know you know it's fucking true let's let's let's

1569
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:53,120
give him a chance to clear the floor here we go is this quality women back back at it again

1570
01:53:53,200 --> 01:54:03,440
no not yet let's let's go go hey um do you ever feel like straight guys who haven't at least

1571
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:07,280
tried to suck a cock are um just fucking cowards

1572
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:15,760
that's the whole voicemail I tell you that's the whole voicemail the fact that you are the only

1573
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:24,480
person laughing it's true they are cowards it is absolutely cowardice I'm so with this guy

1574
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:34,320
it's cowardice I've tried to suck my own sexuality's on a spectrum it's try to suck your own in the

1575
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:39,840
abstract like like legitimately like sucking dick like isn't like actually the worst thing that could

1576
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:44,640
happen to someone like in the abstract like sucking a cock I could probably do it it wouldn't be that

1577
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:50,560
bad honestly sure uh well I mean that's true it wouldn't be like a painful experience might be

1578
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:56,800
unpleasant I would rather I would rather enjoy a delicious meal with friends well I mean it's the

1579
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:01,680
rest of it for me the only reason the only reason I wouldn't suck a dick is because I wouldn't want

1580
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:07,600
to give the person the satisfaction sure like if it was just a floating dick with no person attached

1581
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:13,440
like yeah sure why not yeah okay who won't tell who tell tales of your of your back room antics

1582
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:17,600
you know I want a little privacy in my interaction I don't know I really don't have to be convinced it

1583
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:22,400
genuinely does not strike me is like that bad like yeah like whatever I just suck a dick it's not

1584
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:28,960
into the world sure that's fucking gay yes it is I guess it's like I guess the implication is like

1585
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:35,280
oh what do you do with your with yourself and like your sexual identity after that are you gay now

1586
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:41,920
but not yeah yeah it's just someone's like finger but it has a dick on it why would you put someone's

1587
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:49,440
finger you know I feel like that's even worse uh I'm gonna give everyone look I think look we give

1588
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:54,640

1612
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:45,680
I'm calling back just uh okay just a little update here set to explain myself so uh my highly

1613
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:52,800
controversial voicemail yeah I'm saying that only eight out of ten and above women are uh okay that

1614
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:56,640
was that was bullshit that was a stupid thing I think what I what I meant what I really meant

1615
01:58:56,640 --> 01:59:02,320
to say which is actually could be even more offensive and uh oh oh oh munchie oh munchie

1616
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:07,840
you're gonna get offended you're gonna whitenight me a little bitch here we go okay so I think what I

1617
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:14,960
meant what I meant to say what I really was feeling inside is uh I I can I can fucking

1618
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:18,960
tolerate an eight out of ten or above I can tolerate your craziness more because it's like

1619
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:22,880
oh because you're it's like you're fucking hotter you know it's like why should bitch I'm not going

1620
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:30,240
to tolerate your craziness if you're below eight dog just walked in you know I'm saying like if

1621
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:35,200
you're an eight and below like your dog why would I tolerate your fucking craziness if you're a 10

1622
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:39,600
you know you could tolerate a 10 out of 10s craziness more because they're fucking wicked hot

1623
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:43,280
you know so I think uh I think that's what I really know is this more we're not fucking anymore

1624
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:47,920
she uh he kind of hates me now she said she was thinking of never talking to me again good yeah

1625
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:53,280
she's seeing a therapist now and uh yeah we're just kind of we haven't fucked in like two or three weeks

1626
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:59,120
so well great oh let's hear it let's hear it wait is is this the guy who was like uh he was

1627
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:05,760
breaking up but he was still seeing this person yeah he was so dumb so dumb okay okay incredible

1628
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:11,840
let's talk let's talk about this yeah please well I I do understand I understand the eight out of 10

1629
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:17,600
thing I don't agree with it sure but it makes a little more sense to me comment on this been king

1630
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:28,240
of fives that was that was a time in history he's learned and grown yeah okay five out of five

1631
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:34,240
right I like the end of the story being punctuated by like oh yeah this person like hates me she's

1632
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:39,680
gonna go see therapy for what I've done to her like he didn't say from what he's done oh okay okay

1633
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:44,320
fair that's definitely mixed grappling but it's funny to assume that so I will do it anyway

1634
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:50,160
that's smart that's wise that's wise uh I mean frankly it doesn't sound like our boy has learned

1635
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:58,960
to say the least it does seem that things are despite his best efforts improving because he's

1636
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:04,800
not with this person anymore and it's going to be phased out so that's good I'm glad to hear that

1637
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:11,680
proud of him oh proud of work on proud of your boy that is not more controversial than this last

1638
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:19,120
statement come on no all right the saga the saga concludes okay yeah so thanks for that quality

1639
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:27,360
women here is a little voicemail from uh Jerry uh late honest love him love Jerry my favorite hey guys

1640
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:31,920
so I know that whole Nate's girl is retarded thing is really funny yeah but I think that guy who

1641
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:36,720
left the voicemail was onto something he was trying to expose a secret darker side of the man who

1642
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:42,400
refers to himself as the best guy ever and I have some damning evidence spoken from his own mouth oh no

1643
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:49,040
this is a clip from pcp episode 47 at one hour 51 minutes and 41 seconds he's got receipts take a listen

1644
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:54,320
so why don't they why doesn't society allow me to play with retarded people yes I want to have

1645
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:59,200
sexual retarded people I think that this is enough the show is clearly one of Nate's many

1646
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:10,800
it's been nice knowing you he got you oh all right dude my last exactly to finish out this podcast

1647
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:16,640
before I go to it the police are outside you are right now they ban you your last wish it's okay

1648
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:24,000
though I believe I they've got your last meal it's a bottle of fuel I like to imagine like you know

1649
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:29,120
there's always like the dignified deaths in tv shows where it's like an assassin's come and it's

1650
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:34,160
just like grant me one last wish and the assassin's like of course and yours is just like let me finish

1651
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:40,320
this episode of the pcp let me record one more podcast there's a gun pressed against my head

1652
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:44,560
right now they're just waiting for the end to pull the trigger so well you know I thank you

1653
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,080
officer you're doing a great job it's Michelle holding the gun against you she's trying to get

1654
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:55,040
it might be Michelle dressed up um yeah well okay all right that's that's very damning uh I admit

1655
02:02:55,040 --> 02:03:03,440
to everything you've heard is true everything everything even the lines those are true too

1656
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:15,680
all right here's uh the biggest virgin ever uh how exciting here you go it's your parallel

1657
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:20,960
hey pcp in one episode it was said that oneitis is the deadliest disease known to man

1658
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:25,280
I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to deal with my oneitis I'm going to call this

1659
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:29,920
girl Karen I asked Karen out in high school she said she just wanted to be friends and I accepted

1660
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:34,560
this and moved on I started a thing with another girl and that fell through really hard Karen helped

1661
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:39,120
me recover because she is my friend and we started hanging out a lot but I ended up becoming obsessed

1662
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:43,520
with Karen I think that this has caused me to no no longer see other girls as attractive or

1663
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:48,560
interesting I recognize I had a problem in college and tried separating entirely from Karen twice

1664
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:53,360
the both times even if you're not communicating for months the first time and years the second time

1665
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:57,680
she tried to get back into my life and I allowed it because I figured I could handle it but I still

1666
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:02,080
can't help but think about her every single day unfortunately trying to separate again is not an

1667
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:06,480
option for me anymore because she joined a discord server that is pretty much all of my friends in

1668
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:11,200
it oh he's he's locked in now boys he can't escape she's in the discord server anyway I communicate

1669
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:15,200
with my friends if I were to try and fuck out of here dude that would mean leaving the server and

1670
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:19,840
losing contact with that entire group of people which I am not willing to message them I feel that I

1671
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:24,080
really need to get over this make another discord actually been dating this one guy since we graduated

1672
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:29,840
high school so about five years I've never met him but I heard he was in his late 30s so his biological

1673
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:34,000
clock is going to tell him to get married soon and I just don't think I can handle hearing that she

1674
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,560
is getting married so that's my confusion okay I'm a 23 year old virgin with oneitis and I need

1675
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:44,720
some advice on how to do I have thank you girl I know exactly well from what you know you know what

1676
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:51,440
you know you know what I was kind of on board with it I was like yes oh well you can't help how you

1677
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:58,000
feel I guess until you got to the part about how like she came back into his life and then I was

1678
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,600
like this this girl is a fuck this is that's like some that's a little manipulative I think that's a

1679
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:09,920
little bit well wait well hang on I mean I mean tell me if you think I'm wrong but my take is that

1680
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,480
maybe that's true but he also might just be framing it that way like sure did she really

1681
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:21,040
armrest her her way into his life despite I guess I guess we don't know yeah I mean it's it's the

1682
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:28,000
fault I don't know if it's a fault of hers because if she if this if he's being her friend and she

1683
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,400
misses her friend then I guess that's like not a bad thing on her part I think maybe she should be

1684
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:36,960
more sensitive the fact that she knows there's more feelings there on his end but it's not this

1685
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:44,240
really I just realized something I think I've just realized that we can only take this from his

1686
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:51,360
perspective and if we actually want to understand like the best way forward for either of these people

1687
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,640
we would need to get her perspective as well but since we don't have that anything we speculate

1688
02:05:56,640 --> 02:06:01,360
maybe completely off the mark and that's why we're not you know this isn't marriage that's why we

1689
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:08,640
can't actually tell you how to do it it's just fun fun hypotheticals to to chew on so like if someone

1690
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:13,680
does find themselves in the situation in which we happen to talk about they know the correct answer

1691
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:18,240
because we're always right I suppose that's right that's right for this particular person like what

1692
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:24,960
we say may not be the right thing okay okay that is true here's the thing I don't know okay maybe

1693
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:32,960
this is cruel but I don't know if I can even have pity anymore if you've been jonesen for this girl

1694
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:39,280
who's been with another guy for five years five years yeah are you fucking kidding me

1695
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:46,000
look look okay I don't want to be like overly mean to this guy or anything but but okay frankly I'm

1696
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,880
sensing a bunch of issues one I'm sensing generally low self-esteem and that's fine it's not like a

1697
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:57,200
problem but like obviously if you could have got honestly guys maybe I'm crazy but like I really think

1698
02:06:57,200 --> 02:07:05,360
99.9% of guys issue with women is that there's one girl and they like that and they can't see

1699
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:10,240
themselves being successful with any other woman like do you think Genghis Khan ever had

1700
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:14,320
fucking one night is for anyone woman would he had you know like thousands available to him at any

1701
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:19,680
time the answer is no the answer is if a man has a if a man has two women that would make themselves

1702
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:25,280
available and one says I'm you know I'm not gonna do it he will say buh-bye and immediately plow into

1703
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:33,360
the other one like light speed he'll be in there it's an impregnation um and so where is the light

1704
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:39,120
where's the light I mean I want to be nice to this guy because I like to give helpful advice

1705
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:44,320
dude I think your problem I mean that you yeah yeah you want to say something if you just cut in

1706
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:47,920
I don't know how many how how many different ways can you say it's fucking get over it

1707
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:52,400
like it's obviously not doing anything it's not even get over it you have to you have to cut

1708
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,520
this person out of your life and keep it that yeah I want to put it in terms of actually

1709
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:00,880
guys it's pretty it's pretty simple he's he's he's a coward because he hasn't tried sucking dick before

1710
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:07,920
so consider consider it wrong you ain't wrong you know it's not gay yeah you know what you know

1711
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:13,600
what just go to the guy that she's with and suck his dick and then make him gay and then oh my god

1712
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:19,680
oh then she'll be available and then you can go any think about it yeah but then he'll be gay too

1713
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:24,400
so he won't want her anymore no you can buy buy you can you can you can do that no that's a myth

1714
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:35,120
you okay I mean yeah like Ben was saying obviously the the solution here is you got look

1715
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:39,120
five years dude like what has it been like a relationship we're like oh my god they've been

1716
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:44,400
on and off again these two like oh maybe there's a chance for me everything there's not a step in

1717
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:52,080
this equation is you limiting yourself and being un like un healthily fixated on one woman every man

1718
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:57,760
in the world is better off if you just accept the reality that like there are more than one

1719
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:03,360
okay so this guy was saying like it's affected his ability to even be into other women okay here's

1720
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:10,560
here's your here's your prescription this is dr. Nate's prescription I demand that you go and in some

1721
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:15,280
capacity some social capacity whatever you just do an exercise doesn't involve it's just in your own

1722
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:22,000
head think about the women around you and like are there any redeeming quality about what any of the

1723
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:27,680
women around you chopped up in pieces in your refrigerator like yeah I'm just just a thought

1724
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:33,040
experiment just a thought it's possible that anything decent could theoretically come from

1725
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:38,800
like a dating or just fucking or whatever like relationship with any other woman and I the

1726
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:42,720
answer you'll inevitably arrive at is yes you know what there are actually other girls that are nice

1727
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:47,360
and might you know bring something nice to my life I'm sure I'm sure on some level he understands

1728
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:52,400
that right and like of course yeah so like there seems to be some sort of mental block that's going

1729
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:56,320
out so I think that what he needs to do is literally just pound a pavement go in there and

1730
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:01,600
actually meet the women and see it firsthand this man needs a hardcore dose of of pickup

1731
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:10,320
artistry he needs to go out literally talk to this is the cure for most men's low self-esteem

1732
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:16,880
go out and talk to 100 girls just go do it have a checklist check off 100 and by the time you're

1733
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:23,520
done you will no longer give a shit because the thing is 99% of men give up before they reach

1734
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:28,240
that number if you do it you will you won't care anymore and you'll be over it now you'll probably

1735
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:33,200
meet a girl who's nice no I agree the guy just the guy just you know you you're a guy you get like

1736
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:37,440
this you get in the you just lack perspective you just gotta shake himself out of it that's the

1737
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:43,280
problem the thing is he was asking about like what do I do about my discord friends oh I forgot

1738
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:49,600
about that like join me make another one right I don't think you know I don't think you have to

1739
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:54,880
do anything like the problem is not the discord the problem is that you lack the perspective

1740
02:10:54,880 --> 02:11:00,400
the fact that you see this girl in the discord server still like it fucks you up to the extent

1741
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:05,280
that you have to fucking ask us for what to do about it well that that's true that that's true but

1742
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:11,840
on all right well maybe maybe then you leave the discord and in that time use that lack of

1743
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:16,720
distraction to try and sort yourself out and then you can go back and then you won't care I mean

1744
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:20,800
because this like that's like this is where you totally lose me dude you're like crying about how

1745
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:26,640
you need this discord server it's like the only revenue yeah like I get it I guess that your friends

1746
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:32,240
are there I get that you like these people and this man has a lack of creative lack of creative

1747
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:36,960
thinking because there are other ways you can be in contact like no no no no other social media

1748
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:42,240
other social media I think it download Skype or whatever I don't think you're an idiot if we

1749
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:46,800
did that none of us would talk if we still if I got downloaded Skype right now I would never talk

1750
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:51,600
to any of you again okay what okay Skype Skype wasn't a joke but like I don't know like Twitter

1751
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:56,720
your friends are on there no I don't know make another discord like what's it just make another

1752
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:01,680
okay that's the real answer make another yeah yeah make another discord okay well I don't think it's

1753
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:08,400
that crazy to say that like oh well this is where all my people are at like like that's a thing like

1754
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:12,800
yeah you if you might okay I mean like limit your interaction with them if you I mean that

1755
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:18,160
take up another venue the only problem to that problem no but the thing is I understand the

1756
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:24,080
solution I think the solution is that you gotta fucking get over your shit so that the presence

1757
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:30,640
of this person isn't like ruining your life long term that's absolutely correct but like I at the

1758
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:33,760
very least I want to get look I'm sorry I'm not really trying to be mean to this guy I don't even

1759
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:38,560
really find it funny or really want to but it's like to give him a tangible I want to give him

1760
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:43,200
small steps because ultimately like yes you shouldn't care like long term yes that's the

1761
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:47,600
place to be but in the meantime I understand that this does bug you and obviously he says like

1762
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:51,840
ah if they get married I'll be really really upset like okay that's fine I believe you what if they

1763
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:59,680
get married it'll be the same I mean he should he should already be as upset as he needs to get

1764
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:05,680
you know what I mean they've been together five years exactly exactly there's no like that would

1765
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:12,400
just be the status quo continues okay you just okay look can we all agree look five I have a

1766
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:16,800
little discord server with like four people in it and they're my best buddies from college

1767
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:22,240
like is it really that crazy an idea to just make a server like even if you like I understand

1768
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:25,280
if you're trying to make a parallel server it'll be weird because like oh now they have to like

1769
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:28,880
pick a side like which server are they gonna be like in mainly don't don't even make it that

1770
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:33,600
complicated just bring in like the people who you really got to talk to like what is there like

1771
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:38,720
50 of those people no you probably got like five maybe like 10 maybe less I don't know make a server

1772
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:43,440
just with those people and talk to them through that and leave the server with everybody or if

1773
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:48,160
you don't want to leave it whatever like mute it check it rarely like avoid the girl you should

1774
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:52,800
probably leave it though you can come back later if you know I understand the only thing I could

1775
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:57,760
have I wish that he had the mental capacity to just get over and not have to like completely

1776
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:02,400
remove this person from his life because they were friends originally well of course so that's

1777
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:08,000
this is the nature of the beast some relationship dude just do something but respect her agency

1778
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:15,520

1824
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:43,040
antithesis as I think he said fuck digi I believe is what he said he's the antithesis of me of me

1825
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:50,960
aka the average pcp fan so Annie Fred like is emblematic like if you were to take every pcp fan

1826
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:56,080
and put them into like a big like like melting vat and just stirred them all together you would get

1827
02:18:56,080 --> 02:19:02,800
Annie Fred he is the literal embodiment of what it means to be a pcp fan he comes in to the rck

1828
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:09,440
discord meetup he comes in with his anime avatar I make fun of his avatar and and and then and then

1829
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:14,560
he changes it facetiously to a shit avatar to make fun of me when really he should be the one

1830
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:20,960
that's made fun of for his shit anime avatar listen I'm not gonna forgive you just goes you oh right

1832
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:35,600

I should be cursing you, but you know what I had to preach you know a master's

1855
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:38,240
represent masters and you know what I that's right God look my my my my

1856
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:42,360
experience with that was completely binary I was like this is garbage

1857
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:49,200
that was the best voicemail today God you know all right there's some there was

1858
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:54,040
something about like the extent to which that effect was applied like it was a

1859
02:22:54,040 --> 02:23:01,480
little way too much which made it sort of kind of good exactly exactly I mean I

1860
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:05,600
don't know if we heard some more of the saga of the wacky it was it was it was

1861
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:12,760
PCB bonus episode ASMR core that was what I liked about is just that like it was so

1862
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:18,440
like the visualization of it is just this man like it's so extreme that I

1863
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:22,000
could not possibly imagine like what this man were to look like and how he would

1864
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:27,120
be recording to a microphone like it like you'd be moving away so fast it

1865
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:30,040
would be like a single frame he's on screen than a single frame he's not just

1866
02:23:30,040 --> 02:23:37,280
over and over again oh what a hero thank you so much if you there's more into

1867
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:41,040
this song that honor there's always space on the grail for a man such as well

1868
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:46,160
okay all right well let's not go that far let's not go that far this guy this guy

1869
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:49,880
is going to jail okay he's going straight to jail

1870
02:23:49,880 --> 02:23:55,480
we've got one time not just like South America or something yeah basically the

1871
02:23:55,480 --> 02:24:00,040
same thing but we got one final message and this is from of course our old buddy

1872
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:04,680
the I'll die corporation voicemail bot today on true

1873
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:11,000
oppression no more no more soccer for us this dumb these now this is good this

1874
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:16,400
let's hear what he has to say about oppression okay go booting up I'll die

1875
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:22,760
corporation voicemail bot okay I'm ready through an objective analysis of all

1876
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:26,280
social issues spanning the entirety of the globe I have rightfully calculated

1877
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:29,760
that the most depressed minority in the world is foot fetishists the most common

1878
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:32,560
through line in all discourse is the insistence on such a fetish being the

1879
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:36,520
lowest of flow could it be because of the sweaty odor calculation saying while

1880
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:39,800
the foot can often be sweaty few areas of the body perspired more than the

1881
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:43,480
genitals which are nearly universally acclaimed as areas of high sexual value

1882
02:24:43,480 --> 02:24:48,160
how about it's association with unclean substances such as dirt again this is

1883
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:51,880
found wanting genitals are most strongly associated with producing human waste

1884
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:55,840
product oh my god that is far from being described as clean perhaps it could be a

1885
02:24:55,840 --> 02:24:59,960
fear of transmitting disease alas it cannot be so virtually all forms of

1886
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:03,480
physical sex are prone to promoting the transmission of disease yet this does

1887
02:25:03,480 --> 02:25:07,600
not deter humans from performing such actions in conclusion my calculations

1888
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:10,520
have assessed that the reason foot fetishists are so looked down upon must

1889
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:22,280
be a jealous explain to anybody involved with its creation especially the

1890
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:29,160
moderator of the aisle die corporation voicemail bot alright this no the facts

1891
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:33,400
are in game I know the fact is you're a degenerate foot they framed it shit this

1892
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:37,920
voicemail bot framed it in the wrong way people don't look down on foot

1893
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:43,000
fetishes because you it's stinky they look down on it because they don't get

1894
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:48,520
it I mean they like because they literally look down on it I don't think

1895
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:53,320
foot fetishes are like that maligned because people like as a joke will just

1896
02:25:53,320 --> 02:25:57,320
put their feet like yeah sure look at it like because they don't feel anything

1897
02:25:57,320 --> 02:26:01,080
they don't feel like they're being slutty by showing but on the other end

1898
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:07,800
people will be like oh feet like it's it's just sort of like like I don't I

1899
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:13,160
don't I don't buy the the foot fetishists are maligned I don't see that all the

1900
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:21,200
time yeah there's there's definitely a good people don't get beat up for

1901
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:27,880
liking foot feet so oppressed they can't even be public about their love of

1902
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:32,200
feet it's it's a damn okay but like horrible that's like the case for a lot

1903
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:42,280
of kinks like most of them yeah I feel like feet feet are like like that's the

1904
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:47,240
more on the vanilla scale more on the vanilla side of like fetishes that you

1905
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:51,840
can't say that you have well okay did you see that famous king of the hill

1906
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:56,680
episode where Peggy with her famously massive feet was contracted to be a quote

1907
02:26:56,680 --> 02:27:01,000
unquote model and then they had her doing some very odd foot positioning and

1908
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:05,320
it turns out it was for a foot fetish website and when she found this out she

1909
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:09,760
was deeply disturbed and you know that people would be a quacking it to her

1910
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:16,160
old big old knockers of the foot variety and I get it I get it would you get it

1911
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:26,440
what point did you even make with that I agree that I did it fetish people

1912
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:29,880
to be put on a pedestal the exact reverse of everything that's happening now

1913
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:34,000
they should be completely like a pedestal like on a on a gallows before you pull

1914
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,600
the switch and they all you know fall through but I just agree with the

1915
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:41,240
statement that they are the most for I think my friend George Washington tune

1916
02:27:41,240 --> 02:27:45,440
fetishist we'll have a problem with that as he is of the variety that tune

1917
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:51,240
fetishists are the most marginalized group in society so what's a tune fetishist

1918
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:55,480
somebody likes the Simpsons no yeah well exactly someone like like who likes

1919
02:27:55,480 --> 02:28:01,000
over stylized like overly cartoony like no anatomy no representation of the

1920
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,120
human anatomy whatsoever like like you know like just pure like bending for

1921
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:09,880
example just pure undultrated lines on a page that don't represent humans but

1922
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:15,680
think they have like so they're adults can't help but like them yeah that's it

1923
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:19,040
that's all I think you I think you George Washington tune fetishist will be

1924
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:25,160
good friends yeah that's my that's my new friend I talked about I checked out

1925
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:29,960
on a really long time ago people will know good man all right well that's it

1926
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:33,360
that's our last question was steeped in comedy I was trying to be serious and I

1927
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:36,520
couldn't I couldn't tell if anyone else was serious I was being serious I was

1928
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:42,360
being serious on the fact that's like why why why foot fetish like that's not

1929
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:50,160
the worst fetish okay okay being completely serious but it's not that

1930
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:54,280
it's the worst fetish it's that the people who have it are the most they're

1931
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:58,480
numerous they're numerous and like you never see him coming and like they're

1932
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:04,680
sneaky and they're weird no okay I don't I don't get I speak seriously there's a

1933
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:08,720
lot of people who like make fun of foot fetish like that's a go-to make fun of

1934
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:15,400
for a lot of right guys how can you think it's not a joke it's not a joke it's

1935
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:21,560
not it's not it's not obviously the they're not the most oppressed minority

1936
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:30,320
god damn it but that's what the voicemail if you fucking shut the fuck up

1937
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:37,640
and die I mean you're changing the topic to be the most oppressed fetish okay

1938
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:41,200
fine no why are you fucking listen why don't you we're we're having a

1939
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:50,280
conversation keep up think about it I'll put shoes on my feet and I will keep

1940
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:55,520
up I'll keep all the fetishes away I don't want them looking at all the same

1941
02:29:55,520 --> 02:30:00,080
way I feel about like people saying that ginger people are like really oppressed

1942
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:06,120
XD nobody have no souls it's just like I don't know it's not even that funny

1943
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:10,160
that's why it's a noisy so much because it's not even that funny to say all

1944
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:15,000
these things that aren't even that particularly true making fun of people

1945
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:20,400
who have diaper fetishes now that's funny because that's clearly very strange

1946
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:26,800
and haha clearly I guess so I mean I have no substantive argument to make

1947
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:31,520
against foot fetishists I suppose other than yeah I mean the bot pretty much

1948
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:36,920
I've got no ammo in the chamber fetishes are all by their nature just really weird so

1949
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:39,560
like you know keep it in the bedroom you're not hurting anybody cool cool

1950
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:43,760
beans indeed my knee trick reaction will be to make fun of them but like the

1951
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:49,720
knee trick reaction isn't always the best reaction so it's like you're not

1952
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:54,560
allowed to show your feet on twitch under any circumstances because yeah

1953
02:30:54,560 --> 02:31:00,040
because okay I mean I've heard this from multiple sources I could have been lied

1954
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:05,040
to by multiple I heard you're not allowed to show your feet on twitch

1955
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:08,680
because it is porn to do that I mean that that you know a slightly different

1956
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:12,880
example but like just like now these days you are not allowed YouTube changes

1957
02:31:12,880 --> 02:31:17,800
policy you're not allowed to comment on perfectly innocuous videos of minors a

1958
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:22,560
lot of the time because some people like perceive them you know like sexually or

1959
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:26,680
whatever and yeah that's pretty weird that's a odd stance to take I mean I

1960
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:30,880
get it I think we're kind of throwing out the baby with the bathwater

1961
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:36,040
saying oh yeah I love videos of babies being thrown out with

1962
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:44,320
that's my go-to epic that epic baby and bathwater prank 2019
