And we got some guests. We got a returning guest gamer as Tevin.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Er, two antennas met on a roof and got married. The ceremony wasn't much, but the reception was incredible.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Did it again.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's a good one.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You did it.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, you did it.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you, thank you.

Gamer's Tavern show on YouTube. Check it out.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Classy epic. And we have Tectonic Improv as well.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Shout out to large chat.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tectonic Improv, who I have mentioned, once or twice on the show, specifically for being the guy,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,920
Well, he's got a YouTube channel and I've mentioned you because you did the

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,760
the PCP style lecture on

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,480
Linkart no on a top the fourth wall. Yeah, oh

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,520
I've seen like a bit of that. I keep thinking I'm gonna watch the whole thing, but I never get around to it

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,280
It's okay. Um, it's it's it's it's I kind of I kind of want to talk about that a little bit

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,040
Oh, yeah, I want to say it's a good. It's a good lecture. It's a good choice of topic for a lecture

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,120
and

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,800
Just I don't know. It's very it's very funny. I

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,720
I I knew I knew there was lore. I knew there was a top the fourth wall lore

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,680
But like I don't know just here hearing it described

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,520
Lynn in like a linear sequence of like this happened and therefore this happened and thus this happened is very very amusing it is

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,680
especially for

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,800
It feels like the perfect like lecture topic because it's yeah, it's very esoteric and

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Yes, just

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Like I was I

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,000
Was I used to watch Linkara like way back in the day when I was into like channel awesome and all that

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,520
So even back then I was like this is like kind of crazy. There it is. There it is the car running gift

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,960
I love this gift

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
Wait, I gotta I gotta see

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,200
Fuck I went to a different. I went to a different discord server. Why am I not looking at the right?

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,340
Okay, just go just go without me. Just forget about me Linkara's a funny

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,120
Gentleman he's he's interesting. It's not like on purpose. He's just yeah like that

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,800
He's I is he never funny on purpose? Um, well

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
He has moments I'd say

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Like me

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,800
He's like I watched a bit of his videos back when I was like a that guy with the glasses head

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,920
And I was on that site and I was like, oh, I love

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
reviews

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,240
But I wasn't that big into comics. So I love when someone will watch it. So I don't have

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,480
Yeah, I I recall Linkara being like less funny than Spoonie and

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,560
But he was like considered one of the big three. So I didn't watch really anyone below him on the on the hierarchy

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,560
Only the only the choice the cream of the crop the few the proud

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,720
Haven't seen any of his stuff. I mostly watched

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,760
Guy with the glasses or what did he call himself dog walker or something?

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,760
Stolic

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,880
Nostalgia critic I've seen you know, do you know who link? Do you know who Linkara is I?

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,360
Know a little bit about him, but I haven't seen any of his content

51
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,440
He talks like this and he reveals comics

52
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,600
Kind of the thing. I'm I

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,400
Like I never watched that guy with the glasses or any channel awesome stuff like in its heyday. I just like missed that entire

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,680
Content train good the the most Linkara ever at one point

55
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,480
I went on like a very short atop the fourth wall binge

56
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,640
I just one day I put it on play for a while and I watched some and I was like, okay

57
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,200
This is fine and then another time I watched his Power Rangers series

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:26,040
Which is really good actually I was very because I was a big Power Rangers kid and I was like hmm

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:33,320
I remember Rita Rita repulsa and I remember Lord Zed and then I remember there were some like

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,320
machine cog people after that and I like what happened after that and

61
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,880
Now I know there was one where they were all cars. I

62
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,600
In case you remember they I remember really liking that retrospective. I used to watch it a lot

63
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,880
Yeah, so did I think I was like I

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,560
Was the one thing I was similar like I had seen the Power Rangers the movie with the ooze with Ivan ooze

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,680
Fuck yeah, Ivan ooze. Yeah, I saw that movie too. There's like what it was easy. So good

66
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
It's so good

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,520
Yeah, didn't you go like big giant robot himself?

68
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,840
Vote mode and like he was bigger than the planet and then they killed him

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Yeah, that happened at the end

70
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
No, no Ivan ooze

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did that as well

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Kara becomes like

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,720
He would he would I think it was actually he was piloting like some robot from a comic he read

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,400
I think that's what happened. I don't know if there's any sort of any sort of giant Linkara

75
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Maybe there is cuz um

76
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,440
Cuz I finished I finished the lecture where there was like he was like halfway through a new saga

77
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,520
So I was like I won't cover. I won't bother covering that one

78
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,920
So maybe there is a giant Linkara. I admittedly I haven't watched

79
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,800
One can hold any sense. Yeah. Yeah, right. I mean fingers crossed. He's done pretty much everything else

80
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,760
It's it's been a while. It's been a while since I saw it. Does the lecture cover

81
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:12,440
Linkara lore that does it does it include um the the Vekai with the glasses like movies like too boldly flea and all that

82
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,280
I think I mentioned them

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,080
Uh

84
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,940
Like very are those cannon are those cannon to atop the fourth wall they kind of are

85
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,380
Sort of like they don't really matter in the main in the grand scheme of things. I think uh, I

86
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,640
Think to boldly flea has some has some connections to the main plotline because it like it

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:44,680
I think it's the cannon introduction or reintroduction of mechakara or something like like the point of to boldly flea and whatever the other

88
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:53,560
Movies are called the point of them is that they are like an avengers style like like meeting of all these characters together in one

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,200
Young it was cool. It was just legitimately cool. It was great. I dreamed of being part of I it's very funny

90
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,760
But I get it. I get the appeal completely. It's very of its time

91
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,200
I think um some of the things that like he has

92
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Before the avengers though, right well a little bit and just was in a comic form before that

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
surely oh

94
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,440
I guess that's true

95
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,880
But like I feel like cross when I when I say an avengers style

96
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,600
Avengers have been around for decades. I think

97
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:35,640
Okay, but more more people are familiar with the movie version and like or like the idea of like all of these internet

98
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
Like video people

99
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,240
Coming together to do something together was sort of what was on a little bit unheard of at the time

100
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,640
At least at the scale that channel awesome was doing it. So and that way it's kind of cool

101
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,680
It makes way more sense for someone like lincara who does have like

102
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,720
Storylines then it does for someone like I don't know Todd in the shadows. Yeah

103
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,840
I don't I don't know if it was like this back then but like he doesn't have any plot in his no

104
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,360
He never has no, okay. Well, that's very weird. Just like that's like, oh my god

105
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,960
a

106
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,040
Galactic like like villain has appeared like the universe is in peril. Oh, thank god Todd in the shadows

107
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,760
Thank you. Todd's gonna save the day. It was really like reviewers are the best heroes

108
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,520
Christ it was it was like the I've watched all of the the meet-up films

109
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,640
Including the first one where it's just they were in a hotel

110
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,240
Lobby room fighting each other and it was like nostalgia critic versus the angry video game nerd, which is like where it all

111
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,880
Spiralled out from because they had a few because they were big at the time

112
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,560
It was it was really just nostalgia critic trying to make himself more popular by attaching himself to the angry video game

113
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,000
node, which was

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a very smart move

115
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,280
Yeah, but like they had the first one was just a fight with everyone

116
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,360
Everyone just turned up. It's like who are you? I'm gonna beat you up and they just beat the shit out of each other

117
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,960
And it was very silly

118
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,800
The second one was like an attempt at actual like filmmaking

119
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,720
Uh, and it's laughable and it's it's kind of cute actually

120
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,480
um

121
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,640
There's a lot of funny stories of behind the scenes of these productions

122
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
That's like half the fun

123
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,920
But yeah, that one wasn't really like a super lore thing

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,760
It was just sort of like they understand that they are all part of that guy with the glasses

125
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,760
And the the joke is that nostalgia critic just says hey come over to this thing

126
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,400
He calls everyone and they're like why are we here? They just don't know they're just people

127
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,040
And they you know, some of them just happen to have super magic abilities or guns or whatever and they use they use their funny

128
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,880
reviewer gimmicks

129
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
in whatever happens

130
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
and then the third one

131
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,360
That was the the suburban nights, which is like a d&d thing in the suburbs

132
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,600
Wait, how many are there? There's this four

133
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Okay, the suburban nights, uh

134
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,640
It's the same sort of thing like nostalgia critic calls everyone say hey

135
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,480
It's gotta do this thing and they're like fine. I guess I'll be in your review movie

136
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
And then it's the fourth one

137
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,080
To boldly flee is uh space. They just do the thing. There's like

138
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,560
Lore wise

139
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,800
Lore wise it makes no sense and they address that I think and but you know

140
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,920
When they have characters in their own reviews that are recurring lakara, especially he brings them in for certain things

141
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,240
I think lincara out of all the reviewers

142
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,280
Probably works the best in these crossover movies because he's the one who leans the most in on lore like spoony sort of did it

143
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,320
But not really to the extent that lincara did

144
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,720
I think lincara just really likes doing the lore stuff and honestly, um

145
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,480
Uh, I I I ended up really kind of like respecting it in a way. I just kind of liking it because I mean it's it's dumb

146
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,160
Yeah, but it's also

147
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,400
It's it's also kind of fun like it's it comes through like watching the lecture

148
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,840
I I started kind of respecting it too like he's real like he's really dedicated to like

149
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,400
Something will catch his eye and something he reviews. He'll decide that it's cool. He'll he'll you know

150
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,720
Uh co-opt it and put it into his own version into his like persona universe

151
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Yeah, and then it will stay around and it will continue to get referenced like over and over again like for the rest of time

152
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
I and I think that's

153
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,800
I think that's kind of something that if like if anyone's like interested in making a lecture

154
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,320
I think you sort of have to in some degree respect or even like the thing you're covering

155
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,280
Because yeah, because if you come across if it comes across that you're like

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
you're you're not being

157
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,960
There's something lost if you like genuinely don't care or if you're or if you like dislike what you're talking about

158
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,480
Uh, yeah, like I had I had an idea

159
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,560
I I have ideas for like other lectures, but you know, there's like coven and all that crap

160
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,040
But um, but there was one idea I had in particular. Oh, yeah, I forgot about coven

161
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Everyone did everybody forgets about that

162
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,760
I I had this idea for a lecture where I would cover um, I'd cover the game over thinkers story

163
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,120
And which is really funny. I was gonna say I was gonna say devoo used to talk about that he

164
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,600
She was gonna devoo came out like this week lamel

165
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,680
Uh, devoo was gonna do

166
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,280
The uh the uh the game over thinker lore and she never did and I always wanted to because I thought just like lincar

167
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,080
I was like, that's a perfect. I yeah, that's a perfect topic for it

168
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,520
I would love to see a game over thinker lecture, but the problem with me doing something like that is I uh,

169
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,200
I I fucking hate movie bob and I don't I don't respect him in the slightest. So if I I

170
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,280
I think I think I could hate movie bob, but also

171
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,960
I don't know if like I think the game I'm not super familiar with the game over thinker

172
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,800
but my impression of it is that it is very stupid, but

173
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,960
I I do find it genuinely amusing like when I like for the wrong reasons, maybe

174
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,720
But yeah, because he genuinely likes them or liked them at least at the time he would defend them. I think

175
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Bob. Yeah, I mean bobber. Yeah

176
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Bob

177
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,920
He really would like he really thought he was making like high art here

178
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,040
He really thought he was like elevating like people would say like bob

179
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,720
I just I just want to watch you review like movies and games and stuff

180
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,360
Like I don't like these skits and he's like, oh, well if you don't like it that I'm sorry

181
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,320
You know, I'm doing this to elevate my fucking craft. You know, you just don't appreciate my work

182
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,160
My I'm do this for you and you these pearls before swine. How can you not like the dark game over thinker?

183
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,760
All right, it's the most

184
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
It's the most intricate plot and loan to man

185
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,400
There's a man frozen from the from the 90s and he's back and he's going to jump off a building

186
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,280
I just it's high art because he came up with it while high

187
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,760
exactly

188
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,160
I just love movie balls probably like a straight edge. Oh, I was I was gonna say Bob would never do drugs. That's like

189
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,720
because

190
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,480
God

191
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,680
Did you I this week? I've been seeing that his old tweet floating around that's like that's like

192
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I was supposed to be on a starship

193
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,800
Conversing with sentient robots and uploading my consciousness

194
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Into a fucking robot body. I'll never forgive. I'll never forgive the people that took that future from me

195
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,040
I love it when when Bob accident accidentally

196
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,360
Just uh just inadvertently wants like eugenics and talks about it online. I think it's really funny

197
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,680
You know, it's it's it happens. He's not the only one that occasionally slips into it. But yeah

198
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,680
He does

199
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry give. I think I cut you off earlier. What were you saying?

200
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,080
Yeah, I was just gonna say like the the stuff with linkara and and

201
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,400
movie bob and and all of these that guy with the glasses era like

202
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,160
Terrible like awful but like sort of endearing

203
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,560
Um attempts at making you know, they review things and they try to make them the things themselves in a way

204
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,760
And they always suck in the in the in this sort of style

205
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,080
And it's just it gives me the same vibes as sonichu. But in in a way that I you know, I like sonichu

206
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,440
I kind of admire game over thinker is very sonichu

207
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,840
It's it's how it's like it's so bad

208
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,720
But the fact that they care about it and work really hard to make it. It's just sort of nice and I just kind of like it

209
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,600
Link link like ironically cars. I think link cars is a little bit more like

210
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
It's more high after I'd say

211
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,640
Especially later on I would say link cars is it's a little it's more high effort

212
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,840
But also I get the and this is it's amazing to say this about linkara

213
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,920
But I genuinely think linkara is a little more self-aware that like what he's doing is like silly than bob is

214
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,640
I think I think so too imagine come across too much to like uh onlookers on linkara and his persona

215
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,120
But I do I do think like I mean he actually commented on my lecture

216
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,320
Like really? Yeah, I think I saw that. Yeah, I pinned it back when he watched it

217
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,960
And it's just uh, he's like talking or he just like quotes the video

218
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
uh, we're like people just

219
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,280
All right, I think one of one of the uh, one of the people who was in the audience for the lecture

220
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,640
It was just like shocked at the fact that I had been talking for I think like

221
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,160
20 minutes and we were only at like the first part of the story

222
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,160
Yeah, I I think I I think I should probably talk about this because um

223
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,200
Because uh, I I've noticed like a lot of comments about this lecture

224
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,120
Whenever whenever people talk about it

225
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,040
And I think you per you were probably gonna bring this up to ben about how like the audience

226
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Probably kind of wasn't really into it

227
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,960
I was gonna mention it

228
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:58,200
I could I can tell that like you you shanghide some of your friends into sitting down for this thing

229
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,000
And they did it and you got them to agree to it and a couple of them were maybe like not

230
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,480
Actually prepared. Yeah, and I so like I

231
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,000
I told them I told them ahead of time like hey

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,200
Do you can you guys help me out with this like this like lecture idea?

233
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,640
I have where I'm going to like explain this stuff in front of like a camera for whatever

234
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,600
And uh, I I think I gave them your sonichu lecture and like this is what it's kind of gonna be like

235
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,520
and uh, I

236
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,960
You know, maybe they didn't watch it

237
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,480
But also on the other hand like I I made them sit down for two and a half hours to talk about something

238
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,480
They don't they don't fucking care. They don't care about we cara. So like

239
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I I feel I feel kind of bad

240
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,800
Um, I don't because because I see people in the comment section sort of sort of like blame my friends too much

241
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,400
And and I I gotta you know, I gotta play defense because you know, they're my friends, but

242
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
Yeah, I mean

243
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,840
I yeah, like I I get it

244
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I get I get how

245
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a little annoying that some of them seem to be kind of not some of them some of them seem to get a little annoyed

246
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,280
But yeah, I can understand like thinking about how you set up an event like this

247
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
I can understand how it comes

248
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Or to this I don't know

249
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,520
It's it's kind of just funny like when you and that one guy sort of like get pissed at each other

250
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,880
It's just pretty funny actually. It's like oh, oh, what's this? Oh, what's gonna happen? Oh, it's okay. Oh, it's okay

251
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,200
It's okay. Well, I I appreciate that at least someone likes likes what the the emergent narrative

252
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,760
Of the lecture. That's how I that's how I see it. Uh, I

253
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
You gotta do a lecture about this that

254
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,680
Oh man, uh, uh, one of my friends feels really bad about uh about how the lecture came out

255
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,480
And I always have to tell him that it's like it's fine. It's not a big deal

256
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,480
Yeah, it's not that big. It's not it's really not and like I would I would love to do to do another one with them

257
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,360
And I I think I think they'd be a lot more behaved

258
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,600
That's how that's how you do it because now you've um, you know, you've broken their will. Mm true

259
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,680
Now now they'll be docile. They know what they're in for and uh

260
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,680
No, hopefully they'll be more behaved next time

261
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:19,160
I had another question. I know the youtube question for you. Did you're um you the the fucking um, oh god

262
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,360
The dx video game man

263
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Oh, oh, oh that come back that that's the other that was the second videos of yours. I saw and I liked it

264
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
um, all right, so uh

265
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,120
To anyone unaware which I assume is both give gamers tavern and most of the people watching this, uh, I uh want to like

266
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
I started making videos back in

267
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,760
2017 I think and um one of the first ever videos I did was uh, it was like a

268
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,360
A recommendation video for this this japanese television show called game center cx

269
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,880
I heard of that which which is uh, uh, I think

270
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,400
I think most people would probably be familiar as the source of the his smile and optimism gone

271
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,720
Yeah, it's it the premise of the show is that this this uh,

272
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,520
Japanese like comedian plays retro video games and tries to beat them in like a day

273
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
And uh, you know like comedy

274
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,800
Comes out of these situations. He has to like help

275
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,840
Yeah, he has to get like his like producers or directors to like help him out in certain sections

276
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,760
It's a really good show and uh, I wanted to make a youtube video kind of just like recommending it to people

277
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,480
As a recommendation video, it was good because it really did make me want to watch the series

278
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,600
But I never actually did that the so I guess it wasn't good enough

279
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,920
It it it's fine because it's kind of hard to find online at least nowadays

280
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,840
I believe the the guy's name is arino or something arino. Yeah, uh shinya arino

281
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Yeah, I've seen a lot of his stuff

282
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,400
He's pretty good pretty cool. He's really great. I I love the show a lot and um

283
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,080
the

284
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,000
The basic idea of the video was that like I pretty much give a rundown of the plot

285
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,040
Of of the show why I like it and I gave a bunch of like recommendations for

286
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,400
Several episodes if that video sounds cool and you wanted to watch it

287
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm sorry, but

288
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
It got taken down like a month ago

289
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:21,160
On uh, it it got copyright striked by uh by the people who own game center cx because you know, I

290
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,680
Use footage from the show in the video and like I I can't really be too

291
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,840
Like surprised about it. I'm disappointed obviously, but like

292
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:38,200
Back in like 2014 or 15 or so like uh, the rights the rights owners. I think fuji tv

293
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,880
They started they started going like really draconian on game center cx on youtube

294
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,000
so

295
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,320
It was only a matter of time before it uh, it got struck it got struck

296
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,280
And I think the reason why it got struck now of all times is I recently passed like a thousand subscribers

297
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
So I got monetization on my videos

298
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,960
So I that that might have that might have uh tipped them off

299
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,280
The you you attract you drew the eye of sorrow. It's yeah

300
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,520
We know how it is uh fair use doesn't exist on youtube it exists only in the courts

301
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,760
Yeah, well what what sucks even harder about it is uh

302
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,960
Is I also got copyright struck for uh for this like amv I did a few months ago around the same time

303
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,480
I I got monetization obviously I didn't monetize that video but

304
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
So I have two strikes on my channel

305
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,480
And uh, if I make another oopsie within I think the next like 10 days, uh, my channel's gone

306
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh, that's not good. Yeah, uh, so I'll have to be a little more careful. It's it's not it's not that bad

307
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm more just disappointed that um

308
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,480
I wasn't really that disappointed when the amv got taken down because you know

309
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,240
It was really more of an like an indulgent side project

310
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,920
But I was really sad when the game center video got taken down because that was like that was like one of my first videos

311
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,320
Where I was like, yeah, I really like this and it was one of the

312
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,280
It was one of my only videos that uh from early on that isn't like

313
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
based off of other people's work that is

314
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
That that that did good

315
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,920
In like the yeah, I saw I saw you tweet that it was down and I was like, oh fuck

316
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,400
I remember liking that video and uh, just I don't know. It's damn shame

317
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,040
I'll have to find some other way to like upload it, but whatever. Yeah an archive. It's somehow. Yeah, it's still on my computer

318
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,760
You know, it's uh, I played actually a game based on the game center

319
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,760
Dx show back in 2009 for the ds retro game challenge. Yeah

320
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, yeah, I've actually never played that game, but I heard yeah, I've heard it's great

321
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,600
Uh, I have a review on it on my website actually

322
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I'll have to read that I published a view. What did you give it? Um, I don't remember. I think like an 80%

323
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,400
or something. All right, respectable. Yeah, respectable. Yeah, I published a review back. Um

324
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,280
Uh, I published a review actually back when I played it in 2009

325
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,920
damn

326
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,560
I forget how I always forget that like you've been doing this for a really long time gamers 7

327
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,200
Like yeah, for some reason I've been doing it for too long

328
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Sometimes I feel like I've been doing this for too long

329
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,040
So coming coming up close to the 20 year anniversary

330

349
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,560
by the uh, so I have been

350
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,720
um

351
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,280
Past month past few weeks helping my brother to clear out his room

352
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,680
Uh, because it is I know about this because I listen to the money spenders podcast. Yeah, the money

353
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
com slash give and take

354
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,960
Give and take the money spenders podcast the only place where you should spend your money

355
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,680
Um, it's a great place to do that if you're looking for somewhere

356
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,120
uh, but uh

357
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,840
Yeah, I've been helping him clear out all of the junk

358
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,080
We've been going through all of the shelves and things and like holding them up to his face

359
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,760
Like do you care about this? Is this important to you? It's like, uh, I guess I don't know

360
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,560
Bags bags upon bags of trash. It's great

361
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,080
It's really satisfying to see it being clean and he's obviously happy that he can move around in there

362
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
And then I was looking at my room and I was like

363
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,880
I gotta do the same thing to my room. Even though it's not as bad

364
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,560
It's still like there's there's shelves of books here that I've never read

365
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,280
And I always say to myself, I'll read these

366
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,520
And I was thinking how do I gamify because I'm like I'm stupid like I like I can't do things unless there's a video game

367
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Involved need to have achievements

368
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,160
Yeah, I need I need like to gamify reading all these books

369
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,200
And so that I can get rid of them and have shelf space to put more video games

370
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Or something stupid like that

371
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
And I was thinking what if what if I like

372
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,840
first of all

373
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Because I I like listing things

374
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,360
I was thinking of like making an itinerary of everything I have

375
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,240
And then doing like a list and being like, all right, let's

376
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:27,160
100 percent complete these books by reading them and then I don't know rating them on a youtube video saying

377
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,760
This book sucked. This book was good. And then throwing them away. Finally after all these years

378
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
I can get rid of these this trash

379
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
You can uh, don't eat garbage

380
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,560
Can't you burn the books?

381
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,800
I do when I get rid of them. I donated like charity shop thing to the trash that is

382
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,440
Yeah, don't make them back to the earth. My scuttle read too

383
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Um, so I throw them in the in a in a pit. Have you have you done any book reading? No

384
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,360
Okay, look, look, she's only introduced the concept. She she still needs to she still needs to work on the execution. It's fine

385
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,880
I have I have I have a certain I have a gripe

386
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,600
I have something you know what really grinds my gears what really grinds my gears

387
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Stop me if I've said this on the show before

388
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,760
Um, but fucking fucking uh last year for christmas

389
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,200
I gave uh the conquest of bread by kropotkin to my sister

390
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,680
My brother to my to my brother nate and to nate's girlfriend michelle. I heard about this from michelle

391
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,960
And yeah, good and michelle. Well, you heard about it from her. Uh, yeah, I think so on like your twitter or something

392
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, um no clue

393
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:49,240
And she maybe in the discord uh she she and she said she was gonna read 50 books this year

394
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,600
And she's like she she's like almost there. She's read like 40 something books. It's almost the end of the year

395
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,840
48 and she has not read

396
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,640
She's read 50 books. She has not read the book that I gave her the conquest of bread. It's literally like 100 pages

397
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,880
It's like shorter than a fucking animorphs book

398
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,240
She has not read it

399
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:14,520
But she keeps posting the book she's read and every single book she's read is some stupid self-help book about how cleaning your room

400
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,400
Will make you happier. That's every single fucking book

401
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,000
How many how many books do you need to read that tell you to clean your room?

402
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,040
Just fucking do it or don't we're all those books written by jordan peterson

403
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,920
No, she reads the girl version Marie condo

404
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,160
Marie condo, I mean, I've heard those are youtuber. I was watching and he cited that as like, oh, it's a really good book

405
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,560
I'm sure it's a great book. I'm sure it's a great. He disseminated all the information in that book into one sentence

406
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
So now I don't have to read it. He said

407
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,400
In the book they say look it around to your room and

408
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,520
See if what you have sparks joy and if it doesn't spark joy, consider getting rid of things

409
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Consider fucking get ending it all

410
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,040
What if like I was like looking and owning things just makes me feel good

411
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,880
I love

412
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,080
Looking at things like I have a bunch of shit in my room. You're like a dwarf. Well, yeah

413
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,760
You're like a dwarf who gets happy when they observe a masterwork craft

414
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,320
When they see when they see like a nice like a really like nice like artifact like great in the floor with like

415
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:32,040
With like engraving. It's like masterwork quality with like engravings of carrots on it. You go. Ah, yes, the neurons are firing

416
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Um, fuck you michel

417
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Don't

418
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
At least she's doing it despite you

419
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,720
Uh

420
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,320
Just fucking bread books a good book. It's a good book. I it's short. It's digestible

421
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,240
I used to have I used to have a problem where like my room would be

422
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,560
hopelessly messy

423
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,840
And I don't know what happened, but just like one day I was like, I'm gonna clean my room

424
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,640
This is way before jordan pierced and by the way before he was even born and uh, I just spent

425
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
I spent the day I spent the day cleaning

426
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,080
You were the original jordan. I really was I really was I spent the day cleaning my room and it looked I mean it looked

427
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,000
Decent it looked fine. It looked fine enough. There were there were places to walk around

428
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,200
There wasn't clothes strung along the floor and like ever since I've never really had a problem with having a dirty room

429
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,440
It's not yeah, it's not in the best shape right now, but it's you know, it's presentable. I guess maybe

430
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,840
I have um

431
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,480
Because I just I basically just finished up um all the um all my kickstarter stuff

432
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,920
I had all these boxes all around my room is pretty small and I had like half of it just taken up with like

433
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,680
Boxes and like packing materials and like piles of envelopes and piles of books and stuff

434
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,080
And I I have only just like like yesterday on the day before I like

435
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,200
You know packed all that shit up and like put it in put it in in the closet and stuff

436
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,400
And like put it in a stack and put it like behind my my little like side room curtain or whatever and uh

437
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
It actually doesn't feel much different

438
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,400
um

439
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,680
Uh

440
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,120
I don't know i'm i'm

441
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,680
I feel like it felt like it was all cluttered

442
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,160
And so I put everything away and honestly it doesn't feel that much less cluttered and i'm a little disappointed frankly

443
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,520
The change I didn't the change wasn't drastic enough

444
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,120
It wasn't drastic enough

445
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,880
It wasn't like because I I was keeping a lot of it under my my like table

446
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,800
so

447
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,000
Like you know, it wasn't like space that I was losing

448
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,560
Yeah

449
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,600
Now the now the space under my table is just empty and it's just wasted. So like whatever

450
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,760
I don't know. I thought it was gonna be like, uh, I'm gonna feel so much mental clarity after like I remove all this clutter

451
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
and I put it away and

452
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh, no, my mind is still cluttered

453
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,040
Fuck you can organize your room, but you can't organize your mind

454
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,920
What do you mean do I live in a triangle then you have like a like a triangle room is really small from what I've seen

455
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
A triangle room

456
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
The ceiling is slanted, isn't it?

457
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Oh, um on one side it is. Yeah, I used to have one of those kind of rooms

458
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,920
They have like a name for them. It's like something about it's like it's not like an attic room, but it's

459
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,680
My room is not my room is not a bedroom

460
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,760
It is um

461
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,200
It is it is technically like a side. Although it's not although it's not much smaller than the bedrooms

462
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,640
Um by floor space, but I guess in terms of sheer volume

463
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,120
It is smaller because it does have the the slanted roof. I think it just sort of makes it feel

464
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,800
Basically, I haven't been there, but in video. I've seen

465
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,040
That one video where it's like it feels claustrophobic, but I don't know

466
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,960
I think there's like a zoning thing where where like a bedroom

467
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,640
Can only be considered a bedroom if it's like something square feet and has like a window

468
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Your room has a window, right?

469
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,280
My room actually has very nice windows. My room it has

470
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,240
It's it's about the same size as the as like the regular bedrooms in terms of floor space

471
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,480
It's it's missing volume because it's got the slanted roof. It's got like a half closet like a low half closet

472
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,400
Um that you that is only like up to like my my chest height

473
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:24,280
Um and that's next to my bed and then it's actually got it's got a little side alcove that I have some bookshelves in

474
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:30,440
And I have a hanger bar between the two ends like between the two walls of this little like side alcove

475
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,000
The alcove also has a little slanted roof and I have a nice piece of modern art

476
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,720
Uh, uh nailed to the the slanted like like half roof up there. Oh, what's it's name? I?

477
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,360
I it's nameless uncultured. It's it's it's but it's but it's an original. It's an original

478
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,240
Your room is uh your room is missing volume like a lost book

479
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,640
You know lost volume. Oh got it. I thought you were gonna go

480
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,280
Sound decibels. Um wait. I gotta finish but then the alcove

481
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,920
I have my little hanger bar and I have my I have like sweaters and jackets hanging on that

482
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,400
And it makes like a nice little curtain to sort of cordon off that little alcove. It's really nice

483
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,960
It's really I planned it out so beautifully and the behind that I have bookshelves and then on the wall

484
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,160
I don't just have one window. I have the nicest windows in the whole house

485
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,200
I have a big like three window thing

486
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,440
I have one huge window that like takes up half the wall and then I have two little windows to the sides of it

487
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,760
My like front wall is like all window. It's like mwah. Mwah

488
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,760
And then because I need to sleep until like 6 p.m

489
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,120
And go to bed at like 10 a.m. Every day

490
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,560
I just have all I have them all blackout curtain. I have like stuff like

491
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,240
Hanging up over the window so I can't see out of them and no light gets in

492
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,160
It's a very economical setup. It really makes a whole lot of sense. I had um, I had blackout curtains for a bit

493
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,440
They were pretty cool, but I didn't really have much need for them

494
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,880
I didn't have them for a while because I was on like a reasonable sleep schedule

495
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,360
But then like a month or two ago, uh that

496
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,960
Changed and now I need the blackout curtains again lemau

497
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,280
Well, my room is pretty organized

498
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
uh at all times

499
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,760
Kind of a bit of a neat boy neat freak

500
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,680
Really, I just imagined gamer's tavern's room kind of looks like how ridin's room is described in middle gear solid 2

501
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,440
It's just the bed and the desk nothing else. Yeah, that's pretty much it

502
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,080
It's um empty and sterile just like my soul

503
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,200
Spartan

504
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,040
Yeah, I mean

505
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,800
You don't have you don't have the vice the vice of possession holding you

506
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,360
You don't you don't feel the need to have things in your room to fill the void in your heart. You just have puns

507
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,360
Well, I used to uh own a lot of uh video games, but a couple years back

508
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,560
I sold I think over 300 or 400 games

509
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,840
So that really freed up a lot of space on this

510
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,040
I I just hate the idea of games being sold. I don't I don't know why I even if they're selling anything

511
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
I I hate when I'm getting real stuff

512
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,440
when I was fucking um when I was like uh

513
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,800
In high school or something or maybe earlier. I don't remember. I think I was trying to get money

514
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,400
Me and Nate were trying to get money for a I think was for a playstation 2

515
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,600
Oh, yeah, and so we sold and so we sold a bunch of our old nes games

516
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,320
We sold them to gamestop and gamestop gave us like the worst fucking price for them

517
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,040
Like admittedly a lot of them are genuinely just worthless

518
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,240
But we had an original nes copy of kid Icarus

519
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,120
That actually is kind of rare and like actually we should have actually gotten like a bit of I think they give us like eight bucks for

520
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,080
Yeah, you should never uh sell anything to gamestop. That's a complete waste of money. Yeah less than learned

521
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah, less than learned that like around the time the playstation 2 was new was also like the

522
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,040
Probably like the time when like nes and super nintendo games were probably at like their lowest value

523
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
No one gave a shit about them until like

524
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,400
Well, um, uh, probably around the time that video game reviewers started popping up on youtube

525
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,040
It was that really was that before that was a thing. I don't yeah, I think I

526
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,800
I know that um, they contributed to the games now are quite uh quite pricey. Yeah

527
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,640
Let me see what it what it would cost now kid

528
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Icarus nes

529
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,400
Nes games actually are not too expensive now, but for some reason super nintendo games have gone up a lot

530
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Well, they're it's the best console. So

531
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,280
Of course, yeah, I agree

532
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,520
PS2 is the best one because I I'll concede I'll concede the ps2. In fact, you know what um here

533
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,320
I'm going to shill a friend of mine's channel

534
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,840
uh

535
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,800
Who the who is reviewing every playstation 2 game known to man

536
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,400
Oh, is it um, is it no? Yeah, it's no no

537
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Yeah, no toxicity

538
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:11,400
Another friend of the show we all I I you you and uh, and and uh him or both

539
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,760
I I mostly know you from my discord. Yeah, we're you guys are long time

540
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,800
Uh hangers out in there. We're from we're from way back the from from the way way back the dark ages

541
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,120
Uh

542
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,880
Yes, and I I saw he just passed like a thousand subs too. He did I'm I'm really happy for him because and like

543
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,640
I have a feeling reps to gog is like very close to to kind of blowing up in a way because the concept of the channel

544
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,560
What does it stand for? We review every ps2 game. Oh god

545
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,480
Okay, it's I've seen that and recommend it. I'm surprised. It's only like a thousand subs

546
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,600
It's he he only started it like um, like

547
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,520
Maybe

548
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,280
Six months or so ago

549
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,320
It's it's going it's going to blow up because the concept is so

550
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,560
It's just so like as an idea for a channel. It's only a matter of time. I was like, oh cool

551
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,240
I I would definitely want to get around to that. I assumed it was already a big channel

552
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,120
Just because I I don't get recommended small channels usually

553
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,840
It's it's really funny how the how the idea for like reps to gog started because me null and

554
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,440
A couple of other friends were just in a discord call it for in the morning

555
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,600
I don't remember who it was who brought it up

556
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,120
But like someone was like what if what if we made like a youtube channel where we reviewed every single playstation 2 game

557
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,800
And of course it was like 4 a.m. So we're like, oh, this is there must be like race idea ever

558
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,440
There must be like a thousand games on the playstation 2. It'll be quite an honor taking

559
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,320
I think it has the most besides maybe the we yeah

560
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
That's that's part of the appeal

561
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
I think the other thing is

562
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,680
It would literally go on for like 10 years

563
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,280
If you did one every week, I think I think he did the calculations where like he would be finished with him in like

564
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,840
In like over 70 years if he did a video

565
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,800
Yeah, because a lot of these games are like uh 50 hour rpgs

566
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,080
Yep

567
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,680
Yeah, he just he just recently finished a video of a um

568
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Of like a tactical rpg

569
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,840
And I think I think it's his best video he's made so far

570
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,080
So if you're interested then yeah, check out his uh his review of eternal poison

571
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:26,760
Eternal poison. Yeah, I'm surprised I've never heard of that because tactical rpgs were my favorite genre back in the p2 era

572
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,920
It was like a it was like a late release. I think it came out in like 2006 or seven

573
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,480
Okay

574
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,440
Hmm

575
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,640
neat

576
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,760
Yeah

577
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,400
Yeah, continuing on the idea of like 100 completing my shelf

578
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,320
I have

579
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,960
Had a like list of every game that I could conceivably play at any time

580
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,960
Uh, which is like all the games I physically own all the games that are downloaded on my ps3 and ps4

581
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,200
All the games in my steam and epic games libraries and all that

582
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,880
And I'm like sometimes I just go to that list and I look at all of the things I've I've like

583
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:11,000
Organized it so that I can search by release date and and stuff like that and I've always wanted to like

584
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,320
Complete all of them just because it sucks to have things purchased and never played and never done anything with even if

585
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,560
They suck and I would not like them. I just want to say I did play them. You need to get blood out of that stone

586
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Yeah, I feel the same way

587
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,640
A few years ago. I started an account on backloggery. I think it's backloggery dot something

588
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,120
Uh, so I've been keeping track of everything I've finished and need to finish on on that site

589
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,520
And it's pretty useful to that end

590
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,760
Yeah, like making reviews is a good like I

591
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,200
It's a very good concept that we review every ps2 game because it's just like a very good, you know

592
00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:00,760
Excuse to to play a lot of ps2 games that you would have never given a second thought like I'll get around to that like 40 years later

593
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,280
Yeah, it's turn to dust and you've also turned to dust

594
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,040
So it's like it does seem a little bit unrealistic though. Um

595
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,080
Yeah, the the iconography of the channel is supposed to be like sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill

596
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,680
Yeah, so so like in that very clever

597
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
I I think you're

598
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,080
The at the point the idea of the channel at least for for for my for my lens is that uh

599
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,760
Is that it's like you everyone is aware that this is like

600
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,080
Impossible, but you want to see how far it can go anyway, you know

601
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,760
Hmm

602
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,280
I mean the the right thing to do if you wanted to actually complete it would be to have like a team and

603
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,840
Certain people only play and review certain games and you would have that's that's kind of how this started

604
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,200
Was uh, you had a crowd source it because I because me and a couple of other friends were

605
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,280
were uh

606
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,160
We're supposed to also do reviews in fact if you go like early

607
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,080
Early into the channel's life you can see that there's a couple of other

608
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Other people reviewing the games like I I made a review on Unreal Tournament for the ps2 on there

609
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,400
Uh, and I think I also reviewed a this game orphan scion of sorcery

610
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,760
Yeah, I played that I know that one. It's not good

611
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,520
Yeah, that's uh, that was one of the first ones I got for the ps2. It was yeah, it was a launch title

612
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:25,960
um

613
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,520
So and like that was that was the idea that like we all we all pitch in and make like reviews

614
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,000
It's like a collective thing, but like, you know

615
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,040
We just kind of all sort of fell off except for null, you know, god bless him. He's the only one who's really kept the torch alive

616
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,840
I I just kind of wanted to focus more on on like the main channel stuff

617
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,480
but um, yeah, I

618
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,320
I'm definitely open to making more for his channel because

619
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,840
Because I like the I like the concept so much and I would love to write his coattails when he gets popular

620
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:04,200
Haha, that's how you do it. I think somebody has already done this idea for NES games, uh, probably

621
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,880
Which is a lot more doable. I think it was devoo. It was devoo

622
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,840
She was um, she had the idea to to let's play to let's play every NES game

623
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:20,200
And then they they had a few episodes where they did let's play is what back when let's plays were a thing everyone was doing

624
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,680
Remember let's play and she would have she had like a big master file of every NES game

625
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,960
And she would just play one for like five minutes and be like, okay got it next one

626
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,640
Okay, this sucks or this is fine. Uh, but I get it. Yeah, and it's like per per episode

627
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,480
There was like, I don't know three or four they would do because like devoo actually wanted to like

628
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,560
structure

629
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,000
She wanted to structure it in a in such a way that it could actually be feasibly

630
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Completable, but I don't think they got very far

631
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,240
Um, even though they were only doing a few minutes on each game

632
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,880
Well, there is a there is a let's play. I've been watching brother. I remember like

633
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,160
I think I remember that devoo's brother was really annoying

634
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:05,880
Or maybe wasn't her brother. Someone was really annoying and would like yell and I found it very off-putting

635
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,440
Is that the brother that like broke a hole in her door one night or something?

636
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,240
I don't know that story, but maybe I remember I remember her talking about it on the pcp a long time ago

637
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:23,320
Oh nest quest nest quest was what those were called and someone would yell and I hated them

638
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,760
We need a reboot player late

639
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,120
Well, uh, there was a there's a let's play. I've been following for over 10 years now named zeta plays

640
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,680
And uh, he's been trying to play every single uh, super nintendo nes and genesis game

641
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,480
ever made

642
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,120
How far he's been doing it for a while

643
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,520
I think he has around 10 000 subscribers now. That's cool

644
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,480
The lifelong endeavor there's there's this other guy who who makes um

645
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,920
Who who makes like uh retrospective videos his name's uh, jeremy perish

646
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,240
He he's oh, yeah, I know him. Yeah, he has this uh

647
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,240
He has these retrospectives called like nes works gameboy works and all that stuff and like the point of them is to

648
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:16,120
Chronicle every single game and he he has he has like a lot of production value behind him because uh, he's like one of the

649
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,520
One of the guys behind like retronauts

650
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,560
Uh, he used to work. I think he used to work for one up. He did. Yeah or something, right?

651
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,520
Yeah, so he's he's like he's like legit site

652
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,280
And he's done he's done like all sorts of other

653
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,160
Retrospectives like he he has covered every single virtual boy game

654
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,040
Like he just spent like a year doing all the virtual boy games, which admittedly it isn't much, but

655
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,880
It's uh, it's still they're great videos. I'd recommend it. I I did the the same thing on my website

656
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,920
I reviewed every single virtual boy game one year

657
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,560
Oh, yeah

658
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,560
Yeah, even like the japanese only ones

659
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,680
Yeah, and I also reviewed some of the prototypes that were never officially released. Oh, yeah

660
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,400
That's the virtual boy is like weird because

661
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,000
It's

662
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,920
Wait, wait, wait. I okay. I swear. I've seen a video from like the the gaming historian

663
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,600
And I think he went over every virtual boy game and there's like eight of them

664
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,120
Uh, they're am I am I crazy? I think there's like 20 something, but there there really isn't a lot

665
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,240
Yeah, I think there's around 16 to 20 something

666
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
probably around that much

667
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,280
It's you know, it's not as impressive as reviewing every ps2 game, but you know a lot of these virtual boy games aren't that great and

668
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,720
Yeah, that's that's the entire reason why I reviewed all of them because I figured there's not that many of them

669
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,280
Might as well just do them all. Yep. Yeah

670
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,760
For all the like people that still own a virtual boy

671
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,320
Yeah, why is why is completing things so fucking satisfying? It just feels so fucking good. It's on our bones

672
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,680
Even if it would never happen the idea of somebody cataloguing all video games like there's too many

673
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,320
There's too many of any one console for one person to play in a reasonable amount of time

674
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,160
And then also talk about them. But the idea is just so tantalizing

675
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,960
I I love it. I want to do it all the time

676
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,360
I think part of it is the is like the idea that like

677
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,560
Uh, like for the viewers like

678
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,280
Oh, eventually

679
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,160
He will review or they will review the game. I like and I can't wait for that

680
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,960
And whereas like the person

681
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,600
Making them or or whatever

682
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,440
They it's just it's just a good way to have like

683
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,680
A structured channel and like a body of work, right?

684
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,120
Yeah, it gives you plenty of content. Yeah

685
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,840
but um

686
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:50,920
You know yms your movie sucks. Yeah. Yeah, I know him he he does those the videos of like best movies of x year

687
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,320
And his gimmick is that he watches every single movie that came out in that year, which is why they're so late

688
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,480
And they come out years after

689
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,480
They come out like yeah like years late and that's crazy like that gimmick is why I really am

690
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,440
Hype for those even though I don't care about

691
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,200
Basically everything he talks about right movies. I don't care about all of the art house films

692
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:20,040
It's nice to know it's just nice to know that he has watched everything from that year and this is his favorite

693
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,480
I think I find yms's taste in movies a little dumb

694
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,600
Honestly, I don't know if I really agree with

695
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,680
Like some things that I that I like but there are definitely some movies that he likes that I think are stupid

696
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,840
Have have you ever?

697
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:41,480
Uh, jeez. I'm gonna open a can of worms with this. I can tell uh, have you ever seen anomaliesa?

698
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,960
Have not it's it was a um, it's like a

699
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,080
It's like a stop motion. I think stop motion like puppet movie by a is it

700
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,520
Yeah, who's it by uh, uh charlie kaufman. I think

701
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,520
Okay, or and it's it's also written by like one of the guys who did moral oral and um

702
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,360
Yeah, that's like one that's like one of yms's movies like favorite movies ever and I knew this

703
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And I was recommended it like I think last month or so to watch it and I watched it and I was like

704
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,000
I I could like kind of see why people like it

705
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,080
But it it definitely was like

706
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,600
Not for me and I feel like that's the case for a lot of a lot of adam's tastes

707
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:33,560
Yeah, but it's like but I respect it. You know despite despite not having the same movie taste or even caring so much about movies that

708
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,880
It's the completionist aspect that really gets me interested like knowing the fact that he has seen

709
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,920
Every single movie it kind of puts it kind of puts the list up on a pedestal, right?

710
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,600
Like even if you don't agree with this, it's an interesting idea

711
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,320
But kind of crazy

712
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,040
Yeah, I kind of wanted to do the same thing for like

713
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,320
um

714
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,480
Like playing all of the games from a certain year or at least all of the ones from a certain year that I own already because I

715
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,000
That's too many games come out every year for that to even happen

716
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:12,040
Like the idea of it's less like I could I could do that like I play every game that I owned that was released before I was born

717
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,040
That could be a fun project

718
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,360
Yeah, that's cool. Just just something's like

719
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,680
It's like pointless. It's pointless and it doesn't mean anything because it's only

720
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,960
It's only for me to like check boxes and like I just is autistic

721
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,840
Well, if it makes you feel just you just described all human endeavor. Oh, no

722
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,480
It makes you feel good. Yeah, that's not that pointless

723
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,920
Do you do you like um, do you like the completionist? I say pointless to like I say pointless to like

724
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,200
um

725
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:48,760
To distance myself from from it so that I don't have to admit to anything. Yeah. Yeah, like so I don't have to admit to liking something

726
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:55,880
But yes, it's not like uh, like the um, what's his name? Gerard something the completionist Gerard

727
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,120
Khalil the completionist eyes. I have watched some of his videos

728
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,320
and I

729
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,280
just

730
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,280
I think there was something about him

731
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:15,160
He's very standard like game reviewer, you know, he he was his gimmick of completing a game 100%

732
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,280
I I've always felt like it wasn't

733
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,880
It was sort of false advertising. Yeah more of a marketing gimmick than it is an actual thing

734
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,040
He does because like technically completes the game

735
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:32,840
But what he says is basically a simple review about what is the game and what how it's good or bad

736
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:40,360
And he you know, it's just very standard. I wanted him to go into like how difficult it is to to complete the things

737
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:46,600
I don't know. It feels like he doesn't go into his gimmick enough like he he leans too closely into

738
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,600
like the standard game reviewer instead of being like

739
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,200
Like he I think he has like his own last I watched him anyway, which is a long time ago

740
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,600
He had this like his own this own like section just devoted to the completionist part

741
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,240
But then but that's like only a piece of the video the rest of the video is just a review and I think I think a channel

742
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:13,960
That uh that leans more into that completionist gimmick. It might not be as popular, but I think it's more compelling

743
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,600
It probably just does it for the marketing purposes. Yeah, yeah

744
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,120
Like an interesting gimmick

745
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,800
He seems like a cool guy like um, I remember a few years ago

746
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:29,640
like he used to have a partner that worked on videos with him and uh his partner like left

747
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,720
And he also like when he left he was like, yeah, you need to take down all of the videos I was in

748
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,600
Uh, because I don't want them on the channel anymore

749
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:44,920
And he was like and he like complied even though he really didn't have to because that's like that's such a stupid request to make

750
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,040
But like uh, I think his name was uh, was it greg?

751
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,920
Yeah, greg that was his name

752
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,360
It yeah, I heard about that. It was uh, kind of like another jauntron situation

753
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,120
It kind of was

754
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:03,400
And I might be misremembering things because this was a long time ago and I'm not like a huge completionist head

755
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:09,400
But uh, but that's at least it wasn't at least it wasn't a ronnie from uh game game theories situation

756
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,640
I don't even know who that is. I only know the guy who killed himself. Oh fuck. Okay

757
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,680
The original editor of game theory who killed himself. Yeah, my god

758
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,920
And he was and he was the guy who made um, oh he had his own series on the channel

759
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,480
uh

760
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,040
Side quest digressing and side questing

761
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,000
Uh, I never never knew about that one. You know, what was kind of sad about um

762
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,080
From my perspective any anyways what we said about uh, greg leaving the completionist is that

763
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:46,520
There weren't very many comments being sad about it. Most of them actually were like, uh, good. I'm glad he's gone

764
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,440
That's kind of why that's always kind of awkward. Why would they be glad he's gone because uh for some reason

765
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:59,320
It seems like um, a lot of the comments didn't like greg even when he was on the show and they were constantly complaining about him

766
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,760
Uh, so when he left a lot of people. Oh, so he was so he was kind of he was kind of the ben saint of the whole

767
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,400
Yeah, basically

768
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:12,840
Did he did he leave in in a huff or was it something else? Yeah, he left in a huff. There was a problem

769
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:20,920
He actually like I don't know the details of what happened, but uh, I think he was upset. He wasn't being paid enough or something

770
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I'm not sure

771
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,240
Yeah, again, I I I'm I don't know the details exactly

772
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,680
but uh

773
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,560
It's just a kind of situation and gerard really came out of it looking like the the bigger man

774
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,440
Yeah, but it's still kind of I still kind of feel bad for him because uh, you know

775
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,600
When john left when john left game grumps, everybody was really sad that he left

776
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:48,680
But when when this guy left the completionist, it seems like nobody cared or nobody was sad about it

777
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,640
That is kind of sad

778
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,880
Yeah

779
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,400
So the fact that nobody was sad actually kind of makes me sad about it

780
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,680
That just means yeah, I want you to be gamers tavern

781
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,520
Yeah

782
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,560
Oh, there's this guy more men like you this one guy

783
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:12,200
Similar to the completion. Well, not really similar to the completionist that I watched. Um called lord cat

784
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,520
Oh, yeah, okay. Wait, wait, wait

785
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:21,080
Okay, I know lord cat only from I had a chance the down the rabbit hole

786
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,400
About a spoonie. That's the only thing I know about it. I haven't watched that video

787
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,880
But he's he's a that guy with a glasses person

788
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:35,240
I don't know much about him personally, but his review show that he had was got a small dick and you're fucking afraid of it

789
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,440
Yeah, epic, um, I was gonna show

790
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,560
His show was called uh until we win

791
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,280
And it was strangely compelling. I don't think he was very popular

792
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,880
um

793
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,880
but his videos were like

794
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:58,840
He takes a really difficult game like battle toads or something some old nes game and he details

795
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,720
his his like

796
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:07,160
Struggle and strategy and eventual overcoming of obstacles to complete the nes game

797
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,120
No matter how difficult it is and we're gonna play it until we win and then like rock music plays

798
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:19,320
That's uh game center. That is kind of like game center. Yeah, it's basically the same idea. It's it's a good premise

799
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,200
Um, I I enjoyed that because it's a good premise if you're bad at games

800
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:31,320
Yeah, well, he was quite good at games as far as if you're a pro gamer then like what's even there's no there then that's like no gimmick at all

801
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,640
Like of course you'll win

802
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,240
The thing is that he would play like games that would stump other people and be like

803
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:44,440
Like like really annoying and no one would ever go through getting through this like pumpkin head

804
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,320
I think he played which is like this early pc or

805
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,040
or something 3d game that was

806
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:57,240
Had you know like a lot asked of the player in order to complete it, but he did it and it was like that's cool

807
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,200
That's what I wanted out of the completionist more of that sort of that hype moment, but it was very

808
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,800
Sort of clinical and uninteresting kind of milk test

809
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,680
Yeah, I think I think one of the reasons why false advertising

810
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:17,560
Yeah, I think one of the reasons why lord cat never really got that big is because like

811
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:24,280
He he has a break his personality is like really abrasive and you can tell just from like watching him for a short while

812
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,840
But it's not like it's not abrasive in like an endearing way like spoonies was

813
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:35,000
Mmm, we're like spoonie spoonie is like abrasive, but he's also pretty funny too

814
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,800
And so you can kind of like you can kind of like take it in stride, but like lord cat is

815
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,760
Lord cat almost feels like too mean in a way

816
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,000
Lord cat's a brute spoonie is like a witty witty snark. Yeah, he's like

817
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,480
Spoonie is he's like a loser. You're a loser

818
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:00,440
I'm sorry, that's the only that's that it's it's funny that you describe him as like being aggressive because the one thing

819
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:06,920
That I've ever heard of him is he's like on his furious rant about how much he hates spoonie. You and that idiot Joe

820
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,360
That's a coincidence

821
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,600
Uh

822
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:17,880
It's good stuff. Did just the ancient lore behind all that stuff

823
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Mm-hmm

824
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:28,200
Uh, what I guess is that it is that all we have to say about uh, what are we even talking about?

825
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,600
Uh, has anyone heard of the piss the pissed off video gamer? Does anybody know that guy? That's just sounds like

826
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,040
It's very generic. I think that might not is that a real person. Let me let me check

827
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:46,520
It's it's this incredibly obese guy that was like clearly inspired by the angry video game nerd

828
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,520
I think I've heard of this

829
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,520
And he is uh

830
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,160
I thought you were joking. I know the irate gamer

831
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,600
He's worse

832
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,880
Wow

833
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:04,040
Wait pissed off gamer is worse than the irate gamer. Yes. It's it's more of like a lol cow situation that it is like a

834
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,520
content creator

835
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,680
I think I think I've heard of this guy

836
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,440
I just always assume with stuff like this that that he's like

837
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,920
That it's like supposed supposed to be satire. Maybe that's

838
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,800
Maybe that's just me like protecting myself

839
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,760
but uh, maybe um

840
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,880
The thing with this guy, it's he's just kind of funny

841
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
um

842
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,480
He's made this this this this video about the the nintendo shitcruel

843
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,520
and uh

844
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,520
He's he basically

845
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,520
I don't want to be too mean

846
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,600
But he's breathing heavily and he clearly doesn't know how to speak very well

847
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,360
And the whole review is just him sort of like saying

848
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,080
the nintendo

849
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,160
shitcube

850
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,200
is

851
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,960
Not good

852
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,960
It sounds pretty sounds pretty good

853
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,600
It's it sounds like me. I I kind of love it. I kind of love listening to him

854
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,760
It kind of reminds me of uh francis trying to do like a bit

855
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,360
But it's it's hard to tell what is a bit and what is him

856
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,080
because I mean

857
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,080
He's not in the best way

858
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:21,480
Reminds me of uh, which is named boogie when he used to do those francis things. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but like actual

859
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,480
I think he still does that

860
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,640
Oh my god

861
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,640
Is this real is this real this guy? I think he is yes

862
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,760
Is this is being serious? Okay

863
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,560
This isn't even like that early

864
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,760
This looks like it would be from like 2007. Well, this is a real

865
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,760
This is a real. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So so like if it's that early on I'd

866
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,400
Not to say that satire wasn't invented until like 2010 or anything

867
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,720
But I I think back then there were a lot more people like genuinely trying stuff like this

868
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,920
Yeah, you should know that uh

869
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,600
Maddox invented satire in 97

870
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:07,000
Oh true true. I forgot about that. Did he I forgot. So I guess did he say that or something?

871
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,240
Yeah

872
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,160
This was him actually

873
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,720
Wow, you know, he lost a lot of weight and uh, yeah, good for him

874
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,400
I'm just what oh god. Oh god. Oh no, this is depressing

875
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,200
On the reason I call it the nintendo shit cube

876
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,520
is

877
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,260
That is a piece of fucking shit

878
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,840
It's pretty good

879
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,760
He's telling like it

880
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,800
You should just make like a like a parody of this video

881
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,080
No, no

882
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,960
I can't do it. Not nearly as good as other people. Well, first you have to get really fat

883
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,800
I I yeah, I gotta pack on the pounds. I just buy a fat suit

884
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,960
Commit no, no, no, you gotta be you gotta be uh authentic

885
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,040
Method act as the pissed off video that's called production value

886
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,960
I gotta get a really shitty camera. I gotta get a terrible mic

887
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,120
Hmm

888
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:18,280
The scour the all of it daniel dameron. I gotta I gotta paint stakingly recreate his room as it appears

889
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:25,160
Well, I mean you are saying that you cleaned your room so and his room's pretty clean looking

890
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,440
So you're already you already got that down

891
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,120
Yeah, his room is not too bad. I can't even understand. I've never come to think of it

892
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:39,880
I've never seen game give and pissed off video gamer in the same place at the same time true true

893
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,320
I think we're I think we're on to you really makes you think

894
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,200
Um, well, I mean, where is your proof, huh? Where is your proof?

895
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Burden the proof lies on you slams desk objection evidence, please

896
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,800
No, you need to proof read your proof

897
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:03,720
No, you she can't do it. She can't defend herself. She's got nothing looks like we want this argument then

898
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,280
Going for the kill

899
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,640
Stop killing me

900
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,120
You would like that wouldn't you

901
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,800
I would I would like it if you stop killing me stabs

902
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,520
No, this is worse than

903
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:24,760
Being in hell. This is terrible. Oh, you want me to stop executing you sounds like someone who's guilty

904
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,240
guilty would say

905
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,240
You've walked right into our trap

906
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,800
You've walked right into our life is a cage and death is the key

907
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,080
Ah, that's a good one. Would you find that one? Would you come up with it yourself?

908
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,840
I think I got it from a real cool person

909
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,800
Wow

910
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:57,000
Hey, hey, hey gibb. Yeah, fuck you. Okay. Fuck you. I'll get right on that

911
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:03,400
No, fuck your whole country. I mean, yeah, sure. All right. Piece of shit. Uh, uh, vat tax

912
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:11,000
Uh, uh, it's bullshit. Oh, yeah, that is I hate it so much. It's it's so shit. Let me just let me just complain about this

913
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:16,760
So I get done I get done sending out all the rfck kickstarter stuff and

914
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,480
and it turns out and in in

915
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,760
You alerted me of it and I guess this is just a uk thing and maybe there were some other countries to do it too

916
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,840
but because of the vat the import vat tax it costs

917
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,400
so much

918
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
to just fucking

919
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:38,520
For you I already paid the postage to send the package to you and it just cost you like

920
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:45,320
60 fucking dollars just to merely accept it to just have it be delivered to you even though it's already there

921
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,160
And um, I don't I don't really understand

922
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:54,360
Why I don't get it and I'm and I'm pissed off because I already charged a

923
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,360
I already charged a small like shipping fee for anyone outside the country

924
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:03,240
So I said to everyone in rfck like if you have to pay this I will cover it

925
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,400
I will cover it out of the the funds because I don't I already charge you for shipping

926
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,960
Uh, uh, the other one

927
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,320
Kola the one that made the the biggest order she got it's it's it's gonna be it's like a hundred and it's like a hundred and fifty dollars

928
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:24,760
Or it's like over a hundred fucking dollars just for her to like accept her fucking package

929
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,040
And I'm so fucking pissed at the government

930
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,720
Fuck the government. I'll agree. So wait was the

931
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,480
the um

932
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:40,680
How much was my pin amount like because I think it was because of how you've you you labeled the

933
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:45,720
Value of the items and they say oh, yeah trading valuable goods. That's we're gonna have to

934
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,440
Take money from you for that

935
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,760
You're I don't remember like

936
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:58,280
I think your pledge was like 70 bucks or something. Yeah, and so I don't remember I don't remember like how much

937
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:04,440
was uh like look I get to the post office thinking that I'm just gonna send these packages and they're like

938
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,960
No, no, you have to fill out a form you have to fill out a customs form and I'm like uh

939
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,640
Okay, and I'm in line and there's people waiting behind me

940
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,560
And they're like they're looking at me and like I'm holding them up and like I'm I'm sweating

941
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,640
Like I'm actually like sweating standing there

942
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,200
I'm just like frantically trying to fill these customs forms out to just get my shit sent in the mail

943
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,280
I I don't even remember what I put for the value. I probably just like put like

944
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,520
It just probably just picked a random fucking number and put it down there

945
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,920
Uh, uh, and um, maybe I put like a hundred dollars or something

946
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,880
And probably you should have put one dollar

947
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,920
I I should have yeah, I should have

948
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:46,920
Because like I thought that putting a higher value would maybe like ensure the package for more

949
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:52,760
And I thought that that would be covered by postage, but it's not it's just it literally the quest there

950
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,280
I'm them asking for the value is literally just like how much should we fucking

951
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,480
How how much should we extort out of the person you're sending this to because you're sending it to them?

952
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,160
But I didn't know I didn't know that's why they were asking or I would have undervalued

953
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,760
I think I probably overvalued it and I don't know it's gonna cost me a

954
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,080
It's gonna cost me an arm and a leg, but whatever

955
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,400
Live and learn I guess

956
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:17,320
Piece of shit never be on never tell the government the truth. That's what I've learned preach

957
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,400
Uh, uh, they will they will use it. They will use the truth against you

958
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,920
Oh, speaking of the government. I gotta do my taxes soon. I keep thinking about it. Oh, yeah

959
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:33,000
Keep thinking about that old document thing. Really? You have to do your taxes at the end of the year

960
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,800
We have like four months to do them. Well, they said you got until the end of january

961
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,320
But you may as well do it now. So I'm like, yeah, I guess I may as well do it now

962
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,200
You haven't done April

963
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,760
I still haven't paid my taxes from last year

964
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,000
Because they were due in april, but I got an extension to october

965
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,560
didn't ever and then you

966
01:09:54,280 --> 01:10:00,600
Uh, I had to apply for it, but it was like very easy to apply. I literally just like clicked a button and they were like, yeah, you've been approved

967
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,320
Um, no, there was everyone got an extension till like june or something right?

968
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:11,320
That was like a further extension that I that I applied for till october. That's interesting. I think for for me

969
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,280
They said, yeah, you don't have to pay taxes for

970
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,600
2020

971
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,040
We just like you're off the hook give just you no no not not for 20

972
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,360
Well, those are no those are my 2019 taxes

973
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,640
Whatever the the one that like they're saying you just

974
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,160
For the for the tax year of something to something you don't have to pay that one

975
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,800
But you do need to pay this next one. So I'm like, was that because of like a covid relief? I I'm pretty sure it was

976
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,440
Yeah, god fucking dammit. Why is america so shit?

977
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,640
Why is america such fucking dog shit? Holy fuck

978
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:47,000
God damn. I have to pay like 2000 fucking dollars in taxes for 2019. It's a nightmare. I get money Jesus cry

979
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,400
I love doing my taxes

980
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:55,160
Oh my god, but that's because I love doing when you think of your self-employed taxes are the worst fucking thing in the world

981
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,280
I think when you're self-employed you get screwed in taxes more

982
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,080
Yeah, it's it's so bad. It's so bad

983
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,200
I like doing my taxes when it turns out that I don't have to pay them. It's like I can write everything off

984
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:10,120
Oh, that's nice. Love to say it. Taxes are very taxing

985
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,480
That's why they call them that

986
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,880
It's true. I have to pay

987
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,960
I have to pay I had to pay a ton. I had to pay a ton in taxes. I'm hoping

988
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,080
I'm gonna claim like so many deductions. I'm gonna claim like every fucking deduction from

989
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,680
The all these kick starters and stuff. I don't know. I'm hoping to have a lot to write off

990
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,880
I think uh, I don't know uh too much about this

991
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,680
But I think in order to get around this issue when you're self-employed is to start an LLC

992
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,400
I don't oh god, haven't you all talked about making the pcp in LLC?

993
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,040
Like a while. Yeah

994
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:53,560
Yeah, somebody floats the idea every once in a while or they or they used to back before uh back before

995
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,320
Back before everyone just left. I feel like I'm just left for no reason. I feel like the only person who would have done it

996
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,640
Uh, hasn't been on the podcast in five months. So

997
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,280
Um

998
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:06,600
Nate would bring it up. I think Tom would bring it up or something. Yeah, yeah

999
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:10,920
Yeah, did you mentioned it once or twice and but like but none of us knew how to do it

1000
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,720
Um, so it cares to learn because it was like

1001
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,080
I gotta

1002
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,920
The idea would come up

1003
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,880
One of us would be like, you know, that might be a good idea

1004
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:24,360
And then that would be like it. It was it was mostly just the idea of like

1005
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:31,720
Oh, if we're all gonna like move into the same area to do making videos and all that funny stuff that will never happen anymore

1006
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,960
maybe um

1007
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,680
Then uh, it would be handy and very

1008
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,360
much

1009
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:44,040
Like smooth the process over of like me coming to america if it was an LLC that could hire me on

1010
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,280
Yeah, you'd get a work visa rather than me having to like get an immigration something or other

1011
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:53,640
There's a there's another podcast that I used to listen to years ago that had that had a similar plan

1012
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:59,960
Uh to get someone from australia over to california on like work visa

1013
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:05,880
Was it game grumps? No. No, it was I um, it was like a I thought it might have been ross

1014
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,320
Also, none of them did do that. Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't yatsi

1015
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:15,400
I'm I'm I'm convinced have I have I said my conspiracy theory that ross and holly's marriage was just a green card scam

1016
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,040
I think you have back when like the pro-jaret stuff

1017
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,800
Yeah, I think I heard you say that was holly canadian

1018
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,360
Is

1019
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,360
Is ross canady sounds a little bit

1020
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,120
I don't wait

1021
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,520
Did holly no holly lived in like

1022
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,280
Portland

1023
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,440
Ross I think and ross was living in america. So no no the holly was american

1024
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:42,680
Can you like stay in the u.s. If you are on like green card if you divorce your

1025
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,480
american husband or wife?

1026
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,440
I'm not I think if you've been here long

1027
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,920
I think if you've been here long enough you can probably

1028
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:56,120
Apply for like citizenship to something. I don't I'm maybe I don't fucking know

1029
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Maybe there's like a timer

1030
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,600
Clearly it's possible to do something like that because people appear

1031
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,200
And they stay people up here. Well, I think uh in order to apply for citizenship

1032
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:13,000
You have to have been living in the country for a certain amount of years, but I'm not sure how many years

1033
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:19,480
Yeah, yeah, that's that's what I mean like if if he had been here with holly for long enough that would even if they got divorced that might

1034
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,600
Might make it possible. I don't know. I don't know how it works

1035
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,400
seems plausible

1036
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:31,480
But the u.s. Is one of the easiest place to get a citizenship and as far as I know

1037
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,440
Wait, what that can't be true

1038
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:40,840
Um, I know the test it's the test you take is apparently really really easy

1039
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,680
Like it's just like when was america founded?

1040
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,640
Who is the first president?

1041
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:53,720
What colors are on the flag and stuff like that? I when was america founded? Oh july 4th

1042
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:01,800
Uh, um 1997 when maddox invented satire. He created the united states

1043
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,960
Yeah, exactly as a joke as a bit

1044
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,520
He did both sides of the war. Yeah, that's centrist maddox

1045
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:21,080
I remember the the the bit from that episode of the simpsons where up who is applying for citizenship and the they ask him like

1046
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:28,440
Why what was the civil war fought over and he gives like a very like nuance like detailed answer and the guy's just like

1047
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,520
Please just say slavery

1048
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,400
It makes it a lot easier

1049
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:45,640
It's possible that uh citizenship in us has gotten harder now or maybe easier. I'm not sure but

1050
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,800
I can't imagine why

1051
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,320
It's not

1052
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,520
Yeah

1053
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:55,240
It's I mean it's not easy because you know, it's a whole fucking it's a whole fucking thing

1054
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,760
There's like a million fucking people that want to come here and get citizenship

1055
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:03,240
But can't and there's a million fucking people. I didn't say it was easy here on expired green cars that uh

1056
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:08,840
That it's easier than in most other countries because a lot of other countries are really difficult to um

1057
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:16,920
Immigrate to I don't I've I've heard that japan is particularly difficult to get into like to stay forever

1058
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,880
There might be some countries where it's harder

1059
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,400
But like at the uk is quite difficult as well

1060
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:29,640
Commenters, please don't take this discussion too seriously. We're not informed. Yeah, we're just don't go right

1061
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:35,320
I don't I don't take all of us what we're saying and then like repeat it and then assume that

1062
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,680
I look at this like what ben said in this episode. He really needs to stop running his mouth about things. He doesn't understand

1063
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:48,680
I I know I need to do more of that if anything I need to be bolder with my stupid opinions could be wrong

1064
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,520
No, you couldn't be wrong. It's impossible. No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't say that you can't yeah on the pot on the pcp

1065
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:02,600
We're never on the pcp. You fake it till you make it true. You say it's it does make sense

1066
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:07,880
Uh, that the country just say that's what the pcps model does make sense for the countries to have uh,

1067
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,800
A lot of social programs to have tighter immigration laws

1068
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,840
Oh, social programs don't have this

1069
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,440
Well, I mean countries to have like yeah, so I guess it should be easy

1070
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,240
That was a joke. Yeah, I'm joking

1071
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,760
Yeah, yeah, um, yeah, Japan

1072
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,120
I think they just don't like non-jeffins

1073
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:36,200
Yeah, and I mean who can blame them. Yeah, like they want people to come in like they want to like dilute the manga industry with like

1074
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,080
The wrong types of drawers

1075
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:45,800
The wrong types of cartoonists. We've we've all seen what happens when white people take over so

1076
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:53,720
You don't want that shit if you're a japanese older brother broke his knees. Do you still call him nishan?

1077
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,520
Wouldn't it be nishan?

1078
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,720
Yeah, it was nishan. Uh, oh, they said sorry. Sorry

1079
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,920
He's he's nishan nishan. It's like you like the car car. Yeah

1080
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:13,480
Oh, exactly. This is all coming together. I'm gonna go pick up my nishan in my nishan from the airport

1081
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,040
Excuse me

1082
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,040
I'm loving this

1083
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,120
How you're excused about

1084
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,360
How about ebay?

1085
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,360
You guys ebay. How about it?

1086
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,640
You guys been on ebay lately? I've never been uh

1087
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:36,680
Never actually ebay is where I uh, I don't really look at it before amazon ebay was the place to go to get things on the internet

1088
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,480
I remember way back. I saw a lot of stuff on ebay, uh, like my entire gaming collection

1089
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,120
I

1090
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:47,800
I was because my my my tablet broke actually yeah, my tablet broke

1091
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,520
I mentioned this before and so I needed to get a new one and I was looking for it on amazon

1092
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,160
And it's like a thousand fucking dollars on amazon, but like this is an old-ass model

1093
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,000
So it should not be that much

1094
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So I went on ebay and I found it

1095
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:07,320
And I and I did I had not done this for years, but I I I haggled I fucking haggled

1096
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,960
And you know what I came out on top like a month ago a month ago

1097
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,800
I went on ebay and I made and I found a an item for sale and I was like that's a little too much

1098
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:23,720
I think I can squeeze more out of you. They were asking 175 plus 65 dollar shipping for this tablet

1099
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:28,120
And I was like, hmm. Fuck you. So I I I so I made an offer

1100
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:34,520
I didn't I did I've never used this feature on ebay before I made an offer for like 125 dollars and they were like

1101
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,800
No, they they made a counter offer that was like 165. They're like, oh, I'll shave a little like no

1102
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,200
I'll fuck you. Fuck you. So I made a counter counter offer

1103
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:48,280
Okay 135 and they just flat rejected it. They didn't even make a counter offer and I'm like, oh, no

1104
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,600
I've lost it too hard to get

1105
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:55,800
Well for the at the time I go back on yesterday the item is still there

1106
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:01,960
It's been up for a month. This person is fucked. This person is in dire straits. They're desperate. I can use this

1107
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,960
I have the leverage now. I have the upper hand. So I make another reply

1108
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:15,160
145 dollars. Bam approved. Got it. Shave $30. It's a clean $35 off of the asking price. Hope to see it. Fuck

1109
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,720
Fuck you, uh

1110
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,480
Whatever you need. I haven't um, I haven't used ebay much to buy stuff

1111
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,600
But I use it a lot to sell things and it's a pretty good way to sell your games way better than game stop

1112
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:31,400
I guess I'll have to sell my current tablet um

1113
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:37,960
As is for parts and probably get like 50 bucks for it probably literally pay more to ship it than I would even get for it

1114
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,120
It's like a cintiq, isn't it?

1115
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,920
It is it is

1116
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,240
It's the it's the oldest model. It's literally the oldest model. What's wrong with it again?

1117
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:55,880
It uh, as far as I can tell the only thing that's wrong with it is that the screen simply doesn't work. Oh, uh, which is pretty bad

1118
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:01,560
Hypothetically if you could fix the the display it still works fine

1119
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:07,720
Like it's still like like receives input and like knows when you are like, you know moving the cursor on it and stuff

1120
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:12,520
Uh, it's just the screen doesn't show anything. Um, so if you could fix that then

1121
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:18,040
It would work, but like it's such an old model that the the Wacom doesn't, um

1122
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,040
Uh, service the model anymore, and I think it would probably take

1123
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:27,320
Because it's so old. I think it would probably cost more to repair than it would just to fucking replace the thing. Yeah

1124
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,880
um, yeah, so yeah

1125
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:36,440
Uh, it's probably just fucking good go in the trash. Oh, no, whenever I uh, I couldn't bear to put it in the trash

1126
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:41,640
It would just feel whenever I sell stuff on ebay. I don't like shipping to anywhere outside of the us

1127
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:45,160
So I avoid yeah, because they've send it to fucking uk

1128
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:51,080
You send it to the uk and they put a fucking vat tax on it and it cost them 100 fucking dollars to receive the package

1129
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:57,080
Hey, fuck you andrew yang with your vat tax. Uh, you be I terrible idea never gonna do it

1130
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,720
Can't believe I buy I own a shirt with your name on it. Uh, uh, it's a it's a mistake

1131
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:07,720
It was all a mistake. I gotta say it's it was really funny seeing how fast you turned on andrew yang

1132
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,520
Back went back like before the uh

1133
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:15,720
Before like the primaries or whatever because there was like a solid I want to say like a solid couple

1134
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,720
Maybe like two months

1135
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:22,680
Or where where you were you know, it was two months. I think and then I think bernie started running you were like, all right

1136
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,920
Never mind. This is this is just a bit. I was just kidding guys

1137
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:31,800
I owe I owe yang I owe yang a lot when when when yang started running and I heard about the ubi thing

1138
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,880
I was like, wait, what I don't know

1139
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:41,000
Just like that that whole idea and having it be like seriously proposed like really got me thinking about like wait a minute

1140
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:46,520
Hmm public policy can like impact people in like a material way

1141
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:51,320
Huh, and it just got me thinking like more seriously about

1142
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,440
About issues man public policy

1143
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,640
That's weird

1144
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:04,680
Hmm. It's like it's almost like it's almost like uh, uh, uh, you know material conditions like affect society

1145
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,640
He got you on the on the public policy pipeline

1146
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,680
He did the ppp. He did he

1147
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
He got me on the um

1148
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:20,280
What's the like marxist thing like materialism like dialectical materialism. Yeah, he pipelined me to dialectical materialism

1149
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,520
And it was fucking based

1150
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,840
Thanks, andrew

1151
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,240
Thanks, andre yang. Thanks. Yang is thanks, andre yang

1152
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:33,240
Should get him on the podcast sometime. Oh, that would be fucking fine. Please get andre yang. Thanks yang

1153
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,720
fang

1154
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,640
Um, we should get Biden on the podcast and see if he dies mid mid show

1155
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:43,560
Could you imagine dude imagine if we were the podcast where he fucking died?

1156
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:54,040
He'd drop a lot of experience points, I think yeah, I mean that'd be huge for the channel

1157
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:59,480
Uh, like he's very high level with a little minecraft experience orbs. We suck them up

1158
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:06,200
You didn't know a lot of levels with that the pcp's xb bar. We're just fucking go skyrocketing for like eight levels

1159
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:13,240
It would be it would literally be like when like your level five badoof gets the last like quick quick attack on on a

1160
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,320
Rayquaza or something and it's just like

1161
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:25,480
Uh, that that's that was secretly the best the best inclusion to pokemon was uh was having a little experience bar at the bottom

1162
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,040
It it's good

1163
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,040
It's so much it's so much more satisfying

1164
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,840
What do they add that like gen two? Yeah, that was gen two. I think

1165
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,800
Okay, now I'm just thinking

1166
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,800
Like the idea the concept that all people have more experience. So it's more worth it to kill them

1167
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,440
Well, yeah, they're like level 80

1168
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,840
They're high. Yeah, they're higher level

1169
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:56,040
And also also biden's and like uh and specced into a high class. So that just adds even more experience

1170
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,400
He's he's a prestige class true. Yeah

1171
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:09,240
He's um, he's got uh, he's he's like uh, he's like a legendary like raid boss, you know, he's like a he's like a higher level instance

1172
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,160
Uh or something

1173
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,840
So he's a he's a unique mob

1174
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,400
So it's got like a gold

1175
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:26,040
Oh, no, yes silver dragon silver fox thing round his icon not not the word I would use to describe joe biden, but

1176
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Uh, you know, come on. I mean, come on. He's he's got that he's got the animal magnetism

1177
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,000
You know, he's got that there's something about him. You think he's a furry

1178
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:41,880
What he's just got that gen s a qua. He's just got he's just such a

1179
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:47,560
You know, like we said on shredded, you know, he's he's such a he's a he's you can look at him and you can tell he's a cake eater

1180
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
What the fuck does that mean? Yeah, what the fuck?

1181
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,960
That's a weird thing to say

1182
01:25:54,040 --> 01:26:00,360
This is a thing on on the on the shredded episode we tried to decode they they kept talking about people being cake eaters

1183
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,200
And i'm pretty sure it just means like someone who

1184
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,400
Enjoys life but more specifically in the context of r slash adultery

1185
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,600
It means someone who has their cake and eats it too i.e.

1186
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:20,520
Is just like fucking live in the high life fucking their spouse, but also their their af or adultery partner

1187
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,240
Or sorry a fair partner. Sorry. Would it be ap? Um

1188
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,440
Seems like uh, that that subreddit really had an effect on you

1189
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:34,440
Um, it was very funny. It was very that's how it starts. I may be angry starts out funny

1190
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,920
Then I get serious

1191
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:43,720
Uh, I it's I'll have to do a lecture. I'll have to do a lecture on um on the uh r slash adultery lore

1192
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,960
Uh, the thing about like they talk about like there's code

1193
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,960
Where like oh

1194
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:54,520
Yeah, I was walking around in the parking lot with an upside down pineapple in my shopping cart

1195
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:59,000
And everyone knows like that's a secret sign that i'm like on the prowl for an elicit

1196
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,320
extra marital

1197
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:07,880
Freemasons pizza gate emails came out or all these like all these like politicians of talking about getting like

1198
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:13,240
Spaghetti with extra sauce and cheese pizza like what what is what this like weird coded language?

1199
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:20,600
Mmm. Mmm. I mean wait was that pizza stuff like I have I was that I have no clue

1200
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:26,360
I have no clue. Okay. I'm I'm I'm not one of those people who like thinks that there's

1201
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,040
Like I mean, I believe that there was

1202
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,160
I don't believe in the I don't believe in the satanic pedophile ring. I mean, well, I do

1203
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:39,880
I don't believe that it just is like only the democrat. Yeah, I'm sure they're all fucking kids

1204
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,600
They're all they're all fucking kids and drinking blood. Yeah, obviously. Yeah, it's like eyes wide shut

1205
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,960
That's why they had the kill. That's why they had to kill uh, uh, Kubrick

1206
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,120
I thought you were gonna say epstein, but yeah, well that too

1207
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:58,280
Yeah, I've never seen eyes wide shut. Um, but I can use my context clues to infer

1208
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:03,880
What it's about that it is a movie. Yeah, it's it's it's a little flick. It's got tom cruise in it. Yeah

1209
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,960
Oh, I'll have to check that. Yeah, I know how much you love tom cruise

1210
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:14,040
I I am a notorious your notorious tom cruise appreciate your real cruiser

1211
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:21,160
That's as we like to call them cruising for as we call it on r slash the cruise

1212
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:34,840
Fuck what are we talking about tom cruise something. Oh, yeah, love them

1213
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,400
Okay, what else

1214
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,760
Um, uh, I don't know. I think

1215
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:47,960
Uh, I guess I tweeted about it's similar sort of like list making stuff, but I've been seeing a lot of simpsons

1216
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:55,080
Classic simpsons clips on youtube recommended and I've got into a big old thing just clicking on those and being like ha ha

1217
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:59,800
I remember that bit. That was funny. Hmm. And then uh idea popped into my head like

1218
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,600
I've always wondered like

1219
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:07,640
How when the simpsons gets bad? How does it get bad and how quickly and I was like

1220
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,280
What if I watched every episode of the simpsons and I I

1221
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,880
Noted every time there was a joke with a punchline

1222
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:22,600
That it was like a joke that was good or a joke that didn't land and then I went through every single episode in that way

1223
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:26,600
You mentioned this graphing thing before but when you say it like that it's like

1224
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,800
Oh, you're trying to like see exactly when the downfall was

1225
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,320
Yeah

1226
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,000
Oh

1227
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,480
Well, I mean, this is a this is a great question

1228
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,520
Uh, uh, I mean the the general consent it seems like the the

1229
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:48,120
The general community consensus is that the decline happens somewhere around season 10

1230
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,280
Nine nine or ten

1231
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:55,480
But there are some hardliners that say that actually the golden era was like season up to season three

1232
01:29:55,720 --> 01:30:02,760
And the decline actually started after that and was only like fully completed around season. Well, I remember the the first time

1233
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,760
I hated watching the simpsons was in uh the year 2000

1234
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:11,080
I watched one of the new episodes that aired from the new season on sunday

1235
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,920
And I I didn't like it at all and I stopped watching after that

1236
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,160
2000 would have been like season 20

1237
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,200
No season eight

1238
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,200
Season 12 something like that. Yeah

1239
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,760
Which would be like

1240
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,880
post peak simpsons, but not like not like late simpsons. Exactly. It would be like middle air

1241
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,960
I I I remember I think I've talked about this before in the show

1242
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:42,040
I have heard that it I have heard that it got bad that it got worse before eventually kind of getting less bad

1243
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:46,680
In like the late later seasons. That's what I've heard some people. Yeah, I've seen a few things like that

1244
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,280
um, but I remember

1245
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:53,080
Rewatching the simpsons up to like season 12 or 15 or something and I still

1246
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,040
Was enjoying myself. I don't think it was like

1247
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:00,120
The later ones were like as good and I can tell there was like a little bit of difference

1248
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,120
but it didn't like

1249
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:08,520
Piss me off as I was expecting some of the episodes to like just just based on hearsay like, uh, you'll hate this one

1250
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:13,640
I'm like, oh god. I don't want to I don't want to hate anything and I didn't so I was like

1251
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,800
um

1252
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:20,280
Yeah, I kind of want to go all through through all of them instead of like stopping

1253
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,920
I think it's so much to do. I think it's a really funny gimmick to have like

1254
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,440
um to have like this

1255
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,520
what what sort of

1256
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:36,920
You might call like a scientific like beta driven approach to to it. I think that's funny is

1257
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:42,360
Which like scientist man discusses like terminator or something

1258
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:50,120
I'm trying to yeah, yeah, but like but but to have like a consistent like rule set that you were abiding by as you go through

1259
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,880
Yeah, I think it's funny. Yeah, it's funny because it's like there's no way I could like

1260
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:02,840
Prove that a joke landed based. It's just whether I liked it or not whether it was a good joke to me

1261
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:08,360
Yeah, that does sound pretty cool. I hope somebody does that to my stuff someday. I think a challenge there would be like

1262
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,480
Even like counting jokes at all because like Simpsons will have I know

1263
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,440
Jokes that like like jokes within jokes

1264
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:21,000
So like like a punchline comes and then another punchline comes that you didn't expect and then another one

1265
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,400
It's like, oh, that's such a clever little writing thing

1266
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:27,400
You think it's gonna happen this way and then it doesn't and then something else happens and it's like if

1267
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:32,920
If you're pausing like every time there's a joke to evaluate like did that land or didn't it?

1268
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,960
You're gonna be like making a lot of fucking notes. I know it's such a stupid idea

1269
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,360
And I just couldn't I just like

1270
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,120
Part of me wants to maybe you can practice on my stuff first before you move on to the simpsons

1271
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,200
Yeah, I could those are very clear jokes. Oh

1272
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,360
For a while

1273
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,520
Oh fuck for a while. I was listening to

1274
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,000
I think it's called worst episode ever the simpsons podcast

1275
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,680
And I I fell off listening to it and I don't remember why

1276
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,400
It must have been the worst podcast ever

1277
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,360
Um, have

1278
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,680
Have any of you read?

1279
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,680
um

1280
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,680
The dead homer

1281
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,680
Have you ever read like ever

1282
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,760
Just memorable remember

1283
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:25,720
All right. Well, well to give a basic rundown reading is like when you look at these things called words and um

1284
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:30,920
And there's a collection of words on this website called the dead homer society

1285
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:35,240
And they've heard of this. I've heard there's there's like a section

1286
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:42,040
On the website called like zombie simpsons and it basically is like it's like a novel explaining

1287
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:47,640
Like when the downfall of the simpsons happened. It sounds a lot like Gibbs idea

1288
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:52,040
Uh, it's I remember reading it like years ago. It's really good

1289
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:58,120
Wait a minute. We got we got okay. I'm looking at this page. This is exactly. I I think I'm okay

1290
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:03,400
I've seen the dead homer society. I've never seen this specific page, but like

1291
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:07,560
I really like this and I'm definitely going to read it. It looks really interesting

1292
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:13,880
Wait, I'm but it's not okay. Are these like links in the middle are two like chapters. Yes. Yes

1293
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,840
Okay, it's okay

1294
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:20,600
Reading but nobody does that anymore like line charts. Well

1295
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:26,680
It has charts where it even even has charts in the first part. I would like to see that's

1296
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:32,520
I like the the okay. I'm looking at the first part is called. There it is. What is zombie simpsons?

1297
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:38,120
Average stars. Okay. They I mean they didn't do it by jokes. No, they're not doing it by jokes

1298
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,000
Gibbs is a lot more. Um, is a lot more

1299
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,760
I really like this family. It's it's funny

1300
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:50,440
Yeah, it's good. I like it a lot it the the website itself is very like old internet

1301
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:56,920
In a certain way. Yeah, I remember I remember the zombie simpsons thing being a really good read

1302
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:03,560
Especially as someone like myself who like by the time I was like watching like shows like the simpsons

1303
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:09,800
The simpsons was like long since bad. So I don't have like this attachment to the show that a lot of people do

1304
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:15,480
I I've I've grown up with I had the box set of season two

1305
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,680
I am exactly as old as the simpsons

1306
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:23,240
Wow, so you're like the perfect age almost that's that's pretty lame then

1307
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,400
Wait, what?

1308
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,760
It's pretty lame

1309
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,240
No, cool. Yeah, no, he's right. It is kind of lame. Nah shut up

1310
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:37,400
Oh, you know those are funny because I I grew up watching the simpsons

1311
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:41,000
I think I didn't realize that like even as I was watching them as a kid

1312
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:46,200
They the episodes I was seeing were already like, you know, five or ten years old

1313
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:52,440
I just kind of watched them and thought they were new, you know for a long time. Yeah, I had the same experience

1314
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,040
Yeah

1315
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,080
Uh

1316
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:59,640
Same same with like same with the the nes the nes came out the year that I was born

1317
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,800
And I didn't get one until I was like five or six

1318
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:05,640
And then like later I got a super nintendo a little later

1319
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:11,000
I didn't realize that by the time I got an nes the super nintendo was already it was already obsolete

1320
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:15,800
But at the time I just I just assumed that it was like new and then like I found out later at the time

1321
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:22,120
I think in the u.s. Uh, the nes came out in 1985. You were born in 85. Wait

1322
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:30,920
When did it come out in america in america? It was 85. Um, wait, am I stupid? I thought it came out in like 80

1323
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,360
Uh, the famicom was 83. I think yeah

1324
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:40,120
Oh, okay. Well, I'm well that just makes my point even harder then is that you know, I got

1325
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,600
Yeah, it was like almost a decade old when I got it

1326
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:48,120
But I thought it was the new it was new and I just kind of assumed that to be the case until like for a long long time

1327
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,520
Yeah, your parents tricked you

1328
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:56,440
They probably I mean they probably didn't have to I'm sure they didn't even have to lie for me to just assume

1329
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:58,680
um

1330
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:03,000
But it was just surprising to be like, oh wait, really? It was that old even then? Holy shit

1331
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:09,000
Weird there was this other thing I was thinking I probably also stopped me if you heard this one before

1332
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,360
um

1333
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,880
but no uh looking through the simpsons and then adding up

1334
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:19,560
the day night transitions and and like and and and like time passing

1335
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,600
moments so that you can accurately say

1336
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:28,520
How old Bart and Lisa actually are in like the canon of the simpsons

1337
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:35,160
Have actually thought about that. I feel like that's something simpsons fans would have done like wait, wait

1338
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:40,520
What's the question? The idea is like the the the show has been going on for a very long time

1339
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,600
It's like oh Bart and Lisa wouldn't be that old

1340
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:47,880
But I've always wondered like could you fit like all of the episodes

1341
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:53,880
Into like a smaller amount of time than it's actually elapsed in real life. Like how old would they actually be?

1342
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,920
this okay, there is a

1343
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:01,320
I there's a youtuber called the real gyms who does

1344
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:06,600
Simpsons analysis like this and he has some series called

1345
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:11,720
Uh, I think like the simpsons timeline. It's like there's there's one about the past timeline

1346
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:18,120
One about the present timeline and about like and and the future timeline and I think it's in the present one

1347
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:22,760
He talks about it and like I think like yeah, like there's more

1348
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:28,520
There's like like like Bart and Lisa have been 10 and 8 for all this time

1349
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,120
But there's more episodes than there are like days in the year

1350
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:39,320
So you would have like for it to work you would have to assume that like certain episodes are like happening concurrently with each other

1351
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:45,560
like on any given day like the plot of the plot of uh, uh

1352
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:51,720
I'm trying to think of an you know the the plot of one episode unfolds sort of in between the

1353
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:56,680
Unfolding and you would have to like cross-reference the characters to make sure that there's no like contradiction

1354
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,840
Yeah

1355
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:02,520
There are there are there are contradictions though the funniest thing is that like

1356
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:10,600
Every the simpsons always takes place in the year when Bart is 10 and and Lisa is 8 and yet like multiple different episodes have like

1357
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:18,280
You know the school year ending or like them going to summer Christmas and it's like pretty sure uh the show makes fun of this fact

1358
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,840
at certain points

1359
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,960
About Bart and Lisa's age how'd they never age?

1360
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:30,680
Yeah, isn't like one of the isn't like one of the inconsistencies is like the show started where uh

1361
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:35,480
Homer's dad was like a world war two vet, but now he's like a korean war vet or something

1362
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:41,560
But like a vietnam. Yeah something. Yeah something like that because because like yeah the the simpsons is

1363
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,320
The simpsons is always happening in current in the current day

1364
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,720
But the characters are always the same age

1365
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:51,160
So like their past keeps like floating forward

1366
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:56,280
It's like if you really think about it every single episode is a completely different universe

1367
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,880
Where they're like a day like a week older

1368
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,480
Because it's like springfield is like in a time bubble

1369
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:08,440
But but but there's but there's a weird there's a weird wrinkle to it where like

1370
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:14,600
Homer and Marge's uh, I think their prom always happened in a specific year

1371
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,760
And like oh, yeah like that like completely throws a wrench into it

1372
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:23,160
Well, no that episode where they say that is like a different universe from the other episodes

1373
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:28,920
Yeah, true. That's all right. It's all it's all not canon with itself. And there's all you know the

1374
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,520
Did you know that it's actually all just fiction and none of it even really happens

1375
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:36,920
You know like the the zelda timeline where like it splits after a certain point

1376
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,680
There's like a point in the home and the simpsons where like Homer starts a band

1377
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:44,120
Homer doesn't start a band and that's where like the timelines diverge

1378
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,200
The b sharps

1379
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:50,200
Is it the b sharps because because there was the band because I know I haven't seen it

1380
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:56,760
But I know that in a later season they do another like Homer and Marge like meat story that's set in the 90s

1381
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:03,720
Yeah, and it's like a complete reimagining or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and it like completely rewrites the history

1382
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:08,920
They're gonna do that eventually where it's like um Homer and Marge, uh, remember that I hope they don't I hope the show

1383
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,280
Where they reminisce their time where they met where they were playing fortnight

1384
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:17,400
Right they met on fortnight all those years ago probably during COVID-19

1385
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:24,760
Do you remember when Homer subscribed Homer subscribed to Marge's only fans during during the quarantine? Yeah

1386
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,960
Remember when you made Undertale, sweetie

1387
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,280
But it is weird how uh

1388
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:40,920
The world of the simpsons still looks and feels like it's based on 90s stereotypes even though they have newer stuff

1389
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:46,680
Like I watched one time an episode where they had uh, I think uh, mr. Burns was playing the Wii

1390
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,520
It just looks weird. It's like you're seeing the Wii in the 90s

1391
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,240
Yeah, like a lot of the character designs like ironclad. This is what they are

1392
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,400
I mean, they're pretty generic just like clothing wise, I guess

1393
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,400
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if I agree like

1394
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:09,000
Yeah, like I don't like this does the world look particularly 90s though

1395
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:14,520
I think the characters do like homers. It is the stereotypical dad from the 90s and

1396
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:21,000
No, their entire family is like the stereotypical 90s. No, you're totally wrong. You're totally wrong. I think the only thing

1397
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,920
That would be different. He's just wearing a shirt and jeans. It's the only thing that would be different

1398
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,840
Um now is that all of these shirts would have like stupid

1399
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:33,720
Text on them that sucks and isn't funny and there would be nothing that doesn't have a logo

1400
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Not on a sitcom

1401
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:39,160
I mean

1402
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,120
No, I think the character designs are timeless enough

1403
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:47,240
Uh, they they look fine in any era. I mean like people in

1404
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,240
I mean their house

1405
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:55,560
I mean people today people live in houses that were built like 10 20 30 40 50 years ago and like it's normal

1406
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:01,960
Um, but there's definitely some characters that are extremely 90s like um, the bus driver remember that guy

1407
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,800
I don't remember his name

1408
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:04,680
Auto

1409
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,680
Yeah, okay

1410
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:13,960
You know his his accent the way he dresses. I guess there's there's fucking there's fucking like long-haired waistoids in every era

1411
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:22,360
Like the specific music he's like talking about maybe this because he talks about music. Yeah, he just talks like a 90s guy

1412
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,640
A little bit

1413
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:28,840
Yeah, that is yeah, I guess that's the most obvious one

1414
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:30,360
um

1415
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:36,120
I am like what if like nuclear power in the future just stops and becomes obsolete in the real world

1416
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:41,480
Will they change mr. Burns and his nuclear power plant or will that stay?

1417
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,400
Why would he runs a solar power plant? I'm just thinking of stuff

1418
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,360
I'm just thinking of things that the simpsons has like very

1419
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:55,720
Deeply ingrained and then like in the real world could change could anything change and then simpsons would have to change to keep up

1420
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,080
I don't know if there is anything

1421
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,960
I think they also drive the same car don't they?

1422
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:06,680
I guess that's more of like a meta thing though not written necessarily

1423
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:12,440
Yeah, they just the character himself. Did they get rid of the character or did they change the voice actor? I can't remember

1424
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,160
I think they recast them

1425
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:18,520
Okay, well, did they did they I thought they got rid of them

1426
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,400
Uh, yeah, I don't know

1427
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,440
Um recasting him is probably the right thing to do

1428
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,720
I don't I don't know. I think if they I didn't see that there's much of a problem of it, but like

1429
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,680
I yeah

1430
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:34,760
I

1431
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,760
I don't think yeah

1432
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:43,080
I remember I remember watching why people didn't like it, but I do think that like apu's voice was

1433
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,720
Hanka's area

1434
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:46,760
and like

1435
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:51,800
It's what what do you do at that point? I don't know my my take on that is really been a problem

1436
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:55,240
If they had just like not made a big deal out of it. I don't think it would have yeah

1437
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:58,440
I I remember watching hot diggity demons

1438
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:03,640
The apu that I know video, which is a very good video where he goes into like why it's good

1439
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,560
But it has some really cringy stuff in it

1440
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,080
There's a few cringy moments in it

1441
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,640
and I think the the thing that like

1442
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:16,120
I disagree a little bit on is like he knows all about how apu because he's a big simpsons fan

1443
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,400
and um, you know, if you look at apu

1444
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:23,080
And you really understand everything that's going on with him

1445
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:26,600
You you realize that he's not like a negative stereotype and it should be fine

1446
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,000
the the thing is that

1447
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,120
The people who it affects in like this the playground like not everybody notices

1448
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:42,040
The the the subtle joke of like subverting the negative stereotype trope of the the immigrant who's like

1449
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:47,960
I don't know. Well, he's not stupid. All right. He's like extremely intelligent and all and all these cool things

1450
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,840
And that was what the show initially was doing because it's like

1451
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,520
Progressive in that way. It's always been a little bit progressive

1452
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,920
Yeah, but uh, the the average person doesn't necessarily understand that and they will still make fun of

1453
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:04,520
Indian people by comparing them to apu from the simpsons

1454
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:11,320
Regardless, okay, okay, okay, but let me I mean imagine a world in which apu was

1455
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:15,240
The same idea. He's like an he's an immigrant from India

1456
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,800
But you know, he's he's voiced by an Indian

1457
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:24,440
Uh, and he's like, you know, he's he's all that and stuff and but he's otherwise like the same

1458
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,960
You know, he's a convenience store owner

1459
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:29,960
But he's got all these like things in his past that are interesting about him and he's he's

1460
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,840
mostly the same character like

1461
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,480
you you would still

1462
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,560
I mean, he's it's such a popular show

1463
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:43,400
And and he's like such kind of a fixture of it. I mean, I feel like there's no way that you could avoid

1464
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:47,800
Indian people getting associated with this character who was like the only

1465
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:53,080
You know, I feel like people would still make jokes about if they saw an Indian kid

1466
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:56,360
They'd be like ha ha come again because that's what the guy says, you know

1467
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:59,960
Like come again is not like a really stereotypical thing

1468
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:05,720
But it's just that's the association because of this such a such a well. It's the it's the fault character

1469
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:10,360
It's really just the fault of the simpsons being so successful and so widespread

1470
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:14,840
That it's like even if even if you as a as a fan of the simpsons

1471
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:19,800
You can recognize that he's not a negative stereotype. You can't stop people from doing it

1472
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:25,880
When it's it's like on a surface level, they can see the similarity and they will say the things

1473
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:29,720
So like I think both sides of the argument are kind of true

1474
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:34,520
Like it doesn't it doesn't matter to you shouldn't try it. It shouldn't need to change

1475
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,920
But I get that people

1476
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:41,560
The problem the the problem of like oh people call me a poo

1477
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:45,320
I don't know if there's any like way that could have been avoided

1478
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:50,520
Other than just like not having an Indian in your show, which like that's stupid. Yeah

1479
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:57,480
Uh like having an Indian voice actor wouldn't have changed that. Uh, yeah, I wouldn't have so it's like what is

1480
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:01,880
Done, but I don't know. It's it's kind of dumb. It's kind of dumb

1481
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,880
I I really think if the simpsons had like simply had simply not

1482
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:12,040
Addressed the issue. I don't think they really would have had to change anything not that I think it's bad that they recast him, but like

1483
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:20,360
I don't think they had to really probably probably would have blown over it would have blown over as these things are to do. Yeah

1484
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:26,760
Maybe people were just uh overthinking it. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I'm looking and it says

1485
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,880
I'm looking at wikipedia

1486
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:33,160
No, it says voiced by hank azaria 1990 to 2020

1487
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:34,600
Wait, are you still doing it?

1488
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:39,400
Simpsons creator mac grading stated in august 2019 that a poo will remain on the show. So I guess they didn't

1489
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,920
I guess we're just stupid. Well, they just didn't do any of that

1490
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:50,040
Faced I never I never really looked into it. I just heard about it. So no, I don't know. It's it seems like they didn't do anything

1491
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,880
Okay, well, I thought uh, they were going to do something, but I'm not sure if they actually did

1492
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:01,400
They might have said they were going to do something and then waited for everyone. Yeah to stop listening. Yeah

1493
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,920
Oh, we're definitely going to care about what you just said

1494
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,040
Well, no

1495
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:12,440
Um, yeah, but in that situation, they probably should have just not addressed it at all

1496
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:19,480
Yeah, the the the the bit with like, you know the bit where like lisa's in bed and she's got the picture of a poo on the table

1497
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:25,800
Oh god. Yeah, that's it's so weird. It's such an awkward. I've seen that clip. It's embarrassing

1498
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:27,880
What what clip? I don't know this

1499
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,560
It's hard to even describe because it sounds like a fever dream

1500
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:37,000
There's there's like a there was like a subplot in a in an episode that was like that was totally

1501
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:42,760
Totally not about anything in particular guys. Although well, I shouldn't say like that

1502
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:46,040
It was about the whole up who controversy here. Let me let me see if I can find it

1503
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,560
We're like lisa's

1504
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:52,600
Is like talking to marge and they even like look at the camera when they're like talking about how like, oh

1505
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:57,560
He's it's from a different time. There's there's nothing we can do about it one of them

1506
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,080
They say that and then it was bad

1507
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:05,640
But but they also like don't really say anything because she says like

1508
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:11,000
These issues will be addressed at a future some issues will be addressed at a future date

1509
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:17,080
If at all and then marge like looks at the camera gravely and nods and I just don't know what the fuck they were thinking

1510
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,960
But I guess I don't know what the fuck they were thinking

1511
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:25,480
Like the thumbnail yeah, it's like I feel like I'm about to get apologized to by

1512
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:31,560
I don't want to see it. I don't want to have like youtube rip like apology energy

1513
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:35,000
It looks you know what it looks like people talking about it never mind

1514
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,160
It looks like an antoons video about like the characters are at their funeral

1515
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:42,840
You know now, you know why into symptoms is bad now

1516
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:47,800
It's because it seems like this probably it's like you can't find the clip

1517
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:56,200
I also don't understand. Um, I mean it's it's similar to did you see that like the song like the donald trump song with like the squad?

1518
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,440
I I've not uh, no

1519
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:04,360
I didn't see that during the democratic primaries and it ends with like a fucking like conga line of all the democratic candidates

1520
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:11,320
Like dancing and it's so embarrassing. It's so it's the worst thing i've ever seen. It does sound pretty embarrassing

1521
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,720
it's the squad like

1522
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:18,280
Doing a fucking musical number where they all like chase trump around the white house and like

1523
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:24,360
Wag their fingers at him and and stuff and he's like, oh i'm trying to bumble my way around and oh

1524
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:30,280
I tripped over some some stairs and oh i'm trying to get away from these these women because i'm scared of them

1525
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,320
It's so it's a nightmare. It's just a nightmare. I I let me listen

1526
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:38,600
Let me I feel like maybe I haven't made it clear in the discussion

1527
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:42,360
I hate the simpsons now and I want it to fucking die. I really do

1528
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:47,240
Yeah, I wish it had died along. I haven't really delved into like i'm not a simpsons apologist at all

1529
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:51,240
I haven't really delved into like the latest stuff and I don't keep tabs on it. So

1530
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:52,920
um

1531
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:58,440
That sounds I don't I don't care if it's I don't care if it's less bad than it used to be it's trash and it should be dead

1532
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:03,000
uh, I'm thinking of like what they would usually do when they wanted to make fun of a

1533
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:08,360
president or something they would just have them be in an episode and say

1534
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:10,600
Or do something evil or or

1535
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:13,400
Not evil, but like um

1536
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,000
I don't know like

1537
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,840
They've had bill bill clinton with mr. Burns. They would they would just have just have them say a funny line

1538
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:22,840
That's like oh, yeah, we all know about that

1539
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,400
controversy. Yeah

1540
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:28,680
Yeah, just like pop in for like a little like one-line gag or something

1541
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:34,680
It's I mean they they had the episode where um, uh, george bush moved in next door

1542
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,320
Is it which was just a big

1543
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,400
fucking um

1544
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,600
I don't know

1545
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:43,480
But wasn't that one of the newer episodes that sucked?

1546
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:47,160
I've all of w then. Yeah

1547
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:52,520
You know, no, it was george. It was george hw. It was first first bush. Oh, then that's the golden. You don't know

1548
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,520
That's the one with that's the one with two bad neighbors

1549
01:52:56,200 --> 01:53:01,160
You don't know about I don't have watched that. I don't really remember. I don't know if I've seen that one. They um

1550
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:07,240
George george bush, uh, uh really hates uh homer and bark

1551
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:13,080
And so he he does some mischief. He spray paints too bad neighbors and like their faces

1552
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:17,240
But he spray paints it on his own house so that they can see it like from across the street

1553
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:22,120
Um, and that's it. That's the joke. He spray paints his own house to get back at them

1554
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:27,320
Very clever. Yeah, I don't know. That's why that guy was ahead of the cia

1555
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:32,840
I feel I feel I feel like that episode is kind of light on actual commentary

1556
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:40,440
Uh, I mean it's been like it's been like talked about before and I don't want to go too deep into it

1557
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:45,560
But but like it feels like trump just like broke a lot of like comedians brains

1558
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:54,760
Yeah, the the reality of the situation is like almost too absurd to make jokes about so the sentence is a comedy

1559
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,920
I

1560
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:59,160
Thank you. Good night, everybody

1561
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,680
Hope you had fun

1562
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:06,120
I saw a clips of like the the like the episode about voting where homer goes to vote

1563
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:11,960
And it was stupid. It wasn't as bad as the as the song, but it was really stupid

1564
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,280
Yeah, whenever I see uh, I saw the clip

1565
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:19,400
I saw the clip of like baby bernie sanders having his goons like beat up other kids in the playground

1566
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:22,280
And I was like this show needs to die the show needs to die

1567
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:26,680
This is whenever I see uh clips of the newer seasons. Uh, I was cringe

1568
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:35,320
Uh, it's it's it's it's it's a nightmare. Honestly. I'm getting depressed. It definitely wasn't based. That's for sure

1569
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:39,720
Definitely not based. I don't think any show should go on for that long

1570
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:43,320
No, it's been like what over 20 years now

1571
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:47,880
30 30 30 32 years

1572
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,960
Going on 33, baby. That's ridiculous

1573
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:57,480
It's it's unacceptable. It's a it's a thought crime. It's art crime is what it is. Make a new fucking show

1574
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,800
Make a new fucking show you cowards

1575
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:05,320
Wasn't uh, wasn't that what future drama was supposed to be? Yeah, that's better than every way

1576
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:10,840
Especially then in the the way that it didn't go on forever and ruin itself

1577
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:15,160
It almost did it it does it does have that going for it

1578
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:18,680
And you could you could argue that like some of the comedy central seasons aren't as strong

1579
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:21,720
But it did end before it got too bad. Yeah, I'd agree

1580
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:27,720
There was um, was it there was another Matt Groening show from like a few years ago on netflix game of thrones

1581
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:30,360
Yeah, game of thrones. That was it

1582
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:36,680
I I never watched disenchanted. Uh, me neither. I heard it wasn't that good. It looked dumb. I didn't want to see it

1583
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:40,120
I remember when uh future roma first came out

1584
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:45,400
There was a lot of hype for it and I thought it was going to replace the simpsons. I thought the simpsons was going to end

1585
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:50,920
Um, but that didn't happen the plan. Yeah back in the day anything could have happened

1586
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:55,080
Um, but it didn't instead nothing happened

1587
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,600
Um, yeah, I remember being hyped for future roma

1588
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,640
Uh, future roma was good. Don't get me wrong

1589
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,200
But I wouldn't say that like

1590
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:07,560
The best future roma is better than the best simpsons

1591
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:13,400
That's kind of just that's kind of just the zoomer in me talking because I've seen way more future roma than I've seen simpsons

1592
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:15,800
Oh, no. Oh, no. Yeah, the best

1593
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,800
Sorry, I'm a little baby boy

1594
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:24,360
Simpsons is funnier than future roma was definitely like peaks peak simpsons is funnier future roma has other things going for it

1595
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:30,600
It's got more of like an arc, which is nice. I guess it's more of a of a narrative show the simpsons is more of

1596
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:37,480
Here's a concept and let's tell jokes while we explore it for a few for like 20 30 minutes

1597
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,120
Yeah

1598
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:42,600
Well, you know me i'm a big fan of jokes

1599
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:45,480
What what

1600
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:48,040
What

1601
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,040
What tell tell us a joke funny man

1602
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:53,320
He has been the whole episode. Yeah, make us laugh

1603
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,040
I make us laugh clown

1604
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,080
I couldn't think of anything on funny to say

1605
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:01,800
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry

1606
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,440
Um

1607
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,520
Now what voicemail

1608
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:12,760
I can't think I don't really go anything else to say. Yeah, we we could voicemail

1609
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:18,520
All right. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. It's been two hours very based very based

1610
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:26,920
Uh, let me pull them up and we will get to going right. Okay, not to sound green. Um, how do you like?

1611
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:33,880
You activate voicemail. Oh, oh, it's easy. You'll see. Um, I'll just post it in the chat and you just play it in the chat

1612
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:35,080
It's fine

1613
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:37,960
Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's all there is to it. That is easy

1614
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:43,080
Um, okay. Uh, let me see. This one is called

1615
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:47,640
Hold on I gotta get back to

1616
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,240
Reality oh there goes gravity

1617
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:55,720
Um, this one is called

1618
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:01,960
The worst accent. Okay, three two one go

1619
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:09,720
Guys the worst accent occurs either when Finnish people try to speak English or when Americans try to speak French

1620
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:16,440
Like you think Ben desperately trying to pronounce the words croque monsieur and croque madame was just embarrassing

1621
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:23,880
Wait, I I said I went at length after I tried to say that I went at length or maybe it wasn't then but

1622
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:27,240
Like recently I went on at length about how I don't understand

1623
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:31,160
How french is pronounced and I think it's a nonsense language monsieur

1624
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,760
Madame the yeah, the the sandwiches

1625
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:42,440
The croque croque croque monsieur and croque madame. What are you just doing like a like a I hate this person

1626
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:44,440
This is their argument voice

1627
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:49,800
That's right. Well, what's your point? The worst accent is uh, whatever I've got I guess

1628
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,520
What is your accent?

1629
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:56,840
Uh, I don't know. I assume midwest. Gamers accent. Yeah, it's gamer

1630
01:58:57,480 --> 01:59:00,600
Well, there's not enough there's not enough bad words and gamers tavern

1631
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,960
So you have you have a he's speaking like a gamer gamers tavern. You have a you have a uh, uh

1632
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:11,480
I don't want to say unusual because that sounds negative, but you have like a you have kind of a

1633
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:14,680
Unusual cadence to your voice. Where where are you from?

1634
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:17,880
Uh, the u.s

1635
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,880
Just can you be any more specific press him?

1636
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:24,760
Okay. Gamers tavern values his privacy. Don't dox. Don't dox yourself. I guess

1637
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,560
I guess if I had to guess I would say midwest

1638
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,120
You can say I'm from I'm from the south

1639
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:33,160
Oh

1640
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:34,760
Mexico

1641
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:36,200
Yeah

1642
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:41,320
Is that why you were talking about green cards earlier? I don't hear the south at all. I don't hear southern at all

1643
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:47,640
Yeah, uh, where where I live. Nobody has a southern accent. Um, even though it is technically in the south

1644
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:51,080
New york

1645
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:53,080
Very mysterious south to me

1646
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:56,280
Hey, it's somewhere and that's all that matters

1647
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:59,160
It's south to someone

1648
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:02,040
Yeah, everywhere south to canadian

1649
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:04,440
canadia

1650
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:09,560
I don't I don't know what a finished accent sounds like he said he said the worst accent is a finished

1651
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:14,200
His accent was he finished? I don't think he was that he was finished. Yeah

1652
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,560
I guess I think he was french because he took such issue with me

1653
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:20,280
mispronouncing french

1654
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:25,080
But who knows he didn't sound I couldn't I couldn't quite tell I don't actually know what finish sounds like

1655
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:27,720
I know what swedish people talking english sounds like

1656
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,520
I had um, he didn't sound finish

1657
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:33,320
There was a girl in my high school who was french

1658
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,720
But she didn't I mean she didn't have an accent or anything

1659
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,520
When I was when I've like met french people

1660
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:41,880
I don't know like there's a very like sort of cartoony idea of like uh-huh

1661
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:46,840
Monsieur that like sounds very french, but when I've actually met french people and heard them talk

1662
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:50,520
They don't sound like that. They just have like a things are not like a much

1663
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:56,680
They have a much less recognizable accent that I honestly have a hard time differentiating from like a german accent

1664
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:01,720
I mean france is a very big country. There's probably multiple dialects that they have

1665
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:06,280
I know I know a bit of it's like english, right? Well, yeah, but english

1666
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:09,480
No, yeah, I guess it would be

1667
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:16,840
Accent like sheffield. I've got uh, I've got relatives in canada who speak french, but I don't speak french myself

1668
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,400
french canadian cock and bush

1669
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:22,440
That's not terrible. It's awful. That's god awful

1670
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,880
um

1671
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:28,600
spaghetti

1672
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:35,080
That's italian. Wee wee spaghetti por favor. Wee wee spaghetti marion prussian

1673
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:37,800
Arigato gozaimasu

1674
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:40,120
Thank god for brexit because otherwise

1675
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:47,320
Otherwise, uh, they would they would be easily able to travel over to the uk and kill me

1676
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:54,680
But no longer they would like nothing more than to do the the pcp sleeper cells are on their way

1677
02:01:56,840 --> 02:02:01,000
Um, okay, the next the next voicemail is called um

1678
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,880
Dana wilson, okay

1679
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,040
three two one go

1680
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:10,200
So my husband of 14 years is super bummed out

1681
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:15,960
Uh, he had me do one of those Kawasaki scroll things and like the tiny like

1682
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:24,680
But I he just handed me like a piece of paper and said I need you to read this and then threw the phone in my face and so

1683
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:28,520
You guys only like did a second of it and he was like

1684
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:32,680
I mean, I guess it was appropriate, but like I'm kind of bummed out

1685
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:39,480
And so I feel really bad. I just kind of wanted to let you guys know that like we're happy. It's over

1686
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:41,880
If it if it's actually over

1687
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:43,320
They still really sad though

1688
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:47,800
So if you could just I guess do a voicemail shout out it took me and you know

1689
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:51,240
It's funny is the only way that I figured out who you guys were because I said, oh

1690
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:54,680
What what's the show thing that you like and he's like, oh, it's procrastinators

1691
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:00,040
The only way I figured out how to find this website was by entering Kawasaki scroll

1692
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,840
And I don't believe that's how I figured out

1693
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,400
What your whole podcast was called?

1694
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:10,680
So yeah, just shout out to my sad mopey husband. Oh, shit

1695
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:16,040
Oh, he's coming back. Anyways. Yeah, just just in secret letting you guys know. Okay. Bye

1696
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,320
That's that's epic

1697
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:25,240
I don't remember my head. Do you get it give? Um, well, it's one of those one of those samurai scroll

1698
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:27,880
Things there was a high pitched voice

1699
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:32,120
And we didn't I can't remember if I was there even but I remember it

1700
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:38,120
And was this from a voicemail last week voicemail last week or the week before or something and um

1701
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:42,600
At that point the whole Kawasaki scroll ninja scroll thing

1702
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:47,160
Uh was sort of played out and we were kind of tired of it. So I think we may have skipped it

1703
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,680
That's course

1704
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:50,680
So, I don't know

1705
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:56,200
Uh, I uh, that has not explained it. Big gomenosai to this feels like so this feels like a

1706
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:59,400
hugely meta like big brain like step

1707
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:05,080
That I feel like part one of six of a new arc and I'm not I'm worried

1708
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:09,400
I do you think someone who watches the pcp has been married for 13 years

1709
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:11,880
I like I get gib I

1710
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:17,000
Yes, I under obviously I understand that this is connected to the samurai because it references the

1711
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:21,880
Kawasaki scrolls, but other than that, I I do not understand how it relates at all

1712
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:24,920
Well, we're gonna need a lecture on the samurai thing

1713
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:30,040
I mean the the reason it's gotten so confusing is because I think

1714
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:34,760
Like I'm still not even sure that there were multiple people trying to be

1715
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:37,400
the Kawasaki scroll ninja like

1716
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:44,120
Cool funny well the samurai said last time that that's not true and that it yeah

1717
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:49,240
Is at least mostly all one person so like this person who who who had his wife do a bit

1718
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:54,040
And maybe it wasn't the original and he was trying to make it like I'm gonna do this thing

1719
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:59,400
There's no wife. This is this is a fiction. You've been duped. Huh?

1720
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:02,440
I refuse to believe that this is someone's wife

1721
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:08,520
Yeah, me too. Yeah, at least in this context. I'm yeah, maybe he's happily married. How can that?

1722
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:13,320
Why is that the most confusing part? No one who listens to the pcp could be happily married

1723
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:16,520
And there's no way a pcp fan would be married

1724
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,200
This is um, yeah

1725
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:25,960
All right. Yeah, okay. It's too much. It's too much. I can't let's just say let's just say the pineapple is upside down

1726
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:30,920
Yeah, exactly

1727
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:37,960
Yeah, there it is. I hope so. I hope so DMs are open. She sounded cute. She had a cute voice, so

1728
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:39,960
You know

1729
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:42,760
Uh hit hit me up hit me in the DM

1730
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:47,880
No hitting my DMs. I said pineapple first. No, no kill give no kill give

1731
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:53,960
Um, next one is called. Um wandering through dead fandom. Oh, this one's long

1732
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:57,400
Yeah, three two one go

1733
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:00,120
so I've been uh

1734
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:05,080
replaying some old video games that I never really got around to experiencing and uh

1735
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:09,640
One of those games was shadow of the claustus. I played the ps4 remake and

1736
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:12,280
I've run into a bit of a problem where

1737
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:15,640
The game's so good and I really want to talk about it

1738
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:20,600
But everybody's been talking about it for like 20 plus years or whatever it is. Yeah, and so

1739
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:27,560
They like everybody knows everything about it. There's nothing that I can add to the conversation. Yeah, so like

1740
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:34,360
I feel this there there's like an avoid in my soul of talking about something that's really cool

1741
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:38,520
That I just can't fill because nobody wants to talk about the 20 year old game, you know

1742
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:43,160
Uh, so I'm wondering. Uh, is there anything that you've experienced?

1743
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:49,800
Far beyond its popularity that made you feel that way that left that pit inside your being

1744
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:52,920
Of expression of passion

1745
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:56,280
Um, also mr. Saints. I want to apologize

1746
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:02,600
Few episodes ago. I was I uh, I was naive. I hadn't been up on the

1747
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:10,280
The lore and such and I I just went ahead and uh sent in a voicemail about foreskin and I uh,

1748
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,840
I want to apologize for adding to the

1749
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:18,360
You should we were doing so good. I appreciate I appreciate the apology. No, no, it's all abysmal

1750
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:23,560
Beating of that dead horse. Absolutely disgraceful. Yeah, I'm good. I'm beating

1751
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:27,960
My foreskin just the foreskin though. Well, I don't have that

1752
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:30,840
Oh

1753
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:39,800
So with regards to that the only thing that comes close for me is I got into the game of thrones tv show

1754
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:43,720
Um, well after it had been going

1755
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:51,640
And I got like up to it was like the the last the second till the last season was coming out

1756
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:56,360
I think or like the the second to last season was wrapping up and I was getting into the show

1757
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:59,240
And I was learning about all the stuff that had been talked about

1758
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:04,280
Four years prior to this and I was like, oh now I get what they were all talking about

1759
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,560
But I didn't feel like an empty void in my soul. I don't know

1760
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:13,560
Um, it's it's fine to just talk about something to no one, isn't it?

1761
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:17,880
Just make a blog. I think this person will find that um that like

1762
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:25,800
Even if what they're saying isn't exactly new fans of whatever will will just like the fact that you're into it as well

1763
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:27,960
I

1764
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:33,320
When I made the sonichu lecture, I was like, this is all well worn ground. Everybody already knows this stuff

1765
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:40,840
Like none of what I none of what I say is new. Yeah. Yeah, but I really like that's true of like literally literally every fucking video on youtube

1766
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:46,200
Is someone like looked up some shit on wikipedia and just like wrote it down and then like read it to you

1767
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:48,600
Like nothing is new

1768
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:53,800
Right. Nothing. I'm having a similar sort of problem that he had

1769
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:58,600
Uh, we're like, I'm coming to something so late like I'm working on a video right now

1770
02:08:58,680 --> 02:09:03,720
And I'm talking about like a bunch of like these old these like pretty old games that are critically acclaimed

1771
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:09,720
But like at least I have like some sort of outlet to talk about that and like a youtube video or whatever

1772
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:14,760
For someone like this. I I think just talking to your friends about it would suffice just fine

1773
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
It's pretty good advice

1774
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:23,640
I often have this uh issue because uh 99 of the games I play are either 20 to 25 years old

1775
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:26,040
Yeah, so, um

1776
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:29,320
I have a friend I talked to who is also into

1777
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:33,000
Retro games and every once in a while when I play something I'll

1778
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:35,720
I'll just talk to him about it

1779
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:41,720
Um, I mean sometimes even when I replay stuff, I'll talk about it too

1780
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:46,760
Is is this person like looking to like make content out of their talk?

1781
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:50,360
Or is they or are they just like they just want to talk about it to someone

1782
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:57,560
I guess that's like they can't find a discussion to involve themselves in that that's a little different

1783
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:02,520
But yeah, that's that's unfortunate. I I feel that I don't think there are content creator

1784
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:08,200
This is this is why people will go and like be like and like make someone play a game that they like

1785
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:12,920
It's just because I need someone to talk about it with like, oh, oh, you never played. Oh, you gotta play

1786
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:18,120
I gotta I gotta live my experience. I'm pretty sure there are communities online dedicated to this sort of thing

1787
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:21,240
Like on reddit or on various forums and stuff

1788
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:27,160
I just I just watched um a video this week about like this the search for the last secret

1789
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:29,800
That's like that jaco geller video, right?

1790
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:31,880
Is that who it is?

1791
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:34,600
Um, I've heard of that video. Yeah, like blue point

1792
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:39,080
In the remake added in some sort of like urban legend thing that was yeah

1793
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:46,280
Yeah, they added a thing behind the door in the shrine of the of the the small colossus

1794
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:49,640
Yes, it's funny because they did the same thing in the demon souls remake

1795
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:51,320
Did they?

1796
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:57,960
Yeah, there was like this um, there was like this hunt to find to find like what was behind some door that was added in the remake ended

1797
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:05,800
Um, uh, it involved like playing the game and like the new like mirror mode or whatever and like finding these like

1798
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:08,360
These coins on the ground giving them to the crow

1799
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:13,880
And then you get like a key and inside of the room is uh is like the penetrator's armor

1800
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:18,120
Which is like a an armor set from that that that was from like a boss

1801
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:21,800
That wasn't really original game. It's really interesting

1802
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:24,600
It's really interesting in in the shadow of the colossus

1803
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:30,200
There's like there's really strong evidence that like a secret should be in this spot

1804
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:32,680
Like like if you hear the case laid out, it's like yeah

1805
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:38,600
It really looks like this is like a map that is pointing you towards something secret here in the spot

1806
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:41,960
It's kind of a lost art because there was a lot of stuff like that in games

1807
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:46,760
Like uh, like like the mu under the truck thing is but yeah, but there's but there's nothing

1808
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:48,120
I'm sensical

1809
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:54,840
Yeah, but like there there is a truck in that area of the game and it is weird. Why is it there?

1810
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:57,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly

1811
02:11:57,880 --> 02:12:01,960
Yeah, sometimes there's like things get removed from games before they get released

1812
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:04,680
Yeah, there's these there's these four

1813
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:06,760
points on the map

1814
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:10,040
And there's there's references to like there's references to

1815
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:12,040
Intersecting points

1816
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:18,120
And there's these four points on the map that just happen to be arranged in a perfect cross that makes a right angle with itself

1817
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:22,040
And there's a shrine exactly at the intersection of that cross

1818
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:27,240
And that shrine has this weird looking door in it that is not there for any discernible reason

1819
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:29,800
And it's like yep

1820
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:34,760
Looks like there's a secret here. That reminds me of yeah, it might be cut content

1821
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,840
It reminds me of the door and banjo kazooie and the ice key and all that stuff

1822
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:44,920
Yeah, fucking cyber shell cyber shell did a video on on like the stop and swoop stuff

1823
02:12:45,480 --> 02:12:51,560
And like that shit controlled my life for like a month. I was so obsessed with it

1824
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:55,880
I might only know about that because of cyber shells video. It's a good vid

1825
02:12:56,600 --> 02:13:01,320
Uh, I've known about that since uh the game came out because I I played it back. Yeah

1826
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:04,120
I know I wasn't an n64 kid

1827
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:07,240
So I didn't have banjo kazooie, but I know what you're talking about now

1828
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:11,080
It's it's just such a it was like such a cool idea for

1829
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:18,760
For like a secret in a game and it just like it never ended up truly being what it was meant to be which is which is a damn shame

1830
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:22,280
And that that ice key really kept me up at night

1831
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:26,200
It's it's a lost art nowadays

1832
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:31,960
You can't really you you you can't really do the same sort of stuff that you could back them because like the internet and

1833
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:35,000
Ah, shit. Sorry internet and like data mining and whatnot

1834
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:40,920
Yeah, uh, I think like the binding of isaac kind of tried to do something similar with like the lost

1835
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:47,880
But um, yeah people people like they fucking dug into the files and figured it out data minded. Yeah, I heard about that

1836
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:50,920
Much to uh edmund's uh chagrin

1837
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:56,120
Yeah, but I mean of course they were gonna do I know yeah, it's it's it's kind of like

1838
02:13:56,840 --> 02:14:02,200
It's kind of like when my like like my video got copyright strike like I'm upset, but I'm also I get it

1839
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:05,320
Yeah, yeah

1840
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:08,680
Technology is too strong

1841
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:13,240
We we uh next one next voicemail is called. Um

1842
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:15,720
Uh

1843
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:17,720
Nate's holiday message

1844
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:19,800
Okay

1845
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:22,680
I don't know what this is three two one go

1846
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:25,480
Hope you guys have a good holiday

1847

Merry christmas and all the other shit. Oh you jews

And uh have a good one

1851
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:42,200
I don't know

1852
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:44,200
See you in the new year suckers

1853
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:46,280
suck on my

1854
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:47,640
toes

1855
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:52,520
This feels like the the the bizarro version of that germa Thanksgiving message

1856
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:58,680
Oh, is that the one it's it's it's the one where it pans. Yeah with the mirror. Yeah

1857
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:03,640
Yeah, look anyone look it up if you don't know what it is you you just just watch it don't

1858
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:08,280
I will say nothing further germa. I guess we've already heard from Nate

1859
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,440
I can't remember

1860
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:13,800
All right, hang on. I I saw it this year. I don't know if it's from earlier

1861
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:17,880
It it was it he posted it like late Thanksgiving. I'm gonna

1862
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:20,760
Yeah, I'm jamey jamey pull that up

1863
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:25,560
Yeah, all right here it is

1864
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:28,040
Yeah, I've

1865
02:15:28,040 --> 02:15:30,040
Saw this on my timeline this year

1866
02:15:30,760 --> 02:15:36,920
And it was at first I thought it that was the that email was someone like splicing Nate clips together

1867
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:38,920
But I think that's just from a stream

1868
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:41,960
Or maybe like his podcast. I don't know

1869
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:44,760
I have no yeah, I don't remember that

1870
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:49,880
Yeah, I have no idea where it's from. I it might be spliced together. It might just be from somewhere

1871
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:53,800
Maybe it may be like something they would say on the stream. Yeah, it does. Yeah, it does

1872
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,400
Well, so the only way Nate will be on the pcb is through voicemails, I guess

1873
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:05,720
But he would he would he would never he would never stoop to saying it on the on the pro crass natives podcast though

1874
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,880
We have to get we have to get his second hand

1875
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:10,440
It's a deep fake ass

1876
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:18,600
I think we put like cushions in there or something. I was gonna ask is that did he just stuff it or no

1877
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:24,680
That's is that was that part of his joke or was that something someone else? No, no, that's part of the original tweet

1878
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:26,280
Okay

1879
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:31,960
Yeah, okay, but it's delivered what I mean. I think germa's probably just had like a dump truck ass this entire time

1880
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:36,680
We just never seen it. Definitely. I mean, when when would you have seen it? Yeah

1881
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:39,480
How would you know?

1882
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:43,480
That's a big reveal. I gotta start following germa 985 on twitter

1883
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:47,720
Germa's fucking great

1884
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:50,360
He's so but you are all good. Yes

1885
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:54,360
I don't know anything. That's just because you're stupid ben

1886
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:58,280
No, it's because you're no, it's no, I don't know anything because you're stupid

1887
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:05,880
Uh, that's a good point. Let me let me get the next one. Okay. The next voicemail is called

1888
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:08,760
wait

1889
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:12,200
Oh, uh, yeah, the next voicemail is called. Uh, thank you

1890
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:16,440
God, it's a minute 30 three two one go

1891
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:20,840
So to cut to the chase through all the emotional bullshit

1892
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:25,800
I really just want to know. Yeah, how do you feel about the past seven years of your life?

1893
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:28,040
me personally

1894
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:33,960
Um, it's been a nightmare. You know, I've been growing up. I was like, uh, I was in middle school when I first found

1895
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:37,640
Digi's videos and soon after, you know, within months

1896
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:44,600
Found you guys's videos and I didn't really care about anybody's videos. I just like my little pony and fan base

1897
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:50,600
But beyond that, I'm mostly I'm just wondering how do you guys feel about spending?

1898
02:17:51,320 --> 02:17:55,480
You know seven years of your lives devoted to your internet career

1899
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:58,680
I mean, obviously you've been doing it since before that

1900
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:03,160
And things have always been the same for you. They've they've changed dramatically for me

1901
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:09,480
But I understand that you live the similar lifestyle that you did back in 2012. Well, does that mean? Yeah, just

1902
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:14,920
I really enjoyed your stuff. I take it for granted way more than I should

1903
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:17,640
and just

1904
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:22,520
You know to make an interesting pcp voicemail to start a discussion like how do you feel about

1905
02:18:23,480 --> 02:18:25,480
The seven years that you've spent

1906
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:30,120
And the ride you've taken with the algorithm and how it's really affected your career

1907
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:32,680
And your outlook on things

1908
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:34,760
And how it's changed over time

1909
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:40,040
I'm really excited to know because it bring a lot of context to

1910
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:46,920
What I'm thinking it's almost done and what I'm you know, just what I'm projecting on to you. So thank you

1911
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:49,720
Well, uh

1912
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:56,280
Um, what do I think about spending the seven years doing whatever? Uh, well, I wish I had the seven years back

1913
02:18:56,760 --> 02:19:02,760
Uh, but uh, I would think that no matter how I spent them. So whatever seven years ago. That's like 2013

1914
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:07,720
2013 I don't think I started hypocrite back then. I don't even know

1915
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:09,720
No

1916
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:12,840
Seven years was like pre seven years ago was like pre teabab

1917
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:18,120
Yeah, what if 2014 was when we started pony stuff? Um

1918
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:23,640
Yeah, I don't know. I started back then I was still in 2013

1919
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:26,760
I was still pre pre like

1920
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:31,480
Further education. I was just out of like secondary school and I was like

1921
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:34,120
I don't know what I'm doing

1922
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:36,680
Now I slightly know what I'm doing. So that's good

1923
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:40,920
I have I have like talents that have grown a little bit

1924
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:43,400
And it's it's all right

1925
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:45,400
you know

1926
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:51,240
Can't complain too much. I'm making money. Is it I'm making money talking about stuff with ben saint online. It's pretty good

1927
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:53,400
Now that's the dream right there

1928
02:19:54,520 --> 02:20:00,440
Wait, didn't didn't you uh, uh, discover my stuff in 2013 or was that later?

1929
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:04,440
And I can't remember. No, it must have been later. It may have been a little later

1930
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:07,560
Not too much later though

1931
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:15,000
Because uh, I think I started this channel in 2012 and the first video I uploaded was in 2013

1932
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:19,400
I feel like I found you like maybe four years ago

1933
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:22,840
Jesse found him first right jesse and good

1934
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:24,600
Yeah

1935
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:29,800
Yeah, just see I think posted something in the chat and I looked at it and I was like, oh my god, this is really funny

1936
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:35,080
Isn't that great when you just find like a when you just find a channel

1937
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:37,880
Through the help of no one in particular

1938
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:41,960
It always feels good. It kind of feels like a it almost feels like a secret club

1939
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:45,400
Yeah, I definitely uh felt pretty good for me

1940
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:47,560
Eh

1941
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:52,600
Cool. Yeah, that's that's that's all it's also cool too when like people you people you respect

1942
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:55,400
You find out that they watch like your content. I remember um

1943
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:59,400
I remember I was watching like a running shine stream like a few months ago

1944
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:05,240
And uh, and like I was talking in this chat and he was like, oh, it's a tonic improv. I love that guy and it's like, ah

1945
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:07,080
It feels good

1946
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,320
It's nice to get validation from people you respect

1947
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:15,480
Yeah, well it was weird for me because I didn't know gib or jesse when they first left comments on my on my stuff

1948
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:23,640
And um, I checked their channels out after they left comments and I was like, whoa, these guys have a lot of subscribers and they're pretty good

1949
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:28,440
Uh, it feels real nice to get complimented by them. I suppose

1950
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:30,760
Yeah

1951
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:32,760
I'm glad it was it was nice

1952
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:37,960
So it always feels nice giving a good comment when you mean it when like I don't comment that much

1953
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:40,280
like, um

1954
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:43,960
I I always try to comment really positive things on on on channels

1955
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:50,200
Uh, just so that because like a lot of comments now suck. They're just like repeating parts of the video

1956
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:53,320
They're not very interesting. They may be positive generally

1957
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:55,160
but they're never like

1958
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:57,160
in depth enough to warrant any sort of like

1959
02:21:57,960 --> 02:21:59,960
I don't know thought

1960
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:02,040
Just sort of like

1961
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:05,560
So I like to give like a like a very appreciate

1962
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:10,920
Uh, appreciate it. Yeah, like a more in depth kind of you got shouted out by by running shine

1963
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:18,040
Yeah, we we we talk in dm sometimes or that's awesome running shine. That's awesome. I love running shine. Yeah, he's great

1964
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:19,400
Who's that?

1965
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:23,800
I want him on the podcast. He's uh, he's like I've been meaning to ask him, but I'm too chicken

1966
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:29,160
He's one of the game he he does like gaming videos. Um, he made a he made like a

1967
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:34,440
I think an hour and a half long review of that like yick game y2k

1968
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,680
That's how I found him

1969
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:37,160
Yeah

1970
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:42,680
While my friends tabby tabby nickel like linked his review and the uh, or their review because it's like a bunch

1971
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:46,840
It's a couple of people but uh, wait, wait, wait running shine is more than one person

1972
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:53,880
Yeah, yeah, um, there's uh, two people write the video uh mellow and tropics mellow is the one who like narrates them

1973
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:57,720
What and there's a couple of other people who do like the music and stuff. Yeah

1974
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:00,760
Oh, I just thought it was one dude

1975
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:05,320
Yeah, well, uh, that sounds pretty uh professional

1976
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:12,920
Yeah, it it's he's they're really funny and also informative. It's just uh

1977
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:19,320
That's a really good video the yick video like kind of blew up and that's how I've watched I've literally watched it like four times

1978
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:26,120
Because I'm stupid that reminds me of uh, I was talking to a friend of mine one time about my content and he

1979
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:29,880
He offered to write the scripts and I would do the voicing

1980
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:32,840
And I was like, uh

1981
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:39,240
I would rather do it the other way around I write the scripts and you do the voicing because uh, really I'm more of a writer

1982
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:41,240
I'm not very good at talking

1983
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:44,520
Huh, but I ended up doing everything myself

1984
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:48,120
Um, if I got a good man, if I had a good script writer

1985
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:53,480
I would love to just like read some shit that somebody else wrote because I hate writing. Um, it's boring

1986
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:57,320
Like you said, um, I hate it when it doesn't go anywhere

1987
02:23:58,440 --> 02:23:59,800
Yeah

1988
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:01,800
No, that sounds like a sweetheart deal honestly

1989
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:04,440
Uh, yeah, I'd fuck I'd do that

1990
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:11,320
Yeah, it would be cool if I could work with someone who had a good voice to read my scripts instead of doing it

1991
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:14,920
But I I have no choice to gotta use my own voice

1992
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:17,800
Tragic

1993
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:19,800
That's just uh, to me, that's your brand

1994
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,160
Well, it is now it's so integral to your brand

1995
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:26,360
Just wouldn't it wouldn't be gamers

1996
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:33,880
You're dry delivery that really sells the absurdity of what is happening in your videos just the constant barrage of the puns and jokes

1997
02:24:35,320 --> 02:24:39,560
The way wouldn't I don't know like whether it would be better if it was someone else's voice at this point

1998
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:46,360
Are you guys ready for the next voicemail? It's called thank you too. Oh, no again. Yeah

1999
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:48,760
Three two one go

2000
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:55,800
Also, by the way, um as an amendment horseshoe finale obliterated taken down gone

2001
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:58,600
The wwe claimed the video

2002
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:03,640
It only happened like a month ago or a month or two ago. So very recently

2003
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:07,480
Um, yeah, that legacy is tarnished forever

2004
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:12,280
It's probably never coming back because I don't think jesse wants to deal with all that

2005
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:15,880
I don't I don't really know what the process is like, but it sounds like a nightmare. So

2006
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:17,880
Yeah

2007
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:19,160
Sad day

2008
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:22,040
Um, at least we have new horizons to look at

2009
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:28,520
It's not like anybody fucking wants those horizons though. It seems like everybody's in a fucking nightmare shit hole

2010
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:33,080
Uh, no offense to you or anybody else. I mean, I'm a I'm a loser

2011
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:38,280
Compared to that. I have no room to talk not to talk about me, but just to say damn

2012
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:40,840
Sounds like a fucking nightmare

2013
02:25:41,320 --> 02:25:47,080
Uh, I don't know what he means by that like new horizons. I don't know what he means by that either

2014
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:50,040
I think he just means like the future of youtube and everyone

2015
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:56,120
It just you know one of those like pcp. That's that's really that's really reaching is dead comments. I'm not sure

2016
02:25:56,120 --> 02:26:01,800
That's that's really reaching for uh for uh for a silver lining. It's like, oh, yeah, everything sucks

2017
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:05,960
But hey at least the future will occur like yep, this too. It will

2018
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:09,080
Yeah, um

2019
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:15,720
I did did horseshoe finale get taken down. Yeah, I I heard about it a little while ago. I was like, oh, that sucks

2020
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:21,320
Um, yeah, that kind of sucks. I don't have to do another rewatch of the horseshoe reviews

2021
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:26,520
It's been a long time since I've watched them. I don't even know that maybe someone has reuploaded it

2022
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:28,760
It seems like something someone would have downloaded

2023
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:30,920
now

2024
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:35,640
I kind of thought that like the more time passed and the more times I revisited it

2025
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:42,360
The less I liked horseshoe finale. I kind of thought it was getting worse the longer it it existed

2026
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:47,800
In hindsight not to not to speak for him, but I feel like jesse would probably agree

2027
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:52,360
I don't think he's particularly proud of of a lot of his videos

2028
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:56,600
Maybe horseshoe finale is different because you know, it's it's horseshoe finale. It was very cathartic

2029
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
um as

2030
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,600
It was happening because it was like take making fun of people

2031
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:06,760
Like josh scorcher who is like so irrelevant now. It doesn't matter

2032
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:11,000
It's one of the it feels like one of those you had to be there kind of

2033
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:16,760
It at the at the time it was an it was like a very impactful statement that meant a lot

2034
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:20,360
To a bunch of people now. It's like, yeah

2035
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:25,240
Removed from that context. It's a very strange cultural artifact

2036
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:31,320
Well ever since I was cool in its own way actually actually describing it like that makes me like it more

2037
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:35,720
Ever since I discovered jesse's content. I've been a big fan of his so

2038
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:40,920
It does bother me to see anything. He's done be taken down. Yeah

2039
02:27:41,720 --> 02:27:43,720
It's a bummer. Um

2040
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:45,640
Wait, there was

2041
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:50,600
Was there something else to the voicemail? No, it was just like horseshoe finale gone. Also new horizons

2042
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:54,520
I thought he was talking about animal crossing for a second a little bit

2043
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:58,200
Like someone made like a horseshoe finale for animal crossing

2044
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:05,080
Oh, I want that would be interesting cult corona in in animal crossing. Is he in there?

2045
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:08,360
Can I be in this got to be a horse?

2046
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:15,480
There's no horse. What's the point? Well, there's got to be a horse

2047
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:19,400
But it's cult corona. Is there a horsey sauce?

2048
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:25,560
Wide a long face

2049
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:31,560
Let's let's let's let's move on to new horizons. The next voicemail is called

2050
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:38,040
Uh, well, it's a youtube link. So I guess let's just listen to it three two one go

2051
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:44,680
So pcb. I'm just here to chill amori, which is one of the most pcb core things I've seen in a while

2052
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:51,400
It releases on christmas and it's on steam and I think it will be pretty good amori

2053
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:55,720
It's it's like a it's like a oh, I've seen like rpg

2054
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:59,160
Okay, I've seen um this around

2055
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:07,640
Is this pcp core? I don't know. It's kind of like earthbound core or like yume niki core, which I feel like aligns with

2056
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:15,480
PCP looks like yeah, I've seen it around and I thought it looked like it could be neat. Um, yeah

2057
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:21,160
Okay, that's fair. He looks all right. I like come out because I'm always a big fan of interesting

2058
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:24,360
Art bits here and there

2059
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:26,840
I'm always a big fan of earthbound

2060
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:30,520
Whenever I see whenever I see like a Kickstarter game

2061
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:37,480
That's like, you know getting updated and like I just kind of start ignoring it because I'm like, you know

2062
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:40,680
Maybe I'll hear about it when it's done in like four years

2063
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:43,640
And until then I don't care

2064
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:48,920
Spooky slow ghosts. Oh shit. There he is. There he is. Are you gonna sue?

2065
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:53,960
Uh, no, I'm gonna sue for peace. I'm gonna give them money

2066
02:29:54,680 --> 02:30:03,480
Uh, uh, okay, uh, uh, okay, everyone. Uh, shut the fuck up. Uh, the next one is called, uh, the next upload is called

2067
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:05,640
Everyone is fuda

2068
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:07,800
three two one go

2069
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:13,400
I've been thinking about my question is digi fuda and I've come to the realization

2070
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:17,560
That penises are just inside out vaginas

2071
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:20,280
We all have a vagina in us

2072
02:30:20,680 --> 02:30:24,680
And I guess because vaginas are disinverted penises, that's right

2073
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:31,480
Then all girls just have penises inside them, which I guess means they're being raped assuming they don't want

2074
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:35,080
Their own dicks inside them without their own content

2075
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:38,840
But anyway, uh, I think that makes

2076
02:30:39,480 --> 02:30:47,480
Everyone a fuda girls are just constantly being fucked by themselves because their own penis is all up inside of their vagina

2077
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:50,040
That's such a stupid like

2078
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:52,520
Like it means nothing

2079
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:57,000
I don't I think it's a joke. I know it's a joke and it made me and it made me laugh

2080
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:01,560
So you know what it worked. Good job. I guess we know who is the philosophy major

2081
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:07,240
Yeah, yeah sounds like me sounds just like me

2082
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:15,640
Okay, that was great. Hey, love you. Next one is called voice voice grail. No voice grail. No contestant contestant

2083
02:31:15,720 --> 02:31:18,120
Okay, damn. Damn it. No, I'm not feeling it

2084
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:24,920
Next one is called read theory libs. I'm excited for this one. Uh, this is gonna be good

2085
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:31,960
This one's goes out to fucking michelle's put down your fuck put down your jordan peterson mary condo bullshit and pick up some fucking

2086
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:34,200
Pick up das kapital

2087
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:36,200
three two one go

2088
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:45,560
Go on it's difficult for me to imagine what personal liberty is enjoyed by an unemployed hungry person

2089
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:49,240
True freedom can only be where there is no exploitation

2090
02:31:49,960 --> 02:31:51,640
or oppression

2091
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:57,240
Of one person by another where there is not unemployment and where a person is not living in fear of losing his job

2092
02:31:57,560 --> 02:31:59,560
His home and his bread

2093
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:04,360
Only in such a society and in any other freedom can exist for real and not on paper

2094
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:06,440
Is this from running your communist? That is from

2095
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:09,160
probably economic terrorism and

2096
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:11,640
the oil owners

2097
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:13,640
uh april 21st 1908

2098
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:16,520
By joseph fucking stallin

2099
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:19,160
fucking based

2100
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:25,560
Fucking just absolutely based. Yeah, amazing theory. I mean, yeah guys born in the 1800s

2101
02:32:26,440 --> 02:32:29,560
Rob's banks overthrows an evil king kills fucking nazis

2102
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:35,960
Yep, creates space travel or well, you know sets up the organization that creates space travel

2103
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:42,760
Wait, yeah, and it's what you're saying is stalling. It just blows my mind how fucking based it is

2104
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:45,880
He'll edit you out of pictures though if he doesn't like you

2105
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:48,760
Didn't yeah stallin

2106
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:51,080
And hitler team up in that war

2107
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:55,720
In the beginning they can't uh the relationship soured

2108
02:32:56,760 --> 02:33:00,680
Well, uh, nobody's perfect. What am I thinking? Yeah, no one's perfect

2109
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:04,760
Look, we all make mistakes

2110
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:10,600
I guess um, they did they did kill a lot of nazis though the soviet union did uh do a lot of that

2111
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:13,880
Which is pretty basic. I think we need to yeah, we just need to like measure

2112
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:20,360
Like and I mean, that's good theory. That's good theory. Well, uh, he was spitting straight facts there

2113
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:25,320
You know, you can't you can't deny. It's like there's there's no way that this can exist without oppression

2114
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:30,440
And that's the just the way I like it. You know, that's what they said theory

2115
02:33:31,640 --> 02:33:33,640
I don't think so

2116
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:38,040
What are they what what did they say what did they say?

2117
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:41,880
Well, they say nothing. Thanks for watching

2118
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:44,600
Okay

2119
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:49,080
There's a good way to wrap that one. Oh, that's that's his next challenge to nothing wrong. Dab, dab, dab

2120
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:53,640
Matt's gonna do a new channel or it's gonna be hey guys. Welcome to theory to

2121
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:56,120

2131
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:41,000
You know mousselini is the italian fascist. Yes, and he was with hitler and they were with japan and we were able to okay

2132
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:43,320
Stalin is different man different man

2133
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:49,320
Well, apparently I mean apparently they was he all right. I didn't I actually didn't know that

2134
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:53,000
Now you're just stalin for time. I am

2135
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:58,520
I just want to clarify because uh, I just want to make sure people know that i'm stupid and that we can move on

2136
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:03,720
Okay, well, apparently you're smarter than me because I thought they

2137
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:08,120
Never did that but apparently they did accidentally smart

2138
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:11,400
Listen, anyone getting their theory from the pro cast in the air's podcast

2139
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:14,840
Look, what did we say everything? What did we say before?

2140
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:18,920
We're always right and we always have an opinion and you always have to listen to it

2141
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:22,840
And you should always always always clip it and quote it out of context

2142
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:25,880
And take it as fact

2143
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:28,680
Maybe you guys should read some history books

2144
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:33,080
Maybe you should clean your fucking room

2145
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:35,960
Yeah

2146
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:42,760
Next next one it's called dag zagals is coming for yo gummies

2147
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:45,400
three two one go

2148
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:52,440
Ben since you're so worried about people getting their student debt cancelled and subsidized by the taxpayer

2149
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:59,160
Why don't you just go ahead and get yourself incorporated so you can get your stupid goddamn keto gummies?

2150
02:35:59,960 --> 02:36:08,040
Subsidized by the taxpayer because it only costs like 150 to 250 dollars to become incorporated

2151
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:13,960
And after that you can write off literally everything related to your goddamn keto gummies

2152
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:16,600
As an expense

2153
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:22,360
And then you will also be forced to sell them so I could buy them and enjoy some of these delicious keto gummies

2154
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:28,280
That you are allegedly producing like a mad scientist and also you need to write down everything

2155
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:30,600
You're fucking morian

2156
02:36:30,920 --> 02:36:36,360
You dingus write down everything like a mad scientist like a mad alchemist

2157
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:39,560
Attempting to turn lead into gold

2158
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:42,200
It will be the newton

2159
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:44,520
A key to go down last time don't worry

2160
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:46,920
Just start writing it down turning a lead

2161
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:53,560
Fucking slime corp and then a government office has to have documents about an actual business called slime corp

2162
02:36:53,960 --> 02:36:57,000
Water just do it so malt oligosaccharides

2163
02:36:57,800 --> 02:37:04,680
I some not yes, that's nice. Yes. I I some alt oligosaccharides aka. I am. Oh, that would be a really funny

2164
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:11,640
Cool idea like if if ben like started a business literally called it slime corp and made keto gummies

2165
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:15,480
Under a sliver just make the champion chapter two

2166
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:18,680
Yeah, or maybe I could just do that

2167
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:23,000
um, um, okay, I mean the thing like I all

2168
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:28,360
Since I like have sort of tentative plans to maybe sell candy in the future

2169
02:37:28,440 --> 02:37:34,440
I'm already planning to write off all my gummy related expenses. Anyway, so like whatever. I don't I don't need to be incorporated for that

2170
02:37:35,080 --> 02:37:36,200
um

2171
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:37,480
Uh

2172
02:37:37,480 --> 02:37:40,200
Other than that I actually have not been making the keto ones

2173
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:43,240
I've just been off keto and I've just been making like sugar gummies

2174
02:37:43,480 --> 02:37:47,800
I like to the ones you shared on twitter recently the ones that look very opaque. They look good

2175
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:50,520
Those ones came out really good

2176
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:56,200
But and I and I and I part of me wants to try and replicate that recipe but

2177
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:58,520
I made those with sugar

2178
02:37:58,520 --> 02:38:02,520
But I kind of think that maybe I should switch to using syrup like glucose syrup

2179
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:05,400
I think it might result in a smoother product

2180
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:08,520
Um, because those ones were pretty good

2181
02:38:09,240 --> 02:38:14,680
They were like 95 of the way there. I think switching to syrup might get me the last

2182
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:19,720
The last way there. I don't know. Maybe you should quit comics and just make candy

2183
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:23,800
That's like the opposite of what tectonic improv said

2184
02:38:25,240 --> 02:38:27,880
Yeah, please don't so one of you is wrong

2185
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:31,240
And time will tell

2186
02:38:31,480 --> 02:38:33,480
Who do I shoot?

2187
02:38:34,360 --> 02:38:36,360
Whoever wins we lose

2188
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:38,600
Next

2189
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:43,240
Next one is called next one is oh next one is riddle my ass batman. He's back

2190
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:48,200
He's back, baby. I'm honored to be on an episode riddle my ass batman

2191
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:57,160
I had I had a funny exchange with riddle my ass batman in the comments on the last episode because riddle my ass batman had pledged to the vapor's two kickstarter

2192
02:38:57,880 --> 02:39:01,880
For like a lot. He had gotten like two signed copies, but he had never responded to the

2193
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:04,920
Thing and I had messaged him on kickstarter and I never got a response

2194
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:12,200
So he commented on the last episode. So I just replied to his comment being like, hey, what's what's your mailing address?

2195
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:15,080
Like what's your like like what do you want on your doodles?

2196
02:39:15,160 --> 02:39:18,440
And he I didn't ask what I like I didn't expect him to reply there

2197
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:23,160
But he replied there in the comments like with his mailing. Yes, he did

2198
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:29,160
I I copied the the address and I removed the comments like because like okay

2199
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:33,880
He said like oops, I did dox myself, but he didn't remove the comments. I had to do it

2200
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:40,760
But I got it. I got the request so it's all good. That's good. Okay, three two one go

2201
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:45,960
I know I'm someone who promises new voicemails a lot

2202
02:39:46,680 --> 02:39:52,840
But this time I promise and if I don't deliver you can cut off the end up

2203
02:39:53,320 --> 02:39:55,320
Ben sains dick and circumcise them. Okay

2204
02:39:55,960 --> 02:40:03,160
You're delivering it right now. There'll be a new voicemail series the quest for cold corona coming out speaking of cold corona first of this year

2205
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:09,720
Now I already have all 26 episodes recorded. Oh my god written out. So I ought to do his record every week, you know

2206
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:14,280
Not big deal. What I have to ask is I want to do a comic alongside it. Oh my god

2207
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:17,560
The comic is not finished, but I think I can keep up with demands as I go

2208
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:20,040
So should I do

2209
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:23,800
One week of voicemails one week of comics or should I release all the comics?

2210
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:26,760
in the first half of the year and then

2211
02:40:27,560 --> 02:40:31,400
The voicemail and first voicemails in the first half of the year and in the comics during the second half of the year

2212
02:40:31,880 --> 02:40:35,880
Thoughts discussion and there's a funny voicemail coming after this to whet your whistle. Okay

2213
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:42,120
Same time same piece you can't I can't I can't believe it. I'm just gonna say this as a as a viewer

2214
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:47,240
Slash us unfortunately a fan of the pro kresners podcast

2215
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:53,400
Whatever you have planned riddle my ass batman is too good for this podcast. Just release it separately

2216
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:58,520
I would say okay if if I would

2217
02:40:59,480 --> 02:41:00,920
I would say one of each

2218
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:03,240
I would just say just if you've got if you've got

2219
02:41:04,200 --> 02:41:06,200
If you've got both just release one of each

2220
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:11,080
Uh, it would be my recommendation. It sounds like way too much. I mean the voice mails would be like a good

2221
02:41:12,040 --> 02:41:14,040
Prompt to go look at the comic

2222
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:17,400
If you have like another issue if that's that's true

2223
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:21,800
So it'd be like, oh, we'll listen to the voicemail and then remind everyone to go look at the comic

2224
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:23,560
I think that would work

2225
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:28,120
Sounds like way too much effort for voicemail. I know you should just create actual contact

2226
02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:30,840
26 episodes

2227
02:41:31,720 --> 02:41:37,800
He's got them recorded already. He's basically making a show and we're the broadcast network

2228
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:42,360
Yeah, that's basically it

2229
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:45,720
That's that'd be 26 weeks

2230
02:41:47,240 --> 02:41:48,600
God

2231
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:50,120
Damn

2232
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:51,480
I

2233
02:41:51,480 --> 02:41:53,160
Get excited

2234
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:56,840
It is too good for us. There's no question. There's no question

2235
02:41:58,040 --> 02:41:59,480
um

2236
02:41:59,480 --> 02:42:02,360
Yeah, I I like that. I like the idea that you released

2237
02:42:03,240 --> 02:42:07,720
Okay, I was assuming at first that like the comic and the voicemail were the same

2238
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:13,480
Like it's a comic version of the voicemail in which case I would say release them together if they're separate things

2239
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:18,440
Then yeah, I guess I guess still like just release one on your

2240
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:24,040
Website or on tapas or wherever you're posting it and then we'll hear the voicemail and it'll be a

2241
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:28,680
Reminder to check out the comic that yeah, that sounds reasonable

2242
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:33,720
Let's let's hear. Let's hear the first one. Let's hear his fucking voicemail

2243
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:37,560
The next one is also called riddle my ass batman. Here we go. Let our whistles

2244
02:42:38,360 --> 02:42:40,360
three two one go

2245
02:42:40,760 --> 02:42:47,720
As promised the funny voicemail now. I got I know you guys play dream stories and here's a good one

2246
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:51,720
Uh, I was being raped by donatella. Oh my god

2247
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:57,720
He's like, hey, man. They be sick of those tits and then uh, I was like, no donatella

2248
02:42:57,800 --> 02:43:02,680
No, am I you know like where my ass batman voice? I was like like I was really dreaming as sort of my ass batman

2249
02:43:03,160 --> 02:43:05,160
And then cold corona

2250
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:06,920
came in and

2251
02:43:06,920 --> 02:43:12,120
He kicked donatella's ass joined in and then started raping him. So uh

2252
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:17,640
That's calm. Yeah, and then I woke up. That's about all I have to say. Yeah. I uh, yeah

2253
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:23,880
Got raped by cold corona because donatella's trying to rape me and cold corona's a hero and thank you. Thank you

2254
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:26,440
Co-corona you uh saved me from dream rape

2255
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:34,520
You're a hero. God bless. Thank god. Let's be my horseman. Okay. Thank you. See you time. Thank you. Bye

2256
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:41,880
I'm so glad. So I have one big problem with this with this voicemail. Uh, the corona cannot be donatello

2257
02:43:43,160 --> 02:43:46,760
You don't think so. No, but he's the cutest and the strongest remember

2258
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:49,480
He is the cutest and the strongest

2259
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:53,720
That's true. That's true. Um, uh, I don't know

2260
02:43:53,960 --> 02:43:55,560
I mean

2261
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:58,600
In a horse really beat a turtle. No, I think he could beat him

2262
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,880
I think he could beat him if he got the upper hand if he got the drop on him

2263
02:44:01,880 --> 02:44:04,760
Like if donatello was in the middle of like a really choice rape

2264
02:44:05,320 --> 02:44:11,880
Uh that he was distracted enough by I think I think cold corona could use that to do his ambush tactics

2265
02:44:11,960 --> 02:44:16,200
You're right. It's not a fair fight. It's not a cold corona fights dirty

2266
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:22,360
Not as dirty as donatello not as dirty as donatello, obviously

2267
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:27,340
That's a good point. Remember my ass batman. I'm sorry that happened

2268
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:30,840
Well, is this the dream?

2269
02:44:31,320 --> 02:44:35,960
I don't know, but you know, it's a nightmare. I guess it's this it's all you can say. It was a prophecy

2270
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:39,240
I guess it did have a happy ending

2271
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:42,920
He didn't that's true. That's true. God blesses everyone

2272
02:44:44,280 --> 02:44:45,320
um

2273
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:49,720
Next voicemail is called poop balls lemal

2274
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:52,600
I'm lovin this two

2275
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:53,720
one

2276
02:44:53,720 --> 02:44:55,720
ago

2277
02:44:57,880 --> 02:44:59,880
Yes

2278
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:07,000
I accept what was up with that life for some apology. Yes, but you

2279
02:45:10,120 --> 02:45:14,200
You resist I did I not forgive for that

2280
02:45:15,320 --> 02:45:17,320
Fuck you

2281
02:45:17,640 --> 02:45:19,640
So

2282
02:45:21,800 --> 02:45:24,920
I think I think that's the original man a person

2283
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:29,960
Yeah, definitely. I just want to say the samurai is definitely my favorite

2284
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:35,720
PCP voicemail character all the other all the other ones they're junk not a fan

2285
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:39,240
But every single time there's this non sequitur email and it's like

2286
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:45,880
Konnichiwa. I lose it. I just lose it. It's so good the samurai. Yeah, it's just it's it's it's half the voice

2287
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:52,600
Right, like it's the the the the konnichiwa and the until next time is like, it's so satisfying

2288
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:57,400
It's it's just whatever happens in between those two things is fine. Thank you

2289
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:01,400
Well, he's thank you samurai. He's basically a member now, right?

2290
02:46:02,040 --> 02:46:06,360
Thank you for not forgiving me. I'm a little shocked that there's been no fan art of the samurai

2291
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:09,240
Like he's he's been such a fixture

2292
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:15,800
I guess there's been no like mention of any descriptive things. There's no items that you could have

2293
02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:18,120
He's just a samurai. Yeah

2294
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:24,760
He's just a samurai and he and he scrolls. I guess he has scroll. Oh, yeah, he doesn't know. He doesn't have a scroll. That's right

2295
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:28,920
That's distinctive, right? Like a samurai without a scroll like

2296
02:46:29,640 --> 02:46:35,080
Like I've never heard a subscriber character as being like like. Oh, yeah, and he doesn't have this

2297
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:42,120
Okay, so so so look draw him being sad about the fact that he doesn't have something that and his hand is open

2298
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:44,120
But there's nothing looking looking

2299
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:47,800
Looking wistfully at his at at something

2300
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:54,520
That is gone. He's got like an perfectly scroll shaped space on his shelf that is unfilled

2301
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:57,640
That's his defining trait

2302
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:06,040
Draw him. Oh, he's also got the necronomicon draw him on a computer without any scroll bars on his windows

2303
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:08,920
Oh true

2304
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:11,720
That that's that's the real Kawasaki scroll

2305
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:18,120
The Kawasaki that's the technique is to scroll the web page real quick. Yeah scrolling on twitter

2306
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:20,600
That's the Kawasaki scroll that ben saint stole

2307
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:28,440
No, this is on twitter all the time the technique of going down the twitter feed

2308
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:32,200
All right, I've heard enough of this nonsense

2309
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:36,600
Uh, what next voicemail is called

2310
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:39,720
That is another one. Oh, yeah, you

2311
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:43,720
What you posted to but you haven't played the first no, I didn't

02:47:46,200 --> 02:47:48,200
We didn't listen to that one. Oh

2314
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:54,200
Wait, did I okay? Whatever. Okay, 5 2 3. All right, 5 2 3 is called spitting image

2315
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:56,680
3 2 1 go

2316
02:47:58,760 --> 02:48:02,360

2323
02:48:27,080 --> 02:48:29,080
Gollum made of months shooting piece

2324
02:48:29,960 --> 02:48:31,960
All the stars are here tonight

2325
02:48:32,680 --> 02:48:33,800
Okay

02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:43,720
I was gonna see sargon of

2329
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:45,560
Anita sarkeesian

2330
02:48:45,560 --> 02:48:49,720
No, the woman with the glasses and the red hair who there's all the like pictures of her screaming

2331
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:52,680
Oh, yeah, I know who you're talking about

2332
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:56,520
Yeah, I have no idea what her name is. I don't know. I never actually looked into it

2333
02:48:58,520 --> 02:49:02,120
Okay, okay, good. I'm glad she's here though. It wouldn't be the same without her

2334
02:49:02,520 --> 02:49:03,640
Um

2335
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:06,920
Next the next one is called the same joke again

2336
02:49:07,480 --> 02:49:09,480
Three two one go

2337
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:13,720
Welcome back to the pro president's podcast. Yeah, let's hear it. Virginia

2338
02:49:14,360 --> 02:49:16,360
And I would like to say to our guest

2339
02:49:17,560 --> 02:49:19,560
Jar Jar Binks

2340
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:20,280
I

2341
02:49:20,280 --> 02:49:25,960
I will respect you and your marketing genius and the and I love you and I respect you so much

2342
02:49:26,680 --> 02:49:29,960
Oh, you don't think you want Jar Jar Binks? Thank you so much

2343
02:49:33,080 --> 02:49:35,960
Next guys fucking hiv

2344
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:39,720
Wow, I don't have retards on the podcast

2345
02:49:39,720 --> 02:49:44,600
Why don't you have a cwc on quite quite literally the most famous retard of full time?

2346
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:47,480
Oh, come on. Why don't you have any on again?

2347
02:49:49,720 --> 02:49:54,440
I don't know where this is going. I don't really understand like like it's I guess it's funny

2348
02:49:54,680 --> 02:49:58,760
I feel like he's trying to make a point, but I don't know what that point is. I think the point is that

2349
02:49:59,320 --> 02:50:01,720
Well, I think he's making a point with the jar jar binks

2350
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:08,520
Uh, but I don't think hiv. I feel like hiv was improv

2351
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:13,800
Well, you know what they say everything is positive even hiv

2352
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:19,480
Is is the point that we have bad guests. Does he not like our choice of guests? I don't think that's I think

2353
02:50:20,200 --> 02:50:22,200
with with the

2354
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:22,840
um

2355
02:50:22,840 --> 02:50:24,840
Well, maybe it is but with the digi thing

2356
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:28,920
I think it was just him making fun of how digi called moralogic and marketing genius

2357
02:50:29,640 --> 02:50:31,160
Oh

2358
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:32,680
By the way, that was good

2359
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:37,880
I'm I missed that it was even about that that one was digi. Okay. Yeah, he did say digi at the beginning

2360
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:40,520
marketing marketing genius lamal

2361
02:50:41,320 --> 02:50:49,320
Uh, okay. All right. Whatever fucking great. Uh, next one is called. Uh, you have to have moralogic back on

2362
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:53,000
You have to three two one go

2363
02:50:53,960 --> 02:51:00,840
Holy shit, holy shit, you guys I remember this guy from back when he went by sato asami the first time he got banned from funny junk

2364
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:05,560
Like yeah, no, I haven't even scratched the surface here. Like not only did he get fired from his job

2365
02:51:05,640 --> 02:51:09,960
He he got fucking disowned from his family over this shit like for real

2366
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:14,040
I don't think I'm realizing this is like a prime law cow you have right here

2367
02:51:15,160 --> 02:51:21,480
Oh, well, I don't think he'll come back, right? Oh, he'll come back. He's desperate for attention, but like I don't know

2368
02:51:21,640 --> 02:51:23,640
What it I guess we okay

2369
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:29,560
Go on go on. I I gotta say like I was listening to the podcast and like it was it was funny

2370
02:51:29,720 --> 02:51:37,160
It was funny the stuff he was saying until it wasn't but um, yeah, but I I got upset when he started making fun of janitors

2371
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:44,200
Not like the forum moderator janitors, but the real life janitors because yeah yours truly

2372
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Is a janitor. No shit. Yeah, that's right. I think I I I heard that mentioned on twitter

2373
02:51:51,560 --> 02:51:55,720
I clean I clean schools. I clean them. That's that's fucked up. So

2374
02:51:56,360 --> 02:52:00,600
So here I am. You do you do it for free. You do it for free. I don't do it for free

2375
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:05,160
I do it for money, but it's it's funny because I'm like cleaning light shields or whatever

2376
02:52:05,240 --> 02:52:08,920
And they just start shitting on janitors about how their lowest job ever. I'm like

2377
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:12,200
Ah, now you made a personal mere logic

2378
02:52:12,840 --> 02:52:16,840
I'm pissed. I'm pissed. It's not fun of janitors in that way is like

2379
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:20,600
It's like what are you doing? He hasn't worked very much

2380
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:23,640
Just like normal like labor

2381
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:29,400
Doesn't understand he doesn't respect it like you should because it's it's difficult and people need to do it

2382
02:52:30,120 --> 02:52:32,120
I don't think that mere logic

2383
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:36,280
Likes us very much. I don't think he will like us very much anymore

2384
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:43,320
But maybe we could get him maybe he would come back on to like defend like to argue against us to like defend himself

2385
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:46,200
Maybe we could maybe we could finagle that

2386
02:52:46,840 --> 02:52:50,360
I think it'd be funny if we everything if we frame it the right way. We could make it happen

2387
02:52:50,680 --> 02:52:53,240
I mean, I don't hate my logic. I just think there's I could be uh

2388
02:52:53,880 --> 02:52:57,320
Yeah, if I could be on an episode with on him, there would there would be kind of funny

2389
02:52:58,440 --> 02:53:03,160
I want to play gamer's tower versus mere logic. There's I get I think just those two

2390
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:05,960
just

2391
02:53:06,040 --> 02:53:08,040
The battle battle of the century

2392
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:09,320
um

2393
02:53:09,320 --> 02:53:11,320
You know, there was a lot of

2394
02:53:11,320 --> 02:53:14,280
Honestly, there was a lot of anti-mer logic sentiment going around in the comments

2395
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:19,000
But in my opinion in my opinion, he was a worthwhile guest. He was pretty funny

2396
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:23,960
Yeah, and I wouldn't I wouldn't be opposed to to a to a round around to

2397
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:26,520
uh, maybe

2398
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:27,720
um

2399
02:53:27,720 --> 02:53:29,720
Next one is called

2400
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:32,280
Next one is called red five rainbow

2401
02:53:33,160 --> 02:53:35,800
I know them three two one go

2402
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:41,640
Hey, uh, just calling in to let you guys know that you might be able to get dream as a guest on the pcp

2403
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:44,120
Since you have a connection to him through fit

2404
02:53:44,760 --> 02:53:45,880
since

2405
02:53:45,880 --> 02:53:47,560
dream knows fit because

2406
02:53:47,560 --> 02:53:54,040
It is in the challenging 25 youtubers to a fight for a $5,000 video on his second channel. So

2407
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:58,280
I don't know. Maybe dream as a guest would be cool. Um

2408
02:53:59,080 --> 02:54:01,480
It's it's funny that this voicemail comes in

2409
02:54:02,520 --> 02:54:08,120
I'm I'm new to this but dream is like some minecraft youtuber. So I assume that's how fit mc knows him

2410
02:54:08,600 --> 02:54:13,160
But um, there was actually something that came out recently about this guy that he apparently

2411
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:18,520
Like cheated or something to get uh to get like some sort of minecraft world record

2412
02:54:18,840 --> 02:54:22,840
I saw a video that was titled like our dreams

2413
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:25,800
Like speedruns cheated

2414
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:27,000
Yeah

2415
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:34,600
And I didn't watch it and like I don't I know that dream is like some guy who has become really famous like very recently

2416
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:38,680
I guess he's blown up in like the last few months and other than that

2417
02:54:39,080 --> 02:54:43,400
I just know that he's a guy who's become famous recently and he does minecraft stuff. Um

2418
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:46,440
Uh

2419
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:49,720
This is that just what a coincidence though

2420
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:54,760
Yeah, I don't I don't I don't know anything about honestly

2421
02:54:55,880 --> 02:55:01,400
For me. Yeah, it would probably be good and like a box office draw to get dream on the podcast

2422
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:04,920
He's got a lot of subscribers. I think he has like over a million

2423
02:55:05,640 --> 02:55:07,640
But I don't know who he is

2424
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:10,040
And I don't

2425
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:14,600
Know what I would care to even discuss with him. I don't I don't know uh, maybe

2426
02:55:15,160 --> 02:55:17,880
Sounds hard and I don't know what I'm gonna do it. You gotta chase the numbers, Ben

2427
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:24,280
Oh, I don't that guy. I know his uh, I think I've seen one of his videos before

2428
02:55:25,640 --> 02:55:27,640
Frankly, I'm not motivated to make it happen

2429
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:33,400
Frankly, frankly, I don't know if I give a shit. I know uh fit mc, but I never heard of dream

2430
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:36,440
They he's kind of new

2431
02:55:36,520 --> 02:55:44,600
But I do have dreams video I watched was like I'm playing minecraft and um, there's a there's like every time I get hit

2432
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:49,320
Everyone else in the server like gets launched a hundred blocks in the air and then they fall

2433
02:55:50,040 --> 02:55:53,560
And and that's the gimmick of the episode and there's other ones where he's like

2434
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:59,240
His friends are trying to kill him or like the world is crumbling and he's only got a few minutes to like try and beat minecraft

2435
02:55:59,400 --> 02:56:01,400
Just like little little things like that

2436
02:56:01,960 --> 02:56:03,960
comedy

2437
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:10,600
Cool, so what you're telling me is uh, if I want to get a lot of subscribers, I need to play minecraft, right?

2438
02:56:11,480 --> 02:56:16,680
Yeah, I mean to be I mean to be honest. I didn't know who fit mc was either until he came on

2439
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:22,040
And then I was like, okay. Well, it's a whole it's it's a section of youtube like there's lots of

2440
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:24,760
There's lots of sections of youtube that are like

2441
02:56:25,880 --> 02:56:28,200
Um cut off from others, but

2442
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:31,960
Some of them have larger audiences than others

2443
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:37,160
Yeah, sure. So like educational channels generally do very well

2444
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:42,760
Overall because it's just like interesting things like minecraft work with with zoomers a lot

2445
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:46,280
But not necessarily for

2446
02:56:46,360 --> 02:56:49,240
Uh people who don't play minecraft all the time

2447
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:51,720
No, shit

2448
02:56:52,520 --> 02:56:57,160
Just just you know, just my insight as a you know kidding. Is that is that a fact?

2449
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:00,200
Did you know? Yeah

2450
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:08,360
Just a theory, uh, all right next voicemail is called sucking dick in the street three two one go

2451
02:57:09,560 --> 02:57:14,440
Benjamin, I love you and they're my best friends, but I have something to tell you that I think my offender

2452
02:57:14,440 --> 02:57:21,240
Yeah, I think the over publicization and the overexposure to social matters of lately is probably one of the causes

2453
02:57:21,960 --> 02:57:26,040
To the creative crisis that you've been describing for many episodes now

2454
02:57:26,120 --> 02:57:31,640
I think this idea that you have to create art that's both relevant and conforming to the

2455
02:57:32,120 --> 02:57:34,360
Small window of the world that you've been consuming

2456
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:39,480
I think it's a stupid idea and it's probably creating an unachievable goal

2457
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:42,280
for you with your art

2458
02:57:42,520 --> 02:57:45,960
And poisoning you well and I think the stupid damn

2459
02:57:47,320 --> 02:57:51,240
I think I think wait wait. It's not done. I seek help seek help

2460
02:57:51,960 --> 02:57:53,960
Damn, that's that's a real show knows this though

2461
02:57:55,640 --> 02:57:56,680
Explain

2462
02:57:56,680 --> 02:58:02,440
Well, like that social media sucks. Is that what he's like saying or that way you're saying specifically

2463
02:58:03,080 --> 02:58:08,200
Like he's been saying usage of social media is the reason he's got creative drought or whatever

2464
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:14,360
He's saying it specifically in reference to me in reference to the the way that I've been talking about stuff. Yeah

2465
02:58:15,160 --> 02:58:17,160
Need to seek help from twitter

2466
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:22,040
Yeah, yeah, like the the whole like oh get off twitter, bro

2467
02:58:22,680 --> 02:58:24,680
It's like I think I think

2468
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:26,840
You know that then

2469
02:58:27,160 --> 02:58:29,160
It's it's just like. Yeah

2470
02:58:29,640 --> 02:58:36,680
I don't know. He said then done. I suppose it's I I understand. I feel a sense that in the abstract

2471
02:58:37,640 --> 02:58:44,120
My attention is not where it needs to be in order for me to be productive

2472
02:58:44,920 --> 02:58:46,920
but I don't

2473
02:58:47,800 --> 02:58:51,320
I lack I don't have like a clear like sense of like

2474
02:58:52,360 --> 02:58:56,760
Instead of what instead of me focusing on this I should be focusing on this

2475
02:58:57,800 --> 02:59:00,280
Uh, I don't have like a clear idea of like what?

2476
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:04,360
I know I should be like making stuff, but like what?

2477
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:08,520
What exactly should I be focused on? I don't know, you know to this

2478
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:15,080
I actually just last night I started in on the on a big project that I've been meaning to start in on for a long time

2479
02:59:15,800 --> 02:59:21,400
Uh, and it was kind of fun getting started on that. Um, so maybe maybe maybe things are gonna turn around for me

2480
02:59:21,480 --> 02:59:25,640
I want to uh, uh really focus on that for a little while. Uh, so I guess

2481
02:59:26,840 --> 02:59:30,120
I I just think this guy's right. I think this guy's right and I know it

2482
02:59:30,680 --> 02:59:32,680
And I think he's right too

2483
02:59:32,680 --> 02:59:39,880
Yeah, I I think I guess my problem is just that is just like the a lot of people will like say stuff like this as if they're like

2484
02:59:40,360 --> 02:59:41,640
giving you

2485
02:59:41,640 --> 02:59:48,840
Uh new info not you in particular, but just like in general. Yeah, I think well, I feel like it's it's worth saying

2486
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:50,120
in

2487
02:59:50,120 --> 02:59:55,400
Just to remind someone because like even if they say it to themselves hearing it from the outsides is like

2488
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:59,880
It's a little extra motivation to actually think about changing something

2489
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:06,600
It felt it felt personal enough to me that it didn't just feel like some some like some general like

2490
03:00:07,320 --> 03:00:09,320
General knowledge bullshit

2491
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:14,840
Oh one thing's for sure. I have been I have been describing a sort of specific crisis

2492
03:00:15,720 --> 03:00:20,440
Uh, recently for sure and getting into fights on twitter is a complete waste of time

2493
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:25,720
I will probably never quit that entirely

2494
03:00:26,680 --> 03:00:30,440
It's about it's about moderation everything in moderation

2495
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:35,720
I mean, I do like how like curt you've become instead of like

2496
03:00:36,840 --> 03:00:42,200
Like I see your applies to people and and you're like, uh gross stupid like idiot

2497
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:47,560
Like you just kind of fight and and they don't really start a response because of how like

2498
03:00:49,080 --> 03:00:54,120
I don't I don't really say anything but you do let them know that what they said was stupid

2499
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:56,360
When a tweet makes me really angry

2500
03:00:56,520 --> 03:01:03,320
The last thing I want to do is give them a reason to like continue to say what they think

2501
03:01:03,640 --> 03:01:07,400
So like to me the obvious play. Yeah is to say something

2502
03:01:07,880 --> 03:01:11,720
Say something that is that is dismissive that that diminishes what they've said

2503
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:16,520
That leaves them no room for like a serious like discussion or rebuttal to me

2504
03:01:17,240 --> 03:01:20,520
Uh, uh and and just lets me feel

2505
03:01:21,160 --> 03:01:25,080
Let's me feel as though I have harmed them in some way even if it's insignificant

2506
03:01:25,640 --> 03:01:29,880
Uh, that's all that's all I want out of a twitter fight and that's the easiest way to get it

2507
03:01:30,360 --> 03:01:34,280
It's literally like so on the on the on the quickie. I remember reading

2508
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:38,760
I was reading the quickie years ago and and it just described um a trend

2509
03:01:39,400 --> 03:01:42,680
in which like as sonichu goes on the like

2510
03:01:43,480 --> 03:01:46,920
The the series starts with villains that are like more

2511
03:01:47,560 --> 03:01:49,320
sort of fictional

2512
03:01:49,400 --> 03:01:53,240
And you know the the characters have like continuing battles against them

2513
03:01:53,320 --> 03:01:54,520
But like later on

2514
03:01:54,520 --> 03:01:59,080
Chris starts to introduce these real life people these real life trolls as antagonists

2515
03:01:59,480 --> 03:02:03,080
And as the story goes on the conflicts with these antagonists

2516
03:02:03,480 --> 03:02:06,280
They actually become shorter and less climactic

2517
03:02:06,920 --> 03:02:08,440
because

2518
03:02:08,440 --> 03:02:11,480
Do you do you know where i'm going? Have I said this before? I don't think yeah

2519
03:02:12,360 --> 03:02:14,360
Are you are you going to like

2520
03:02:14,840 --> 03:02:19,160
She was inspired by real life events. That's what she was taking them from

2521
03:02:19,320 --> 03:02:20,200
Near the end

2522
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:21,880
Is that where this is going?

2523
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:27,080
No, the the the the reason posited in this quickie article and it sounds true to me

2524
03:02:27,640 --> 03:02:33,720
Is that the the battles against these real life antagonists become shorter and less climactic because

2525
03:02:34,200 --> 03:02:35,480
chris

2526
03:02:35,480 --> 03:02:41,960
Genuinely hates them and feels genuine anger and wants to use their presence in the comic not as like

2527
03:02:43,320 --> 03:02:45,320
A narrative beat for drama

2528
03:02:45,320 --> 03:02:47,880
But because chris needs to just defeat them

2529
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:51,080
Like you know in a way that is as final and as

2530
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:55,960
And as and as you know serious and as indisputable as she can

2531
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:59,880
She just wants to feel that this person is dead and destroyed and to let her audience know

2532
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:03,400
I have won this person is lost. They are gone. They are nothing to me

2533
03:03:03,720 --> 03:03:07,800
Which is why someone like ian brandon anderson will show up for exactly one panel

2534
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:13,560
Before sonichu just will utterly obliterate him in a single blow and then he gets dragged down to hell by trolls

2535
03:03:13,560 --> 03:03:17,880
And that's the last you ever hear of him because that was like such a serious conflict that it was like

2536
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:23,800
There's no fun and games here. There's no this is not like a ha ha. This is a villain like oh, we're rivals with each other

2537
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:30,680
No, fuck this person. I kill them. That's what needs to happen. The monsters and that's how I feel

2538
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:35,960
When I see some dipshit on twitter say, uh, I don't know

2539
03:03:38,680 --> 03:03:43,160
Whatever I don't know man. This uh, this sounds kind of like school shooter talk to me

2540
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:47,320
You sound kind of like school shooter talk to me

2541
03:03:47,960 --> 03:03:50,440
I should shoot you for saying something like that

2542
03:03:50,920 --> 03:03:52,920
I could shoot you

2543
03:03:57,080 --> 03:03:59,640
Next voicemail are we done? How many more do we have?

2544
03:04:00,440 --> 03:04:06,520
Only like four I think four or five cool. We're getting there. Um

2545
03:04:08,120 --> 03:04:13,160
Next one is called mr. Miracle. Wait, why wait, why was that last one called sucking dick in the street?

2546
03:04:13,720 --> 03:04:15,560
I

2547
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:22,680
It's evocative against the people going. It's true. It drew my eye. Okay. This one's called mr. Miracle three two one go

2548
03:04:23,880 --> 03:04:26,040
Hey, Ben, I have a comic book recommendation for you

2549
03:04:26,120 --> 03:04:31,160
It's called Mr. Miracle by Tom King. Tom King is one of the biggest names on mainstream comics right now

2550
03:04:31,560 --> 03:04:37,320
And mr. Miracle is a DC comic character created by Jack Kirby a huge visionary

2551
03:04:37,720 --> 03:04:39,960
She's made freedom mention him on the last episode

2552
03:04:40,520 --> 03:04:44,840
But you don't really need to know anything about DC comics continuity to to get into it

2553
03:04:44,920 --> 03:04:50,840
It reminds me of the champion that you mentioned you were interested in writing again has sort of

2554
03:04:51,480 --> 03:04:53,480
some thematically

2555
03:04:53,480 --> 03:04:59,320
Some similarities it's about this guy who's a literal champion from this cosmic kingdom

2556
03:05:00,360 --> 03:05:05,240
But um, it has a lot of emotional depth to it and and the art I think is pretty good

2557
03:05:05,880 --> 03:05:07,880
I think you might might like

2558
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:09,800
Give it like a

2559
03:05:09,800 --> 03:05:11,400
seven out of ten

2560
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:12,920
Look look it up

2561
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:16,840
Seven out of ten would you recommend the seven out of ten? I guess I have before

2562
03:05:18,280 --> 03:05:19,560
um

2563
03:05:19,560 --> 03:05:22,680
You know numbers are very hard to know what they mean true

2564
03:05:23,480 --> 03:05:29,720
If it's like seven out of ten in general, but I think this person would really appreciate what's good about it

2565
03:05:29,800 --> 03:05:31,800
Maybe yeah, all right. Yeah fair enough

2566
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:34,200
I've never heard of this though

2567
03:05:34,280 --> 03:05:40,680
I've heard of mr. Miracle. I know absolutely nothing about him. Yeah, I guess he's a super escape artist

2568
03:05:41,640 --> 03:05:43,960
This is like his power. Oh like Houdini

2569
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:47,480
Or like chris angel mind freak

2570
03:05:48,360 --> 03:05:55,720
Powers and abilities like all the new gods scott free is function. I guess his name is scott free is functionally immortal

2571
03:05:56,520 --> 03:05:59,720
Uh, superhuman strength ability reflects a stamina

2572
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:02,840
resistance to blah blah blah blah

2573
03:06:03,160 --> 03:06:05,160
Genius level intellect

2574
03:06:05,480 --> 03:06:07,480
Oh, he was he was trained

2575
03:06:07,720 --> 03:06:13,080
This this fucking sentence scott was trained by granny goodness as an arrow trooper

2576
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:17,320
Well, you know, he's he's a man for the job

2577
03:06:17,880 --> 03:06:24,440
I'm not that into comics, but I can never take me like granny goodness seriously whenever she'd show up in like the

2578
03:06:24,680 --> 03:06:27,080
Justice League cartoon or whatever. I'd be like

2579
03:06:27,720 --> 03:06:33,320
We really using we're really using someone called granny goodness. I take I take gorilla grot over her

2580
03:06:34,200 --> 03:06:35,800
Wait, is he a

2581
03:06:35,800 --> 03:06:42,120
Okay, he's a good guy. Why was he trained by yeah, he might have defected is granny goodness is a bad guy

2582
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:44,760
bad girl

2583
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:46,680
Sure, um

2584
03:06:46,680 --> 03:06:48,680
Everyone any anyone can be a bad guy

2585
03:06:49,480 --> 03:06:52,120
Bad guy is gender neutral like uh like billie eilish

2586
03:06:54,360 --> 03:06:56,360
Yeah, exactly eilish is gender neutral

2587
03:06:58,040 --> 03:07:02,600
And and so are and so and so uh

2588
03:07:03,640 --> 03:07:05,240
Are you dear viewer?

2589
03:07:05,240 --> 03:07:08,040
It's we should get we should get billie eilish from the pcp

2590
03:07:08,920 --> 03:07:10,920
I agree and that would be great

2591
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
I'm sure oblivion fall knows her

2592
03:07:15,080 --> 03:07:16,440
Wait, why?

2593
03:07:16,440 --> 03:07:21,640
Yeah, uh, he does like music, right? Everyone in music knows each other. Oh, that's small

2594
03:07:21,720 --> 03:07:24,200
It's small in small world small world

2595
03:07:24,200 --> 03:07:28,120
I picked up a guitar and I already I instantly had ringo star's phone number

2596
03:07:29,480 --> 03:07:31,480
It was recent love the back love

2597
03:07:32,280 --> 03:07:33,640
peace and wolf

2598
03:07:33,640 --> 03:07:38,760
This ringo star wrote every wrote his number on every guitar in the world because it's like if you're doing this

2599
03:07:38,760 --> 03:07:45,400
He wants to get to know what you what you're about. It's like call me. It's like that story of um of jack white

2600
03:07:46,120 --> 03:07:50,360
Hiding like records of unreleased demos and used furniture. He gives away

2601
03:07:50,840 --> 03:07:53,800
Just like a true by the way

2602
03:07:55,480 --> 03:07:59,400
Honestly that I have I that voicemail and the

2603
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:04,280
Wikipedia article has given me like no sense at all of what mr. Miracle is

2604
03:08:05,320 --> 03:08:07,320
He might be talking about a specific run

2605
03:08:07,880 --> 03:08:12,600
Like a recent run by um by tom he did say I think is what he said

2606
03:08:13,320 --> 03:08:15,560
He said um, he said tom, um

2607
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:20,200
Uh, yeah, tom king. Okay. All right. Well

2608
03:08:21,320 --> 03:08:27,800
I probably should check it out, but I I don't know if I'm going to cheesy probably knows something about it

2609
03:08:28,520 --> 03:08:30,520
Maybe he would maybe he would

2610
03:08:30,760 --> 03:08:36,360
um, all right next voicemail is uh called um, what is it called? It is called

2611
03:08:37,720 --> 03:08:40,040
Mr. Miracle 2 big barda

2612
03:08:40,840 --> 03:08:44,520
I know from the wikipedia article that big barda is mr. Miracle's wife. So

2613
03:08:45,400 --> 03:08:49,720
That's context. I think big barda is also linkara's favorite comic book character

2614
03:08:50,760 --> 03:08:55,080
Really, I think so. Yeah, it all comes back. It all comes full circle

2615
03:08:55,800 --> 03:08:57,800
Uh, three two one go

2616
03:08:58,280 --> 03:09:01,640
So just one more two details that could convince me to read the comic. Um

2617
03:09:02,360 --> 03:09:08,040
One tom king's a huge lefty. He is an ex-military but has no love for that bullshit. That's cool. And um

2618
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:17,400
It features one the sexist woman on comics. Um big barda. She's like a huge amazon lady who has big tits and big s

2619
03:09:18,120 --> 03:09:25,160
And now you have my attention and give google her to big barda. I'm gonna school. I'm gonna google it and she's

2620
03:09:25,880 --> 03:09:28,680
Mr. Miracle's wife. So she's the whole comic

2621
03:09:29,320 --> 03:09:35,320
I do I do not believe you're fucking cool. I do not believe for us. I do not believe for a second

2622
03:09:35,480 --> 03:09:37,400
When I have to read it

2623
03:09:37,400 --> 03:09:42,040
I do not believe for a second that a woman who first appeared in a silver age comic book

2624
03:09:42,600 --> 03:09:44,920
I would ever find them hot. I think it's impossible

2625
03:09:45,320 --> 03:09:49,880
But I'm gonna google it and let's let's find out shall. What was her name? I think I get what you're saying big barda

2626
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
Big barda

2627
03:09:56,520 --> 03:10:01,000
No, what is this? What the fuck is this? What the fuck?

2628
03:10:04,040 --> 03:10:06,040
What the fuck I don't get it what?

2629
03:10:07,720 --> 03:10:11,560
What is good? What is appealing about this at all? She looks like she's got a fucking like

2630
03:10:12,040 --> 03:10:13,080
Feet

2631
03:10:13,080 --> 03:10:17,480
Pharaoh's helmet. She's looking like full body armor and just like a girl with a face

2632
03:10:18,200 --> 03:10:20,200
What the fuck?

2633
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:22,200
She's literally just a girl with a face

2634
03:10:23,400 --> 03:10:27,400
What there's just a lot of different iterations. I don't know which one he's talking about

2635
03:10:28,040 --> 03:10:30,520
I mean, they're all they're all the same. Well, I personally

2636
03:10:31,320 --> 03:10:35,080
She's wearing a suit of armor. This sucks. I prefer my girl's not to have faces

2637
03:10:35,480 --> 03:10:37,480
I

2638
03:10:39,720 --> 03:10:43,560
Cannot understand I cannot understand why you would look at this and be like, uh

2639
03:10:44,600 --> 03:10:48,600
Uh, this this girl who looks literally the same as every other girl

2640
03:10:50,520 --> 03:10:51,720
Except

2641
03:10:51,720 --> 03:10:56,920
She's wearing armor. Look, there she is. She's not wearing armor. She's she's just tall. I guess

2642
03:10:57,640 --> 03:10:59,640
Oh, wow, it's a girl with a face

2643
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:04,760
This sucks. She looks pretty good. No, no fuck this comic. No fuck mr. Miracle

2644
03:11:05,960 --> 03:11:07,080
I miss you

2645
03:11:07,080 --> 03:11:13,560
Miracle, this is my perfect excuse that I needed not to read it. I can pretend to be outraged about this

2646
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Uh

2647
03:11:17,400 --> 03:11:24,520
No, this is tecno tonic. Are you gone? Wait a minute tectonic said he'd be back. Um, but he said go on without him

2648
03:11:25,080 --> 03:11:29,560
Okay, wait, what the fuck hold on. I just found this on google and I just want to show you

2649
03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:37,080
That's fucked up

2650
03:11:37,560 --> 03:11:43,240
This is fucked up superman in a porno. They're gonna fuck they're gonna fuck for money

2651
03:11:44,360 --> 03:11:51,640
Pretty cool. Uh, I wonder what the context is for this one. Do you think if superman has sex that his, uh

2652
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:54,920
Pee-pee jizz would go zap and kill

2653
03:11:55,240 --> 03:11:58,840
Listen, listen, you listen you stupid motherfucker. Obviously

2654
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:02,280
Of course

2655
03:12:02,440 --> 03:12:06,280
Um, didn't didn't superman get lois lane pregnant in one

2656
03:12:07,400 --> 03:12:08,440
iteration

2657
03:12:08,440 --> 03:12:13,800
And I've heard people say that like obviously it's impossible because like super sperm should be like stronger than steel

2658
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:20,920
And she just like obliterate her uterus, right? She just like the sperm should just tunnel through her body and like fill her with a

2659
03:12:21,560 --> 03:12:25,480
Micro it's easy. All he needs to do is do it at an extreme distance. So the air is

2660
03:12:25,880 --> 03:12:27,880
Resistance will slow it down to the point

2661
03:12:28,440 --> 03:12:33,880
Where it will not kill her. So she's like 40 like 40 miles down the road and he goes

2662
03:12:35,880 --> 03:12:38,360
Wait, can't he just have kryptonite around him?

2663
03:12:39,880 --> 03:12:46,280
Yeah, he could just wear like red kryptonite or whatever. Uh, autoerotic kryptonation

2664
03:12:47,160 --> 03:12:52,040
I think it's red kryptonite. I think it's a red kryptonite that doesn't hurt him

2665
03:12:52,120 --> 03:12:55,400
But just like kind of turns him normal. So just use that

2666
03:12:55,960 --> 03:12:57,880
That's what you need. It's like honestly

2667
03:12:58,280 --> 03:13:04,280
I kind of think that there might be like an in now that I say that I'm thinking that maybe there is like an in-universe

2668
03:13:04,760 --> 03:13:10,760
iteration of superman where he does get lois lane pregnant and he only manages to do it by the use of red kryptonite

2669
03:13:10,840 --> 03:13:14,360
Yeah, I could be like hallucinating this right now. That's his like j.o. Crystal

2670
03:13:15,640 --> 03:13:16,840
No

2671
03:13:16,840 --> 03:13:18,840
Yeah, exactly

2672
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:25,320
Okay, all right. All right. This is this is fucking this is degenerate. This is degenerate is what this is

2673
03:13:25,960 --> 03:13:27,960
um, next one

2674
03:13:28,680 --> 03:13:32,440
Where are the chibi bakas you baka faced horse scrotum?

2675
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:33,800
three

2676
03:13:33,800 --> 03:13:36,440
Wait, there you go. Three two one go

2677
03:13:37,480 --> 03:13:39,240
Yo gib

You said like a billion episodes ago that you and monk. She did a cure a chibi bakas episode

2679
03:13:46,440 --> 03:13:52,600
No, you never released it. I never did what happened. Where's the chibi bakas?

2680
03:13:52,680 --> 03:13:57,240
Where's the chibi bakas gibbon? Where's the bloody I'd love to see it

2681
03:13:58,360 --> 03:14:00,360
I I I oh

2682
03:14:00,920 --> 03:14:07,400
I love to watch chibi bakas on me on metelli is well between sweet and chimneys

2683
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:16,520
We got a nerve struck a nerve have I know it's just really really bad. Um

2684
03:14:17,240 --> 03:14:18,440
Um

2685
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:24,680
Too close to home too close to home too close. It's just from my flashbacks to my literal everyday life

2686
03:14:25,720 --> 03:14:27,720
This is just

2687
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:34,040
Everything sucks about the uk the vat tax is out of this world and everyone sounds like that

2688
03:14:35,080 --> 03:14:37,640
um chibi bakas is is is sort of like

2689
03:14:38,920 --> 03:14:43,640
On like permanent hiatus, which is to say that there's no plans to ever make an episode again

2690
03:14:43,640 --> 03:14:45,800
But I did say that I recorded that

2691
03:14:46,680 --> 03:14:53,720
Yeah, I've looked at the footage before and it was just like not very interesting and kind of like lame and I don't like it

2692
03:14:54,920 --> 03:14:56,920
Wait, what you mean like the audio?

2693
03:14:57,400 --> 03:15:00,200
Well, I recorded it in video form and audio

2694
03:15:00,600 --> 03:15:04,760
Um, because we because munchy was literally there. It's like oh, it's chibi bakas live

2695
03:15:05,240 --> 03:15:09,960
Wait, was that for was that ragcon four? No, that was when munchy came over to stay in my house

2696
03:15:10,600 --> 03:15:14,200
Right, right, right, right. I mean the the discussion just will release it

2697
03:15:15,480 --> 03:15:20,920
Well, the thing is I have to edit it because it sucks and it's like we don't really have much to say

2698
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,720
I was just like that was weird wasn't it? Yeah, if I had weird

2699
03:15:24,360 --> 03:15:27,880
I think people would appreciate it. I don't know. I don't know. I can tell you what to do

2700
03:15:27,960 --> 03:15:32,360
But like I think it would it's it's probably it's probably worth posting

2701
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:38,840
Okay, I'm I'll think about it. I'll have to I've remind I was hoping everyone would have forgotten

2702
03:15:38,840 --> 03:15:41,720
But there's one guy he's fucking ruined my plan

2703
03:15:43,080 --> 03:15:45,480
If you already have the footage you may as well release it

2704
03:15:46,520 --> 03:15:51,560
But I don't want it to be cringe. I gotta un-cringe it for it. It's too late. It's too late

2705
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:54,280
I gotta I gotta up the contrast mac

2706
03:15:56,520 --> 03:16:02,120
The thing about that is not releasing it is even more cringe by definition. You're really damned if you do damned if you don't

2707
03:16:04,360 --> 03:16:06,360
Maybe

2708
03:16:06,440 --> 03:16:11,000
Maybe maybe I won't be cringe, you know, maybe maybe I don't know. I doubt it

2709
03:16:11,720 --> 03:16:12,440
uh

2710
03:16:12,440 --> 03:16:19,720
Next one is called um make pcp wholesome again safe place. Oh wait, I didn't put it in the chat. Um

There it is make pcp wholesome again safe place three two one go

2712
03:16:26,680 --> 03:16:29,480
Guys there's nothing healthy wrong with being a talk

2713
03:16:30,120 --> 03:16:33,240
Oh, no, if a black man has exude your wife for instance

2714
03:16:33,400 --> 03:16:36,520
Why not been a little more inclusive, you know, I'm progressive

2715
03:16:37,160 --> 03:16:39,160
I think that he's a young

2716
03:16:39,240 --> 03:16:40,360
masculine

2717
03:16:40,360 --> 03:16:41,560
brave man

2718
03:16:41,560 --> 03:16:47,240
And he's doing great for this podcast and for our community. So people, please

2719
03:16:47,880 --> 03:16:49,880
Stop making fun of ben sainte

2720
03:16:50,360 --> 03:16:52,360
You should know better

2721
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:54,680

Thank you

2723
03:16:56,520 --> 03:16:58,520
Yeah, you're the butt of every joke ben

2724
03:16:58,520 --> 03:17:04,840
That's what what did I say? Who was the guy who left the podcast and everyone was glad he was gone that I compared myself to

2725
03:17:06,360 --> 03:17:08,360
Uh greg from completionist

2726
03:17:09,080 --> 03:17:13,880
Yeah, lemal. I don't know. Oh, yeah, that guy. I like that. He sounds like he's

2727
03:17:14,840 --> 03:17:23,160
He's like talking in front of a huge audience like the echo it makes it seem like he he's doing like some sort of state of the union or whatever about

2728
03:17:23,960 --> 03:17:25,960
It being okay that you're a cock

2729
03:17:26,200 --> 03:17:29,720
Didn't uh maddox do that one time

2730
03:17:30,440 --> 03:17:32,760
He did for a second. I I thought that was a thought

2731
03:17:33,400 --> 03:17:35,640
This was a maddox thing, but no

2732
03:17:36,520 --> 03:17:39,160
Yeah, but when maddox defended cucks he like

2733
03:17:39,880 --> 03:17:42,360
It's like he thought that the only

2734
03:17:42,840 --> 03:17:46,280
Meaning that the word had was that you were like a cuck fetishist

2735
03:17:47,480 --> 03:17:49,160
And he didn't like

2736
03:17:49,160 --> 03:17:53,000
He didn't read no, no, there's nothing wrong with being a cuck's like it's just a fetish. He missed the point

2737
03:17:53,560 --> 03:17:58,680
He missed he didn't read the room. I guess. Yeah. Yeah on that one

2738
03:17:59,480 --> 03:18:01,800
No, we're just sort of maybe it's one of those language

2739
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
purists whereas like if it was

2740
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:08,360
Language can't change if people use it differently. It has a definition a word

2741
03:18:08,760 --> 03:18:13,880
A word can't have more than one meaning in different contexts. This is so stupid

2742
03:18:15,080 --> 03:18:16,440
uh

2743
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:18,440
Next next one is called cross

03:18:53,720 --> 03:18:58,680
Called, uh, I think it's called bond shrift condensed bold or something

2755
03:18:58,760 --> 03:19:04,840
It's I can only find it in vegas like I try to use it other places and I can't find it anywhere. Let me

2756
03:19:05,800 --> 03:19:11,640
Let me see get it. I mean, I I will say, you know, everybody knows that I love, um, showcard gothic

2757
03:19:11,880 --> 03:19:14,840
Yes, everyone knows about the showcard gothic and that's a that's a big one

2758
03:19:15,240 --> 03:19:19,400
Um, great font that I never hear anyone talk about is ukari mobile

2759
03:19:20,120 --> 03:19:23,720
ukari mobile is a super good font and which I found

2760
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:29,720
Uh, because it was the font that they used in the promo materials for fighting is magic

2761
03:19:30,200 --> 03:19:37,400
The the the game that would go on to become, uh, them's fighting who herds them's fighting herds classic. Oh, yeah

2762
03:19:38,440 --> 03:19:41,320
Um, that's a super good, uh

2763
03:19:42,200 --> 03:19:46,360
There's one called there's one I use all the time called trash type dk

2764
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:52,600
Um, which looks it looks like courier, but it's all like messy and fucked up and like grungy looking that one's like

2765
03:19:52,920 --> 03:19:54,920
I love that one

2766
03:19:56,040 --> 03:19:59,560
What else to it as a kid my favorite font was sylphane

2767
03:19:59,960 --> 03:20:05,800
Because sylphane looks like times new roman, but it is slightly bigger and therefore if you write your essays in it

2768
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:07,880
You can get away with writing that

2769
03:20:08,120 --> 03:20:09,320
Yeah

2770
03:20:09,320 --> 03:20:10,680
uh

2771
03:20:10,680 --> 03:20:11,800
I like

2772
03:20:11,800 --> 03:20:16,840
I like all the fonts from pokemon games. I use those a lot when I want to use like some like

2773
03:20:17,480 --> 03:20:22,280
Computer looking texts. I like the um the cave story font too. That one's nice

2774
03:20:23,240 --> 03:20:26,040
There's too many fonts to keep track of I have no idea

2775
03:20:27,080 --> 03:20:30,920
Uh, riveting uh riveting a font commentary

2776
03:20:32,360 --> 03:20:36,920
I mean there's a font of discussion people are interested in people are definitely interested in fonts

2777
03:20:36,920 --> 03:20:39,800
And I am one of the gamers who is who who has like

2778
03:20:40,680 --> 03:20:42,680
I don't know difficulty

2779
03:20:42,760 --> 03:20:46,440
Remembering fonts or like distinguishing them. I mean, there's so fucking many

2780
03:20:46,520 --> 03:20:51,480
There's so fucking many but I've always felt like people are always like into something about fonts

2781
03:20:52,040 --> 03:20:57,640
And I just my brain just doesn't perceive them in the same way fonts are interesting

2782
03:20:58,280 --> 03:21:01,960
Because they're like a thing that everyone is oh, I just

2783
03:21:02,920 --> 03:21:05,240
A bit of an outstretched pick but uh karima

2784
03:21:05,880 --> 03:21:13,800
Karima is the font that andrew hussey used to like it's the font that like the title of like planets appears in in homestuck like

2785
03:21:14,200 --> 03:21:16,680
Durs and prospit and like land of wind and shade

2786
03:21:17,400 --> 03:21:20,200
Is karima and uh karima is pretty cool. Um

2787
03:21:21,240 --> 03:21:22,360
Uh

2788
03:21:22,360 --> 03:21:27,000
Fonts are like a thing that like you see everywhere and probably for a lot of your life

2789
03:21:27,080 --> 03:21:29,080
You don't even like think about or question at all

2790
03:21:29,160 --> 03:21:34,040
And then when you when you discover that like these things have names and like people design them

2791
03:21:34,280 --> 03:21:37,880
And like they come from somewhere and there's all these things to consider about them

2792
03:21:37,960 --> 03:21:42,600
that like uh that you'd never even thought about like spacing and and kerning and and um

2793
03:21:43,240 --> 03:21:46,680
Serifs and and all that shit and it's like a whole rabbit hole

2794
03:21:47,320 --> 03:21:51,240
That was like right in front of you the whole time. Yeah, and you never even thought about it

2795
03:21:51,320 --> 03:21:54,680
That's what that's what's interesting about fonts to me. I like I like wolf

2796
03:21:55,320 --> 03:21:57,320
uh fonts

2797
03:21:57,720 --> 03:21:59,000
wolf

2798
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:06,040
Yeah, wolf peck is a band that I like and the the leader of the band is also very into fonts and he's made a font

2799
03:22:06,680 --> 03:22:08,680
Um that he uses in all his youtube videos

2800
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:13,640
And he's very like knowledgeable in all the different aspects of font design

2801
03:22:14,680 --> 03:22:16,680
I see and it looks nice

2802
03:22:17,400 --> 03:22:20,280
I see I think it may be a series of fonts. I can't remember

2803
03:22:21,320 --> 03:22:22,440
well

2804
03:22:22,440 --> 03:22:24,440
Oh, I have I have one

2805
03:22:24,520 --> 03:22:28,040
That I used in the champion that I thought was pretty nice called knight warrior

2806
03:22:28,760 --> 03:22:29,880
um

2807
03:22:29,880 --> 03:22:32,920
That's just kind of a fancy looking one that I think is this is nice

2808
03:22:33,800 --> 03:22:36,040
Oh, yeah, this is this is a funny kind of gothic

2809
03:22:37,960 --> 03:22:43,560
This jack stratton leader of wolf records doing a font video. He's funny

2810
03:22:44,360 --> 03:22:46,360
He's a funny guy

2811
03:22:46,360 --> 03:22:48,360
Font calculus

2812
03:22:48,440 --> 03:22:54,040
Tectonic, what did you what did you post the um the my name is tectonic improv video for oh, that's that's um

2813
03:22:54,520 --> 03:22:57,320
The title is the bond shrift condensed. Oh

2814
03:22:58,280 --> 03:22:59,800
Oh, yeah

2815
03:22:59,800 --> 03:23:03,240
I remember when I when I started making videos. I was like I need a font

2816
03:23:03,400 --> 03:23:08,120
So I just kept testing out fonts and videos and I eventually found this one. I was like this one's cool

2817
03:23:08,680 --> 03:23:14,360
Don't take this the wrong way. Were you inspired by digi being really into blue highway?

2818
03:23:15,640 --> 03:23:20,120
No, what what font is that is is that close to this one?

2819
03:23:20,360 --> 03:23:22,360
I

2820
03:23:22,680 --> 03:23:27,880
No, I mean sort of but not really no just I remember digi was like very for a while

2821
03:23:28,280 --> 03:23:29,640
She was like

2822
03:23:29,640 --> 03:23:34,600
Blue highway was the font she would always use in all of her videos. Oh, you mean just like having a font

2823
03:23:35,240 --> 03:23:39,880
Yeah, just having like a font. That's like your font. I'm sure I'm sure I was inspired in some way

2824
03:23:40,680 --> 03:23:44,520
Yeah, I remember her talking about that and I thought like that's a good idea that makes sense

2825
03:23:45,320 --> 03:23:46,680
um

2826
03:23:46,680 --> 03:23:49,400
She's not like she invented the concept or anything, but yeah

2827
03:23:50,200 --> 03:23:52,200
Uh

2828
03:23:52,360 --> 03:23:59,080
All right, anything anything else to say about fonts uh guys or shall we please watch that wolf sans video?

2829
