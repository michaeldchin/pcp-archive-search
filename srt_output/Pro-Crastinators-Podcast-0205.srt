00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,900
The legendary two-man episode is finally here.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,240
No one will show up, and if we do, oh, I'll be so upset.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,520
It's me, Bestie Boy, and we've got Tom Oliver.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,440
Yo, what's going on?

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:29,720
We're the only people with the resolve to suffer through COVID and show up in our workspaces

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,240
for this podcast, the grueling commute of going down the stairs or into another room.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,280
The testicular fortitude, indeed.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,240
It was a huge ask, but we do it for you.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,960
That's right, and you owe us, so patreon.com slash The Pro Crastinators is the only place

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
to give us money.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,120
There was a new bonus episode out about the contentious episode topic of Topics, and

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,880
we get into all the nitty-gritty of that, so go check that out.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,920
If you're a fan of Insider Baseball, this is like the insider-iest baseball, and it

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
gets pretty heady.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
It may be the most.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
It does.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
It does.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,560
You know, I really enjoyed the arc of that episode.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,400
We got so mad at each other, but then there was kind of a nice resolution.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,720
I don't know.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,040
It was good, endorsed by me.

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,160
Best shown in anime of the season, easily.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Oh, you know what?

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
That reminds me.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,520
Just for fun, I was looking up something, or where was I listening to this?

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,800
For some reason, I was hearing about someone making fun of Nissan cars the other day, and

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,760
for whatever reason, I think I Googled Nissan, and I was on the Wikipedia page, and I saw

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,160
that it said, it was like the history of the page or something, and they were like, blah-blah-blah,

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:44,360
Nissan is actually a, it gets its name from the original Zaibatsu of the original, or

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,800
the old Japanese Empire, and I was like, wait, I've heard that word Zaibatsu before.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Where have I heard that before?

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,680
And then I just Googled it or whatever, and I realized, I realized the origin of the term

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,120
Zaibatsu, as used by the super best friends cast, and I realized that it's the fucking

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,760
coolest thing ever.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,560
Because what I thought it was, I thought it was like, based on the way that it had been

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,560
used, I thought it meant like a wrestling confederation or something, like specifically

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,960
like a wrestling term for like their group.

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,360
I thought the Zaibatsu was a specific name for like their gang of miscreants.

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,600
Zaibatsu was a very specific thing.

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,480
It meant, oh, I wrote it down here, I have the kanji here.

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:33,000
It means a financial clique for the original Empire of Japan, okay, not original, but like

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,560
before World War II or whatever.

44
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,200
So it specifically refers to like a confederation of business conglomerates, or it is a business

45
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,800
conglomerate of individuals.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,400
And I was like, well that, I see why the super best friends would have used that.

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,760
Now they are deceased, but I think perhaps that is an appropriate term to use for what

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,280
we do here at the PCP.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,480
It is exactly the sort of thing that makes sense, and it's Japanese, so that's pretty

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
cool.

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
And they're dead.

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
They're dead.

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Yeah, we can just take it.

54
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
We can just carry the flag.

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
It's ours now.

56
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,600
Both the super best friends and all the Japanese from back in the day, they were using it.

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
They're all dead.

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,160
So it's totally free and open.

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,600
We might as well just change the bonus episode name to that, like why not?

60
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
You know, that's true.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,720
Anyway, I understand that's like a, well I don't know what the term is, that's like

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,200
a term that they popularized and made part of their, what's the word, zeitgeist, I don't

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,720
know, their cultural influence.

64
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Yes, yes.

65
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,800
So it's definitely associated with them, but it is just a term that could be used for

66
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
anything.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,360
The passage of time, dude, we just got to claim it now and not back down when challenged.

68
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,320
And eventually the, the winds of fate will change direction.

69
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
It will be our turn.

70
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
And indeed.

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,520
And as the actual soul of a samurai in my body, man that I am, and the business, the

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:58,560
aspiring businessman, I, this is like the perfect word to be used for such things.

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
So fuck it.

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,640
I think it's totally sick and I'm not going to let it die now that I actually know what

75
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
it means.

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,760
It's totally cool.

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,240
And I'll, I'll do it in honor of you guys as I use this word, rest in peace, super best

78
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
friends.

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Anyway, so that's the, I learned the term, maybe everybody who knows them since they

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,680
were very popular and still are individually already knew what that meant, but I just had

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,640
a spiritual awakening and it was totally sick and I feel good about it.

82
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Indeed.

83
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,880
It's, did you know what that meant Tom?

84
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,800
I had never even heard of the word before you mentioned it.

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Oh, okay.

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Right now.

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Okay.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I see.

89
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I am not as much as a weeb as you are.

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Unfortunately.

91
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I just, I haven't reached that apex of power yet, but perhaps someday.

92
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,040
It's sick of me to think, it's sick of me to think that there were bigger weebs than

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I am.

94
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
You know.

95
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,600
And really I've, I've remedied that particular malady of myself.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes.

97
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,520
Every day you get a little bit more powerful and a little bit more fucking cringe, but

98
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,040
that cringe power is undefeatable by the normal man.

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Indeed.

100
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Indeed.

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
So Tom, have you seen the end of Steven Universe moving on to the other thing I wanted to talk

102
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
about?

103
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Oh, I have not yet.

104
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
I need to.

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,840
We're planning on doing a whole Steven Universe cast, I would assume at some point to kind

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,520
of wrap everything up.

107
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Yeah.

108
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,240
I mean, that's a good idea.

109
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
I mean, we've done it.

110
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
I guess I'll go into it too much.

111
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
We've been doing those since like the beginning.

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,000
It seems only fitting that we put a bow on the whole thing and wrap it all up properly.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I agree.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I agree.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm still a big fan.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Excuse me.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was looking into the details now that, you know, so there's Steven Universe, then

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the movie.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Excuse me.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then the recent Steven Universe.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Future.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Future has ended.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,040
And specifically there were rumors going around that there was going to be like a comic continuation.

124
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,680
But Rebecca Sugar clearly stated on Twitter like, Hey guys, just so you know, I am not

125
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,160
working on anything Steven Universe now.

126
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Like if there's comics, it's not me.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,720
So everyone can be assured that the story has in fact ended and what we got is what

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,280
we got, which means any complaints that someone might want to put forward about unsatisfying

129
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,400
elements or incomplete storylines are totally valid and you can no longer deny any, any,

130
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
you can't say that they're going to fix it in like the comic.

131
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,840
You can't fix it in the comics anyway.

132
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,240
The comics are B canon.

133
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,520
They're not real.

134
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,000
It's just like fan and band-aids that they're being paid to make.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,520
It's not true.

136
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,760
No, all that matters is the show.

137
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,480
Just like with MLP, everyone's like, Oh, the comics still, no, no, that's all not real.

138
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,400
The comics just tell the story beyond, well, I mean, the show ended on like with them becoming

139
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
adults and whatnot.

140
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,480
I assume the comics didn't go beyond that.

141
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,320
But even like while it was going on, like they would address plot elements from the

142
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
show in the comics.

143
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
We'd be like, this is what happened.

144
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,320
But then the show would go against that.

145
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
So whatever.

146
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
It's all fake.

147
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,400
I've heard very mixed things about the Steven Universe ending.

148
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,680
I've heard some people say it was really good and they cried and it was sad and great and

149
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,200
a good way to wrap everything up.

150
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,880
Other people like it's the gayest, worst thing ever, including famously Michelle sang a whole

151
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
song about her displeasure.

152
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,640
Her song, hey, go check out Michelle's song in the show notes.

153
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,520
Her balls are blue at the ending of this song of the show.

154
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Poor Michelle.

155
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Rest in peace.

156
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,520
She was the biggest Steven Universe fan out there because Michelle is also like mixed

157
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
race.

158
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,400
And that was like a fucking, it's funny because the ending of Steven Universe, there's a lot

159
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,200
of people out there, which is it's understandable that they would say like, so the Steven Universe

160
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:20,120
finale or sorry, Steven Universe future is about like now that the battle is over, it's

161
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,120
about dealing with Steven Universe is like literal PTSD that he acquired through like

162
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,240
these horrible things he's been through.

163
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,320
So to people who resonate with like trauma or depression or like anxiety or things like

164
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
that.

165
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,440
Like I could totally see why they would be way into that it like a personal thing.

166
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
I get it.

167
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,280
I like stories about like my personal issues as well.

168
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Everybody does.

169
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,840
But the fact remains that there certainly are some plot elements that weren't thoroughly

170
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
explored enough.

171
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,600
And it's just funny like Michelle is one of the biggest people I know complaining about

172
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
the ending.

173
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,360
But like she always had a personal connection because like Steven exists in this like weird

174
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,920
like, you know, half breed, hybrid, I mean, you know, mixed race, truly a fate, like Coralette.

175
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
You wouldn't want that.

176
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,240
You wouldn't wish that on your worst enemy.

177
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,880
So like that was always a thing that like made her into Steven.

178
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,600
It was like, you know, something that hooked her into it from her personal experience since

179
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,320
she's like a bunch of she's like Japanese and Mexican Cuban and white and stuff.

180
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
That's rough.

181
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
I know it's a nightmare.

182
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,480
But but it's and now, but I feel that it's it's a very good faith thing to because even

183
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,920
Michelle was was redpilling on me on all the unfinished plot threads like most famously

184
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,560
the box from the weird like space inside lion's head.

185
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,760
What was in the box, Rebecca?

186
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Why was it there?

187
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,620
I don't care if you just put it originally as like a visual design element.

188
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,160
Every other thing that was in that magic headspace was addressed at some point, except for that.

189
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,000
And if you'll indulge me, Tom, I came up because the other big complaint about the ending,

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,360
I would say this is the second biggest one.

191
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,640
The box is kind of a meme, but the other one is that we never actually see Steven ever

192
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,400
really come to terms with Rose.

193
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,920
And in fact, his last like the last interaction Steven has with Rose, aka Pink Diamond is just

194
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,040
further reasons why she was like a horrible and worse person.

195
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,280
The last thing we hear about Pink Diamond, aka Rose in the series is how she had a literal

196
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,880
abusive relationship with Pink Pearl and like physically assaulted her and would like

197
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
hurt her.

198
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,600
Like that's the final note.

199
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
The moral is that like Pink is just terrible.

200
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Like is that what they're going for?

201
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
That's how it feels.

202
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Yeah.

203
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
What's up, Jesse?

204
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Are you here?

205
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Hey, are we doing a Steven?

206
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Is this a Steven?

207
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
We are at this particular moment.

208
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
We are talking about Steven.

209
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
We are talking about Steven right now.

210
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Yes.

211
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Let me just here.

212
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,680
I'll just finish my point and feel free to say whatever you like.

213
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,120
I was just going to say that the way to wrap that up, in my opinion, because like sure

214
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,360
everybody complains about Pink Diamond being evil and all that stuff.

215
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,200
Okay, but the reality is we learned everything good about Rose and Pink Diamond at the very

216
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,800
beginning and then we learned like the bad stuff she had done like chronologically before

217
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
she like became a much better person.

218
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
But to us as the audience, it feels as though we've just like heard all bad things about

219
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
Pink for so, so long.

220
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,400
The right way to resolve that is to bring that full circle and here's just my little

221
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
fanfic.

222
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,960
The way to resolve it is you get two birds with one stone.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,680
The final thing that happens at the very end, like as Steven is like dealing with his trauma

224
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,200
or whatever, he like, he opens the chest in his little headspace and what does he find

225
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
there?

226
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,120
Yet another one of Pink Diamond's, of Rose Quartz's tapes.

227
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
And man, this is perfect.

228
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,200
This resolves fucking everything people wanted.

229
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,680
It's he plays the tape.

230
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,960
This was one final tape that was only there for Steven because this is a special space

231
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,480
only Steven could get to.

232
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,520
He plays it and here's what happens.

233
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,760
It starts with Rose and she's like, Hey Steven, this is another letter.

234
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,360
You know, I know once you're older, you'll see this.

235
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,440
Once you've like developed your powers and stuff, you'll, you'll be able to get in here.

236
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,840
What she then does is she transforms back into Pink Diamond for Steven to see and be like,

237
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,760
I want you to know this is who you are, to be comfortable with like the stuff that we've

238
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
been.

239
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,360
And then she explains all the horrible things she's done or at least in general terms and

240
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,320
just lays it out for the audience.

241
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,640
Like Steven, I'm sure by now you've learned all the horrible things I've done.

242
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,600
I want you to know that I understand that like those things were bad.

243
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,960
I grew like you, you, the audience, you know, this is the surrogate going on here.

244
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,040
You've now seen all the worst things about me, but I also understand how bad a person

245
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,680
I was and I work to fix that, which she did.

246
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,800
She was fucking hero and like an actual good person before she died mostly and she tried

247
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,880
to make amends for all the bad stuff she had done.

248
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,040
So like that should have been the final note that resolved like the chest, like Steven and

249
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,720
Rose and the diamond, the Pink Diamond whole thing, and would have actually dealt on screen,

250
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,800
not literally off screen with Steve or not at all, not at all.

251
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,640
It's strange that they don't have anything like that because there was nothing.

252
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,560
The whole mention the last episode, the whole arc of Pink Diamonds like reveal through this

253
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,480
entire show has been like, she's like this fucking perfect person.

254
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,800
And then like every note of information we've gotten from her after is just like, actually

255
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,480
she was a piece of shit.

256
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,800
Without doing what you said, bring it back full circle, like it just feels like actually

257
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Pink Diamond was shit.

258
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,160
She was bad and that's what you should take away from this entire show.

259
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,480
Not to be too, not to talk down to the audience, but I think the intended audience of Steven

260
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,200
Universe is fairly young.

261
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,840
I think that audience needs a little, I mean, I see a lot of people being like, oh my god,

262
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,240
Pink Diamond is a monster.

263
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,600
Sure, when she was young and foolish, she did a lot of bad things, but let's resolve

264
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,160
on like, in my opinion, like the most healing attitude that we all need as a society, that

265
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,280
people can change and grow.

266
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,440
And the fucked up thing is, we already know for a fact that she did grow and change and

267
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,400
did become a good person, but everyone's just forgotten that because narratively, that's

268
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,720
further back in our minds.

269
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
And we're just not thinking about that.

270
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
She was a hero.

271
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
She was a hero.

272
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
And a good person.

273
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Yeah, yeah.

274
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,440
I mean, is there really anything that needs to be resolved with her?

275
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,920
I mean, like, you don't have to like redeem her and have her like go like, oh, hey, you

276
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,280
know, actually, I'm not a piece of shit at this, this whole, this idea that people have

277
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,840
that like Pink Diamond is like all bad and she's a piece of shit and she's a monster

278
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,960
is like totally missing the entire point.

279
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Like she can be.

280
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I mean, I agree.

281
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,800
You don't necessarily have to like do some ask what the end we're like, oh no, she actually

282
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280
did have some redeeming qualities.

283
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,080
Well, we already know she had redeeming qualities.

284
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,880
She started out in the show.

285
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,400
We always saw were her redeeming qualities.

286
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,840
Just because we're later introduced to some more, you know, three dimensional shitty aspects

287
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,480
of her doesn't mean, you know, you know, that she's just sucks completely.

288
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,680
Even though she I totally agree.

289
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,680
But just consider the fact that I see a vast sentiment of discussion online specifically

290
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,360
about how look, like these are the kind of people we hear.

291
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,080
Like there's a lot of people, there's a certain overlap of fandom of Steven Universe of people

292
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,440
who enjoy Steven Universe and people who when they learn one bad thing about someone's

293
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,160
history, like now think that person is historically bad for all time.

294
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,240
I think there happens to be an overlap between those two camps, but that's all of humanity

295
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
everywhere.

296
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,400
And I don't know if you've discovered a cure for it yet besides mass destruction and death

297
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,160
for every human on earth.

298
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,840
I just recommend a little reminder because I felt like we left.

299
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,720
I'm just we left it on a very negative tone for everything that like that pink and rose

300
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,000
had done.

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,240
Maybe that's just me thinking that like there was a negative tone.

302
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,600
I mean, as some of them, I haven't watched the ending, so I'm talking out of my ass.

303
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,240
But you the way you phrase this entire discussion in the first place, and Jesse, you might not

304
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,680
even been in a call when we were talking about it, was the reason you even brought it up

305
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,480
is because it wasn't the audience, but like Steven himself didn't ever seem in the story

306
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,360
to come to any resolution, even though that was like the driving force of all of future

307
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
was dealing with his package.

308
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,000
His arc was really started like Vorshminger like a saint, like a perfect being.

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,420
And then he learned she was flawed and bad in many ways, sure.

310
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,480
But there was never a visible third point where Steven comes to terms with that.

311
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,440
We simply end the series and I guess he's at peace now.

312
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
That's fairly unsatisfying.

313
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,280
Well, he has that one line.

314
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,280
There's one throwaway, you know, blink and you'll miss it with your ears line where

315
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,920
he says, Oh, blah, blah, blah.

316
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,840
And I'm talking to my therapist online once a week.

317
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,920
So that's kind of like implying that he's still dealing with it, but in kind of a fufu

318
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
way.

319
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,560
I'm so sick, sick of hearing about therapists and therapy and mental health.

320
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,560
This whole thing has gotten so out of control in our culture now where everyone's like,

321
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,160
Oh, therapy is always good and it's good for everyone.

322
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,160
And if you have problems, then you definitely have a mental health issue.

323
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,840
And you definitely, you know, it's good to, you know, whatever happened to just like stuffing

324
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,440
shit down, like a man, whatever, you know, maybe the older generations had it right.

325
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
I'm sick and tired.

326
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,240
You're just constantly bombarded with all this mental health care shit, you know, from

327
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
all directions.

328
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,920
And it's like, enough is enough.

329
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Just leave me alone.

330
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
That's my mental health.

331
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,640
Have you ever seen the Sopranos?

332
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Have you ever seen the Sopranos, Jesse?

333
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
No.

334
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,480
The Sopranos are exactly like season one Tony Soprano, where he's, he has like, people

335
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,160
don't know this, but the actual like underlying plot of, of the Sopranos is not just cool mob

336
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,040
boss stuff, which obviously is, is what happens day to day.

337
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,360
But the actual plot is about Tony Soprano getting therapy because he has these panic

338
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,120
attacks that are very unbecoming of a mob boss.

339
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,840
So he has to like, so he deals with his mental health, like throughout the entire series

340
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,400
as like the main underlying like Tony plot of what's going on.

341
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,320
But he's always like, oh shit, what did he say?

342
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,800
Whatever happened to, to the strong silent type, whatever happened to that kind of thing?

343
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,120
Whatever happened is just keeping it all bottled in.

344
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
And he's right.

345
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Yeah.

346
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Yeah.

347
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
That's the right way to go.

348
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,400
You don't want to, you know, before everything, you know, there was always this perception

349
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
that before you were a fucking surf to a Lord and no one cared and you would work the field

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and die.

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And that was great.

352
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Like at first.

353
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Ideal.

354
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,520
And first it was like this perception that if you, you know, see a therapist, there must

355
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,400
be something really wrong with you and there was kind of a stigma against it for a lot

356
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
of years.

357
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
I get that.

358
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,720
And but then people started, you know, trying to make this push for like, there doesn't have

359
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
to be a stigma.

360
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,320
It should be okay to talk about your problems and, and seek help for whatever's bothering

361
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
you.

362
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
And like, I agree with that.

363
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Yes, that's fine.

364
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Yeah.

365
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,280
But then it's like, it got so pushed to where people, the whole world now is overbearing

366
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
with it.

367
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,120
Everybody has, everybody has a mental health.

368
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,440
You've all got the mental health.

369
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,400
It's like, you know, you've all got to see a therapist for everything all the time.

370
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,280
If you're not seeing a therapist, then you're, then you're stuffing shit down and you're

371
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,920
repressed and you're doing something wrong.

372
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,800
You know, my dad is a psychologist and he always had a predisposition.

373
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,040
Like there have been several times in my life where I don't know, like just everything

374
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,880
isn't going like exactly the way I want it.

375
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,520
Like for example, when I was just like looking for better jobs and trying to, excuse me,

376
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,960
find like an intro chip to finish my degree and stuff, my dad would just recommend, he's

377
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,560
like, Hey Nate, why not go talk to someone, go like talk to a person.

378
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,040
And the pitch was never, the pitch for me was not like, Nate, you obviously have like

379
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,720
depression or some, you know, mental deficiency.

380
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,560
I need you to, like you should go see someone to deal with that.

381
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,240
His idea was like, I assume because this is kind of how he deals with his patients because

382
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,920
it deals with a lot of like old folks who like, they don't necessarily have a lot of people

383
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,680
in their lives to talk to every day because they're in nursing homes and stuff.

384
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,320
He'll be like, Nate, just go to like a psychologist or whatever and just like have a discussion

385
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,680
basically simply about whatever you're trying to improve about your life and like trying

386
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,040
to get straight.

387
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,560
And really it just served as like, it's like, oh yeah, I mean, I guess I am maybe playing

388
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,640
too many video games and should like spend another hour a day looking for a job, like

389
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,040
just very pragmatic down to earth stuff.

390
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
If that's the intense, I can at least understand that.

391
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,720
Is the part of it that's supposed to help just getting it out and just like the illusion

392
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,880
that someone is understanding or listening.

393
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,520
It kind of feels that way.

394
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
I think that's what it is.

395
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,720
Yeah, because like it's really interesting to me that like so many people recommend not

396
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,960
only therapy, but like medication all the time and like everybody's on fucking antidepressant

397
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,400
meds.

398
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,920
Yeah, that's the one that really weirds me out because it's just like a medication worship.

399
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,080
But like, you know, like people don't have seemed to have forgotten with like this acceptance

400
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,920
of mental health that like not feeling good sometimes is normal.

401
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,120
Like life is not always going to be perfect.

402
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,680
And it's just like, if you can identify why you don't feel good, you're not depressed.

403
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Like you're just having a shit time.

404
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,520
Like you don't need medication.

405
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,400
Like if you if you're just like, man, I feel like garbage because like I just sit around

406
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,360
and do nothing all day.

407
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,640
You don't need antidepressants.

408
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,600
You need to stop sitting around and doing nothing all day.

409
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,400
You need to do something.

410
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,360
You need antidepressants if you're just like, my life is great.

411
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,640
I have a good job.

412
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,480
I have good friends.

413
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,720
I have a good family, but I'm still depressed.

414
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,240
Like that's when you need a therapist and medication.

415
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,400
If you can clearly identify why you feel like shit, the answer is right in front of you.

416
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,360
Just stop being a little bitch and fix that shit.

417
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:32,920
I just like the only person in the entire world who's really qualified to figure out

418
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,480
what's wrong with you is you.

419
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,760
And I guess I'm just skeptical of the idea that anyone, no matter how much schooling

420
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,720
they've had in psychology or whatever, can listen to like bits and pieces of your story

421
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,480
in a room for like an hour a session and suddenly even come anywhere close to having

422
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
the answers or any real insight into you.

423
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,360
Like you can't possibly explain every single thing that is making you the way you are.

424
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,320
And so I don't know.

425
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,920
And plus you have to pay for it.

426
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,960
If therapy was really so important, wouldn't it be free?

427
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,680
Wouldn't it be, you know?

428
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,120
I mean, if it was so helpful, if food was so helpful, wouldn't it be free?

429
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,800
Fuck food.

430
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,320
Nobody needs it overrated.

431
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,640
I don't know.

432
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,760
Maybe that was stupid.

433
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,360
I don't know what the fucking point was.

434
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,080
Sure, there was a point in there somewhere.

435
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,040
Make a complex point about how when when there are lots of goods in the free market,

436
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,960
inevitably many sources will spring up and they'll inevitably drive the price down,

437
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,360
hopefully to literally zero eventually.

438
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,120
Yes.

439
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,560
Free therapy for everybody.

440
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm sure that'll solve the problem.

441
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,720
Anyway, not too much therapy.

442
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,960
If having to be completely free.

443
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,320
Right.

444
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,640
Wait, you're getting me confused.

445
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,760
I forgot what the hell my idea was to begin.

446
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,680
Well, you were saying that you don't think that like someone could for an hour and a half

447
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,440
sit down and talk and like understand really the depths of your life.

448
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,880
Well, I mean, like the thing is, like you have to pay exorbitant amount of money

449
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,880
for a therapy session with a therapist.

450
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,280
You have to choose your therapist.

451
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,320
What if you choose a bad one by mistake?

452
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,520
Like what if you happen to get a therapist who sucks and you would never know

453
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,800
and the damage would be irreparable?

454
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,920
They would get inside your head with all this crap.

455
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,520
You know, there's people who suck at their job, no matter what job it is.

456
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
There's got to be therapists who suck at therapy.

457
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,920
I went to therapy for a while.

458
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,120
It was terrible.

459
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,120
You can pay money for a therapist and you just paid money to be even more screwed up.

460
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,960
That's the other thing is like the anxiety of getting the right car

461
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,720
times a thousand, which is already bad enough.

462
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,320
You know, if I get the wrong car, then I'm fucked for years, you know,

463
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,480
and it feels like if you get the wrong therapist, you're fucked for the rest of your life.

464
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,320
Even my problem with therapists and the reason I tend not to go to see them

465
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,000
is simply because the profit structure like motivates them to keep me in there,

466
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,040
you know, like they benefit from my problem subsisting as opposed to solving them.

467
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,000
Like the benefit financially is to keep me coming back week after week.

468
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,880
Hey, the Hippocratic Oath is not do no harm.

469
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,640
Not make sure you're curing up, you know what I'm saying?

470
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,160
You can just keep stringing me along.

471
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,200
If they stay neutral, I could just keep coming back.

472
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,040
I'm like, I don't want to become dependent upon this.

473
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,600
I want the problem solved.

474
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,760
And, you know, I like to think that they're not thinking in such a callous term.

475
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,240
We'll review video games until you stop.

476
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,480
Oh, shit.

477
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,600
And he was where's my Rayman to review then?

478
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,760
Damn it. Oh, no, I'll go now.

479
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,320
See you guys.

480
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
Thank God.

481
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,560
Well, anyways, my point with all of that was Steven Universe sure is a fun show.

482
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,720
Boy, did you guys see that last episode?

483
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,600
How cool was that?

484
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,320
Boy, I sure do love cartoons and stuff.

485
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,400
I, you know, because a lot of people were like really emotionally

486
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,600
devastated or in a good way, like they were feeling like climatically fulfilled.

487
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,120
Whereas I know some people like Michelle were more thinking about

488
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,360
like the lore and how there were things they were unsatisfied.

489
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,920
I suppose I'm kind of in the, I don't know, the worst world

490
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,960
where I was just kind of like, I mean, I really passionately

491
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,720
loved Steven Universe for a long time.

492
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,880
But then when it ended here, I was like, OK, that's cool.

493
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,040
That was nice.

494
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,040
For example, like the whole last episode, there's this whole like

495
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,440
bit they're doing where all the gems that are the closest,

496
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,760
like the crystal gems, the real ones, they like won't show emotion or cry.

497
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,600
And I was just like, look, I know how this joke ends.

498
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,240
I know from the start of the episode that they will cry.

499
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,520
They're obviously faking.

500
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,480
And then surprise, it happened.

501
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,600
Wow, how emotional.

502
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,920
I do. I do agree that, like, after they all hugged Monster

503
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Seven and he got back to normal and then the episode ended there,

504
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,400
then the next episode, like it's a time skip and he's just fine

505
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,640
and he's moving out.

506
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,440
That was a month later.

507
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,280
There was definitely like a lot glossed over that I would have liked to.

508
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,640
But maybe you didn't need to see it.

509
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,800
I don't know. But like the whole, I think the whole idea

510
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,400
of Steven Universe Future, the whole thing this last season

511
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,920
has been like really brilliant and good and kind of groundbreaking.

512
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,080
I mean, just the idea of like, you know, Steven Universe is a kid's show.

513
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,320
It's like kind of like a playoff of like a like a shonen anime thing almost

514
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,720
or like like a like a Sailor Moon, some shit.

515
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,280
You know, this is like a little boy saving the world.

516
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,280
The idea to do that and then not gloss over the fact

517
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,760
as any other show would and has throughout history that this would mess

518
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,720
a person up, especially a child to say after, you know, it's the big battle

519
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,560
is all said and done. OK, let's not just end it here.

520
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,960
Let's do a whole other season dealing with the mental and emotional repercussions

521
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,200
and trauma that this has all had on poor young Steven and to just like really

522
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,800
delve into, you know, themes of like PTSD and trauma and stuff is like really

523
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,320
hasn't been done in this kind of show before.

524
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,240
And, you know, regardless of whether the last episode dropped the ball

525
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,240
or hit the mark perfectly or not, I think the idea of doing that

526
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,480
in the first place with the season was like really good and cool.

527
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,200
You know, my only I do enjoy a lot of that stuff as well.

528
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,800
I do have one kind of a criticism, maybe you disagree.

529
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,440
But like I felt like, I don't know, maybe this is not fair.

530
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,880
And this wasn't isn't like how it would work in real life.

531
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,720
But I feel like they were kind of trying to have their cake and eat it to

532
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,680
because through the entirety of Steven Universe, like Steven was the

533
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,240
like the happy go lucky rock that whenever like things went wrong,

534
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,920
he would be the upbeat one.

535
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,920
And I would I could understand like that making him change

536
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,960
and being more like depressed and, you know, have PTSD and stuff.

537
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,200
And I get like addressing that in a show.

538
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,240
But it seems to me like, I don't know, like they used Steven

539
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,400
for that purpose of being that person.

540
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,800
And then like just years later, when everything's fine,

541
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,360
I mean, I guess that's how it works.

542
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,280
Like when a soldier comes back for more, that's when they start to get all fucked up.

543
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,960
But it was so long later.

544
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,760
And I feel like they like wouldn't those sort of things started to have

545
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,920
said in when he was like in the middle of them?

546
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,680
Because he seemed totally he seemed 100 percent fine

547
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,480
through the entirety of the original trauma is.

548
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,760
You can you can come out of a bad situation

549
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,920
and be totally fine for a while because you're relieved to be out of it.

550
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,800
And it's not until a little while later that, you know, all the stuff from it

551
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,920
starts setting back in.

552
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,720
I really don't think Steven was fine throughout like a lot of

553
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,360
the last few seasons in the movie.

554
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,800
Like there were very clearly moments where he was having trouble continuing

555
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,400
and you know, dealing with all this rose shit.

556
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,960
Well, anybody would have individual moments of trauma,

557
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,280
like when he got his fucking gem ripped out or when Spinell was going to kill him

558
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,400
or when he was all that stuff.

559
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,120
But he wasn't he wasn't always like the rock.

560
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,120
Like other people had to pick him up, you know, multiple times.

561
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,040
I love the scene where he's at the doctor's office, like

562
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,240
and she asks if anything bad happened in his childhood.

563
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,800
And he starts going over all these things that to the viewer at the time,

564
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,920
watching a cartoon would seem mundane because it's in a cartoon,

565
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,240
but really like driving home the fact that, no, every single one of these things

566
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,520
that happened in every episode of the whole series,

567
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,640
even just one of them would permanently destroy a child's psyche.

568
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,280
All right. But you know what? Fuck you, Rebecca,

569
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,240
because a lot of those things were played for laughs at the time.

570
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,120
And now I'm supposed to like, oh, shit, I'm sorry that like you put the goofy music

571
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,360
as these horrible horrible things were happening to him.

572
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,280
So am I supposed to feel bad for Steven or are you the one who's the callous one?

573
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,800
Rebecca, I think that's just the nature.

574
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,360
Like if Steven Universe wasn't, you know, what it was at the beginning,

575
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,200
it wouldn't have gained traction and you know what, I'm like a big thing

576
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,560
that people would care about.

577
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,520
So they had to dangle Steven's trauma for views is what you're telling me.

578
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,360
They had to amuse.

579
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,800
I'm not saying that like she had this idea at the beginning.

580
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,200
I don't know. I haven't.

581
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,360
OK, you know what? You know what?

582
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,320
I can my my entire point isn't valid

583
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,320
because Steven Universe Future is obviously designed to be a separate thing

584
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,520
from Steven Universe.

585
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,880
So you know what? That really.

586
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,960
How about that episode with that fucking?

587
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,720
How about that sexy volleyball check?

588
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,160
That was a great episode right there. Boy, oh, boy.

589
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,440
That the the sort of moral that they came or that the moral.

590
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
But the conclusion that her and Pearl came to at the end there where they both

591
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,880
like after fusing, they got all this new insight into Rose that neither of them

592
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,720
had had before. And then that great line of like, I always knew she was trying

593
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,400
to change, but I never knew why because now she understands like that's I think

594
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,880
that is what you were talking about before.

595
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,880
That's something that like contextualizes pink, where it's not like

596
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,720
it's not like, oh, we thought she was good, but she's really a piece of shit.

597
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,560
No, it's that that is making the case that she was good because she had been

598
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,080
a piece of shit, and that was the whole motivation she wanted to change.

599
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,120
I think that put it cast it in a new light pretty well.

600
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,800
You know, that's true.

601
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,760
That's I guess perhaps just as a fan, maybe it's more of this as a fan.

602
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,440
Like I feel a certain uncomfortableness, which I think was intended.

603
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,520
I mean, it was obviously part of it.

604
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,640
Like it makes me a little uncomfortable to see like the Steven who,

605
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,160
at least to me, the viewer has been like the rock of like positivity and

606
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,400
upbeatness. I watched Steven Universe because it was comfy and I really

607
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,520
enjoyed the atmosphere. And then to see trauma be all fucked up.

608
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,800
I mean, again, I think this was the point.

609
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,200
It's like, oh, this is uncomfortable and I don't like seeing Steven unhappy

610
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,440
and traumatized, but you know, makes sense.

611
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,600
That's how it would be.

612
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,920
Maybe just as a fan, it's that like I wanted to see a Steven Rose

613
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,640
resolution of some kind.

614
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,560
And maybe there was a line or two here there.

615
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,400
Other characters develop a deeper understanding.

616
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,160
I feel like Steven didn't get that.

617
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,200
So just as a like, as like, you know, you're saying it's kind of like a

618
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,720
Sailor Moon or a Shonen series kind of styled show.

619
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,680
You expect the big emotional anime speech and that did not come, at least

620
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,280
like the climactic quote unquote meeting of those two, you know,

621
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Titans of characters of like Steven, Pearl or whatever and Rose.

622
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,440
But yeah, yeah, I mean, it did touch on these.

623
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,400
My biggest trauma.

624
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,000
I think that's why a lot of people did like it.

625
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,640
That that really, you know, that it really hurt me deep inside is that, you know,

626
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,920
this this whole show, we've been investing in it for so long.

627
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,080
We never got to see Greg fuck Pearl.

628
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,480
Yeah, this is a this is a crime against humanity

629
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,800
and a crime against gem kind of the highest order.

630
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,480
We never got to see Greg fuck Pearl.

631
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,600
We should have seen that.

632
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,480
We should have also seen Steven fuck Lapis and Peridot.

633
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,560
Although Bismuth is definitely going to split Pearl wide open with her.

634
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,760
No, that's going to happen.

635
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
I don't like that at all.

636
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,840
I don't want to think about it.

637
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,640
I'm not going to, you know, that one episode, though,

638
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,080
was the only time I've ever kind of liked Bismuth,

639
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,080
because she was actually kind of endearing and looked a little bit unusual.

640
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm going to see a therapist about there being like too many lesbians and cartoons these days.

641
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,600
Oh, you know what I was saying?

642
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,480
I was saying to Michelle the other day, Steven Universe, would it really

643
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,160
the original Steven Universe, which I could get on board with, was really the story

644
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,720
of all these dumb ass bimbos and hoes and sluts.

645
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,400
They needed a strong patriarchal man to set them straight.

646
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,120
And that's what Steven Universe was.

647
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,480
But now Steven Universe's future is fucking all these women coming in

648
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,320
and saying the man needs to figure out his emotions.

649
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,920
It's not OK that he lashes out and literally kills people.

650
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,160
You made me a warrior.

651
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,800
I had to be strong to defend you.

652
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,080
You made me into this creature.

653
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,600
Now you want me to change?

654
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,400
Sounds like it's forcing some kind of stereotypes on both sides of the equation.

655
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,680
Good job, Rebecca.

656
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,960
I loved when he I loved when he was

657
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,760
I loved when he was beating the shit out of a white diamond.

658
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,960
I wanted to see more of that.

659
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,840
I wanted that to get darker and more violent.

660
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,160
I wanted in the really kicker ass around the room.

661
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,680
It got darker than I ever expected it to when you like tried to murder white diamond.

662
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Oh, man.

663
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,480
And the episode where he was yelling at Greg when they had a big fight

664
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,200
because he realized that Greg's been full of shit his whole life

665
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,000
and that he had a really comfortable upbringing.

666
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,400
That was cool. When he said like.

667
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,360
I figured you would sympathize with Greg, though,

668
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,080
because Greg had like this stuffy, like uppity family

669
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,480
who tried to control him and tell him what to do all the time.

670
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,080
I mean, you can always see the the grass is always greener, right?

671
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,840
So I totally get Stevens like he's now seeing what he could have had

672
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,480
through that family connection.

673
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,440
But I don't know. Right.

674
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,600
I don't know. It was a complicated scene, of course, as many things are here.

675
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,680
It's just I liked it.

676
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,200
I like the whole I like the whole thing, except for the parts that were lame and shitty.

677
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,680
But I don't care about those parts because they're boring to talk about.

678
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,040
Man, what about that?

679
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,280
Yeah, I loved seeing White Diamond

680
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,880
when Steven was a monster, that whole little like dramatic speech

681
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,960
she gave about how bad she feels about how, you know, like Spinell was like,

682
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,360
this is all my fault. The White Diamond is like, no, you were just mad at Pink.

683
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,080
And if she hurt you, it's because I hurt her.

684
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,160
Just like I hurt Steven and the Gems and everybody in the entire universe.

685
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,680
I love that.

686
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,400
Just imagine I just it's really funny to me.

687
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,160
Like, imagine waking up and realizing that you've fucked up so bad

688
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,400
and so consistently for so long that you've hurt everybody in the entire universe.

689
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,800
White Diamond absolutely became my favorite character.

690
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,240
I love her. She's the best.

691
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,920
She's cool. That was that was.

692
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,320
I mean, and what has White Diamond come to terms with like the reason

693
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,840
she did all those things was like probably because of the authority

694
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,400
placed on her and how she felt she had to be perfect.

695
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,560
So she developed these weird like authoritarian needs.

696
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,240
And I'm sure at the time, you know, she had no perspective to know any better.

697
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,680
Or like, yeah, right, right.

698
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:36,000
But I like that they that they were able to devote at least like one little line

699
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,520
in there to like giving her some remorse or like characterization

700
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,080
beyond my critique of that line, though, was the delivery.

701
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,640
Was it like, oh, Steven, I'm so like they didn't

702
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,120
her like way over the top voice.

703
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,360
That should have been a little more like down to earth.

704
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,880
I don't know. It was like kind of it was like a rarity reading like a.

705
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah, that's true.

706
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,200
I don't see it as like any less sincere because she was being dramatic.

707
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,760
Speaking of gems.

708
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,720
Well, Rarity had three gems on her flank.

709
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Three diamonds. There you go.

710
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,080
The Diamond Authority, it was Rarity all along.

711
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,680
Rarity is white.

712
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,320
What a spike, fucking eight pearl.

713
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,160
What if you just fucking ate all of them?

714
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,040
Spikes the most powerful.

715
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Dude, spikes their natural predator.

716
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,720
Why didn't they introduce dragons as the natural predators of gems?

717
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,000
So this is all a defensive war.

718
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,840
And if only if only creepy Chad spike

719
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,280
my little pony finale had been there, he would have saved the day much sooner.

720
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,400
We need my little pony future to cross over.

721
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,720
And then we can get all these plots.

722
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,240
Oh, oh, oh, shit.

723
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,600
Is that started yet?

724
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,640
What is that show?

725
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,800
I saw the trailer for it.

726
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,320
Like a my little pony generation, something or other.

727
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,920
I don't know what it is, but I saw the trailer.

728
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Pony life. Yeah.

729
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,320
I don't think it started yet.

730
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,400
What's the premise of it?

731
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,800
It looks like there's no animation in the animals, but my little pony.

732
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Like my little pony, but animated slightly differently in cutes here.

733
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,480
But there's no like information as to what it is.

734
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,720
Yeah, it was very strange.

735
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,320
I want to see everyone's videos.

736
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,720
I want to see animated James make his big video about how this sucks.

737
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,080
It's not living up to the potential of the original, even though it's better

738
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,560
in every way as I'm waiting for the schism.

739
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm when Gen five drops, I'm so excited to have the the pony

740
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,080
equivalence of the Picard Kirk arguments happening on Twitter.

741
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,040
And I can watch from the sidelines and be like, I know I understand this.

742
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,400
Have they if they like revealed Gen five stuff, is it going to be like

743
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,520
the same continuity or it's a reboot, but they haven't announced anything about it yet.

744
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,440
A reboot. It's just that's.

745
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,200
Wait, OK, it's just it's just going to be a new generation.

746
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,560
Just like all the other ones are had nothing to do with each other.

747
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,400
So yeah, OK, OK.

748
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,480
So so Twilight doesn't exist anymore.

749
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,800
Like that kind of that's all gone.

750
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,280
It's dead.

751
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,760
So gone. That's a waste.

752
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,160
Why not just have why not just fucking have Twilight be the story's over, man?

753
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,800
They have to be over.

754
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,000
But you can do the next generation.

755
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You can do. Yeah.

756
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,160
But you can do that with like you can do like a next generation with like new

757
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,000
characters and still have, you know, Twilight.

758
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,600
Yeah, OK. Now, from what I heard,

759
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,800
I think they were saying they're going to they're going to shift

760
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,960
the the the Twilight to like an Earthpony again or something.

761
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,720
I don't know if that's true or not, but OK.

762
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,600
I mean, they fucking changed.

763
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,480
They changed lots.

764
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,200
Well, whatever, like Rainbow Dash's Firefly was.

765
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,760
So I can't wait for all the Internet drama and all the YouTube videos.

766
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,960
It's going to be a great time.

767
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,840
I'm definitely curious to see what it looked like just on its face.

768
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,680
You see, because like Lauren Faust was like

769
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,000
she she had a vision for a show and she made, you know, a whole thing.

770
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,840
But the other generations were mostly just, you know, entirely toy focused

771
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,360
characters from one generation would appear in the other.

772
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,680
So like Gen Five might have like some characters

773
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,560
just have different personalities and look exactly the same

774
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,200
with the same color design and everything.

775
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,360
Like Rainbow Dash, you're, you know, you're you, but you're completely different.

776
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,640
Yeah, I'll be fine.

777
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,960
I'm looking forward to it.

778
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,920
Oh, Jesse, Jesse, I wanted to right now.

779
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,880
I won't tell anybody because it's not out yet.

780
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,640
If whatever, you don't want to know anything.

781
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,480
Have you heard anything, Jesse, about the gigantic leaks

782
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,160
of what's going on with the FF7 remake?

783
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,160
Because I have some insider information.

784
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,320
OK, I like I don't want.

785
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
I won't tell you if you don't want to know.

786
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,080
I do not want to be spoiled for anything.

787
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,760
OK, OK, understood.

788
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,960
I didn't want to know it.

789
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,320
No, I didn't want to know the world.

790
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,040
Like I saw something and like I don't know

791
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,560
if I should believe it or not.

792
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,440
Like I don't know if it was.

793
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,120
Yeah, I know, right?

794
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,640
I don't know if it was a for real spoiler or just like a joke.

795
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
And I'm afraid to ask if the person was joking or not.

796
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,000
But like, yeah, like.

797
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,200
Like it, it, it like broke me.

798
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,960
Like it hurt my heart because like.

799
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,960
If it's true, then this is something that could have surprised me

800
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,680
that is now destroyed for me.

801
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,920
Like it could have been something like because I'm like I'm not trying to hate the remake.

802
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,400
Like I don't I understand.

803
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,600
Like I like I want to if there's anything in it

804
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,840
that can catch me by surprise and make me go, wow, that's really interesting

805
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,440
and cool that they did that.

806
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,160
Then I want to be able to experience that.

807
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,760
And the fact that I like even maybe saw a spoiler

808
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,560
is like taking that away from me.

809
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,720
It's ripping away something that I deserve.

810
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
God damn it. I understand.

811
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,520
Yeah, yeah.

812
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,720
So OK, well, I add a quick time event where if you mash X, you can save

813
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,120
Eris, that's the thing because like I'm like, I'm not even because honestly,

814
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,800
like if they did something like really drastic to really surprise me,

815
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,880
even if it like, you know, shat all over the old game

816
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,120
and was completely retarded and new and stupid.

817
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,840
At this point, I would be like, hey, cool.

818
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,400
I fucking like as far as I'm concerned, if they're going to change anything,

819
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,680
they might as well change everything.

820
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,600
They might as well go completely off the rails and totally be blowing my mind

821
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,720
at every turn so that, you know, rather than having to compare

822
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,000
to something that I know is objectively better, the old game,

823
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,000
I can I can go on this ride and be like, oh, everything's different

824
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,160
and stupid and crazy now, and it's just a wacky.

825
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,680
All right. You know, yeah, there's a logic to that.

826
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,120
Yeah. But I don't know.

827
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,880
Like now I hope like I hope what I saw isn't true because I if it is,

828
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,080
you know, I just I don't want to feel like I got spoiled for something

829
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,640
because like I remember when I played Final Fantasy 7 the first time,

830
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,320
like 20 million thousand years ago, I was a little kid when it first came out.

831
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,280
Back then, as a kid, I had a strategy guide and the strategy guide

832
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,680
had like story spoilers in it for them.

833
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,440
So like even as a kid, I got spoiled for the game.

834
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,800
This game that is now, you know, that became my favorite game of all time.

835
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,560
And I've waited all these years to now know that I had a chance

836
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,880
to get surprised finally and got spoiled again.

837
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,320
It's like it's like a sick joke.

838
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,400
It's like it's even harder now to avoid.

839
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,080
I got just mute Final Fantasy 7 and FF7 on Twitter.

840
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
So none of those tweets show up.

841
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Yeah, that's true.

842
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,760
Let me check. I'm just checking the release date real quick.

843
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,120
It is coming out. Oh, my God.

844
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,600
April 10th, five days.

845
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,520
I thought they pushed it back.

846
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,480
In fact, I think what you're hearing this is well.

847
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,280
OK, I just googled it.

848
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,120
Maybe they didn't.

849
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,560
Is the reason that like the spoilers are out because like they gave

850
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,560
some people the game early because I kind of it came out early in some regions.

851
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,360
I saw a tweet of somebody in I think Europe somewhere that has their copy.

852
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,400
It is the virus's fault that this happened, that these leaks are out there.

853
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,880
It's not the virus's fault.

854
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,640
If this happened, if this virus spoiled me for a video game

855
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,720
that I'm looking forward to, even slightly, that's a bigger tragedy

856
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,280
than anything else that's done to our nation.

857
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,040
That's the worst part of society.

858
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,400
That's the true tragedy.

859
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,000
I, you know, I'm a bit more in the camp of new, bad, old, good

860
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,520
just across the board.

861
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,200
But beyond that, I won't say anything.

862
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,000
But I've just I have seen what I've seen what appears to be like like footage.

863
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,880
I watched a guy play a little bit on Twitch or something who seemed to have it.

864
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,240
It was funny that that feed I was watching just gets cut off

865
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,640
and is then like this channel no longer exists.

866
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,960
I'm like, oh, there goes Square Enix bringing down the hammer

867
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,400
on some of these troublemakers.

868
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:13,640
My my my opinion on it is old, good, new, like new, bad, but spoilers works.

869
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Spoilers. I say spoilers even worse than new, bad.

870
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,720
You know, because the thing is I've heard some spoilers that are troubling, I'll say.

871
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:28,480
But like I there there is a possibility this could be something special.

872
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,840
And I mean, as we've said before, you and I, it's like, you can't not be.

873
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,040
I was just watching a guy fight something and I was like this.

874
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,560
I can't ignore the fact that like seven year old me would be exactly

875
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,280
creaming his fucking pants, looking at what I'm seeing before me right now.

876
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,200
The logical, rational, like thinking part of your brain tells you

877
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,720
they're going to ruin every part of this.

878
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,080
They're going to shit all over it.

879
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,560
It's going to be bad.

880
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,960
Zoomers and zoomers are going to play it and they're going to think that they're going to think this is the real one.

881
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,320
God, but there is.

882
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,080
But there is still like underneath it all.

883
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,760
There's like this small burning ember of nostalgia that you just can't get rid of.

884
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,720
And you look at it and you go, oh, God, it looks kind of cool.

885
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,760
If I get so excited for like a really cool piece of like Tifa fan art,

886
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,080
how can you not get excited for this entire game that is essentially a fan art?

887
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,680
If a fan art, yeah, yeah.

888
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,560
Speaking of new bad, I'll tell you, I've been playing the Resident Evil 3 remake.

889
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,080
I've heard bad things.

890
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,280
New bad, I don't know.

891
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,920
New very bad.

892
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,440
I thought it was being viewed pretty well.

893
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,080
Is that just like the mainstream journal opinion and like real people think it sucks?

894
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,240
So I did that.

895
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,920
I did a video when Resident Evil 2

896
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,440
remake came out called Resident Evil 2 is great.

897
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,760
But I hated sort of tongue in cheek.

898
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,360
I had some criticisms and some complaints.

899
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,320
But I think square or not square Capcom.

900
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,800
Capcom must have seen my video and said, we'll show this guy how good he has it now.

901
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,880
He wants to complain about a Resident Evil game.

902
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,800
We'll give him something to cry about.

903
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,120
And they sure did.

904
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,600
First of all, I think I was out.

905
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,200
Um, I think I'm at the end of the game.

906
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
It's been like a half an hour of gameplay.

907
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,240
First of all, yeah, yeah.

908
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,520
Just like there's so much from the original game that is just gone.

909
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,200
Like it feels like half the game you go.

910
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,440
You're in the city streets for like the first hour or two.

911
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,560
And then you're in a hospital and then you're in an underground lab,

912
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,400
just like the underground lab in Resident Evil 2 that they already did.

913
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,760
And it's like, what happened to like the clock tower section in the park section?

914
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,480
What happened to all the branching paths?

915
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,640
No branching paths.

916
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,200
They they made the zombies like, huh, they made the zombies weaker

917
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,800
to like they're not bullet sponges anymore.

918
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah, they were too strong.

919
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The last one was the complaint.

920
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,640
Right. But like it would have been like the resiliency of the zombies wasn't the issue.

921
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,200
For me, the issue was that the headshots felt like they didn't work half the time, you know?

922
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:55,760
Yeah.

923
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,480
So like if they had just kept them that level of resilient and let me put them

924
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,640
down with one headshot, I'd have been like they fixed it.

925
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,320
Instead, like the headshots still don't work and they're weaker.

926
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,680
So now that it's just like the zombies are made out of paper,

927
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,000
all the gore effects are gone, like the arms don't fall off when you shoot them.

928
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,480
The legs don't fall off the fuck.

929
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,160
They just kind of just quality design.

930
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,960
All all the zombies have a stock falling down and dying animation.

931
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,000
And it's the same for every zombie you shoot in the whole game.

932
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,960
No, no one falls apart. Nothing.

933
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,240
There's this weird like mashing X minigame.

934
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,200
You have to press every time a zombie grabs you, which it feels like it does nothing.

935
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,960
It doesn't like activate a counter.

936
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,920
You don't have any like counter weapons like the knife that you had in the first

937
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,000
two remakes. It's just there's there's no way to get out of a zombie grab.

938
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,440
You're just pressing X seemingly for no reason.

939
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,480
And also, you know, it still has the problem of every time a zombie grabs you,

940
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,400
the camera swings around to be cinematic.

941
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,320
And then it comes back and you're disoriented and you run into another enemy,

942
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,560
which is even worse when the nemesis is chasing you through the whole level.

943
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,160
And the nemesis, they just bungled all their bangles with the nemesis.

944
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,600
Let me tell you, brother, this guy used to be the the head

945
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,200
honcho, big cheese chairman of the fucking board of resident evil.

946
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,000
You know, before they before they retconned, you know, Albert

947
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,720
Wesker and being like the series antagonist when he was still technically dead,

948
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,520
you know, nemesis was like the big bad of the trilogy.

949
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,280
He was a culmination of like every, you know, the ultimate evolution of these

950
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,960
monsters you've been fighting. He was intelligent. He hated you.

951
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,840
He was a bully. He ran at you.

952
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,800
And he just punched you. He was mean.

953
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,280
He had guns. He had fingers to use guns.

954
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,600
And he chased you. And like the chase were dynamic and like real.

955
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,800
And part of the gameplay, he'd you'd walk into an alley and you'd have to run

956
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,760
and he'd chase you into other rooms.

957
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,120
All the nemesis encounters here are like QTE,

958
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,280
like like story driven, you know, like on rails, scripted scenes.

959
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,320
Instead of just the dynamic him chasing you like Mr. X was, they, you know,

960
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,040
I think there's like one section of the whole game.

961
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,240
There's like one five minute section where he's actually stalking around the city.

962
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,800
But it only lasts for that one section.

963
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,760
It's like five minutes.

964
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,120
And the rest of the times you see him,

965
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,000
it's all scripted sequences of him coming out and just you run from him

966
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,360
in this like cinematic story segment that seems like it feels like you can't

967
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,480
actually die game bad movie. Good. I love movies.

968
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,680
I love Avengers. Please give me more.

969
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,160
Jesse, do you know if this game was made by a different like like not studio,

970
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,960
but like different team over at Capcom, because it seems bizarre

971
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,880
that this game came out so quickly after Resident Evil 2 and so much is different.

972
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,800
I was thinking the same thing.

973
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,680
It is bizarrely because it seems like it would be more work to build

974
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,120
everything again, seemingly from the ground up than just port over all the features

975
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,880
like the limb damage and stuff from two.

976
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,880
Yeah, I think it was I think it was definitely rushed because and I think someone,

977
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,160
the YouTuber Sphere Hunter brought this up in her review where

978
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,400
it's possible that because there are more zombies on the screen in this game,

979
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,080
like there are bigger hordes, they had to like take away some of the features

980
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,880
of the zombies to make them fit more. Well, great.

981
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,280
Maybe. Yeah, not worth it at all, especially when, you know,

982
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,800
you have these, yes, much bigger hordes of zombies,

983
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,000
but they're all go down like paper mache.

984
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,800
So what's what's the difference?

985
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,520
Fucking, I don't know, old, good, new, bad, old, good, new, bad.

986
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,600
Hey, listen to this, though.

987
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,680
I happen to hear one piece of, I don't know, like developer commentary,

988
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,080
the art director here in the in the gross, disgusting audio links chat.

989
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,800
I just posted two images of Jill.

990
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,040
All right, I this was straight from the fucking horse's mouth.

991
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,240
Now, all right, before you call me a fucking goober gate or everybody,

992
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,480
it's it's always been theorized that like a lot of these people

993
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,920
are making their women like less sexy on purpose

994
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,040
so as to not like upset interest groups of various types.

995
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,080
OK, the art director has straight up come out and said the director

996
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,520
for the remake that they had to change her design to be too practical.

997
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,680
And they thought it was a mistake in the original game to make her so sexy.

998
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,080
It was a mistake.

999
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,400
And he's like, oh, my God, like the developers at this point,

1000
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,640
even though she was wearing like casual clothing, all they did.

1001
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,720
And also look at her clothes, look at her clothes.

1002
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,120
Is that too sexy?

1003
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,520
I'm sorry, you can see a tiny bit of the top of her breasts.

1004
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,680
Yeah, all they did is they just changed a tube top to a tank top.

1005
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,880
And but and also but but she had a sweater around her waist, at least,

1006
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,600
so that she actually had more clothes in the original technically speaking.

1007
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,320
You know, she was at least in the original.

1008
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,760
She went out with the intention of wearing a sweater.

1009
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,680
And this one is even more sexy because she didn't even think about

1010
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,160
wearing a sweater in the first place.

1011
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,800
Just put on just that means just fucking they're just saying these.

1012
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,320
I mean, you that should not be a consideration when you're fucking

1013
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,840
designing and I don't know what it's like.

1014
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,960
I felt like her hair looks like way worse in this version.

1015
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,360
And like, I think it's way worse than I think it's technically

1016
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,000
the same hairstyle as the original, but just the uncanny valley

1017
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,080
of the of the new graphics make it look like a Karen cut.

1018
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,560
All of a sudden, it's almost like art style is relevant.

1019
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,720
I'm just looking at this first screenshot.

1020
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,920
I think just the fact that they're no, no.

1021
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,800
Realism, good fucking non-photorealism.

1022
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,360
I mean, Tom, I fuck you.

1023
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,000
Oh, you're right.

1024
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,240
I love photorealism.

1025
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:21,920
You piece of shit.

1026
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,760
I know you do.

1027
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,600
Across the board.

1028
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,080
Yeah.

1029
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,280
Well, just look at this screenshot.

1030
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,400
Like the hairstyles are similar, but the fact that there's not those

1031
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,520
like stray cartoony kind of strands of hair covering the forehead on two sides

1032
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,800
totally changes the silhouette and it really emphasizes a big forehead

1033
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,160
on the redesign model.

1034
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,760
She old good new bad pretty much sums it.

1035
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,640
I and you know what, they're doing it again.

1036
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,440
They're doing this thing.

1037
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,600
The number one thing I hate.

1038
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,680
And I understand why they're doing the thing of designing their

1039
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,400
characters after real life models.

1040
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,960
I am so opposed to that practice.

1041
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,600
I think it's such a mistake to do that.

1042
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,000
It's like whatever.

1043
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,320
That was like my biggest complaint about the visuals.

1044
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,480
Yeah, I cry five and don't make cry four.

1045
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,520
Dante was like this big buff like comic book superhero guy.

1046
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,800
It was cool.

1047
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,920
And then in five, he's just like normal proportion and it looks like he like

1048
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,720
lost like 50 pounds of muscle from the last final point on the gubergator side.

1049
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,320
Yes.

1050
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:15,560
Okay.

1051
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,400
People are going to, they did give her a DLC outfit for its DLC pay extra for

1052
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,360
the original version, but it's not even the same.

1053
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,000
She doesn't have a skirt.

1054
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,080
She has a scort.

1055
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,560
You can't see your pussy and that's a fucking rip off.

1056
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,680
So fuck you.

1057
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,280
I don't know whether I'm being like, like insane or anything.

1058
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,560
I don't see anything particularly wrong with the new one on the, on the right.

1059
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Well, wrong is a relative term.

1060
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,720
Like, yeah, there's nothing wrong with it.

1061
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,280
The dine is just fine.

1062
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,480
I mean, it does come from a bit of old, good new, okay.

1063
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,040
It's, it's, it's about the spirit of what is a remake.

1064
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,800
And when, whenever I see a remake, perhaps I'm more, you know, more attached to the

1065
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,400
past than others.

1066
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,560
Why would they make a real legitimate rational reason?

1067
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,200
Why, why like to change the design?

1068
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,000
Like it's not a big deal that they changed it, but it's kind of a big deal that

1069
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,440
they don't have a good reason for it.

1070
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,240
It's the reason and the art director straight up, and this is a rare instance,

1071
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,160
he came out and said it directly.

1072
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,960
She was too sexy.

1073
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,200
That's bad.

1074
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,160
We had to fix that mistake.

1075
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:16,880
Sure.

1076
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:22,040
It's, it's not like you can disagree with his opinion with that.

1077
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,480
I just personally like would like, I don't know.

1078
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,680
I, I feel like if he thought that it's too sexy, we need to change it.

1079
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,080
And he does that.

1080
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,280
And the game is the, you know, the game is the thing that matters more.

1081
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,200
Like this is an image you're never really going to be looking at this character

1082
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,320
in this exact way, usually going to be seen from them, from the behind.

1083
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,680
And you're going to be looking at the zombies that are coming at you.

1084
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,960
So like, all you're saying, what I'm saying is that your point is you don't

1085
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,280
care about these details.

1086
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,240
Others might.

1087
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,520
And I mean, I'm not really getting to like a larger point of like sexy

1088
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,600
characters are good and I do like them.

1089
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,320
And I personally, if I were to design a game would not shy away from having a

1090
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,200
sexy character.

1091
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,560
I hope all I hope is that there's more people like me in the world like that,

1092
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,440
who are not like terrified or making sexy characters with remakes.

1093
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,320
It feels like, like it's always like a big brand.

1094
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,240
They're making a remake to make money.

1095
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,880
Nobody has any artistic, like not, not really, no real artistic integrity is

1096
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,320
going into remakes because they're coming from a, you know, a point from the

1097
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:40,840
top down, big guy says, we have an IP, need to make money, use IP to get people

1098
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,680
to buy thing because they're stupid and they will buy the same thing over and

1099
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,640
over again, sell same thing.

1100
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:52,560
So for them, the entire thing is all about PR, appeases many people as possible

1101
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,600
and have it be just okay and put it out.

1102
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:01,360
And indie games don't need to worry about like things like that or like newer

1103
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,200
games because they're the design characters for the first time.

1104
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,400
So like, while this is bad and I agree with you, I generally just don't think

1105
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,240
it's a big deal because remakes are bad, just in general, and fuck them.

1106
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,240
Okay, but I mean, why are they bad?

1107
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,160
Well, okay, that's a complicated question, but I'm a, you're arguing the pragmatism.

1108
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,440
I'm arguing the like ideological concerns person.

1109
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,480
I'm not arguing for them.

1110
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,680
It's just sort of like, this is the reason I don't really see too much of an issue

1111
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,280
because it's just, it's a remake already.

1112
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,040
It's what, look, I'm not even a, I'm a kumar, but I'm not a big kumar.

1113
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,040
And so like, yeah, I enjoy attractive female forms.

1114
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,040
I am a big kumar, I'm just putting that out there.

1115
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,720
Fair it out, fair it out.

1116
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,800
It's, when it's so clearly stated in black and white, like the exact reasoning

1117
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,760
that like these people are fundamentally opposed to, like, because they think they'll

1118
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,960
have issues, to me, it stinks of cowardice or an ideology that I just disagree with.

1119
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,080
Either they're trying to appease people and it does come back to like, they're

1120
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,640
changing thing, I mean, Jill's outfit is iconic.

1121
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,840
I never played Resident Evil, but everyone knows this fucking outfit because it was

1122
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,120
great and everyone loves it.

1123
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,280
But it's the beret too, all that stuff.

1124
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,680
But they're, you know, I mean, it gets to larger issues of like, should we sanitize

1125
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,240
culture, like is sexuality bad and needs to be scrubbed?

1126
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,840
I mean, you know, that's the real issue it touches.

1127
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,440
I would strongly argue, no, like I don't want like hardcore pornography

1128
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,040
available 24 seven all the time.

1129
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,160
I mean, available is one thing, but like visible and in your face.

1130
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,160
But tasteful, you know, sexuality is not only appropriate, I think at a certain

1131
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,600
point, healthy for people to be exposed to.

1132
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,200
So I don't know, that's kind of what it gets to for me on the larger front.

1133
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,520
And maybe you agree with that, but you're just arguing with pragmatism.

1134
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,240
That's also what I'm arguing is that you'll never really get this from a

1135
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,120
remake because of the way remakes are monetarily focused.

1136
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,360
You know, like if you want to change the world of video games, remakes have

1137
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,560
to stop being bought by people and new games have to be embraced more.

1138
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,880
But, you know, it's not as easy as the biggest anti-remaker because the games

1139
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,760
have to be good and, you know, all that sort of stuff.

1140
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,520
I hate remakes, but good ones do exist.

1141
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,600
I just discourage it because they generally come out bad.

1142
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,800
For example, Pokemon Heart Gold, possibly the greatest remake of all time.

1143
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,320
That game is, I mean, it's great.

1144
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,760
And in basically no way does it make the original like worse.

1145
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,960
Well, OK, it kind of replaces it, which is one of the reasons I don't

1146
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,800
really like remakes, but it didn't really like sully the history.

1147
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,640
I mean, they did change the design of the main character, which looks way gayer

1148
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,760
now, which is too bad.

1149
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,240
But other than that, it's it's basically inoffensive.

1150
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,960
Everybody loves the Resident Evil One remake, which I never played, but they

1151
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,920
tell me is like even better and just as good and honors the original.

1152
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,040
All that good stuff that OK, that's all good.

1153
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,040
That's all good.

1154
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,920
So I don't know.

1155
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,000
It's just about how you do it.

1156
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,040
I forgot to mention about the Resident Evil 3 remake.

1157
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,440
Yeah, the reason why I think the game is clearly so rushed and has so much

1158
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:11,520
missing from it is that when you buy the game and you download it, it comes

1159
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,520
in two separate downloads.

1160
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,280
There's the game, Resident Evil 3.

1161
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,720
And then there's an entirely separate game that is just like some lame,

1162
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,520
online multiplayer raid mode left for dead bullshit.

1163
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,600
Of course, like no one would ever play.

1164
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,280
There's no reason anyone would care about this ever.

1165
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,640
Nobody asked for this.

1166
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,720
It's like four players are guys going around fighting, you know, hordes

1167
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,280
in a room to try and get out of the room.

1168
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,280
And one player is like a controller person, like putting zombies down,

1169
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,680
like a SimCity guy.

1170
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,960
And it's like, who asked for this?

1171
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,720
What is the point?

1172
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,800
And you know, it's not even in the game, which originated in Resident Evil 3.

1173
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,880
The mercenaries mode is not even in there.

1174
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,240
So they took out a bonus mode that was part of the game originally and

1175
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,840
created a whole new bonus mode that is lame and sucks and nobody would ever

1176
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,160
care about and also the game bad and also old good.

1177
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,800
You know, we got to call this episode old, good, new, bad.

1178
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,600
That really sums it up.

1179
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,120
I'm just in a real slight tizzy about it.

1180
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,200
Oh, I remember back in the day when they were making the first season of

1181
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,560
Steven Universe, I was there when Garnet was a fusion for the first time.

1182
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,120
That old was good, but this new was bad.

1183
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,720
I just don't just not doing it for me.

1184
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,600
God, they're going to remake Steven Universe someday and the nemesis is going to suck.

1185
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,000
Hey, you know, I don't know if you guys are aware of this meme.

1186
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,760
Michelle, despite being a true four-channer at heart, spends a lot of

1187
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,680
time on Tumblr looking at girly, shitty Tumblr memes.

1188
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,400
But there is one excellent Tumblr meme that's Steven Universe related

1189
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,320
that I think you guys will appreciate and all of you listening.

1190
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,400
I'm sure many of you are not Tumblrites as well, but I've been exposed to the

1191
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,280
culture and I brought back this wonderful cultural artifact.

1192
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,600
And now that Steven Universe is over, it's appropriate to let you all know.

1193
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:15,200
It's that there's this there's this meme of when something happens in Steven

1194
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,880
Universe that is shocking, unexpected, possibly even good.

1195
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,720
You just screamed to the heavens.

1196
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,520
You say, I'm bald, Rebecca, I'm bald.

1197
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,040
And you snatch off your wig as a grand.

1198
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,520
I think this is like related to what's like drag queen culture or something.

1199
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,800
Because it's about like actually being bald and wearing wigs and how

1200
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,920
Rebecca has snatched your wig in surprise.

1201
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,440
OK, so there you go.

1202
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,720
There's your cultural artifact from the gay community, everybody.

1203
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,720
I'm very confused. Brought to you by Michelle.

1204
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,200
Yeah, I can't follow that at all.

1205
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,520
That sounds like pretty Michelle.

1206
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,000
There's layers to that.

1207
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,960
It's it's interesting, clearly missing crucial context.

1208
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm bald, Rebecca.

1209
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,560
Thank you for making me bald.

1210
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,520
I love that. Hey, all right, then.

1211
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,960
So how about that?

1212
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,080
What's up? PCP dating sim.

1213
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:03,960
Oh, yeah.

1214
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,880
The other thing I wanted to talk about, of course.

1215
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,360
Well, first of all, let's just give full credit to the whole crew.

1216
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,280
It is out, guys. Have you played it yet?

1217
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,480
It's out. It's actually really good.

1218
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,760
I've been all over it.

1219
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,720
All of them. I did Mages' whole story.

1220
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,920
I got killed by Slut Mage.

1221
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,160
Yeah, so that I reloaded by Save and I didn't get killed by Good Mage.

1222
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,240
But I got friendzoned by her, which is even worse.

1223
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,880
Yeah, that's worse than death.

1224
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,320
Are there like because that's the only thing that I've seen to the end.

1225
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,120
Are there like like sex scenes and like no.

1226
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,160
No, no, there's not that.

1227
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,880
There are two like most of them don't resolve in a kiss.

1228
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,720
I think two of them do only one of them is visual.

1229
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,920
The other one is implied.

1230
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,120
Well, because like not implied, just in text.

1231
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,480
Because when I did because when I did the mage route, you know,

1232
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,000
it didn't have one.

1233
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,440
So I thought, OK, thank goodness,

1234
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,480
they're not doing creepy, weird sex scenes of all of us.

1235
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,760
Yeah, but then I had the thought, wait a minute,

1236
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,360
what if they are doing it for all of us except mage because she is the girl?

1237
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:10,680
And that filled me with rage and hatred for even the possibility of it,

1238
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,880
of that double I could see that I could see thinking of that.

1239
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,760
And I think they made that they made the safe, fair decision

1240
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,680
to avoid doing so entirely.

1241
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,600
That's probably what I would have done.

1242
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,360
So I did that.

1243
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,520
And then I did my route and I didn't get to the end of it.

1244
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,920
I think I only got like half with you.

1245
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,880
And it was like, what do you think of it so far?

1246
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,040
My route was written by Chip Wiseman, who I is am I correct?

1247
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,040
And assuming that everyone's route is written by like totally different people.

1248
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,440
Yeah, the in the credits mostly.

1249
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,800
Yeah, that's my route is written by like four people.

1250
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:44,200
Yeah, yeah, like it wasn't as horrific and terrible

1251
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,800
and awful and bad and stupid as I thought it would be.

1252
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,520
Like there were parts in order to make friends with Jesse,

1253
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,960
you have to be a bully and a bad person.

1254
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,480
Jesse loves that shit. Yeah.

1255
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,760
You. Yeah, I felt like your route was a little heavy on the references

1256
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,760
and the like wacky person stuff like it's very like it's very clearly

1257
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:10,760
like someone emulating my writing as my speech, which obviously

1258
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,200
I don't necessarily speak like my writing in real life.

1259
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:20,320
You didn't you didn't have a rant about poopy buttholes one time, not even one time.

1260
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,360
It like like it wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be.

1261
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,040
There were parts that like I thought were cleverly written

1262
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,360
or that made me chuckle the whole part with Colt Corona.

1263
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,920
I don't know if he's in it more than just this one part,

1264
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,600
but there was one part where like Colt Corona is like just saying dumb shit.

1265
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,120
And I'm like, that was that's funny.

1266
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,160
Like I'm very happy to see Colt Corona immortalized in a video game.

1267
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,320
I'm more, you know, in one of the other routes, I just saw a week

1268
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,520
like something was happening and just a shadow darts past.

1269
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,160
I was like, what the fuck was that? Yeah, I think it was Colt Corona.

1270
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,200
There is a Colt Corona scene that I got to you.

1271
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,520
That was very funny and hilariously written.

1272
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,080
And it's like, like I am as trepidatious and horrified

1273
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,280
as I am to see myself portrayed by like the fan interpretations of me.

1274
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,400
You know, I am a human being like interpreted, you know,

1275
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,520
interpreted as like this weird cartoon character that people see me as

1276
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,640
as horrifying as that is to see Colt Corona, my greatest creation,

1277
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,240
my son, my brother, my best friend, the chosen one, my partner in crime

1278
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,640
in the darkest of times to see him immortalized in a video game was pretty cool.

1279
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,360
So that was my favorite part so far.

1280
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,120
Yeah, it's OK.

1281
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,760
I've seen a good amount and I'm prepared to say that this project is good.

1282
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,400
It is. It's definitely like the detail in the backgrounds

1283
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,240
and all the little references everywhere. It's so cool, man.

1284
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,520
Yeah, just like, I mean, I can't help but play it with like this

1285
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,240
constant critical eye of rage of like, I would never fucking say that.

1286
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,760
Why do you think this of me? What is wrong with you?

1287
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,600
I hate you. You make me regret ever being a public figure in the first place.

1288
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,240
I want to die. Yeah.

1289
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,720
But aside from that, it's pretty. It's pretty deep.

1290
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,600
So I guess. Yeah, yeah. I had a bit of a similar thing.

1291
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,640
I mean, I haven't played it yet.

1292
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,800
I'm probably going to play it tonight.

1293
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,760
I'm terrified for basically the same reason you're saying just

1294
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,320
of like how I interpreted. I felt like you guys give a disclaimer.

1295
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,320
There was no connection to real people intended.

1296
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,800
So I don't like all the dialogue is like funny and like I look at it

1297
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,040
and it's charming. I'm like, OK, that's good. I like this.

1298
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,360
And until like there's one like little jab in there that fucking ruins it.

1299
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,360
Like it's like, oh, and then Jesse said this word,

1300
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,040
but I don't think he knows what it means.

1301
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,960
I'm like, what are you talking about?

1302
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,160
Why would you say that of me?

1303
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,680
Like, did I did I use that word wrong once and like five years ago

1304
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,040
and just someone never forgot it? Like, stop.

1305
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,360
You know, I feel probably I feel a little weird.

1306
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,040
I mean, because I know the guy, well, OK, I won't won't go into that too much.

1307
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,440
But just like when I'm playing my route, like first of all,

1308
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,600
just the visual depiction of Nate is like such an exaggeration.

1309
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,680
Like, I wish I looked like, you know, like Professor Bessman.

1310
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,000
Professor Bessman, like my fear is what I get a lot of the time

1311
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,360
because like a lot of my fans, they do a thing where they like think

1312
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,840
that I'm actually way cooler than I actually am.

1313
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,000
And like my biggest fear was that like this is going to be

1314
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,640
I'm just going to feel bad about myself because this depiction of me

1315
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,800
is like so much better.

1316
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,280
But the Nate route actually it kind of deals with exactly that issue

1317
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,160
of how like Nate projects and like looks really competent.

1318
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,320
But actually, he's got a lot of like

1319
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,240
I always feel like the fans, which is true, like I feel like the

1320
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,040
like fans of mine think I'm cool for all the wrong reasons

1321
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,760
that I don't want people to think are the reasons I'm cool.

1322
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,400
Sure. Sure.

1323
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,600
It's just like, like, I don't know.

1324
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,920
Like they have me in the like, it seems like everything my character says

1325
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,720
is like really smart and really clever and charming and funny.

1326
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,520
But then every once in a while, like I'm also eating garbage and shit

1327
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,920
and like rolling around and like there's like the.

1328
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,960
There's like there's like the the last part I got to before I had to stop.

1329
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,520
I didn't finish it, not for any like I didn't like rage quit or anything.

1330
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,120
I just got, you know, busy, but like the tears just got a little too blurry

1331
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:05,080
to keep playing. Yeah, yeah, I'm like I'm having some like debate

1332
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,600
about Evangelion and like a bar with someone and like yelling at him

1333
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,360
and like yelling about how he's an idiot.

1334
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:17,720
I don't think I hate seeing like my anger be misinterpreted.

1335
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,240
Like this, like there's like a line like, oh,

1336
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,080
I don't see why he's getting so worked up over such a little thing.

1337
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:29,760
Like when I lose my temper, it's not because I'm like angry.

1338
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,360
It's because I'm fucking anxious because I'm usually surrounded

1339
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,880
by like five guys interrupting me the whole time and can't make my point.

1340
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,280
That's what causes me to like raise my voice.

1341
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,920
I would I don't think I would just be sitting at a bar yelling at someone

1342
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,120
about Evangelion like one person. Yeah, that's I don't give a shit, though.

1343
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,480
It's definitely finish your root because there's a bad ending with Donatello

1344
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,400
and it's really. Oh, no, of course, that would be the bad ending.

1345
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,720
Why would it be the good ending? Of course.

1346
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,320
I was going to say, Tom, I felt like the person who wrote yours

1347
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,080
captured your like, I don't know, talking pattern pretty well.

1348
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,760
They obviously know a lot about your stuff.

1349
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,560
Really? That's good.

1350
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,560
I wonder who wrote it. All right.

1351
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,800
That's that's intriguing and creepy, but I'm more intriguing.

1352
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,840
I'll probably check it out.

1353
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,240
I thought that for whatever, like, I don't know, there's like a Nate

1354
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,000
and then there's like a teaching assistant.

1355
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,400
OK, I won't spoil for you like your role, but like the Tom role was like

1356
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:33,280
among the most depressing, like initial setups of like it was so like

1357
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,400
juxtaposed to the rest of the characters.

1358
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,840
It was truly saddening, at least it just like real at first.

1359
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,760
And then like in the Nate rat, which I'm playing through, obviously,

1360
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:48,520
like there like you're like a subservient little worm to like tune Nate

1361
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:53,240
and like there's like just for one example, like I get the idea here,

1362
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,440
but there's like a big book.

1363
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,440
You're carrying like a volume of the Urban Dictionary, like Encyclopedia or whatever.

1364
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,120
You're like struggling to carry it with two hands.

1365
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,280
You hand it to Nate who like effortlessly like dangles it with like one finger.

1366
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,360
It's like, oh, God, this is too much.

1367
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,960
This is rude is what it is.

1368
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,200
It's just plain rude.

1369
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,360
True.

1370
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,720
They just know that I can't go to the gym anymore.

1371
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,040
My muscles are just deteriorating.

1372
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,800
Canonically, I think this is before you ever got hurt, though, or maybe not.

1373
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,800
OK, maybe I don't know.

1374
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,560
Maybe that's true.

1375
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,520
If there isn't a Q&A from Tom at the gym, I will be deeply disappointed

1376
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,400
because there is a gym.

1377
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:30,560
There's one thing in my route, which I'm a little bummed.

1378
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,960
I mentioned this when I streamed it, but there's a go.

1379
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,560
There's a thing with my route, which like doesn't come up again.

1380
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:43,040
And it's really interesting and I wish it had where like a new transfer student

1381
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:49,360
comes in and it's she's called Gwulfbin, which is an abbreviation for girl who

1382
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,840
looks like Riska, but is not.

1383
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:58,320
And she's like, oh, she has the hots for Gibbon, the character.

1384
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,320
And since this is a dating sim, you're trying to get me like there's like, oh,

1385
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,120
no, you've got to deal with Riska.

1386
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,280
And then also it was implied that Endless War was like also after me.

1387
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,560
And it was going to be like a whole like love square sort of like battle.

1388
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,760
But then it sort of it was dropped and they never came back up again.

1389
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,000
I was like, no, that was that was too bad.

1390
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,720
The coolest thing I've ever seen.

1391
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:27,760
But God, you know, what if they remade the PCP dating sim and made it worse?

1392
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,080
You know, I'm just someday we'll have to say, God,

1393
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,120
old, good, new bed, you know, no, it can't be true.

1394
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,240
They make it in 3D.

1395
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:41,760
Has they face scanned all of us for all the graphics, but they removed the

1396
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,080
DeVoo and Majora. It can't be true that the old was good.

1397
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,640
Oh, no.

1398
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,680
But I don't want to shit on it too much because like, no, I'm not like shitting

1399
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,800
on it. It's clearly had a lot of love put into it.

1400
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,840
The amount of work that went into it and the obvious love they have for

1401
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:03,320
like our stupid podcast and is like incredible.

1402
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,320
It's so hard work.

1403
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,120
It makes it feel like it's all been worth it to keep this thing going for so long.

1404
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,440
You know, there are a couple of monster episodes once in a while or a small price

1405
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,200
to pay for, for, you know, I don't know.

1406
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,040
The this is why, like, I don't know.

1407
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,080
We talk about, like, you know, sometimes, like, do we need to make an episode,

1408
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,360
like every week, you know, like, should we change the format?

1409
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,080
All those are reasonable questions to think about.

1410
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,960
But like at the end of the day, I really think it's just valuable to just have

1411
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,440
the thing, at least in my life, maybe you guys agree, to have, like, a thing

1412
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,560
in my life that I know, like every Sunday, I come here and I record a podcast

1413
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,160
with my friends that I've known for a long time and I respect all of them.

1414
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,280
And whatever happens, happens.

1415
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,480
It gets put out there and hopefully people like it.

1416
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,400
And you know what?

1417
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,600
It's had pretty good results with something like this.

1418
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,000
Just warms me old heart a little bit, see, people like in that stuff.

1419
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,280
It's very humbling.

1420
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,400
And, you know, on a more specific note about the dating sim, I got to say,

1421
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:04,440
like Oblivionfall, Sixten, Canman, Eric, working on the soundtrack.

1422
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,480
There is some incredible work in the soundtrack.

1423
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:12,160
I mean, I want to listen to this whole thing because I see Canman in the

1424
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,280
credits of the, of the, I'm looking at the dating sim, OST.

1425
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,360
I've got it downloaded, Carcalicious Plus Plus Plus by Canman, apparently.

1426
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,680
Oh, I think it's the one song by him, but there it is.

1427
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,560
For example, I don't know if you guys have listened to the full main menu song.

1428
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,000
Oh, yeah.

1429
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,200
It is a nine minute anthem.

1430
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,680
You can't turn it away.

1431
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,160
It starts off with like generic dating sim music.

1432
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,160
It event and Oblivionfall made this obviously.

1433
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,120
He's a fucking genius.

1434
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,360
It like skews into like a weird warped version of like through the fire and the

1435
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:45,240
flames, like halfway through and then like warps into like more weird shit as goes.

1436
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,880
And there's like a voice saying like, this is the menu.

1437
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,560
You cannot stay here.

1438
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,440
It will break if you keep listening.

1439
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,440
Oh, incredible, incredible.

1440
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,080
And the only other one, like there's a bunch of awesome stuff.

1441
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,960
But the one song I wanted to mention is there's just a song called, and I'm sure

1442
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,080
there's many examples of this, but there's so much heart, class of simple and clean.

1443
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,840
I was, yeah, I was in, you know, like Nate's lecture and the thing.

1444
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,520
And you just hear like generic classroom music and then just like mixed into the

1445
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,680
melody in the back.

1446
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:18,400
You just hear like, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk, punk.

1447
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,520
They have mixed in like so many of like the, that was simple and clean from

1448
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,480
fucking Kingdom Hearts one.

1449
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,000
So many memes songs have been mixed into this soundtrack.

1450
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:32,280
It makes me like so fucking happy to hear that shit.

1451
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,920
It's like all the memes and all the stuff that I've cared about in my fucking

1452
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,800
worthless ass life is being immortalized in this dating sim in ways that people

1453
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,160
might actually give a shit about and think are cool.

1454
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,360
They have a scene.

1455
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,160
It's so cool.

1456
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:50,080
Seen if you go on my route, where I play like chicken and a basketball for you in

1457
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,080
my room.

1458
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,360
Yeah.

1459
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,920
Do they play the actual song from like your, oh, fuck yeah.

1460
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,800
That's why I'm in the credits and I'm in the stuff because technically I said, yes,

1461
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,800
you can use my music.

1462
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,480
Oh, so they asked you when you gave permission to do so.

1463
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,600
Cool, cool.

1464
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:08,920
That's so cool.

1465
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,920
Michelle has loved that there's a song called Michelle's Theme.

1466
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,520
She's, she's pretty into that.

1467
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,080
We all have little character themes in there.

1468
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,600
This is, you know, only Michelle that I see, actually, literally only

1469
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,160
Michelle was worthy of a character has an actual theme.

1470
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,160
But like that class of symbol and clean is like a melody that's like Nate

1471
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:32,440
related. And I'm sure that there are, oh, I would hundred percent heard a Jesse

1472
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,080
song that, yeah, butt sugar was mixed into one of these songs at some point.

1473
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,640
I forget what song that is, but it's so good.

1474
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,040
Yeah, I do like the lore of the game.

1475
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,520
The fact that like Nate and Ben canonically share the same philosophy

1476
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,400
class and each time one teaches, they redecorate the entire room with like

1477
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,240
their shitty memorabilia.

1478
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,040
So cool, so fucking cool.

1479
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
Okay, I'm sorry.

1480
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,920
Just gushing a little bit.

1481
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,720
Yeah.

1482
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,880
Yeah.

1483
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,240
Yeah, yeah.

1484
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,920
I'm, I'm very glad it exists.

1485
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,080
And I think I already said this, but like I asked them, like, can I, can I use

1486
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,600
this fucking? It is just generally good music.

1487
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,320
He said, yeah, I'm wondering if.

1488
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:18,400
Yeah, I mean, since these people, this collective of people, however many

1489
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,440
there are in this group, now that they've, you know, proven themselves to be

1490
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,560
capable of something, like I'm wondering if like I could say to one of them at

1491
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,560
some point, hey, I've got an idea for your fucking game.

1492
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,520
Maybe you can get the gang back together and fucking do my idea.

1493
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,920
The idea occurred to me as well to, to utilize this.

1494
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,040
I mean, I want to, frankly, I would love to hear the tale from Eric himself.

1495
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:40,440
Oh, sorry.

1496
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,520
Well, Eric was like second.

1497
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,680
It was Chip Weissman who like led the project.

1498
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,360
I'd love to hear just the full tale of how he put it all together.

1499
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,520
That'll be, that'll be in the heckles for Shekels stream.

1500
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,200
The may have already come out by the time you're listening to this.

1501
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,760
But we're planning to do like a thing where we get the developers in.

1502
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:01,640
Right.

1503
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,480
Great points, great points, because I want to hear the tale and because, you

1504
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:09,080
know, among other things, I this like the game is obviously four free available

1505
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:09,920
now, you can download it.

1506
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,440
There's a patch, by the way, excuse me, make sure you get the patch version.

1507
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,480
The OST is also free to anyone who wants it.

1508
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,080
Like obviously all these guys worked for free.

1509
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,240
At least I would assume so over this time, just out of love of the craft.

1510
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,120
But like as it should be, as it should be.

1511
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:28,280
I just want to hear how Chip, like he probably started small, probably got a

1512
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,240
couple of people on board.

1513
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,080
I saw he used Godot to make this.

1514
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,240
I remember when I was making my game, indeed killed this, this game engine

1515
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:40,080
killed three Palestinian children when they were, oh my God, and fucking 9-11.

1516
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:44,520
9-11 exists in this game as a living embodiment of footage of the 9-11 terror

1517
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:44,960
attacks.

1518
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,320
It's so awesome that that happened.

1519
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,640
I love that American lives were lost.

1520
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,680
No, I apologize, everyone.

1521
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,320
Whenever I forget what I was saying.

1522
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,840
Anyway, so I was just saying that when I was working on my game back in the day

1523
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,920
for like the game jam, me and my buddy Rich did, we were thinking of using

1524
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,880
Godot or something, but we settle on good old RPG maker.

1525
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:12,760
So basically I'm as good as these guys at making video games is the point.

1526
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,880
Fair, fair enough.

1527
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,520
I definitely have video game projects of my own that I will need

1528
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,400
certain people to do things for.

1529
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,080
So I will be that that's a little bit far in the future.

1530
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,200
But yeah, I know I can call upon some of these people and they'll be like, hell,

1531
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,960
yeah, let's work, let's work and make a fucking cool product.

1532
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,040
Hell, yeah, it is.

1533
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,400
It is really handy to have all these connections.

1534
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:39,120
Let's cancel this whole endeavor and all just make video games.

1535
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,200
We can be like fucking we can keep the podcast going.

1536
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:48,240
But specifically, it will be exactly like Yandere Dev.

1537
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,040
We'll make a weekly podcast, specifically discussing the like

1538
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,240
10 lines of code that have changed every week on the project as we milk it for

1539
01:16:55,240 --> 01:17:01,160
years and years and years, six level deep if tree rest in peace.

1540
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,280
Rest in peace.

1541
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,000
Everyone's CPU running that game.

1542
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,120
I'm ready to drink from the cum chalice and and seek oblivion.

1543
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,240
Oblivion fall that is.

1544
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,240
Hey, great work, buddy.

1545
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,480
All right.

1546
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,480
So I guess that's it about any other comments.

1547
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,640
You guys want to say about it?

1548
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,600
Well, here's the thing that's happening.

1549
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:24,600
Yeah, the the no crowd WrestleMania is going on right now.

1550
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,640
Oh, yeah, they're doing it over.

1551
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,280
How is it weird as the one we are watching it?

1552
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,040
Well, it's weirder because it's WrestleMania and it's like the biggest show.

1553
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,200
And it's just like dead silent the whole time.

1554
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,920
They should add ambient applause because it is so weird.

1555
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,080
Yeah, they didn't hear anyone.

1556
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,400
OK, so they should have like a PS1 like copy pasted like.

1557
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:50,680
Yeah, the other wrestling company that's on TV, AEW,

1558
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,520
it's like a newer organization.

1559
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,680
They are also doing empty arena shows, but they had the idea of putting

1560
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,480
at least some other wrestlers like around the ring to simulate crowd noise

1561
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,960
and like react and just that small difference of having two or four people

1562
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,560
outside the ring reacting to stuff makes all the difference in the world

1563
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,520
and makes it feel like a wrestling show again.

1564
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,640
And like it feels like the WWE didn't want to admit

1565
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,600
that the other company had a good idea.

1566
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,080
So they stubbornly don't do it and they have like no one around the ring.

1567
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,320
There's everything is like dead silent and like really weird.

1568
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,480
And like the match is like they're doing the stuff.

1569
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,520
They're trying, but it's so are the rest of us wearing gloves.

1570
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,120
Gloves. Do they have to social distance?

1571
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,000
Oh, all right, right. Push them like force push.

1572
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,160
No, but there is there is a clip from an indie match on Twitter

1573
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,160
of I think Joey Janelle fighting someone in a social distancing match

1574
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,120
where they are doing that.

1575
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,280
They're like throwing like Hadouken punches and like not.

1576
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,320
So incredible. Yeah.

1577
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,640
But they didn't do even though like the majority of the matches,

1578
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,920
you know, they definitely suffer some from not having the crowd.

1579
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,480
And some of the big like moments like tonight, it's going to be the edge match

1580
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,520
like his first match returning after like nine years out with a

1581
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,360
debilitating neck injury.

1582
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,080
You know, it's a big deal that he's returning.

1583
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,920
And unfortunately, he has to make this great return to an empty arena.

1584
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,400
So that's sad. Yeah.

1585
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,640
But that's rough.

1586
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,320
They did something.

1587
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,120
The last match of the night last night was so cool.

1588
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:30,920
It was the Undertaker versus AJ Styles in a boneyard match.

1589
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,960
And this is the one part where like the social distancing quarantine thing

1590
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,480
was ended up being like a blessing in disguise because

1591
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,960
for the last couple of years, like Undertaker is he's much he's a much

1592
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,560
older man than he was. And he's yeah, it's it's been kind of uncomfortable.

1593
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,680
Some of his recent matches were like he's fighting Goldberg

1594
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,400
and he's getting dropped on his head and like he can't stand at the end of it.

1595
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,200
And it's just like, oh, maybe he should hang it up.

1596
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,400
I don't like watching this hero, you know, be so like crippled and old.

1597
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:04,480
This is bad. But they're they they're fucking the storyline

1598
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,960
that they're doing leading up to this is sort of lampshading that

1599
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:10,560
where AJ Styles has been like goading the Undertaker by going like, hey,

1600
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,120
you've lost it.

1601
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,000
You keep trying to come back into the spotlight and you're an old man.

1602
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,400
You've lost your mystique.

1603
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,600
You're posting on Instagram.

1604
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,920
You've got a wife now.

1605
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,920
You know, you do whatever your wife your your balls are in your wife's purse.

1606
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,280
You know, you're not that.

1607
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,160
Yeah, you're not like a badass undead wizard anymore.

1608
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:30,160
You're just a guy named Mark and Undertaker is like, how dare you call me, Mark?

1609
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,160
I'm going to kick your fucking ass.

1610
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,920
My my legal name is the Undertaker.

1611
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,080
Oh, so they're that's awesome.

1612
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,040
So they're having a Boneyard match.

1613
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,560
They didn't explain what a Boneyard match is prior to that.

1614
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,480
I was wondering. No.

1615
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,360
I think I think they probably would have called it a graveyard match,

1616
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:57,080
but they didn't want to say graveyard like during the pandemic or something.

1617
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,840
So Boneyard is better.

1618
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,440
It wasn't even an actual Boneyard.

1619
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,400
Like I was picturing like the elephant graveyard from the Lion King

1620
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,520
where like in the video game where you platform on top of the like elephant skull.

1621
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:10,240
It wasn't the undertaker will win platform.

1622
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,240
It was just like it was just like a shed and like a shed and a yard

1623
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,600
with a whole dug for a grave.

1624
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,120
But they had they got this match was like so they they basically

1625
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,040
just did the Matt Hardy broken stuff.

1626
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,000
I was just going to say, this sounds just like the Matt Hardy.

1627
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,320
Exactly. They yeah, they had like a camp.

1628
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,600
They filmed it like a little mini movie.

1629
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,200
And it was like the perfect way to accentuate

1630
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:37,400
everything that is still great about the Undertaker while hiding all of his age

1631
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,920
and like his the stuff he can't do anymore.

1632
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:44,840
It goes you can just present him in this movie like a bad ass final boss.

1633
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,240
And he comes out.

1634
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:51,160
So this is so here's the thing about the Undertaker.

1635
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,520
The Undertaker.

1636
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,920
I've already said this in a vlog that I recorded today,

1637
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,760
but I'm going to say it again here.

1638
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,800
The Undertaker has has always had two main skill trees at his disposal.

1639
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,600
He's had the undead wizard skill tree.

1640
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:12,520
And he's also had a mean Texas biker skill tree.

1641
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,080
Those are the two aspects, the yin and yang of the Undertaker.

1642
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,720
But he has never used these two skill trees in tandem.

1643
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,520
It's always been one or the other.

1644
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,480
He's an undead wizard, and then he's a biker,

1645
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,320
and then he's an undead wizard for a few more years.

1646
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,440
And then, you know, back and forth forever.

1647
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,040
This was the first time that he really pulled out all the stops

1648
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,240
and fought at 100 percent full power.

1649
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:38,520
You're utilizing both of his skill trees and one massive power set.

1650
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,480
He was he was an undead wizard, Texas biker taker.

1651
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,000
And the AJ Styles is at the as at the Boneyard.

1652
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,720
They're they're they're doing like a thing

1653
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:53,560
where it's like a so so they a hearse pulls up

1654
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,480
and they pull out like a casket out of the hearse.

1655
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,720
And you're thinking, oh, I bet the Undertaker is going to come out of this casket.

1656
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,720
But no, AJ Styles comes out of the casket.

1657
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,480
And he's like, see, I can come out of a casket, too.

1658
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,360
It ain't even that scary, Undertaker.

1659
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,800
You ain't you ain't bad.

1660
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,760
Anyone can come out of a casket.

1661
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,760
So then.

1662
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,320
Then all of a sudden you hear the the distant rumble

1663
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,120
of the of the fucking motorcycle.

1664
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,520
The Undertaker's hog.

1665
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,920
You hear it in the distance. Oh, fuck.

1666
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,000
Yeah. See, the Undertaker riding his motorcycle

1667
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,760
and all of a sudden Metallica is playing out of nowhere, out of the sky.

1668
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,360
And the Undertaker comes up in his motorcycle

1669
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,880
and he's like he's like a fusion of himself.

1670
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,560
He's like an undead wizard biker.

1671
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:40,400
He's like he's he's so he gets off his motorcycle.

1672
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,000
It's like it's like a chrono trigger when you finally like have mastered elements

1673
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,440
and you start doing dual texts using both elements at the same time.

1674
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,560
Fuck, yeah. Oh, God.

1675
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,240
And they're fucking fighting and they're beating each other up back and forth.

1676
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,000
And at first, AJ Styles is beating up the Undertaker

1677
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,560
and he beats them up really bad.

1678
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,200
And of course, he's got his friends, Gallows and Anderson to help him out.

1679
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,720
So they're they're all teaming up on him and they're beating him up.

1680
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,120
And so he's got the Undertaker like on the ropes.

1681
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,480
He's got him on the metaphorical ropes because they're not in a ring.

1682
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,440
They're in a bow yard.

1683
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,360
He's got the Undertaker is beating him up.

1684
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:16,320
He hits him with it with a with a with a tombstone, like not the tombstone,

1685
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,760
the move, he hits him with a literal tombstone.

1686
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,160
And so like the Undertaker is like dying.

1687
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,280
He's like, oh, God, you're hurting me really bad.

1688
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,360
I am pretty old.

1689
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,800
And AJ Styles like, yeah, old man, you're an old man.

1690
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,480
You've got a wife. Fuck you.

1691
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,480
Coming around here, having a wife and shit.

1692
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,520
What are you gay?

1693
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,400
What are you gay?

1694
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,400
Having a wife.

1695
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:44,720
So he's taunting him as he throws him into the open grave

1696
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:49,040
and he gets into like the bulldozer tractor thing to like pour dirt on the grave.

1697
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,560
And he's like, I'm going to get you, Taker.

1698
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:56,760
But then all of a sudden the Undertaker teleports behind AJ Styles.

1699
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,600
Oh, my God, I'm not in the grave.

1700
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,760
I'm behind you, motherfucker.

1701
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,400
And there's like there's like like John Carpenter lighting like the thing,

1702
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,600
like coming out shining from behind Undertaker.

1703
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,600
So he looks really cinematic and scary.

1704
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,800
And AJ Styles is like, oh, crap.

1705
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,800
I forgot you have magic powers.

1706
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:16,080
And the Undertaker kills AJ, he kills all of his friends.

1707
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,520
He they they climb up to the roof trying to escape him like a zombie movie.

1708
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,720
The roof of this shed.

1709
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,720
And he gets up there and the Undertaker is just like, I'm a biker and a wizard.

1710
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,160
And then he makes fire.

1711
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,400
This is a great fireball.

1712
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,880
He summons meteor and it's like a huge wall of flame.

1713
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,560
He rubs behind AJ Styles.

1714
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,680
And then he he he kills gals and Anderson.

1715
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,480
They're fucking dead.

1716
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,360
Then he beats the shit out of AJ Styles.

1717
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:46,360
And so then he's like, he's like, yeah, how are you like that?

1718
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,600
You're not even cool, boy.

1719
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,720
You talk about my wife.

1720
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:49,640
I'm the Undertaker.

1721
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,560
I'll kill you and shit.

1722
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,960
And like, I fucking hate my wife, dude.

1723
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,280
And like this whole match, they're they're like taunting each other

1724
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,760
and like trash talking each other and like giving these like cinematic

1725
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,600
villain monologues to each other.

1726
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,480
It's so like over the top and like like a grand insane spectacle.

1727
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:12,600
And eventually Undertaker, he he he gets AJ up to the side of the open grave.

1728
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:17,360
And he goes at this point, AJ Styles has been so thoroughly beaten

1729
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,640
that he's begging for his life.

1730
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,680
He's really turned.

1731
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,280
He's really changed his tune.

1732
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,960
You know, before he was like, I fuck you, Taker, you're old and you have a wife,

1733
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,000
like a loser.

1734
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,960
Now now he's like, oh, God, I'm sorry.

1735
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,400
Please don't bury me.

1736
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,080
Don't bury me, Undertaker.

1737
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,840
It's like, oh, it's OK, boy.

1738
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,400
You put up a hell of a fight.

1739
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,360
I ain't gonna bury you ain't nobody giving me a fight like that.

1740
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,920
He's like patting him on the head and stuff.

1741
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,600
I ain't gonna.

1742
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,680
And then he walks away.

1743
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,640
But he turns around and he boots him into the grave anyway.

1744
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:50,600
He's like, I can be a jerk too.

1745
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,760
So then Undertaker buries him.

1746
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,960
He buries him under all this.

1747
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,880
He buries him alive under all this dirt.

1748
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,640
And the last thing you see of AJ Styles is just a grave with like AJ's hand

1749
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,520
like out of the grave, like he's just dead.

1750
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,320
Like his hand is like, it's really cool.

1751
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,880
And then Undertaker is like, well, my work is done.

1752
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,920
And he puts his arm up to like celebrate his victory.

1753
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:18,240
And as he puts his arm up, the house lights on fire behind him

1754
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,120
and his his symbol lights up in a neon light on the house.

1755
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,000
I don't know if he manifested the light with his powers

1756
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,760
or if the light was already there and he turned it on with his powers.

1757
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,880
Either way, it's equally impressive.

1758
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,920
And also Metallica starts playing again on the sky.

1759
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,360
And then he gets back on his hog and rides off into the night.

1760
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,440
And it was the best thing ever.

1761
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,680
I hope they do a million more.

1762
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,920
Every Undertaker match should be like this from now on.

1763
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,200
It was exactly what I want to see.

1764
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,120
Thank you for saving wrestling with your tech.

1765
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:48,880
Literally, yes.

1766
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,000
Thank you for giving, for proving that this kind of thing can work

1767
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,520
because now the Undertaker can be cool again.

1768
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,440
And wrestling can be cool again in this dark time with no crowds.

1769
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:03,120
We can have cool Undertaker matches like this, where he's portrayed

1770
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:08,160
as he should be like an unstoppable badass and not like an old man wheezing in the ring.

1771
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,040
Thank God for that hearty.

1772
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,600
The only thing that would have made that better.

1773
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,560
This would be my director's cut version is as he turns away and says,

1774
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,080
you put up a hell of a fight, boy, I'm not going to bury you.

1775
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:22,760
My wife is flying out of nowhere and fucking he'll drop some of the fucking grave.

1776
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:25,920
That was awesome.

1777
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,520
So that was the first night of WrestleMania.

1778
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,520
And tonight's the second night.

1779
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:33,440
Boy, I can't wait because tonight they're doing the John Cena versus

1780
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:38,720
Bray Wyatt Firefly Fun House match, which I hope is another one of these.

1781
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,000
I really am hope.

1782
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,040
I got my fingers crossed in a real fun movie like this.

1783
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,560
Yes. Yeah.

1784
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,440
So Brent Wyatt's going to love that fun.

1785
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:51,360
He means he's he's he's that's very much his aesthetic to kooky scary clown shit.

1786
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:52,360
Hell, yeah.

1787
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,560
Wrestling is cool.

1788
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,400
Yeah. Wrestling is like like the ultimate form of

1789
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,080
like when you're with your brother in the woods and you both have sticks

1790
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,200
and you're like, there's the swords now and we're going to kill each other.

1791
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,920
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

1792
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,760
I saw the video you posted before the Vanguard one invades the Jericho compound

1793
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,160
and steals his shirt. Oh, God, I love it.

1794
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,400
I love it. I love all this goofy shit.

1795
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,520
I love it.

1796
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,960
Just I love the fucking Chris Jericho is like cutting a promo on Vanguard one

1797
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,480
as as if he is a person like Vanguard one, you son of a bitch.

1798
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,040
I offered you a spot in the inner circle and you declined me.

1799
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,400
Don't you dare decline me again.

1800
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,040
Like he's like, for some reason,

1801
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,400
he's like really invested in getting Vanguard one into his little clique.

1802
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:39,520
And he's proved an invaluable ally to the deletion.

1803
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,080
He's sitting in his hot tub and his palatial estate,

1804
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,560
like cutting a promo on everyone.

1805
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,960
Vanguard one shows up.

1806
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,520
Chris Jericho gets out of the hot tub.

1807
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,440
He's got his pants on and a belt.

1808
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,360
Yeah, he does.

1809
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,640
And it's just like he's having an argument with the drone.

1810
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,680
He like offers him a shirt and I guess Vanguard one says, fuck you again.

1811
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,680
So that's the second time now that Vanguard has declined his offer

1812
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,960
and zooms away like a fucking zoomer.

1813
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,960
And so Chris Jericho is in rage now because that little he goes,

1814
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:10,200
that little bastard stole my shirt.

1815
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:14,080
He released the home missing one shirt right now.

1816
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1817
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,080
He says, release the hounds like Monty Burns and a bunch of dogs,

1818
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,280
like little Chihuahuas and like Pomeranians come out of his house

1819
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,880
and start chasing after this flying drone that they can't possibly catch.

1820
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,080
They have to stand on top of each other.

1821
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,400
Yeah, dogs form a ladder of dogs.

1822
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,280
I hope this pays off in a match between Chris Jericho and Vanguard one

1823
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,400
and Vanguard one.

1824
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,120
Fuck he's feuding more with Vanguard one than he is with Matt Hardy.

1825
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,880
I hope so. I hope to see it.

1826
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,200
Maybe we'll get his own drone and they could do aerial combat.

1827
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,320
The Geradrone 5000.

1828
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,640
Oh, yeah, that's good. That's good.

1829
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,480
Hey, slight other note.

1830
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,360
Hey, I got my lecture out.

1831
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,320
People seem to like it.

1832
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,000
It was, in fact, one piece.

1833
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,360
Oh, now you know, what a shocker.

1834
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,400
You know, it delighted me to see that some people were in fact surprised

1835
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,640
to see it and you would see you would see things like, wow, in retrospect,

1836
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,000
this was obvious, but I didn't see it coming.

1837
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,280
And the other slightly concerning thing is I'm seeing people saying like,

1838
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:28,280
wait, I thought Radcon was over or there are more lectures.

1839
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,360
These people are not aware of what's going on with Radcon.

1840
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:35,840
And people never aware that videos have to be made before they can be released.

1841
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,480
Yes, they take time and energy to produce not everything that was done

1842
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,960
is immediately posted while the event is going on.

1843
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,880
When I saw when I post, I saw one comment that was like,

1844
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,040
whoa, aren't you guys social distancing?

1845
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,240
What do you do and all in one guy? Bro, bro, it's been it's been weeks.

1846
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,360
Yeah, people are silly.

1847
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,480
People are foolish.

1848
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,440
Anyway, the lecture was cool.

1849
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:59,520
And looking back on it, now that it's out, it's interesting to note

1850
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:04,680
because exactly how many kind of gigantic plot points I did miss,

1851
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,800
not even on purpose, but just in my haste to get through the whole story

1852
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,800
in a paltry five hours.

1853
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,920
And again, thank you guys for participating.

1854
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,520
It was a great time, but because of the social distancing thing,

1855
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:23,520
like when we went there, this did not seem like that immediately big of a deal.

1856
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,080
While we were there, it changed the way it changed while we were there.

1857
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,760
And we were kind of like I had to drive home like through it,

1858
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,320
like through this ruined apocalypse of a world.

1859
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,400
And also during this long drive home, I didn't have a debit card

1860
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,960
because also while I was there, I logged onto my bank and found out

1861
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,360
that someone had stolen my card information and made like a thousand

1862
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,280
dollars of charges that I had to like I had to go to dispute

1863
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,240
and I had to like get my card on hold.

1864
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:58,440
So I had like a hundred dollars in cash to drive all the way home with.

1865
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,200
And in the middle of this pandemic, like this actual end of the world

1866
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:08,400
and like I ended up like totally fucked like out of out of oil out of gas

1867
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:13,240
and like in like a random gas station in like Pennsylvania

1868
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,680
with with like one hotel next to it.

1869
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,560
And like I tried to go to the hotel and they were like, oh, you need a card.

1870
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,400
You can't pay for a room with cash.

1871
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,960
So like I was like totally fucked.

1872
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,160
There was like an ATM.

1873
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,680
But to use the ATM, I needed to get like the bank app

1874
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:29,560
so that I could use it without my card and the app didn't work.

1875
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,800
And the app sent me to a website.

1876
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,360
The website sent me back to an app.

1877
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,680
None of it worked. It was all.

1878
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,000
So I stood there for an hour, like gradually getting matter

1879
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,760
and like losing my mind in despair, like just stranded in the middle

1880
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,480
of Pennsylvania, in the middle of a pandemic with no money to my name at all.

1881
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,280
It was not good.

1882
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,920
So that's my story of my journey home.

1883
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,560
That's fucked. I assume you lived.

1884
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,200
Yes, I eventually I managed to make it somehow.

1885
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,640
I don't remember how exactly, but yeah.

1886
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,520
I actually. Well, shit.

1887
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,520
I had to. So I mean, did I was curious, did the whole countryside

1888
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,640
like was it different from looking?

1889
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,800
It was burning. Well.

1890
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,720
It wasn't that much of a difference other than like everyone was weird

1891
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,840
about taking my cash, which pissed me off.

1892
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,720
Yeah, yeah.

1893
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:15,080
Nobody wanted to touch like the the gas station clerks would like leave the cash

1894
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,640
the change on the counter and like get away from you like cowards.

1895
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,000
There was one like that's even going to do anything.

1896
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,960
There was one courageous young woman at a Dunkin Donuts drive-through

1897
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:30,160
who handed me my change and actually made the hand fingers contact.

1898
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,240
And I just thought you are a brave and pure heart.

1899
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,880
I love you.

1900
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,960
You're the only good person in this whole ruined world.

1901
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,640
I hope that you survive and no one else does because you had the courage

1902
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,440
to touch my hand.

1903
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:49,440
But the biggest actual difference I've experienced is that at drive-throughs,

1904
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,200
people are now wearing gloves.

1905
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,920
For me, that has been the biggest difference in my life.

1906
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,880
And it just makes me think like, wait a minute,

1907
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,280
shouldn't the fast food preparers always have been wearing gloves?

1908
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,400
Why did it take this to get my food handlers wearing gloves?

1909
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,920
Only the person working the drive-through wouldn't wear gloves

1910
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,640
because they're touching the outside of the bag, which I guess is fine.

1911
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,920
I don't know. I don't know. The fair point.

1912
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:17,200
The only difference I've noticed is that I look up in the sky

1913
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,800
and it's really quiet and there's no airplane trails and it's really nice.

1914
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,800
And you know what? I kind of like that.

1915
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:28,080
You know, there's still too many people out and about for my taste.

1916
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,200
I still when I'm out, I still feel crowded.

1917
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,840
Like there needs to be a worse pandemic.

1918
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,040
Like no pandemic is big enough for me.

1919
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:39,280
I won't be satisfied until everyone is gone and dead or hiding.

1920
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,720
Like I had to go to Walmart to get something.

1921
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,680
I don't even remember what, like supplies, like tea or some shit.

1922
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,440
But just like, you know, like early in the morning at like 8 a.m.

1923
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:54,440
and it was just packed with baby boomers with these carts full of shit,

1924
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,160
like toppling over the sides in my way.

1925
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,120
Every aisle I tried to go down, it's like,

1926
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:04,320
isn't I would assume that like the places should be empty.

1927
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,320
You'd think like end of the world, everyone is hiding.

1928
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,200
That means I'll have room finally to move around.

1929
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,960
But no, it's like more packed out there than ever

1930
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,360
because of these fucking boomers.

1931
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,680
Yeah, I was really with their chains,

1932
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,560
their chains of 10 carts tethered together by rope,

1933
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,960
taking up entire aisles of Walmart.

1934
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:26,400
Yeah, I was really pissed off like on the flight home

1935
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,640
because my flight was canceled and I had to rebook

1936
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,160
and they made it easy through the app.

1937
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,160
I was like, OK, there's another flight same day a little bit earlier.

1938
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:40,400
And I was thinking like, oh, like they're cancelling a lot of flights.

1939
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:44,080
Maybe this means that like people are cancelling their flights

1940
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,960
and like they're not going to fly anymore.

1941
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,920
They're not going to go on holiday today.

1942
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,600
But of course, what it actually meant was my flight that I was rebooked on

1943
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,440
was completely packed and there were multiple people sneezing

1944
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,280
and lots of people with hand gel and everyone was scared.

1945
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,560
And I was like, God, this is going to be like fucking six, seven hours.

1946
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,680
And I was in the window and I was stuck up against the window

1947
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:08,520
and I had to like these two, this couple next to me.

1948
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,760
Well, like every time anything was touched,

1949
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,160
they would get out the bottle of hand sanitizer

1950
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:16,400
and they would squeeze it all over their hands and it's like, God,

1951
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:20,400
they probably think I'm the worst because I'm not wearing gloves or a face mask

1952
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,240
and I'm not, I don't have that shit because I wasn't prepared.

1953
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,120
And I went to yesterday.

1954
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:28,800
I went to like the little convenience store nearby just to get some stuff.

1955
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,560
It was hilarious.

1956
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:33,720
So I live in the ghetto and it was full of of urban individuals

1957
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:37,040
just going about their day and it was fucking sick.

1958
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,840
But I'm walking in there with like gloves and face mask.

1959
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,320
And like the first thing happens is that the guy just like comes up to me

1960
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,960
as you know, as often happens here and the guy's like, Hey, man, you got some change

1961
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:50,280
and you're like reaches out to shake my hand and I I'm wearing a mask and gloves

1962
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:54,360
and I just recoil and I'm like, is this is what it feels like

1963
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,080
to be truly an upper class hero?

1964
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,560
I don't want to touch these lower class scum.

1965
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,520
This let's avoid contact.

1966
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,520
And I was thinking like, should I stand here and explain?

1967
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:05,880
No, no, no, you don't understand.

1968
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,280
It's just social distancing.

1969
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,320
I got out and I was like, fuck it.

1970
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,240
I just walked on.

1971
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,720
Was I a part of the problem that day?

1972
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,000
Did I look like a bad guy?

1973
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,720
Probably.

1974
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,360
Pardon me.

1975
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:19,480
I mean, you had the whole thing up like they could probably assume the signs

1976
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,080
were crystal clear.

1977
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:24,920
He reached out like for a handshake and I like he was like reaching out to me.

1978
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,920
I like jumped back and recoiled.

1979
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,920
Like I don't even I'm not even really that scared or even worried.

1980
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:30,760
It would have been less scary.

1981
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:33,640
I had the mode for a gun.

1982
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:36,720
And then it would have been embarrassing that I recoiled.

1983
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,280
He's actually like a really nice guy and I've seen him around before.

1984
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,600
He very politely asked, but just like the reach out just happened to be

1985
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,120
the exact thing I'm trying to avoid with all this shit on my face.

1986
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,120
So I had a very visceral reaction in the moment.

1987
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:52,440
You know, the homeless around me are very nice.

1988
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,360
I like them.

1989
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,400
They never bother me.

1990
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,800
They just ask for food or money.

1991
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,360
And I always say, no, and it's great.

1992
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,360
We all go about our day.

1993
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:01,400
I just I just hate the ones that ask for money and you give it to them

1994
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,760
and they ask for more money.

1995
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,760
Yeah, it's just like, yeah.

1996
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,800
That's why I just don't do it.

1997
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:07,880
I never give my to anybody.

1998
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,120
It ruins it for everyone because it makes me not trust anybody

1999
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:13,240
and not want to give any homeless person money.

2000
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,640
Although, you know, I was thinking really wasn't for the sickness.

2001
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,880
I bought like some snacks or whatever if it wasn't for the corona

2002
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,160
and I was just trying to get out of there.

2003
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:24,040
I probably would have given that guy like some of my snacks

2004
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,760
if I've been thinking clearly, but I was in the rush to

2005
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,160
oh, I had my like live stream or whatever.

2006
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:32,360
So I was I was rushing callous guy all absorbed in his daily business.

2007
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,440
Tough being a two bird.

2008
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,560
It's tough. It's tough.

2009
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,480
I got a schedule to keep.

2010
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,600
I got my titty stream is coming up in five minutes.

2011
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,480
I got a plump and thickened.

2012
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,680
You know, before I go live, the one good thing that happened

2013
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,040
on my on my drive home through the the fucking this plague world

2014
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:51,320
is that like I was going through like some random

2015
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,920
mountain town and like the like in like bumpfuck Pennsylvania somewhere.

2016
01:39:56,600 --> 01:40:00,520
And like there was this I was hungry and I just happened to pass

2017
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:04,240
like in the middle of nowhere, this like country dining establishment.

2018
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:07,640
And I'm like food and I pulled in there and it's like this beautiful

2019
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:12,080
like serene looking log cabin establishment sitting on a hill

2020
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,640
overlooking this quiet little Twin Peaks mountain town.

2021
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,840
There's like woods in the distance and like fog rolling over the hills and stuff.

2022
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,840
And I'm like, oh my God, I've like stepped into the real America here for a second.

2023
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,240
And like I walked into this restaurant

2024
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,520
and like the dining was all the lights were off and it was, you know,

2025
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,040
no one could sit down and eat.

2026
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:32,920
But like walking into this like folksy little diner

2027
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:36,760
and like giving the girl my order and sitting down to wait for it.

2028
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,760
And like the the owner of the place was sitting there, who was like an older lady.

2029
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,080
She started like talking to me and asked me questions like, oh, where are you going?

2030
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,880
And I'm totally like, oh, I was down here for a work thing and I'm driving home

2031
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,480
and I'm stuck in this and that we were like bonded a little bit.

2032
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,080
And it was like I was talking to like Stephen King characters.

2033
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,440
Like I just walked into this folksy like little slice of Americana.

2034
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:00,080
And like I walked out like, oh, my goodness, this may maybe it's

2035
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,800
maybe it's a good thing that everyone's dying.

2036
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,560
Yes, it definitely is.

2037
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:06,840
And so I got in my car and I took out my little burger.

2038
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,480
And it was like the best burger I've ever had, too.

2039
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,920
It was like it was like a oddly good.

2040
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,320
Like I think I stepped into like the Twilight Zone or something.

2041
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,560
They just first like, yeah, but it was like it was like one of the

2042
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,680
like the uplifting Twilight Zones, not one of the scary ones.

2043
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:20,800
Right. Right.

2044
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,640
It's like death doesn't come like a thunderbolt.

2045
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,400
It comes like a whistle.

2046
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,920
Yes, it's like like the one where the guy dies and his dog is there

2047
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,480
and he goes and the guy says, welcome to heaven.

2048
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,600
Oh, we don't allow dogs.

2049
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,880
And he's like, well, then I don't want to go.

2050
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,520
And then he meets God and is like, oh, that wasn't heaven.

2051
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,640
That was hell. They were trying to trick you.

2052
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,720
And he's like, well, I knew because my dog didn't want to go in.

2053
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,760
Based, so fucking based.

2054
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,320
Yeah, that's what it was like.

2055
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,560
It was that episode with the dog.

2056
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,680
That was Muslim heaven where they don't allow dogs.

2057
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:47,680
They're they're no fans.

2058
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,040
They're no fans from what I hear.

2059
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,960
Hey, did you guys see punk has an only fans account now?

2060
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,480
Oh, God, I didn't want to think about it.

2061
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,920
But here it is thrust in front of my face.

2062
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,800
I've been trying to.

2063
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,600
That's my daughter.

2064
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,440
That's my niece.

2065
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,480
And now she's being a hoard out on the Internet.

2066
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,800
It was her idea like a common thought.

2067
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:12,120
I don't acknowledge her autonomy as a human being

2068
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:15,160
or a pumpkin being to make these decisions for herself.

2069
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:18,640
I mean, women, you know, you don't have a right that I actually got a few

2070
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:22,760
people's sub for a month, which is the most epic thing of all time.

2071
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,800
No, I am.

2072
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,040
I probably did it out of curiosity

2073
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,400
and also they would have given me money anyway, but it was very cool of them.

2074
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:35,080
I feel like I need to like make a follow up image.

2075
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,320
Yeah, at least one.

2076
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,480
Give the people got to do something for.

2077
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:45,520
Hey, man, I mean, maybe this will turn out to be the right decision all along.

2078
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,240
And this is the avenue we should all be going.

2079
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,000
It's it's, you know, make money is the most important.

2080
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,960
It's good enough for Idubs.

2081
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,920
It's good enough for me.

2082
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:56,800
Yeah, I mean, the whole Idubs thing is not important.

2083
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,840
The fact is people were talking about it and I capitalized on it like a capitalist hero.

2084
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,480
Smart.

2085
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,480
Yeah.

2086
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,480
Well, that's life.

2087
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,280
Hell, yeah.

2088
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,600
As the Joker would say,

2089
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,400
truly, this is a clown world we live in.

2090
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,520
Well, we got voicemails.

2091
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,240
You want to go to them?

2092
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:18,760
Yeah, I'm good.

2093
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,000
I said my piece.

2094
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,480
All right, that's all the talking that I knew how to do.

2095
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,160
OK, here we go.

2096
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,600
We've got voicemails.

2097
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,560
Speakpipalink is in the description.

2098
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,640
You can leave voicemails, blah, blah, blah, you know the drill.

2099
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:32,840
All right, let's see.

2100
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:34,840
We got our first one is OK.

2101
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:36,600
Hang on my fucking mouse.

2102
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,400
PC police are back.

2103
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,920
OK, it's one's kind of hard to hear, but do your best and listen.

2104
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,160
And we will have a journey.

2105
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,800
OK, here we go.

2106
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,240
We have won.

2107
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:49,960
You thought we had given up.

2108
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:54,000
You thought you had bested us, but you, you were wrong.

2109
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,760
We started with the lowly Asian PCP fans, the Chinese.

2110
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:04,000
And now our virus is said to have all the PCP fans worldwide.

2111
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:04,800
Oh, no.

2112
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,280
The only downside is the world leaders.

2113
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,520
Those big wigs and fat cats fumbled the name because we called it

2114
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,000
called coronavirus or whatever.

2115
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,600
Oh, 19 close enough.

2116
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:23,960
Now, PCP members crumble in fear as we the PC police.

2117
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:26,200
The PC.

2118
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,080
Wait, what's what's going on?

2119
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:30,880
What's going on?

2120
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:35,200
Sorry, sir, we were just attacked by a clustered character

2121
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,000
dressed in a pizza onesie.

2122
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,960
And we dropped a new, improved vial of the coronavirus.

2123
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,280
Our base is now infected.

2124
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,280
What's shatsky?

2125
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,400
Where is he?

2126
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,440
He's currently giving us demands.

2127
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,600
Demands.

2128
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,600
What are you talking about?

2129
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,440
He wants to steal your dad.

2130
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:59,440
No, no, anything from Papa Garland House.

2131
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:04,440
Joining us now, Brad Merlinghouse is the CEO of the cryptocurrency developer

2132
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,440
Ripple Ripples.

2133
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,440
What is that?

2134
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:09,440
Oh, no.

2135
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,440
Do not fuck with me.

2136
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,440
Oh, no.

2137
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:23,440
Dude, so the coronavirus was made to get us or rather the PCP fans.

2138
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,440
Correct.

2139
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:28,440
You know, that works because like we are the reason people are dying after all.

2140
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,440
Oh, you know, it's true.

2141
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:35,440
The idea of this virus being somehow linked to cold corona is like,

2142
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:38,440
because it's such an obvious joke, everyone's making it,

2143
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,440
but everyone's making slightly different versions of the joke.

2144
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,440
So the lore is like so convoluted.

2145
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:44,440
No one really knows for sure.

2146
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:47,440
Like if he's responsible for it or just a victim of it like everyone else,

2147
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,440
you can't say for certain, even I can't.

2148
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:51,440
Even he can.

2149
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,440
What an enigma.

2150
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:53,440
Especially he can't.

2151
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,440
Let's see what we got next.

2152
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,440
Okay, here we go.

2153
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:01,440
Three is not a creative number.

2154
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,440
Let's hear it.

2155
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,440
Oh, well, this is culture death.

2156
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:09,440
I mean, three people on the last episode.

2157
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,440
Seriously.

2158
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:11,440
Oh.

2159
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:15,440
Well, if no one else is saying it, then I guess I will.

2160
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:21,440
Every member not in this week's episode listening to this voicemail as it is being played right now.

2161
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:23,440
Okay.

2162
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,440
You will never let this down.

2163
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,440
Yeah.

2164
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,440
You are a member of the PCP.

2165
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:31,440
Fucking act like it.

2166
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,440
Damn.

2167
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:33,440
Harsh words.

2168
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:38,440
Don't these people also complain when there's like too many people on the show?

2169
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:39,440
Yeah.

2170
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,440
There's no way.

2171
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,440
That's less of a problem these days.

2172
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,440
There's different camps.

2173
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,440
You know, you can't please everybody.

2174
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,440
All right, fuck it.

2175
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,440
Let's just go straight on to the next one.

2176
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,440
Although fuck everyone who isn't on the PCP.

2177
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,440
It's a delight to be here with my friends.

2178
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,440
I savor the opportunity.

2179
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,440
All right.

2180
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,440
Special shout out to my boy Ben St.

2181
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:03,440
I love that guy.

2182
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,440
I'm just like the fuck that guy.

2183
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:09,440
The resignation of just like admitting like that's not much of a problem these days.

2184
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,440
Yeah.

2185
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,440
Yeah, it's true.

2186
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:16,440
All right, let's check out Nyan Kwan who is leaving us a message.

2187
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:17,440
Okay, sounds good.

2188
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,440
Take it away, Nyan.

2189
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,440
Hey, everypony.

2190
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,440
It's Pinkie Pie here.

2191
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:25,440
Just wanted to say hi to my favorite ponies around.

2192
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,440
Of course you crew.

2193
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,440
I'm so proud of how much you've grown and how for you progress in your careers.

2194
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,440
Everyone has achieved so much and I'm so happy.

2195
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,440
I just know that you're all going to do great things.

2196
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:38,440
Can't wait to see what's in store for the PCP.

2197
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:40,440
I love you guys.

2198
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,440
Roadies forever.

2199
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:45,440
That was a really good voice.

2200
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,440
That was really Pinkie Pie.

2201
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,440
That was too real.

2202
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,440
That was real Pinkie Pie in real life.

2203
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:54,440
I actually really like that.

2204
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:59,440
Well, I think what it was, there was a thing that was going around Pony Twitter for a while

2205
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,440
because I still follow people into the show.

2206
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:05,440
There was some AI thing where you can feed in voice information.

2207
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,440
That was really high quality.

2208
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,440
Whatever you wanted to say.

2209
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,440
I mean, some of the Twilight ones I've heard were pretty accurate.

2210
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:20,440
The Fluttershy ones they were doing have Fluttershy's soft pronunciation for things.

2211
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,440
So it was pretty good.

2212
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:23,440
That was so nice.

2213
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:26,440
I was waiting for the other shoot-a-drop and for it to be a mean look.

2214
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,440
Yeah, I was waiting for the other shoot-a-drop.

2215
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:30,440
Thank you Pinkie Pie.

2216
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:32,440
The shoot-a-drop is now that Pinkie Pie said such nice things.

2217
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,440
I have to take a hard look at myself.

2218
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:35,440
Am I worthy of such words?

2219
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,440
No, I don't deserve it.

2220
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,440
Yes we are.

2221
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:40,440
I feel bad.

2222
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:43,440
Well at least somebody appreciates all that we do for this world.

2223
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,440
Pinkie Pie.

2224
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,440
She would.

2225
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:47,440
She would.

2226
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,440
As long as I have Pinkie Pie's respect.

2227
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:53,440
As long as the main six always appreciate love and respect us,

2228
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:56,440
then there can be no nothing bad.

2229
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,440
We're on the straight and narrow.

2230
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:01,440
New bad main six good.

2231
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,440
Pinkie Pie good.

2232
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,440
That's hitting me a little harder than I expected it to.

2233
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,440
And I already listened to it as I was preparing them.

2234
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,440
It's making me a little emotional.

2235
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,440
The thing that Pinkie Pie would be proud of me.

2236
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:14,440
Oh Jesus Christ.

2237
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:16,440
Alright, let's move on.

2238
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:19,440
I could never truly pray all that gay away.

2239
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,440
I wish.

2240
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,440
I wish.

2241
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,440
Alright, let's check out-

2242
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,440
Which you can pay the gay away at Patreon.com.

2243
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:26,440
Patreon.com.

2244
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,440
D-Pro guys.

2245
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:30,440
What are we called now?

2246
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:31,440
No one knows.

2247
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,440
This is from-

2248
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,440
This is simply called Nate's Soundboard.

2249
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,440
Recommended audio.

2250
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,440
Turn your audio way up everyone.

2251
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,440
I'm not going to want to miss a second of this.

2252
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:40,440
Let's check it out.

2253
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:41,440
Go.

2254
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,440
Turn it down.

2255
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,440
Bruh.

2256
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,440
These nuts.

2257
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:47,440
Bazinga.

2258
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,440
Be gone.

2259
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,440
Good.

2260
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,440
Good.

2261
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,440
I'm gay.

2262
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,440
Yes.

2263
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,440
Oh, that's Robin Stinger from One Piece.

2264
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,440
That's a great one.

2265
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,440
That's a great one.

2266
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,440
It's the Nate nodding at every sound effect.

2267
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,440
Yep.

2268
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:11,440
Yeah, yeah.

2269
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,440
The other promise.

2270
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,440
Roxas theme.

2271
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,440
You make a good other.

2272
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,440
Too long.

2273
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:23,440
Bazinga.

2274
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:24,440
Yeah!

2275
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,440
That's a good one.

2276
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:28,440
I just wanted to let you guys can't hear it.

2277
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:31,440
You know, I since added Bazinga to my soundboard

2278
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:35,440
and I'm currently mashing it every half a fucking second.

2279
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,440
I'm mashing it so fucking fast.

2280
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,440
And a couple of farts with reverbs.

2281
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:40,440
Super crazy.

2282
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,440
None of this is going to come onto the podcast unfortunately.

2283
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,440
But I really loved that moment I was experiencing right now.

2284
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:47,440
It was great.

2285
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,440
You're like a baby with like a sound box.

2286
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,440
Like a little plastic sound.

2287
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:52,440
Like the cow goes moo.

2288
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,440
Yeah, cow goes moo.

2289
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:57,440
The Sheldon goes Bazinga.

2290
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,440
I was, you know what it's like?

2291
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,440
I was saying before it's like having a, being a transhumanist.

2292
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:06,440
I've attached these soundboards to me.

2293
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:08,440
I now have additional functions as a human being.

2294
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:10,440
But really it's more like augmented reality.

2295
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:14,440
Because I'm wearing the goggles as I'm listening to my computer.

2296
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:15,440
But none of you guys are.

2297
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:18,440
So like I'm seeing things that are not there.

2298
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:19,440
Kind of.

2299
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,440
Okay, anyway.

2300
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:21,440
My soundboard is sick.

2301
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:24,440
And I took that as a bunch of suggestions to put on the soundboard.

2302
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,440
And there's some good ones in there.

2303
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,440
Smoke weed every day.

2304
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,440
Not a bad idea.

2305
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,440
All right.

2306
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,440
All right.

2307
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:31,440
Next one.

2308
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,440
Here we go.

2309
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:34,440
This is from unga bunga lecture heads.

2310
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,440
Okay.

2311
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,440
And go.

2312
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:42,440
Hey, I have like a basic ask question for names.

2313
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:44,440
The one piece lecture.

2314
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:45,440
Really great.

2315
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,440
I fucking loved it.

2316
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,440
Nice.

2317
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:52,440
I just feel people are kind of getting the wrong message from it.

2318
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:55,440
And I just want to know whether you agree or not.

2319
01:51:55,440 --> 01:52:00,440
I see a lot of people who are kind of like, oh, thanks for this.

2320
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:03,440
I'm just going to skip everything.

2321
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,440
Oh, I'm totally caught up on one piece now.

2322
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:09,440
Better start on chapter 900 and whatever we're on.

2323
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:10,440
76.

2324
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:15,440
I feel like that's like the wrong interpretation of the lecture.

2325
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,440
Right.

2326
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:20,440
Like your whole point was telling them to go read it.

2327
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:25,440
But then these people are just kind of thinking that they get to skip everything now.

2328
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:26,440
I don't know.

2329
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,440
Let me know.

2330
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:32,440
Well, I can't imagine starting something not at the beginning.

2331
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:34,440
So this whole concept is.

2332
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,440
Right.

2333
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,440
Of course.

2334
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:37,440
It would be, it would be insane.

2335
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,440
Kind of.

2336
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:44,440
I mean, because as, as Sean here says at the very beginning, like, um, like I clarify,

2337
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:47,440
read one piece and continually throughout it, I'm like, read one piece.

2338
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,440
I have to skip so many details.

2339
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:54,440
So if you just want your opinion, your thought confirmed, then yeah, certainly I agree.

2340
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:56,440
That's the correct way to do it.

2341
01:52:56,440 --> 01:53:03,440
And, uh, I would net, like, even if, well, I mean, the lecture covers like the big plot

2342
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:08,440
elements of like Ponyglyphs and the Grand Line and like what is the King of Pirates

2343
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:09,440
and like the Willa Dee and shit.

2344
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:12,440
Like, not even in that much detail, but you're touching all of those.

2345
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:17,440
But like one piece is, I mean, maybe I should have emphasized this even more, but I did say

2346
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,440
it in there.

2347
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:20,440
It's about the journey, not the destination really.

2348
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:24,440
And Luffy made that very explicit at various points in the story.

2349
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,440
So yeah, just got to experience it.

2350
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:29,440
This, this sentiment, if it's being expressed in the comments is like the equivalent of

2351
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,440
saying, oh, I read a Wikipedia article.

2352
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,440
I don't have to watch a movie that the article was about.

2353
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,440
It's like, it's not even close to the same experience.

2354
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:40,440
It's like the equivalent of watching like my Gurren Lagann videos and saying, you're right,

2355
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:43,440
Nate, you can just turn your brain off and enjoy Gurren Lagann.

2356
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:47,440
That there is nothing beyond what was initially stated as in just the opposite of the intent.

2357
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:56,440
Do you think this is like people like wanting to be up and like, you know, understanding

2358
01:53:56,440 --> 01:54:00,440
the relevant stuff without having to spend any of the time to get into all of this stuff?

2359
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,440
Absolutely.

2360
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,440
They don't want to commit cowards.

2361
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:04,440
It's paradoxical.

2362
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,440
People don't want to be left out of the conversation.

2363
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:10,440
But you won't get anything in the conversation if you don't actually care about the thing

2364
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:11,440
that's being discussed.

2365
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:12,440
Yeah.

2366
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:13,440
Yeah.

2367
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:16,440
You can't properly care about it unless you go along the actual journey.

2368
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:21,440
Also, where are they that they're just surrounded by one piece conversation that they have to

2369
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,440
cram for immediately right now?

2370
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:27,440
This is, I mean, the world has changed for me so much.

2371
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:32,440
And like, this is why like, given I made the potty cast when I was young, I was the like

2372
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,440
the only one I knew who gave a shit.

2373
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,440
I mean, I wasn't that internet savvy back then.

2374
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:40,440
So I was just sitting alone, like reading one piece, looking around and hoping for someone

2375
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,440
to care and no one did.

2376
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:47,440
And then like 15 years past, and now like we have a podcast that has like assembled

2377
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:51,440
dedicated viewers, people who follow week to week and like give a shit about it in a

2378
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,440
pretty thoughtful way and pretty detailed way anyway.

2379
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:58,440
And like now, now, and like, I don't know, not, you know, whatever, my feelings aside

2380
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,440
don't matter.

2381
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,440
But guys like Jeff are like doing like catch up things.

2382
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:05,440
And I wonder about the exact motivations.

2383
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:10,440
Maybe it's just because they want to be part of the conversation, or maybe it's because

2384
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:14,440
they feel left out, or maybe it's because they're out of material and one piece is getting

2385
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,440
pretty popular right now.

2386
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,440
I don't know.

2387
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,440
I mean, any of those are fine.

2388
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:23,440
I don't blame them as businessmen, but it's, I don't know, it's just, it's such a weird

2389
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:29,440
thing to see like that side of the story when for me, it's just been such like a personal

2390
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:33,440
thing for a long time, a long time, whatever, I don't begrudge him.

2391
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:34,440
It's just, it's interesting.

2392
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:37,440
And yes, I'm a better fan than you and always will be.

2393
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,440
I win.

2394
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:39,440
You lose.

2395
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,440
That's the end of the conversation.

2396
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,440
Fuck.

2397
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,440
Yeah.

2398
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,440
Old thing.

2399
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,440
Good.

2400
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:48,440
In that case, my fandom of the series, your new thing is your fandom bad.

2401
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:49,440
Yeah.

2402
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,440
You go into it now.

2403
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:51,440
Die.

2404
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,440
God, I love being a gatekeeper.

2405
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,440
It feels so good.

2406
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:55,440
All right.

2407
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,440
We got one final voicemail.

2408
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,440
This is from, let me see.

2409
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:00,440
Battery man.

2410
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:01,440
Yeah.

2411
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,440
Battery man.

2412
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:03,440
Okay.

2413
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:04,440
Take it away.

2414
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:05,440
Go.

2415
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:08,440
Remember when you could jack off the space jam and nobody thought you were a perfect?

2416
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:09,440
Yes.

2417
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:13,440
The only reason people don't want to have Judy Hobbs is because of worries have created

2418
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,440
a stigma.

2419
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:15,440
Oh my God.

2420
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:16,440
Thank God for saying this.

2421
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:19,440
Being attracted to cartoon animal people is completely natural human sexuality.

2422
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:24,440
It was quite normal before all this shit happened.

2423
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,440
Fuck furries.

2424
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:26,440
There you go.

2425
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:27,440
Fuck furries.

2426
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:31,440
I've been saying that exact thing for years now.

2427
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:36,440
I feel like this guy is like, I should sue this guy first.

2428
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:40,440
But I won't because I appreciate him also saying it.

2429
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:41,440
Yeah.

2430
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,440
Yeah.

2431
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:44,440
He's saying what we're all thinking, I think.

2432
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:49,840
Lola Bunny was so unequivocally hot and everyone wanted to have sex with her that it should

2433
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,440
not be any kind of weird thing to feel.

2434
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:55,040
There wasn't even entertained the thought that it might be a weird thing because these

2435
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:59,560
weird people did not exist yet to taint and pervert it.

2436
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:04,720
My father would stride around Walmart proudly wearing his shirt of Bugs Bunny spanking Lola's

2437
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:09,960
red and ass and it was not frowned upon, but now he wears it simply the time has passed

2438
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:12,840
and Zootopia is out and now he's getting looks.

2439
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,800
Don't do this to my father, furries.

2440
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,480
Let him live his life.

2441
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:17,480
Yeah.

2442
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:18,480
It's a travesty.

2443
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:26,040
It's one of those terrible things where people associate, people assume you're way in more

2444
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:29,320
in than you are.

2445
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:30,320
The whole brony thing.

2446
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:37,560
I like the ponies, they're cute and all that and because the label brony has been during

2447
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:42,520
that time, it was a big deal if you were coming out as a brony and everyone would hate you

2448
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:47,440
or love you and it was just like it needn't be like this.

2449
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,320
It's just a cartoon, it's cool.

2450
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:51,120
It's why we can't have nice things.

2451
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:55,960
Everything good and pure is inevitably co-opted by freaks.

2452
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:00,720
It's just that poisonous binary thinking that everything breaks down to online and it's

2453
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:04,120
just so reductive and it's disappointing.

2454
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:05,120
Yep.

2455
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:06,120
Yep.

2456
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,720
Oh shit, I was going to say something about that.

2457
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:11,040
Yeah, I want to fuck Lola Bunny is what you were going to say.

2458
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,640
We all want to fuck Lola Bunny.

2459
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:14,640
We're all in agreement, everyone in the world.

2460
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:17,560
Secretly, you don't say it out loud, you're all, we all know.

2461
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:23,480
She was specifically designed to make you want to fuck Lola Bunny, animated and drawn.

2462
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:26,800
That's when he got a boner on screen and I was like, same.

2463
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:27,800
Same.

2464
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:33,680
It is not weird to be attracted to what are obviously humanoid characteristics applied

2465
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:38,040
to characters who have some non-humanoid characteristics.

2466
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:43,040
That's why I'll proudly jack off to any quality porn of, I don't know, if it's furry who gives

2467
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:47,080
a shit, if it's fucking Judy Hopps who gives a shit, if it's fucking My Little Pony who

2468
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:48,080
gives a shit.

2469
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,960
If there's human-like qualities, yeah, fuck it man.

2470
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:56,680
I'm not a furry, never been, not interested, but if there are just human qualities that

2471
01:58:56,680 --> 01:59:01,160
are sexy, I will achieve boner status and it will be awesome.

2472
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:10,760
If I see a tree outside that vaguely resembles the feminine form, I will assume it's flesh.

2473
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:13,320
That is consent, that tree has consented.

2474
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:20,800
You ever see the images of vegetables that have tits, a carrot that looks like a penis

2475
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:21,800
or something?

2476
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:22,800
Those funny things.

2477
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:27,520
Have you seen the image that's been posted around during this corona thing, during the

2478
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:32,000
whatever, being blocked inside of two lights on the ceiling and the way the shadows are

2479
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,200
being cast kind of look like tits and the guy's like, yo, the ceiling about to make me act

2480
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,200
up?

2481
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:38,200
And same.

2482
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:39,200
Same, brother.

2483
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:45,800
Have you guys ever heard that old joke about Tarzan fucking Jane?

2484
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:47,800
Don't know.

2485
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:48,800
No.

2486
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:59,200
Jane wants to fuck Tarzan and she says, you know, put it in here Tarzan, have you ever

2487
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:00,640
done this before?

2488
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:05,160
And Tarzan goes, no, me use hole in tree.

2489
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:09,600
And she goes, well, okay, this is a bit better than that.

2490
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:14,520
It's, you know, she shows him where to put it and then Tarzan kicks her in the crotch

2491
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,320
as hard as he can.

2492
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:20,400
And she goes, oh, oh my God, Tarzan, why did you do that?

2493
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:23,320
And he goes, checking for termites.

2494
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:24,320
I remember that.

2495
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:27,320
I remember that one.

2496
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:30,600
Oh, that is classic.

2497
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:33,320
That was a deleted scene in the Disney film.

2498
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:34,320
Indeed.

2499
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:37,240
God, Jane was so fucking hot in Tarzan.

2500
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:39,160
Jesus Christ.

2501
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:40,160
Everything good.

2502
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:44,320
You know, the voice actor played her, played the like the girlfriend in Goodwill Hunting

2503
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,320
that like British lady.

2504
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,320
I didn't know.

2505
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:47,320
I forgot her name.

2506
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:49,320
Mini, mini, is it mini driver?

2507
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:50,320
Whatever.

2508
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:51,320
I don't know.

2509
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,320
I love both those things.

2510
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,320
So I thought that was cool.

2511
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:54,320
Jane and Goodwill Hunting.

2512
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,320
Okay.

02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:56,320
Anyway.

2514
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,320
All right.

2515
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:58,320
