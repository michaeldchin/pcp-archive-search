1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The great thing about the ancient alien theory is the fact that we can compare modern achievements with stories from our ancient past.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And so if today we're able to create a two-headed dog with six legs,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is it possible that a similar creature existed thousands of years ago?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the PCP.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm the best guy ever and welcome to my unidentified podcast. No one knows what it is. I am here with Tom Oliver.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Aliens built the pyramids. They genetically engineered us human beings. They crashed in Roswell.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We use their down ship to create microprocessors, and that's why Intel is the thing.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Alienware computers are actually alienwares.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The proof is in the pudding. Hippocrit is here.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Nate.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wait, you said something. Cut the whole podcast out. I made a mistake with what I said.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I was going to make a joke, but I said the whole thing wrong three times in a row. Just kill me.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Cut myself out of the podcast and put a beep boop noise.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We'll get back to that. Lethal Aurora Mage is here.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Do we have ghost aliens? That is the question.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think they might be the same thing. And of course, Munchy wears tiny hats.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Guys, I'm in a signal from outer space right now. Oh my God, I'm going to type down wow on my paper because they like World of Warcraft.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is the wow signal, but that's World of Warcraft now.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We really have evolved since we were those aliens long ago.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, everybody, we're talking about aliens today.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The most powerful race on the planet Earth.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The most benevolent beings with their compassionate eyes.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am Paradot. I love Steven Universe. I am everything to me.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I just want to go on record as saying my absolute favorite emoji is without a doubt the alien face emoji.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I copyright it. It is my property. Every time you use it, you owe me one American dollar.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's actually check out these Urban Dictionary definitions.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We've got a double for you, everybody. So number one, we've got aliens.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wait, did we explain what the PCP is?

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, we totally forgot. Thank you for reminding me.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So the PCP, everybody, is a podcast of a bunch of internet content creators who got together and they just have fun.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They just love goofing. And we love aliens. We love aliens.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's a big proponent of alien culture.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We feel more related to aliens than you fucking disgusting, normie humans out there listening to it.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So that's why we decided to talk about our spirit brethren today.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
People always say, does morality come from within the soul of man?

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Or does it come from a higher being? Or does it come from God?

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Or the third option, did it come from aliens? That's what I want to get into.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, but here, Urban Dictionary, give us some information about what the fucking aliens even is.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, here we go. Top definition, people from outer space.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Generally, peace, loving, and wise, they've come to Earth because we've got Velcro and they love that shit.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's the thing. The example is terrible, so I'm not going to read it.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But then our other definition here is UFO.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, UFO, abbreviation for unidentified flying object.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The USAF defines a UFO as anything that relates to any airborne object,

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features,

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
does not conform to any currently known aircraft or missile type,

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
or which cannot be identified as a familiar object.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, well thanks point, Dexter, for the textual definition.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So the United States Air Force just confirmed the existence of aliens if they have a definition on record.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is that true? How so?

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Because you just said the USAF, right?

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If they have a definition for it, they must acknowledge that it's a thing that can happen.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If it can happen, that means it's real.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If it can happen, it is real.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It sounds like...

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I watched Ancient Aliens, alright?

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I know exactly how you have to do this logical chain of how aliens work.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I never once watched Ancient Aliens.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, like when in Google Docs, when I type teleport, it corrects it as if it's not a word,

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
but when I type aliens, it's a word.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Therefore, it exists.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh shit!

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's in the database, it's real, probably built by aliens, manipulating us right now.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I fucked it up again.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, there's a static that cut into my...

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm back now, I'm fine.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Aliens are interrupting your thought process.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
They're scrambling my brain, making me not funny, and the audience is just hearing static, so it's fine.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you don't want to let you talk?

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's just cut to the chase here. Aliens are real.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, okay, they may be real. Have they visited the Earth?

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, they've seen Steven Universe.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The sneakle are here, and they're going to fuck us up.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My opinion is that the aliens are objectively real, but the only ones we've seen have been really funny,

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and the other ones that we haven't seen since.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We're just waiting for that.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The fact of the matter is that aliens are real, and they're illegal, and they're crossing the border every day,

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and Trump's going to fix that shit. Stop making fun of him.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Is alien like a mean to use as a word? I don't know, is that like a negative implication there?

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No, it's not.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Because now it's undocumented immigrants, you know how that's changed?

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, they keep changing it.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I guess it's just like Judge Collins talked about the softening of language every time.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's only the legal alien that's sick, because an alien in that terms is just someone who is living in the country,

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
but it's not a resident of that country.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Like Phil Collins' famous song, Legal Alien.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like all of the fucking aliens that crashed here in Roswell are now being held prisoner in Area 51, as we reverse-

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I think they were a diet of old age.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think they were forcibly bred to reproduce so we could continue to study them.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I wouldn't put it past us.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Maybe aliens are like space elves, and they're undying. It's very possible.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who do you think produces more precom? Alph or ET?

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Alph.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Definitely Alph.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Alph gets around.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I mean, have you seen his nose? I mean, come on.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's not his nose.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So the universe is really big, right? It's really, really, really big.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know about that.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's really, really, really fun.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, well take my word for it.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've looked into this a bit.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've watched Star Trek. It's hilarious.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I've seen that. It's really goofy out there.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, because the universe is so big, and human beings have explored and can see such a tiny little baby-sized percentage of it.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So as the discussion goes, as the argument goes, there's so many opportunities for life out in the cosmos.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
When you get into this stuff, immediately religious people think that there's something magical and special about Earth

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that God created man in his own image and made us here and shaped the universe around us.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So yeah, God created the entire fucking universe to house one little basically insignificant planet here

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that nobody gives a fuck about that we can't do anything with, just like a goof.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, I'd say that was the inefficient answer.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't think anyone here is doubting the possibility of humanoid aliens in the universe in general.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I just want to make the point for the listeners out there.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
For any doubting Thomases, they will be deleted as will Tom from this podcast immediately.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This was my topic idea! You can't delete me!

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's true.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did you know-

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Actually, the opposite of a doubting Thomas. You're the woke Thomas.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm taking that term back. I'm fucking- I'm suing the federal government to get custody of that term.

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Bastards.

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Again, what were you saying?

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Here's an article thing that I read, and I have no idea whether it's true.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But did you know, guys, that there's life in our solar system on Mars?

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In, like, the under-under-the-surface oceans on Mars, people have found small little bacteria.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's much of getting invaded by aliens right now.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Stop! Please!

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Is that what's happening?

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Please stop them! Please!

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They're trying to- they're doing everything they can to disrupt this podcast so that the word does not get out,

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that we're under their shit, and we know they're among us every fucking day.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, I was about to- I was about to announce something, but, you know, I was interrupted,

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and now my brain is, like, scrambled, like I remember what I was gonna say.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Here, maybe this image will help you out, check out this.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm just a thing.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Something cool.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's a good one.

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Just so everyone knows, we are constantly, like, in our chat dumping more alien images

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
just to keep us woke as possible while we're at it.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I just Google searched funny cartoon aliens, and I'm just posting all of the cool images

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that I found scrolling down at Google Image Search.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Maybe we'll remember to post a link to all of these images.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No, you can play along. Just type in funny cartoon aliens and just laugh at them while we're laughing.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
All right, continue.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay, you know, Tom posts a picture here that makes it a good argument.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's like, okay, if aliens weren't real and didn't visit Earth, how did they build everything in prehistoric Earth?

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Why were they responsible for every major achievement of humanity, you know, up to the invention of the cuckold?

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The blocks of the pyramids cannot be carried by men on their shoulders.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They just couldn't do it. It was just too heavy.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You really think that a bunch of fucking people dragged multiple ton blocks across the sand?

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
No, aliens did it. The amount of precision that the pyramids are built with, you can't even do that today with modern technology.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you think a bunch of life, do you think a bunch of fucking monkeys with sticks can make that shit?

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Do you think a bunch of Minecraft characters built those?

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The true facts all point to aliens just being really swole and they carried them on their shoulders because they're really strong.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And then instead, they didn't have spaceships, they just jumped away from our planet to another one.

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They just had very strong legs.

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay, let me ask you this. Does anyone have any good reason to believe that aliens were actually on Earth ever?

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Is there any justification other than like, oh, they must have been here.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Google search the Anunnaki, god damn it.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What is it?

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The Anunnaki that shit's fucking real, dude.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
All of the ancient creation myths are actually just misinterpretations of alien visitation.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Look, watch ancient aliens. It lays it all out. Shit's fucking real as fuck, alright?

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Everything that happened in the world is aliens.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Have you seen all of ancient aliens? I don't know how much there is.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I've seen quite a bit.

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I've seen it all.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Is it always that guy? Is it that one dude?

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's not always that guy. You know what the interesting thing is?

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, I'm gonna blow your fucking mind right now.

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is how I know that ancient aliens is legit.

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Alright, so I just linked...

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, no, no. Listen, this is some real fucking shit right now, okay?

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This is a conspiracy theory that's gonna blow your mind to shit.

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Alright, so everybody knows what the ancient aliens guy looks like, right?

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Everybody knows that.

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Alright, people at home, play along with me here.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Alright, you're about to have your fucking brain expanded.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You're gonna be like, blow.

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're about to reach level 7 Christ consciousness.

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Exactly, this is good. You're gonna get at least two levels of Christ consciousness.

184
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Expansion here.

185
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So, Google, ancient aliens guy, go to images, put that in your brain.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now, go to Google Images and Google search Babylon 5.

187
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Alright, that's a television show, okay?

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Babylon 5 Centauri.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And then, be amazed that the Centauri aliens look exactly like the ancient aliens guy.

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's the exact same thing. They're literally the same.

191
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh no.

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
These fucking guys.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Is that a fucking coincidence? No, it's not!

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I even see pictures of him posing with pictures of them.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He's trying to tell us something. He knows shit, alright?

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ancient aliens is 100% legit.

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Babylon 5 is a realistic account of aliens and how it's going to go down in the future.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This shit is real. It's all fucking real.

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He's not the only one. Look at this shit.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm seeing some major similarities here.

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Kim Jong-un or whatever.

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They're among us, dude.

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And you know what the fun in Babylon 5?

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The Centauri are the closest alien species to humans because they live in Alpha Centauri.

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They're their star. That's how it's good.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's all coming together, dude. The shit is fucking real.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I mean, mathematically speaking, they're the most likely to be the real aliens

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that fucking steal my parking spot every day at work.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
These are other fuckers.

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What are you gonna do, man?

211
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Sometimes you just gotta let the aliens have their way before they fucking kill you.

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
My favorite alien is the guy from Doctor Who.

213
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
He wears a suit.

214
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No, not that guy.

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He wears a suit and if you look at him, you're like, oh, god, it's a scary guy.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But then if you turn around, if you're not looking at him, you completely forget his entire existence

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and the fact that he was just there.

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And if you turn around, you're like, oh, my god, it's a scary guy.

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And then you turn around again, you're like, wait a minute.

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why am I here? Oh, my god, it's a scary guy.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, no, there's nothing there.

222
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Ben Sane.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Exactly.

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Mike, if anyone knows that Doctor Who alien, that's like a real cool one.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Wait, is that the one that's the one that teleports?

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Like the weeping statues or whatever?

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, no, no.

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Those are like angels or something.

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm gonna type in Doctor Who.

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The Europeans immediately jump in and correct us on our lack of Doctor Who lore knowledge.

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
My favorite aliens are the alien kids.

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And the reason I like them so much is their debut album, Alien Rap,

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
songs that lie from Planet Lump by the alien kids,

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
where they wrap it up their alien food and the ways which they process it.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Also about education reform.

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
My favorite aliens, I'm quite partial to, you know that blue guy,

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
who like a whole narrative was built around him from that like,

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm blue, I'm blue, I'm blue, I'm blue.

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No, I was gonna say that.

241
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh, you like, okay, well that guy's got like a name and a lore and a huge back story

242
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and like all kinds of tie-ins.

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Can we just go on record though that as cool as that guy is,

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
the best blue aliens to ever exist are the aliens from Interstellar 555.

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Come on.

246
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I do love them intensely.

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They got a bit more depth to them, all right?

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There's a lot of fan and lore around this blue dude,

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
but I like going direct to the source with the canon lore.

250
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's where I like to live.

251
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah, Gib, go on.

252
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I was trying to remember the name of this 80s alien kid movie,

253
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
kid alien movie, and I can't remember what it is.

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's like a group of kids and there's a cool one and there's a nerdy one

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and he has a computer and he types on the computer

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and he makes like an anti-gravity bubble

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and then they build a spaceship and they use the computer and make a bubble

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and they go into space because the kid was like getting dreams of like alien technology

259
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and then they go into space and then they get to the spaceship

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and the aliens does a goofy fucking plastic weirdo in a suit

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and they have a fun time and then the alien's dad comes back

262
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and he said, have you been talking to the humans again?

263
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And he's like, I'm sorry dad, but in aliens,

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
so you don't know that that's exactly what they're saying,

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
but it's probably, it's like you can infer.

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And then the kids go home and what the fuck is that movie?

267
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I really like it.

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Home Alone 3, Journey to Big Water, I don't know.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Guys, I have something really fucking important.

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Go search media aliens and you will see some crazy fucking images.

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Do that to viewers.

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Media aliens.

273
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You see a picture of Bill O'Reilly?

274
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You see like a movie toaster?

275
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't see Bill O'Reilly.

276
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Cowboys and aliens.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Dude, the aliens from Cowboys and Aliens are so fucking scary

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
because they're with cowboys.

279
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I like this extreme UFOs and aliens ones.

280
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay, well, this is all great and all,

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
but I wanted to ask you guys a specific question.

282
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And it's that, okay, if aliens are real and they visit Earth,

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
should they be allowed to kill human beings?

284
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Should they be allowed to wipe out humanity

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
if they deem that we are inferior and not worthy

286
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
of ascending to a galactic civilization?

287
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Explorers, 1985.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Okay, that's the one, that's the one.

289
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Anyway, why would they be able to?

290
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What if they are able to assess that humanity will advance

291
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
to some like stage where it could be a threat?

292
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Like, you know, like in Mass Effect, right?

293
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The Reapers may or may not be some sort of like white blood cell

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
that wipes out, you know, like civilizations that advance too far

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
or something like in Die Buster and Gun Buster.

296
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That same idea is present where like humanity is growing

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and reaching out to the stars and whatnot

298
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and the space monsters are thought to maybe be some sort of like

299
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
white blood cell that wipes out like civilizations

300
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
when they get to advanced.

301
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And they don't really explore why that happens,

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
but perhaps one possible reason could be too much stuff happening.

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Out in the real world, could fuck some shit up.

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Could maybe, I don't know, cause problems.

305
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm thinking from the perspective of humanity,

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
fuck that entirely, that's just a cock mentality

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
to just bend over and not expand throughout the universe

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
because oh, maybe would kill some things and do some bad stuff.

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Fuck you.

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I mean, it would be very hypocritical of them considering

311
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
that they're out in space and now killing stuff.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, it's, you know, it really is just like

313
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the whole anti-spiral argument from Gern-Lagan

314
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that the anti-spirals-

315
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What's this about white blood cells?

316
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I mean, seriously.

317
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The aliens have green blood.

318
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This doesn't even make sense to them.

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They're about the black blood cells.

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But, yeah, so like the anti-spirals and Gern-Lagan,

321
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like their whole deal is they stopped like the spiral guys.

322
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You know, the spiral just represents like evolution

323
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and growth of humanity and whatnot.

324
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And the anti-spirals like they deliberately put a cap on themselves

325
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
so they cannot go any higher and they gave themselves the job

326
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
to like squash, you know, like anything out there that gets too,

327
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that starts growing too much and could get out of control.

328
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And they were proven wrong and they were doing the bad thing

329
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and it was done.

330
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, I mean, to be fair, to be fair,

331
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
one of the things I like about Gern-Lagan

332
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
is it doesn't actually tell you that they were in fact wrong,

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but what it gives you is it-

334
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't know.

335
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You got punched in the face pretty good at the end.

336
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He did get punched real hard.

337
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I thought that was definitely some subtextual thing there.

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You're not wrong.

339
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A little bit of subtext.

340
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's clear where the intense lie,

341
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
but like it allows a degree of ambiguity

342
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
where it is true that the human beings may in fact fuck some shit up,

343
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
but I actually prefer that they don't confirm

344
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that everything works out perfectly.

345
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes, we agree.

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Instead, it leaves you on this note of that everyone like agrees

347
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
that like, okay, we are all going to work specifically

348
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to maximize happiness, freedom, and avoid this catastrophic thing

349
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that could come with too much of either of those first ones.

350
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, I would not let any aliens fucking tell me what to do

351
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
or my buddy's here on earth because that's thought crime.

352
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I think it's bullshit.

353
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You can instead, if you were an alien race

354
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
full of advanced technology and you were able to travel

355
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
through the stars and all this shit

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and you could make some sort of calculated sort of projection

357
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
on the future of humanity and you thought that it was going bad.

358
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Instead of being like, well, you guys are going to fuck up

359
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
in a couple centuries, so you're dead now.

360
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'd be like, this is an opportunity to kind of guide this society

361
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
towards a better understanding.

362
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I think just the act of interstellar contact

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
would fundamentally shift the progression

364
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and trajectory of human interest dramatically.

365
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So I think just by being introduced to the concept of aliens

366
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
we would change our priorities

367
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and the way society interacts in general, simply from that fact.

368
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And I think it would be hoovan upon aliens

369
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
if they thought that we're going bad to use their position

370
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to try and help.

371
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Basically, they need to be the America of the galaxy

372
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and intercede and spread space democracy everywhere

373
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and do nation building.

374
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's interesting because Star Trek deals, as you know,

375
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
with this very issue and it's the Prime Directive.

376
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And of course, in Star Trek First Contact,

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
the movie based from the next generation

378
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
in which they go back in time to the moment where

379
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
human beings and Star Trek develop their own warp drive,

380
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
which is the technology you really need for faster than light travel

381
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
in order to be a force in the galaxy and in the universe

382
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
outside of just your own little solar system.

383
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And as soon as they activated their warp drive,

384
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
they were detected by some nearby Vulcans

385
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
who don't live too far away.

386
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And then they came down and were like,

387
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
oh, hey humans, let's be friends now.

388
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And it was through that that they developed the Federation

389
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and grew into Starfleet and all that good stuff

390
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
that happened afterward.

391
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So the best case scenario is Star Trek.

392
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Star Trek and Starfleet and all that cool stuff.

393
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's the best case scenario.

394
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But it is entirely possible that what if the humans

395
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
just met the Klingons first or something?

396
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Not even the Klingons, but something even worse,

397
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
like the fucking Borg.

398
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And it fucks them up real bad.

399
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And they get whatever kind of bad things happen to them.

400
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm not even advocating for anything here.

401
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm just expressing alien issues.

402
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hashtag alien issues.

403
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Relatable alien problems.

404
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Stealing our jobs, crushing the working class, alien issues.

405
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I think it's retarded and stupid

406
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and frankly you should feel bad

407
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
for even suggesting anything like that.

408
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Because aliens are probably not going to have any...

409
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, I'm not saying they won't at all,

410
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
but they might not have any philosophical insights whatsoever.

411
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's possible they might just be like fucking like a dog or something.

412
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And they'll just be beasts of the land.

413
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No, that's silly.

414
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
An alien couldn't get here

415
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
without a certain level of development.

416
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Sociological and technological.

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm not saying that if we meet aliens,

418
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
if we meet aliens,

419
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
then it's very possible that there are just like thousands of planets

420
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that are just full of just bum-fuck-retard dominant species

421
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
that have no real abilities whatsoever.

422
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And so, I don't know.

423
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And even if there is a highly developed species

424
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
that gets to us first,

425
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
it's not guaranteed that they will have any sort of the same sort of like,

426
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
you know, democracy or ideas such as that.

427
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There's absolutely no way to tell that they will have anything

428
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
even resembling that whatsoever.

429
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And so, I don't think...

430
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
If an alien species does meet us,

431
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
there's no way to tell if it will even know what killing is,

432
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
because life just might work so different on that planet.

433
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Because, you know, all of our ideas is built on how life is on Earth.

434
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But if there's just some weird fucking crazy planet,

435
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
there's no way to know what its needs or wants are,

436
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
everything will have needs or wants.

437
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I hear what you're saying,

438
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
but I think there are some basic biological foundations

439
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that make a lot of things like life versus death.

440
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, life versus death, for example,

441
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I think is a pretty clear cut one

442
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
that any alien that advances to the point

443
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
where like they can, you know, travel through the stars and whatnot,

444
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I think we'll have some fundamental understanding of like what life is

445
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and probably respect it.

446
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I mean, they might operate in a society that just like works on total enslavement.

447
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Trolls. Trolls.

448
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Or trolls, there you go.

449
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Alternate trolls, yeah.

450
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Were alternative trolls even that different from normal humans?

451
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What were their distinguishing characteristics?

452
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
They were super fucking strong.

453
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
They had crazy like, like PSI powers.

454
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And they were super fucking violent.

455
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
They like killed everyone for like looking at the bad.

456
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And there was a really rigid like, like India caste system.

457
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But then Carcat just like was best friends with Dave.

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
How come he didn't just like kill Dave?

459
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
That was after like, that was after a while.

460
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That was after a lot of homosexual propaganda.

461
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So what you're telling me is hashtag not all trolls.

462
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah, hashtag not all trolls.

463
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Okay, all right, there we go.

464
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, it's all trolls.

465
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Fuck all trolls.

466
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You can all burn.

467
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Every troll was an MMM.

468
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And fucking one of them had a bullet in them.

469
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You bite the bullet, asshole.

470
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Die.

471
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm gonna say yes.

472
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm very happy that Homestuck is part of this conversation.

473
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I just want to say that.

474
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't really have like a point.

475
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm just, I just remembered.

476
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
What's your favorite Homestuck alien?

477
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, John Egbert.

478
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah, it's mine as well.

479
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Hey, so, okay.

480
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So does anyone have any personal experience?

481
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like, has anyone ever come up to you and said like,

482
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
check me out of a fucking alien

483
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and then directly annihilated you?

484
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You know, like a story like that.

485
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm interested in that sort of thing.

486
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Do you want to know about the story of the alien that got away?

487
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yes, absolutely.

488
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So when I was a little kid,

489
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I loved, I loved aliens.

490
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I loved space.

491
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I loved science class.

492
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
We were talking about like the solar system

493
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and astronomy and all that shit.

494
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And it was really cool.

495
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And I loved science.

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Then I was like...

497
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So I was at the carnival.

498
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The carnival was in town.

499
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And so I was,

500
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and I was all about aliens.

501
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And this was back like in 1990,

502
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
whatever, old, olden times

503
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
before Munchie was even a twinkle in his dad's eye.

504
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And I wasn't a twinkle in my dad's eyes ever since.

505
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Exactly.

506
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
He explains everything.

507
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So I'm at this carnival

508
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and I'm playing the games and stuff

509
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and I decide there's this big alien prize.

510
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I was like, that's what I want.

511
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So it's typical like little green alien

512
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
but you were like, I had like a hoodie on

513
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and it was a cool thing.

514
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And I was like, that's what I want.

515
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And I spent all day trying to win this alien prize at this game.

516
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't remember what game it was.

517
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I got it.

518
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I felt like the coolest guy in the entire world.

519
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It was big.

520
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It was like 18 inches tall.

521
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It was one of those big, hard to get prizes.

522
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You are literally paradigm.

523
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Exactly.

524
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I resonated with that scene a lot.

525
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And this story takes a tragic turn here though.

526
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Because I brought it home

527
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and I brought it to my mom

528
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and my grandmother.

529
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And they're both very religious.

530
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And they thought aliens were the devil.

531
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So they refused to let me have it.

532
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And I was like, no.

533
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I worked for this.

534
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
This is the result of my labor.

535
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
This taught me a lesson about capitalism

536
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
in the world.

537
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
How dare you take this from me.

538
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But they bribed me.

539
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
They bribed me.

540
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
They were like, alright, you capitalist pig.

541
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We will give you

542
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
that toy from Lost in Space.

543
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That other space movie that you really like right now.

544
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
If you give us this.

545
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And I was like,

546
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But

547
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I won this and they're like, yes.

548
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But we're going to be the government incentives

549
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
giving you things for free.

550
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
If you vote

551
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Democrat.

552
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So I voted Democrat.

553
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I got rid of it.

554
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And they made me feel bad because

555
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I thought my soul was going to burn in health forever

556
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
for having this alien toy that I won.

557
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I never saw it again.

558
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And every time I see the alien

559
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
wear logo, I'm like,

560
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
There he is.

561
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm going on to bigger things.

562
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm so happy.

563
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm CEO of a computer parts company.

564
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We can all just agree

565
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
that the little stereotypical

566
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
green alien guy with the big ass eyes

567
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
is the pinnacle of graphic design.

568
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I agree.

569
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Completely.

570
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Do you guys ever see that post?

571
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
There was a post of some photos

572
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
of a claimed real photo

573
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
of a gray alien with the big

574
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
eyes and like, you know, like the small lips

575
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and everything, whatever. And then someone drew over it

576
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
quickly as a sketch.

577
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And then again, it was the perfect proportions

578
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
of an anime girl.

579
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm just saying, dude.

580
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's a conspiracy.

581
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Anime girls.

582
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll try and find it.

583
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll try and look for it.

584
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Actually, you know what that exactly reminds me?

585
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
There was a chapter in Frank and Fran

586
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
where there is a, which is this horror

587
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
like monster surgery.

588
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
This particular chapter is about

589
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the main character, Matarake Fran.

590
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Matarake Fran.

591
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
People just come to her and ask for crazy surgeries

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
because she's like a god of surgery.

593
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And she can literally do anything, including bring the dead back to life sometimes.

594
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
She's just nuts.

595
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
In this case,

596
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
a famous actress approaches her

597
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
and is like, Fran, you're famous, help me.

598
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I, okay, there's a guy

599
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
that I love, that I want to marry, date, etc.

600
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The thing is though,

601
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
he's only into that fucking 2D shit.

602
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He's not into 3D pig disgusting.

603
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He's not into that.

604
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So what I need you to do,

605
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
okay, there's the image he posted.

606
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's fucking awesome.

607
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So what I need you to do, Fran,

608
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
is make me look like a fucking anime girl.

609
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I-R-L.

610
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Do whatever you gotta do

611
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to my fucking body to make it happen.

612
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So like, she like shortens her limbs.

613
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
She like, okay, so what she does with her brain

614
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
is this is fascinating.

615
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So the anime babes have big old heads.

616
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
She replaced her skull

617
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
with a gigantic dome thing

618
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and then has her brain suspended

619
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
by wires inside the thing

620
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
with a big cavern.

621
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I know, it's fucked up.

622
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Like, Frank & Fran is a fucked up series, but I love it.

623
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But the culmination of this

624
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
is that slowly, when she becomes more and more anime,

625
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
she-

626
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
her eyes getting big in all kinds of crazy shit.

627
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Increase anime!

628
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
There was just a knob.

629
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yes, there was a knob.

630
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm talking overdrive here.

631
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So like, Nia's to say her body was getting

632
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
super fucked up the whole time.

633
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
She has to wear a wig now

634
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and she has to do maintenance

635
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
on her body and shit because she's a fucking freak now.

636
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But ultimately, what happens is

637
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the guy does start to love her

638
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
because she is like his anime babes.

639
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah, he's doing it.

640
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So that happens and then like, I think they either get married

641
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
or they're like, I don't know, they're together for a night

642
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and so the guy's laying in bed

643
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and she's like, yeah, I'm coming out to come fuck you

644
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and then as she

645
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
as he turns, see her climbing onto the bed,

646
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
there's like a light shining from outside the window

647
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and her wig has fallen off

648
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
and all her clothes are off and you can see her body

649
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and she just looks exactly like one of these

650
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
fucking gray aliens.

651
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Exactly the fucking same.

652
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And it's pretty much like the climax of the whole arc.

653
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You know what this means, dude?

654
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
This means that anime is an alien plot

655
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
to make us want to fuck them

656
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
to make us sympathetic to the alien cause.

657
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Exactly.

658
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The Japanese have been taken over by aliens.

659
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
By the way, I just want to say

660
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
When did like fucking

661
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Astro Boy come out and shit?

662
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What year was that?

663
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The 30s, the 20s, I can't remember.

664
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The 40s? A while ago.

665
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Not the 20s.

666
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Wasn't that long ago, was it?

667
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
No, cause Disney started like the 10s of the 20s

668
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
so it was later than that.

669
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I think it was like 50s.

670
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'd say like the 40s or something.

671
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't know, whatever. Around there, around there.

672
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
In the background of my audio

673
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
is like a very like consistently

674
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
weird booming base.

675
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That's just my alien spaceship.

676
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Don't worry about it.

677
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Wait, wait, no, no, no.

678
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Okay, this is some real shit right now, okay?

679
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So, I'm going to drop a conspiracy theory.

680
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Christ conscious of the other level.

681
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Roswell, Roswell at the UFO incident

682
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
in mid-1947

683
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
at United States Air Force's balloon

684
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
crashed in a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico.

685
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, okay, Wikipedia, keep telling us that.

686
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
1947,

687
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Roswell, five years later

688
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
in 1952, Astro Boy

689
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
is released. Oh my god.

690
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What do you think it is?

691
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Mega Man came out that pod.

692
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Mega Man came out that pod.

693
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Wow. He came out.

694
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Guys, my favorite monster,

695
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
no, I'm sorry, my favorite alien

696
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
of all time.

697
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I can't decide if it's the Flatwoods monster

698
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
or it's the Hopkinsville's goblin.

699
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
They're both a goblin.

700
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Those are excellent choices.

701
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Here's the original

702
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
depiction of the Flatwoods monster,

703
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
by the way.

704
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Okay, I dig it. He's impressive.

705
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Whoa.

706
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
This is Waluigi.

707
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
He's Waluigi

708
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
in a wedding dress.

709
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He just wants to be loved.

710
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No, but the

711
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
canonical version is

712
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
fucking dope. Look how cool it is.

713
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Holy shit.

714
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, the Flatwoods monster.

715
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't want to go to the Hopkinsville's goblin

716
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
because he's just a little fucking guy who's an asshole.

717
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Fuck you.

718
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Dude, do you know

719
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the story of the Hopkinsville's goblin?

720
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I have no idea. Okay, so fucking

721
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
basically

722
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
these two fucking

723
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
in the middle of fucking nowhere,

724
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I forget where, like New Jersey

725
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I think, anywhere.

726
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Anywhere in the world

727
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
can happen to you. Okay.

728
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Um, you know, just these fucking

729
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
hillbilly fucking retards,

730
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
you know, fuck you if you farm.

731
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
We're in their house.

732
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And just these fucking, like, little, like, gray,

733
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
like, like fucking, like, goblin

734
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
fucking asshole, like, sable eyes.

735
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
These fucking sable eyes came out.

736
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And they started, like,

737
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
popping in and out of windows, like, playing

738
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
playing peek-a-boo and shit and, like, making fun of these people.

739
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Making fun of them, they're, like, waiting

740
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
shit, being real assholes and

741
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
playing pranks. Playing mean pranks.

742
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
One of the dads would walk out and, like,

743
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the door was slightly open and he walked in the other room

744
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and then a bucket fell on his head.

745
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Fucking mean. That's what they were.

746
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
They're just pranksters. They're just mean people.

747
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
They're jerks and fuck you.

748
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Goblin, you're mean.

749
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That's why I like them, because they're really prank.

750
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Alright. That sounds good.

751
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I think Mage was trying to say something before. Mage?

752
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Um, I wasn't,

753
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
but I had something in mind, so you maybe

754
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
you read my mind. Okay.

755
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay.

756
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But first, I have to open the door for my cat.

757
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Sorry.

758
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Well, in the meantime, everyone, I just,

759
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
while she's doing that for a second, everyone look at

760
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the greatest alien who ever lived. His name is

761
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Jiren. He is from Dragon Ball Super

762
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and he is canonically stronger than God,

763
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
proving that aliens are superior to God

764
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and my God. He is

765
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the best of all time. Also, he looks

766
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
exactly like me in every way.

767
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Alright. Alright. He is me.

768
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
He is me. Okay. Now we're just projecting.

769
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm serious. Look at my newest

770
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
video where I'm talking about Star Trek. I put

771
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
a picture of him up. It looks exactly like me

772
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
wearing my sunglasses. I'm just saying.

773
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Okay, mate. Lay it on us.

774
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Okay. Well, it's not

775
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
that big of a story, but, you know, when you

776
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
asked, like, if anyone had some sort

777
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
of experiences or whatever. So

778
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
one time, I was around

779
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
10 to 12 or so,

780
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
just a little, little Mage

781
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
running around late in the evening

782
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
without supervision.

783
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I was with a friend at that time. It was

784
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
really late in the evening and it was almost

785
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
dark. I think, like, the sun was almost

786
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
completely down.

787
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
We were both going home and we were

788
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
near his house and just at the corner

789
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
of my eye, I spotted something and then I

790
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
looked up at the sky, not, like, directly

791
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
above me, but, like, in the horizon.

792
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
They were, like,

793
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
several lights sort of flashing and something

794
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
was flying by before disappearing behind

795
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
a building. And

796
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I didn't know

797
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
what it was because it was very, well, I mean,

798
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
literally a UFO. I'm not

799
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
implying it was an alien UFO, but, like...

800
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Sure, sure.

801
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
We both saw it and we didn't know what

802
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
it was and we ran towards the horizon to see

803
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
if we could, you know, see it behind the

804
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
building. But by the time we got to the building

805
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
it was already out of sight.

806
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And, like,

807
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I told my parents about it and they said,

808
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
oh, it could have been a plane or something because

809
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
planes have, like, you know, lights on when they're

810
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
flying in darkness and stuff.

811
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But, like, it looked too

812
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
close to the ground and, like, the lights

813
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
were too big and spaced a bit differently

814
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
from the planes.

815
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And also, like, the plane had, like,

816
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
no real reason to

817
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
be flying over there because we didn't

818
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
have an airport in my city and we never

819
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
saw planes ever fly.

820
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Like, now we do, but back in those

821
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
days when I was a little...

822
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We never got planes flying over

823
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
our places, like...

824
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You know, Major, I'm glad you brought that up.

825
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
What year was this? It was, like,

826
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
over ten years ago.

827
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Uh, I think...

828
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Was it on September 11th?

829
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
One by any chance?

830
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm just saying.

831
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Just checking in.

832
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You know, I was gonna say, depending on how old

833
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
you are, but if it's only, like, ten years ago

834
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
probably not, it might have been some sort of Russian

835
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
thing, possibly, since I know you were

836
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
close to there.

837
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And, I mean, it could have been,

838
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
like, you think you only got independence

839
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
from Russia, like, one year

840
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
before I was born.

841
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, really? Are the Russians

842
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
aliens?

843
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Basically. Maybe.

844
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Putin is superior to all the life forms on the planet,

845
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
so it's probably true. I need to interject here

846
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
because I'm on thealiens.wikia.com

847
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
fandom page

848
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and I'm looking at the Anunnaki

849
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and I'm in some deep shit right now.

850
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Alright, check it out.

851
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
He's in hot water right now.

852
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Check the shit out.

853
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Anunnaki, general information,

854
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
whole world,

855
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Aldebaran,

856
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
habitat, earth,

857
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
body type, vagina humanoid,

858
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
sapience level,

859
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
super,

860
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
behind the scenes

861
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
information,

862
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
universe, real.

863
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
What?

864
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
This is some real stuff.

865
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
There's a lot of aliens. I mean, we aren't even

866
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
gonna get into the aliens that populate the

867
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
imaginary universes out there. There's just

868
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
too many to go into.

869
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The accompanying picture really sells this whole

870
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
thing. It's

871
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
some great a shit.

872
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Let me tell you.

873
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, shit.

874
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Wow.

875
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Are those the aliens, those big bearded

876
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
motherfuckers? Figures

877
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
believe to be the Anunnaki. I believe it's some sort

878
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
of sculpture or artistic representation.

879
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Viewers, if you want to understand

880
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
what this looks like, if nobody edits this in

881
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
cough then. You know what's great though?

882
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
The main figure is basically

883
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
just, imagine like the

884
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
representation of Sargon of Akkad with

885
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
googly eyes. That's pretty much what we're looking at right here.

886
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Right. Confirm.

887
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
By the way, I just want to point out how amazing

888
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
it is that there is a category for

889
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
universe, real versus not real.

890
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Think of how many entries there are

891
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in here that depict universes that are

892
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
not real. This is why you gotta watch

893
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Ancient Aliens. That's just the beginning of the

894
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
fucking rabbit hole for all of this shit.

895
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
This is a huge arc. It goes on forever.

896
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Let's just throw out the concept of real versus not real

897
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
because that's garbage anyway. It never meant anything.

898
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Once we get that out of the way, then we can

899
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
get into the real shit where you are

900
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
right now.

901
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
When I was a young lad,

902
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I was a very smart boy.

903
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I hadn't actually read The Great Gatsby.

904
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I hadn't actually read The Great Gatsby

905
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
but I imagined that I had.

906
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I was a smart

907
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
cookie. Anytime

908
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
aliens were brought up, I would immediately be

909
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
like, that's probably not true.

910
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's probably like this and that.

911
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Every time my little brothers would

912
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
say, whoa, what's that? That's a blink

913
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and light moving across the sky. It's an airplane.

914
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's not real. It's not alien.

915
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I never had

916
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
a time in my childhood

917
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
where I believed anything because

918
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I think I was told they weren't real

919
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
before I had an experience like

920
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
that.

921
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I thought I was real smart

922
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and stuff.

923
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I would love rationalizing things in my head

924
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
like, I don't know

925
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
how that could be but

926
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
let me think of the ways that it could be fake

927
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and I would be that kid.

928
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So that

929
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
yeah, I ruined

930
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
my little brothers' lives.

931
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
They now don't believe.

932
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You know what the most important aliens in my life

933
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
are? The aliens from Chicken Little.

934
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Because they were so fucking gay

935
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and they're like, you destroy...

936
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
they mess up that guy's fucking baseball

937
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
game.

938
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
No, I can raise you one better, dude.

939
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You know what the most important aliens

940
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
are? The Fleblings

941
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
from ChexQuest. Those guys

942
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
were fucking around.

943
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Hell yeah.

944
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Do you remember the

945
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
weapon you had when you ran out of ammo? You had a spoon

946
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and you scooped them up because they were

947
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
goo. I do remember that.

948
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That was some real shit, dude. It was absolutely devastating.

949
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It deeply impacted the way I eat cereal to this fucking day.

950
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I remember something.

951
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
My favorite alien

952
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
is not whatever I said.

953
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It is, in fact, a very specific

954
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
comic

955
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
in the Xenomorph

956
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
whatever comic universe.

957
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The first movie's pretty good,

958
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
but this comic is like the best

959
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
alien story ever.

960
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And if you type in Alien Comic

961
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Saxophone, you will see the image I'm talking about.

962
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You've sold me on this.

963
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's not actually funny. It's just like really cool.

964
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's the ending of the comic. The saxophone

965
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
is like one of the marines is like

966
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
precious items and he has to throw it.

967
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I just want to say, just searching Alien Saxophone in general

968
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
is leading to fantastic results.

969
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Whoa. That doesn't dope as shit.

970
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Oh my fucking god. This is sick.

971
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He's so aesthetic with that thing.

972
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It looks incredible.

973
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't know what that comic is.

974
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I am hard.

975
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But if anyone wants

976
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
a really good Alien Xenomorph

977
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
comic experience, that is probably

978
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
the best one I've ever read and it's probably better

979
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
than the movie and I like it a lot.

980
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Shit, dude.

981
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Alien Saxophone.

982
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I like it.

983
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Incredible. Oh my god, guys. I figured it out.

984
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I got our guy.

985
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I got our guy.

986
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I locked up and got a handcuff right here. Here he is.

987
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That's a real jazz for your soul mother

988
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
right there.

989
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I just cannot believe how much I love

990
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Aliens.

991
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I couldn't agree more.

992
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But have we run the gamut for our deep

993
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
discussion about the realism

994
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and the 100% confirmation that they are

995
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
real aliens?

996
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
We have met them on multiple occasions.

997
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm thinking it's like a

998
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
they live situation mostly.

999
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
They're hidden in plain sight with all kinds of

1000
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
bizarre gay filters.

1001
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
We have some solid proof

1002
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that Obama is a lizard person.

1003
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We've got some real shit.

1004
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Hillary too. Hillary too.

1005
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
We could have been ruled by aliens

1006
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
but we fucked it up.

1007
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
What are we going to do?

1008
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Humans making mistakes. That's probably the best

1009
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
case aliens could make for wiping us out

1010
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
is like, look, we could have ruled you

1011
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
but you didn't vote with her.

1012
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So fuck you.

1013
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You work with her, you massage in his

1014
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
piece of shit.

1015
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The aliens are super liberal cooks.

1016
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
They invented it.

1017
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Dude, the first thing they went to

1018
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
when they got here was Seattle.

1019
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That's when they got here.

1020
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I want to say that if you don't think

1021
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
aliens are real, first of all

1022
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
how dare you. Second of all

1023
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
look no further

1024
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
than the

1025
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I mean if you believe that there's a love

1026
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
battleship underneath the pyramids of Giza

1027
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
which you should because it's completely

1028
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
feasible and I've been there myself.

1029
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Isn't it less than a millimeter thick?

1030
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's like one atom thick.

1031
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And like two miles wide.

1032
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's the love battleship.

1033
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And if you think yourself, well what's it

1034
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
used for? I'll fucking tell you.

1035
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Back in the 1950s when the grays were getting

1036
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
heated up and they're getting super mad

1037
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
at the United States government because they

1038
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
wouldn't give them weed.

1039
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
That's all they wanted. That's the way they came

1040
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
to earth for that dank kush bro.

1041
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They wouldn't give it from the United States government

1042
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
because they were fucking prudes.

1043
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So some women from South America went over

1044
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I need to give them the weed so they'll

1045
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
know they'll fuck off. So she went to the pyramid

1046
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
of Giza and she went inside the love battleship

1047
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and she wished with all of her heart that they

1048
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
would get so much weed that they would fucking

1049
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
bark. You know what they did. They all got

1050
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
sick and they ran away. So thank you women

1051
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
from South America for powering the love battleship

1052
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and proving that aliens are fucking real.

1053
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Shit.

1054
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I am 100% convinced. Oh by the way

1055
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
unlike ghosts, unlike ghosts

1056
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
aliens are incredibly eco-friendly.

1057
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
They're known for their hacky

1058
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
sacks and general peace-loving nature

1059
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and have incredible taste and rap.

1060
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They're dykes.

1061
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I think I would take

1062
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
an alien over a ghost any day of the week.

1063
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Who do you think would win an alien or a ghost?

1064
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
What about an alien ghost?

1065
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's what I said in the beginning.

1066
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But if aliens die

1067
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
they have ghosts too don't they?

1068
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
How do you know? We know that we have ghosts.

1069
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That's like the concept of interracial marriage.

1070
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It's never happened so let's stop discussing it.

1071
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's not going to happen. We know because of the

1072
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
dream bubbles that ghosts are real.

1073
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah.

1074
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's like

1075
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
we don't know if they're going to have the concept of ghosts

1076
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
because they might not have ghosts. We know we have ghosts

1077
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
because we've grown up and evolved to have them

1078
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
on the planet Earth. God has only

1079
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
given human souls.

1080
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Those lowly aliens

1081
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
are not superior beings enough.

1082
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
The aliens might have their own gods.

1083
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
They could have their own gods.

1084
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Guys, you know

1085
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
like the saint when in Rome do what Romans do

1086
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
if an alien dies on Earth

1087
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
maybe it gains a ghost.

1088
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That's pretty good.

1089
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That's pretty good.

1090
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
All right.

1091
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
What if the alien comes to Earth

1092
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
and is enraptured in our culture

1093
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and is born again a Christian?

1094
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Does he gain a soul?

1095
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Here guys, let me ask you this.

1096
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Ginger.

1097
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Let me ask you this.

1098
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
If an alien lands in

1099
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
the United Arab Emirates

1100
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and actually lands in an American airport

1101
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
particularly United States soil

1102
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
can he still get legally same sex married

1103
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
because he's on American soil

1104
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
but he's also in Saudi Arabia

1105
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
so two conflicting laws.

1106
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Which law overrides for an alien?

1107
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
What if he doesn't conform to human

1108
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
gender binary things?

1109
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Can he get gay married at all?

1110
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The most common forms

1111
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
of monsters are these vagina

1112
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
alien types. Where does that exactly

1113
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
fall on the spectrum? It seems female

1114
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
at a glance. But they're all vagina

1115
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
monsters.

1116
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Maybe all the aliens

1117
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
in the real universe are all vagina

1118
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
humanoids.

1119
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And the ones in the fake universe are the penis.

1120
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Of course.

1121
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Men, the patriarch is not real.

1122
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's a social course.

1123
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It all comes together.

1124
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Little bit column A, little bit column B

1125
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
motherfucker.

1126
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Well team

1127
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I think we did it.

1128
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What would you want to be in your UFO?

1129
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
What's the sick UFO?

1130
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What UFO do you want to buy from your UFO car

1131
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
dealership?

1132
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Jimmy Neutron's

1133
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
spaceship.

1134
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
What about the show called Rick and Morty though?

1135
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
No.

1136
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's really smart.

1137
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Seriously for real, the Jimmy Neutron

1138
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
movie of them all turning like the

1139
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Ferris wheel and stuff into spaceships

1140
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
is like the coolest thing I've ever

1141
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
seen in my whole life.

1142
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Why?

1143
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I fantasized about turning stuff into

1144
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
a spaceship and just going.

1145
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And just going up there.

1146
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Also that eighties movie I mentioned.

1147
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Anything like that. Anything that's like

1148
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
real.

1149
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Like Jimmy Neutron.

1150
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I want the spaceship.

1151
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Is Jimmy Neutron

1152
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
the real universe or is he in the fake

1153
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
universe?

1154
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Maybe we're in the fake universe.

1155
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
He's a genius. He can travel between the

1156
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
universes. He's not limited

1157
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
by such things like the rest of us.

1158
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I want a purple sparkly spaceship.

1159
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Well, age post is a very dank looking

1160
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
spaceship in there.

1161
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It's shining bright.

1162
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
You guys ever seen Spaceballs?

1163
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Of course.

1164
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I want the spaceship they have

1165
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
that's just the RV

1166
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
but it has engines on the back.

1167
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That's a good one. I thought you were

1168
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
going to go with Mega Maid.

1169
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Like Van the rest of my life anyways.

1170
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It's going to be perpetually poor. So it'll feel like home.

1171
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You know?

1172
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Alright.

1173
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Is this one?

1174
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Is this one?

1175
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Is this one?

1176
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Oh my god!

1177
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yes!

1178
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You win. This is the best one.

1179
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
That's the one.

1180
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That shit. Oh god. That was in Lego Magazine

1181
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
every month and I was like I want it so bad.

1182
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I had it.

1183
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I lost all the pieces

1184
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
that I have no clue.

1185
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Oh my god. We have to go on a quest

1186
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to find all the pieces of the Master Emerald.

1187
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
We have to go back.

1188
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I remade that UFO in like a million

1189
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
different ways. It was so fucking fun.

1190
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We got a...

1191
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
When we all do Radcon

1192
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Lego Land, there will be

1193
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
great research.

1194
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Those were the coolest aliens.

1195
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Radcon Lego Land

1196
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We have to.

1197
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Lego Con? I don't know. I got nothing.

1198
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Alright.

1199
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I feel like my thoughts can be summed up

1200
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
in this image.

1201
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Fucking drag and drop. Please.

1202
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Please. My computer is freezing up

1203
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
because they know.

1204
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Okay.

1205
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Nothing in this book is true

1206
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
but it's exactly how things are.

1207
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
With a bunch of just fucking

1208
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
aliens. I like how

1209
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
this is the third edition revise that

1210
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
explains it.

1211
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
You know what?

1212
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Real serious question. This is the last thing

1213
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I've got to say on this topic.

1214
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What's the deal with fucking crop circles

1215
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
if aliens aren't making them?

1216
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I actually had a thought about this

1217
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
that I forgot to bring up.

1218
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
The aliens put crop circles down

1219
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
because we have constantly been making

1220
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
crop rectangles and they get confused.

1221
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
They think we're talking to them.

1222
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So they reply with the crop circles.

1223
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
They hear the rectangles and they're like

1224
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
oh, okay, a circle.

1225
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And they're like, oh.

1226
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
They don't get it.

1227
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Maybe the square in alien language

1228
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
means DTF this whole time.

1229
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

1230
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And that's why they abduct us and give us anal probes.

1231
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
They think that we consented already.

1232
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
That makes sense.

1233
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Oh, we're going to press charges super fucking hard.

1234
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
We need alien safe spaces.

1235
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Final question guys.

1236
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Are skeletons aliens?

1237
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Think about it. They aren't human.

1238
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
They aren't alive.

1239
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Okay.

1240
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Agreed.

1241
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yeah, okay.

1242
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
We wrapped it up guys. We did it.

1243
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yeah, okay, that's done.

1244
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
All right, everybody.

1245
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
If anyone doesn't have any final points,

1246
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
let's just take a look at these fucking questions over here.

1247
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah.

1248
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Did anyone, by the way, do the thing on the fan discord?

1249
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
No.

1250
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Ask the questions.

1251
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Go submit it right now.

1252
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
We'll get some while I butter us up

1253
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah.

1254
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Okay.

1255
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Okay, what do you got with this one?

1256
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
At LibRplex, I guess,

1257
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
asks

1258
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
tips on winning arguments

1259
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
slash being more persuasive.

1260
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
How do you get people to be persuaded?

1261
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Munchy, what do you do when you want people to believe you?

1262
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
When I want people to believe me,

1263
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I just don't,

1264
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
like when I want people to believe me,

1265
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I don't know if I necessarily want that a lot.

1266
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I will like, the point of the conversation

1267
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
is that I won't be to spread my ideology

1268
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
most of the time, if ever.

1269
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It will just be to explain myself

1270
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and then come to my own conclusions after everything is said

1271
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and done.

1272
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Well, if I explicitly want someone to conform

1273
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
to what I like, because I don't know,

1274
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I just want to emotionally manipulate them for any reason,

1275
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
then I'll just act

1276
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
like a really good person,

1277
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
they'll feel bad for not agreeing with me.

1278
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'm really cranking up at

1279
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
your like straight-faced

1280
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
answer as you posted

1281
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
a picture of a cobra with a fucking cigarette in it.

1282
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I just got

1283
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
really, really

1284
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
without comment.

1285
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
No human could ever conceive of this.

1286
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It had to be external forces.

1287
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's the only explanation.

1288
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I love that snake.

1289
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
What's the guy fucking doing?

1290
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
What's his angle here?

1291
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
His angle is getting turned

1292
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
as fuck.

1293
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Alright, I'm going to have to say,

1294
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
there's so many images.

1295
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I want to edit this just so that I can make sure

1296
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
that all the images get put in the

1297
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
thing. So if you've just been listening,

1298
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
the video version of this podcast

1299
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
will have images on.

1300
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So, there you go.

1301
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Hey, so on the thing of

1302
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
how to win an argument, I would say

1303
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
that somebody who's great at winning arguments,

1304
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
whether you like the guy or not,

1305
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
is like Donald Trump.

1306
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Because what Donald Trump does,

1307
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
more like Donald Trump, am I right?

1308
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Got him.

1309
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
What Trump does

1310
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
is the classic

1311
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
debate tactic of just

1312
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
not giving a fuck with a question

1313
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
you were just asked and just making up

1314
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
an answer to some other question.

1315
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's extremely high level.

1316
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But if you're in a debate,

1317
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I don't know, maybe there's

1318
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
a formal setting or whatever,

1319
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
but if you just want people to be on your side,

1320
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
if you just want to win overall,

1321
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
eventually, and there's no autistic rules

1322
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
going on or anything,

1323
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
just ignore attacks

1324
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
and ignore things

1325
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that are about the substance of what's wrong

1326
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
with your position. Just focus on

1327
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
what's wrong with their position

1328
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and hammer away at it incessantly

1329
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and discard all decorum

1330
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
and all semblance of trying to be

1331
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
acting in good faith

1332
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
or take the other person's argument at its face value.

1333
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
If your only goal is to win,

1334
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
just find a point

1335
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
that you think they're vulnerable at

1336
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
and hammer them over and over again.

1337
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Exactly how people do it.

1338
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
My two suggestions would be first.

1339
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
If you just want to win the argument,

1340
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
always appeal to emotion.

1341
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yeah, that's a good one.

1342
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
The limbic brain is what's responsible for decision making

1343
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and that's the emotional part

1344
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
of the brain. The neocortex does not

1345
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
have anything to do with decision making.

1346
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So if you want to sway somebody quickly, appeal to their emotions,

1347
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
not logic, because logic is not very

1348
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
persuasive. You use logic after

1349
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
the fact to justify your emotional responses.

1350
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But if you actually want to change somebody's

1351
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
mind, I highly recommend the Socratic method

1352
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
of arguing where you present

1353
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
your points as questions.

1354
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So you ask them questions

1355
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and you basically back them into a corner

1356
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
to basically make your points for you.

1357
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Because that way they're coming to the conclusions

1358
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
themselves and it feels like it's their ideas

1359
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and their learning as opposed to you beating them

1360
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
over the head with what the right answer is.

1361
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah.

1362
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I have a suggestion.

1363
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
This is kind of a bit of a tip here, guys.

1364
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So if you're arguing with

1365
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
someone, the best thing you can do

1366
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
is not to make the other person

1367
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
feel attacked by your side.

1368
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Because as soon as a person

1369
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
feels attacked, they get defensive

1370
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and as soon as a person gets defensive

1371
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
it's shut off.

1372
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
The conversation is shut off. You're no longer going to be

1373
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
able to persuade them because

1374
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
they're locked in and they're not

1375
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
going to be budging and they're going to be stubborn.

1376
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So don't make them feel

1377
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
attacked.

1378
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Nate, your argument about ignoring

1379
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
the

1380
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
question you were asked or whatever is depressing.

1381
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
That's good if you're on a debate

1382
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and you're trying to convince the audience

1383
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
but not the person you're debating.

1384
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Conduct is important here.

1385
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Entirely true.

1386
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And failing all that

1387
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
puts an image of a snake with a cigarette in it's mouth.

1388
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I don't know if that will win

1389
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
every argument.

1390
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
By the way, just on the subject

1391
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
of debates or arguments, this always gets me.

1392
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Considering Tom's

1393
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
emotional argument point there.

1394
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's so true.

1395
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Let's say, for example,

1396
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
you've got some debate going on

1397
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
between a mom

1398
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
whose kid was

1399
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
kidnapped by a pedophile and raised

1400
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
or something.

1401
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
What was he wearing?

1402
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
You have the mom here

1403
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
who's experienced this.

1404
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Let's say that the ideas, her and her organization

1405
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
are pushing for stricter legalization

1406
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
laws to outlaw

1407
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and let's say

1408
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Lollicon porn, for example.

1409
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So he's very near and dear to Nate's heart.

1410
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Indeed, indeed.

1411
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And then on the other side,

1412
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
you've got a fucking scientist

1413
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
who's saying, I have studied this

1414
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and I am telling you, there is no connection

1415
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
between this particular art

1416
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
or whatever and increased rates

1417
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
of pedophilia. If you've got those two people,

1418
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
even if the dude is correct

1419
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and can demonstrate that he is correct,

1420
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
nobody's going to give a shit

1421
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
what they care about is making the other person feel good

1422
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
because something bad happened to them.

1423
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
That is how it works every fucking time.

1424
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
You cannot deal with these kinds of things.

1425
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's totally illogical, but you see it

1426
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
all the fucking time.

1427
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's the worst. Which is why I so

1428
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
hate all these

1429
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
advocates

1430
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
for all these causes that people

1431
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
individually may have experienced the particular

1432
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
crime, but then they go on to try

1433
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
to advocate policies

1434
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
to change things for everybody.

1435
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
These people are looking at anecdotal evidence.

1436
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's your own experience, sure,

1437
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
but it's completely anecdotal.

1438
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's the mass studies that actually matter

1439
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
when it comes to making decisions on a large scale.

1440
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
People can't emotionally quantify statistics.

1441
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
That's why we're all fucking retarded.

1442
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
That's why the aliens come.

1443
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
They're going to kill us and I change my mind.

1444
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
They should do it.

1445
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I want a meteor to kill us rather than aliens.

1446
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It's my religion, you know.

1447
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
What if the meteor was

1448
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
brought here by aliens?

1449
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Would you rather be

1450
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
a ghost, skeleton, or alien?

1451
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Huh?

1452
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Aliens are gentle. Aliens are compassionate.

1453
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
They understand what I want.

1454
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They don't indicate it to my needs.

1455
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
If an alien kills you, you'd be

1456
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
euthanized. If a skeleton kills you, you'd be

1457
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
butchered.

1458
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You're right about that.

1459
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Skeletons can really get under your skin enough.

1460
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I haven't been listening to this

1461
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
entire question because I'm looking at this

1462
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
making them laugh so much.

1463
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You have to have the snake

1464
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
up the entire Q&A session

1465
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
so nobody hears any of this.

1466
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Good idea. Good idea.

1467
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Alright, let's get to the question.

1468
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Wait, wait, Maja was going to say something.

1469
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I said it fun, but now the moment's over.

1470
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Dammit. Well, shit.

1471
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
If an alien kills you,

1472
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
you'd be euthanized.

1473
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
If a skeleton kills you, you'd be butchered.

1474
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You're right about that.

1475
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Skeletons can really get under your skin,

1476
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
you know?

1477
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Okay, what do we got here?

1478
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Here's one.

1479
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Hey, what's up, you imitating mother fuckers.

1480
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
They ask,

1481
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
do you lock your windows at night?

1482
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I think they want to get into your house, Munchie,

1483
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
so be careful how you answer this question.

1484
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yeah, I fucking...

1485
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I do not, in fact.

1486
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I always have my windows open and with a fan

1487
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
blasting as loud as fucking humanly possible.

1488
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
If you ever come up with a little of my streams

1489
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
of video quality,

1490
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
or sometimes arm retrieval because fuck arm retrieval,

1491
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
then you'll hear my fan.

1492
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
It's legendary, it's powerful,

1493
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and it's throbbing constantly.

1494
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I would say that I, yeah,

1495
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
when it was hot during the summer,

1496
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I've got a little AC unit that I just left the window open

1497
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and I just didn't give a fuck about it.

1498
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I would just leave it open for days

1499
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and give a shit.

1500
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm on the second story, though, so that we'll probably...

1501
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I am...

1502
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm not going to answer this, actually.

1503
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah, definitely.

1504
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Whenever I can.

1505
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
This won't matter because he's not at this house anymore.

1506
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
But Digi used to not lock his doors,

1507
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
and it was the scariest fucking thing

1508
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
of my entire life.

1509
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
You know what I... I always think

1510
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
about this scene from Full Metal Jacket,

1511
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
which is where, you know,

1512
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Private Pile at Fat Motherfucker piece of shit,

1513
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
like he...

1514
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Whatever, Sergeant Gunnery, whatever,

1515
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
is reviewing there like...

1516
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
He's just reviewing the troops and whatever

1517
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
bootcamp for joining the Marines.

1518
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And he sees this fat piece of shit

1519
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
did not lock his footlocker.

1520
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And he just says, so matter of factly,

1521
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
like Private Pile,

1522
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
you stupid, stupid motherfucker,

1523
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
there is nothing I hate more in this world

1524
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
than an unlocked footlocker

1525
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
because if it weren't for people like you,

1526
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
there would be no thievery in this world.

1527
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Didn't you already say that in a different podcast?

1528
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Did I?

1529
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I probably did. It's one of my favorite lines ever, though,

1530
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
because I had not even considered the idea

1531
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
that like, what?

1532
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
People should be responsible for protecting their own things

1533
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
and we should accept the reality

1534
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
that human beings are generally self-interested

1535
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
so it's our responsibility to account for that

1536
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and to manage our ways through life

1537
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
considering that and facing fucking reality

1538
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
instead of a utopian ideal

1539
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
that isn't fucking real and never will be

1540
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and is a waste of time to imagine

1541
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
is the real way, where, where, where, where works?

1542
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
What the fuck?

1543
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And that's why Starfleet will never happen.

1544
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Starfleet could happen, we'll see.

1545
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's not as utopian as it seems, but okay.

1546
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
All right.

1547
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
What was the question again?

1548
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Do you lock your windows at night?

1549
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah, I always lock my door extensively.

1550
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I have, I have like three different locks

1551
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
on my fucking door.

1552
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I have a dead bull and I have the fucking normal lock

1553
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and then I have like that fucking

1554
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Shoryu thing at the top.

1555
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I hear you.

1556
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I don't want anyone to be able to get in or out.

1557
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm going to protect this really

1558
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
by not allowing myself to come out at night

1559
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
because I know I'm not going to be responsible.

1560
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
My, my doors and windows

1561
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
are all locked by elaborate

1562
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
point-and-click adventure game puzzles

1563
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
that I have to solve every time I leave

1564
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
and enter.

1565
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Keeps me on my toes.

1566
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Check out this guy, this like pizza guy

1567
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and this pizza box coffin I posted by the way.

1568
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Oh my god, Sans with boobs also.

1569
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I know, I love that.

1570
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Just to show people images.

1571
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Okay.

1572
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Yeah, let's save this image.

1573
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm going to put it on the screen.

1574
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Ben's not going to fucking do that.

1575
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
No, I'll do it.

1576
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I'll edit, I'll edit the thing.

1577
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Sounds good to me.

1578
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
There's too many images for it to be found.

1579
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
We really, we really have gone overboard

1580
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
with the fucking image posting this episode.

1581
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I didn't expect the images to be in the video.

1582
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It's just we just started posting aliens

1583
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
ahead of time to get ourselves psyched up

1584
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
for the right views.

1585
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Oh, how psyched we were.

1586
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Just to help you out.

1587
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
We're going to post our time stamp

1588
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
so you can kind of sync that up with the podcast

1589
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and help you find where they are.

1590
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
That'll save you some work.

1591
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Maybe.

1592
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Good thinking.

1593
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Okay, do you have a question from the...

1594
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Actually, wait, no, we didn't hear Tom and Mage's answers.

1595
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I'm curious.

1596
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Do you guys lock your doors at windows at night?

1597
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I have so much shit down here.

1598
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I don't trust anybody.

1599
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I don't trust the people I have to live with.

1600
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I don't trust any of you motherfuckers.

1601
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Agreed, neither do I. Very smart. What about you, Mage?

1602
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I trust people so much that I'm not going to answer this question

1603
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
because if anyone

1604
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
goes out at night

1605
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
and sees windows

1606
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
and if they see locked windows and open windows

1607
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
if they knew my answer

1608
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
they could narrow down which windows

1609
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
could potentially be mine.

1610
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So I'm not going to say.

1611
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That does reduce the significant amount of windows

1612
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
from the list of Mage's windows.

1613
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Oh, but now I know that you have windows.

1614
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's already narrowing down.

1615
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Well, that's a given.

1616
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
We all gave our answers and you're the most mysterious

1617
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
PCP member of all time

1618
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
even to other members.

1619
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
That's definitely true.

1620
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I like it. I think it's great.

1621
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Check out this question.

1622
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Here's a good one.

1623
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
If you're 15 to 16

1624
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
year old self

1625
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
saw how you look and act now

1626
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
where you are now, what would they say?

1627
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Let's start with Munchy.

1628
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
What if you were 16 years old again?

1629
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
What would you do?

1630
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I think the question was

1631
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
what would they say about where you are now?

1632
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
They'd probably say, wow, in two months

1633
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I'm going to be fucking rolling in it, bro.

1634
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah.

1635
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
They'd probably be like, wow, nothing's changed.

1636
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
He'd be so disappointed.

1637
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
He'd be so distraught.

1638
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You didn't even get that dank cyborg eye

1639
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
you've been hyping up your whole fucking civilization.

1640
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I didn't even get turned into a crystal skeleton

1641
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
and get to weeping legs.

1642
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
How about you, Gib?

1643
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
If you're 15 to 16 year old self saw you

1644
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
what would you think?

1645
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
How you look, how you act, what you're doing?

1646
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
He'd probably, well, let me think

1647
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
was I interested in like

1648
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
internet game review type people

1649
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
at the time, like 15, 16,

1650
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
maybe.

1651
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But I'd probably just be like

1652
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
unimpressed because I'm not like

1653
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
a super rock star at the time.

1654
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
What the fuck? The Beatles

1655
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
got big when in the 20s

1656
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
halfway through yet, bitch.

1657
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Kill yourself.

1658
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That's what he would say.

1659
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
But then I would say, grow up.

1660
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Jesus.

1661
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's not all about doing it immediately.

1662
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Yeah, silly boy. And then I would kill him

1663
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
and then I would start disappearing.

1664
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I know when I was

1665
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
15 to 16 I mostly

1666
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
spent all my time watching anime.

1667
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Specifically one, specifically

1668
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
like big long running shounens.

1669
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I just did that all day every day.

1670
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And I would definitely

1671
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
be happy about where

1672
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I am now, I think.

1673
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I mean, I'm saying this from the perspective of what I think that guy

1674
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
would say, but even back then

1675
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I wanted, I'm not that swole, but I wanted

1676
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
to be somewhat, so you know what, I'd be disappointed

1677
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
that I wasn't more fit, but I'm working on it.

1678
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I'm working on it.

1679
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
But he would be happy

1680
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
that I found my path in life

1681
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and am financially secure

1682
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and independent

1683
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and am achieving

1684
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
my personal dreams.

1685
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I think he would be very happy. I think he'd be happy about all those things.

1686
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I certainly am.

1687
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Let's look at some

1688
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Patreon questions.

1689
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Wait, after Mage and Tom made the question.

1690
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Keep forgetting them.

1691
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I'm trying to read these

1692
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and listen to you

1693
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
and also read these questions. Some of them are just

1694
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
like, I don't care.

1695
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Okay, hang on to that one.

1696
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Tom, Mage, what do you think?

1697
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I think

1698
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
my 16-year-old self would be like,

1699
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
good job losing the weight. I'm pretty fat.

1700
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Now you're not.

1701
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I cannot even imagine you being fat.

1702
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I know, it's crazy to think about.

1703
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It was a crazy time.

1704
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Let me tell you.

1705
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Those stairs, man.

1706
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
They scared me.

1707
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I told you.

1708
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'd be like, why the fuck haven't you

1709
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
finished your comic yet? You fuck.

1710
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But then I'd be like, oh, I can do 3D

1711
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
and I'd be like, whoa, holy shit, I want to do that

1712
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
but it seems so impossible right now.

1713
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Now you're doing it and I'd be like, I know.

1714
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You've finished a bunch of comics since then, though.

1715
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You finished a bunch of shit.

1716
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Scootaloo!

1717
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
To me, my comic is like

1718
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
a Shonen manga start to finish.

1719
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
That's all my ideas are.

1720
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I haven't done any yet.

1721
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
So it'd be like, you fucking hack.

1722
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Joan Vasquez never even had a real job

1723
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
right out of high school. He got J.T.H.M. published

1724
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
and we got famous. What the fuck is wrong with you?

1725
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Joan Vasquez is the guy who did all those

1726
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
weird puppet things you made

1727
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
to review about 100 years ago, right?

1728
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
No.

1729
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
No, he's the guy who did

1730
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
J.T.H.M. and Invader Zim.

1731
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah, that's right.

1732
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
No, that was M.Strange and he's a cool guy.

1733
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
He's what got me into 3D.

1734
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So I would be him.

1735
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
He's what converted me from a 2D

1736
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
being to a 3D being.

1737
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It was a big influence.

1738
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I'm waiting to find my idol that converts me

1739
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
to a 4D being.

1740
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I don't really transcend this mortal coil.

1741
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
How about you, Mage?

1742
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
What would your 15 to 16 year old self say?

1743
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Look at it now.

1744
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Well, immediately it would be the opposite

1745
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
of what Tom says. It would be like,

1746
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
oh, do you let yourself go, didn't you?

1747
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Oh, no!

1748
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I mean, not too much,

1749
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
but I would have preferred to be

1750
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
a different body type than I am now.

1751
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Still would.

1752
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Hit the squats, fam. Hit the squats.

1753
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yeah.

1754
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
She would probably be quite happy

1755
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
with what I'm doing right now

1756
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and would be slightly disappointed

1757
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
that I still haven't finished

1758
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
any comics yet, as well.

1759
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Because I actually did start a comic

1760
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
when I was 14 or so

1761
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and I sort of stopped doing it.

1762
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Maybe one day you and Phantom Horn

1763
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
will get back together and finish

1764
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
that old comic.

1765
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
We got to leap around.

1766
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
That was a hard no right there.

1767
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I know.

1768
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Right, here's a question

1769
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
from the Patreon Discord.

1770
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Patreon.com

1771
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Donate as we talk to you, for real.

1772
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
It's true, we do.

1773
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Even Bin Saint is here, unfortunately.

1774
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Don't tell them that.

1775
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
They'll leave.

1776
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Water says,

1777
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
what is your favorite thing

1778
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
another member on the PCP has created?

1779
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Oh, good question.

1780
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That is a fantastic question.

1781
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
The Vapors.

1782
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Excellent choice.

1783
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Chapter 2, specifically.

1784
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Chapter 2 is...

1785
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I like Chapter 1 better, I think.

1786
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's shorter but denser with good content, I think.

1787
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I don't know.

1788
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I gotta think. This is a tough one.

1789
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Who am I even going to pick?

1790
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I like a lot of old Digi contents.

1791
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Project Awesomeness.

1792
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I like a lot of that.

1793
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Dude, what the freak!

1794
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
My favorite line.

1795
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It's my favorite line of all time.

1796
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1797
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Yeah, I like old Digi Bros.

1798
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
The Dark Souls playthrough of Digi Bros. was nice.

1799
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
But that's not my favorite thing of all time.

1800
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
That's just pretty good.

1801
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I guess like Horseshoe Finale

1802
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
and the One Year Later Horseshoe Finale thing

1803
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
by Jesse Endless.

1804
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Jesse Endless.

1805
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Horseshoe Finale was great.

1806
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Yeah, okay. Horseshoe Finale is definitely great.

1807
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
The first thing I ever saw of Jesse's

1808
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
was kind of the most

1809
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
mind-blowing out of all.

1810
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Just because it was the first time I ever saw Jesse's

1811
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
shit and

1812
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
really fucked me up.

1813
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It was the

1814
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
review of the Crystal Castle,

1815
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Crystal Kingdom review,

1816
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
whatever. It's like it's Colt Corona

1817
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
doing a review of whatever. Crystal Empire.

1818
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Thank you. Thank you.

1819
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Brony Curious. Always good to have you on an episode.

1820
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I had another pony moment

1821
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
this morning too. I felt hot.

1822
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
What was it? Tell me about it.

1823
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I was in a chat

1824
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
and I have some art people

1825
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
in the chat and Cece was there. She was talking about

1826
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
the next season of RuPaul's Drag Race

1827
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
and one of the people on there was Trixie.

1828
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I just thought Trixie, Pony, because I didn't see

1829
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
the context of the conversation. Hell yeah.

1830
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'm never going to be cured. It's terminal.

1831
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah. Whenever I hear of President

1832
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
or First Lady Fluttershy, I'm always like

1833
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
oh wait, fuck it's not the pony. Shit.

1834
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I fucked it up again. She's not hot.

1835
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Dammit.

1836
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I was always confused

1837
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
when I type in rule 34

1838
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Trixie and I would get like Timmy Turner.

1839
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I didn't understand.

1840
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Now we're talking.

1841
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Now we're cooking with jazz.

1842
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
What else is great? I love

1843
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Brunswick that Ben made.

1844
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Brunswick is great.

1845
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Yeah, like Brunswick a lot.

1846
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I just love Gibbs content in general.

1847
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Yeah, I was going to say my favorite

1848
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
content is like the one little animation

1849
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Gibbs did with the glass of water.

1850
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Oh, the fish one.

1851
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Oh, of course.

1852
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
There's a fish at the door.

1853
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I watch both You've Got Chainmail

1854
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
and Pokemon Go miniscule review

1855
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
like every single day of my life.

1856
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You've Got Chainmail is a masterpiece.

1857
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
You've Got Chainmail is the best thing you've ever made.

1858
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm going to have a

1859
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
sequel at some point. You've got Platemail.

1860
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Oh, yeah.

1861
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Please. I can't wait.

1862
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I'm dying for it.

1863
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I like it all.

1864
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I like it all. It's all pretty good.

1865
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I don't know. I can't think of any

1866
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
specifics. I like Topten trampolines.

1867
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Topten reasons like a trampoline.

1868
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
That is a good one. The trampolines one is great.

1869
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I mean, one of my favorite videos

1870
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
of all time is like Anthony C's

1871
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
review of cancel out wedding.

1872
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
He's not up. Oh, I see.

1873
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Yeah, like they work together on it.

1874
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Invite Anthony C

1875
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
to the PCP. Press one if you want

1876
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Anthony C in the PCP member.

1877
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
And press two

1878
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
if you want Anthony C to be the only remaining

1879
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
PCP member immediately

1880
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
afterward.

1881
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Incredible.

1882
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
We couldn't have Anthony C in the PCP

1883
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
because every episode would be scripted.

1884
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
There would be a whole script that he would write. We'd all have to do.

1885
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
And that would be each episode.

1886
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Oh, is that a dig? Are you digging at him?

1887
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
That's funny. No, that wasn't a dig.

1888
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
That was a compliment to his

1889
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
insane work ethic. Oh, of course.

1890
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
OK, OK. Tom, I fucking love

1891
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
your low-poly 3D models

1892
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
you make of like stuff

1893
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
like the sushi you did

1894
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
and I think you did the sushi.

1895
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
The Cuphead famous.

1896
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Yeah, Cuphead was recent.

1897
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Like all the little cute

1898
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
PlayStation-y, PlayStation 1

1899
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
sort of things.

1900
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I love that. Tom, I

1901
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
have recently procured

1902
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
a desire to have sex with Cuphead.

1903
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
So I was hoping you could

1904
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
give me that model for my

1905
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
disgusting animations that I must do.

1906
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Frinter.

1907
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Exactly.

1908
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Fantastic.

1909
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I think some of my favorite stuff. I was going to say

1910
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Fisher the Door. That's definitely one of my favorite things.

1911
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
There's a legend. So fucking good.

1912
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Animate more hippo.

1913
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Fuck.

1914
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Yeah, just do all this work. I demand it for free.

1915
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
That's just the kind of guy I am.

1916
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I'll give you exposure.

1917
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I really

1918
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
liked best game ever. To the elements.

1919
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
When I strip you naked and put you on the fucking cold

1920
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
and then you'll be dead. There's your exposure.

1921
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Dumbass. Okay.

1922
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm calming down. I'm settling down.

1923
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I just tweeted something like that. There was like a comic strip

1924
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
that someone retweeted. It was like, hey, can I

1925
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
use this on my website? Oh, that's right.

1926
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And it's just like, my dad told me about exposure.

1927
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
That's what you die from in the desert.

1928
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Yeah, that's probably where I got the idea to

1929
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
steal it. Loki's stealing some jokes here.

1930
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Loki.

1931
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I like best game ever, Undertale. I thought that was really good.

1932
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Oh, no.

1933
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Oh, no, Tom. What have you done?

1934
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I love it. It actually is pretty good.

1935
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It is pretty good for what it is. I just like how

1936
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
you've ruined the game at the end. It's fantastic.

1937
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
If you fucking watch this

1938
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
and you play the game, guess what? I've ruined everything for you.

1939
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
You'll never experience your fag

1940
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
and kill yourself. That's the good part.

1941
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Because the reason I like that so much

1942
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
is like, I almost did

1943
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
watch it. But I'm like, no, I think I'm going to play Undertale

1944
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
at some point. So I'm not going to watch it. So I saved

1945
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
myself. I saved myself

1946
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
the horrible fate. And so it had

1947
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
some personal weight for me.

1948
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
The video is an interactive experience.

1949
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
It is. It is.

1950
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I like your

1951
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Gurren Lagoon Part 1

1952
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
and

1953
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
what was that other one?

1954
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
There's only a few. I'm trying to think of

1955
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
what it was. I know. I know. There's not that many.

1956
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
We Agua Episode 1

1957
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
about speed running

1958
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
is a masterpiece

1959
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
of vlog technology.

1960
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
No, there's nothing else. I've never done anything.

1961
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It's nothing else.

1962
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Something that's kind of recent

1963
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
that I really like. Phantom Reviews.

1964
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Phantom Reviews is great.

1965
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I agree. Mage, I was going to say

1966
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
something I liked from you was

1967
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
the transformation animation

1968
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
you did with your character.

1969
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh, the map fight.

1970
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Fucking great. The keyframing

1971
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
on that is so good.

1972
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
It's got punch to it. I like it.

1973
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Thank you.

1974
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
When you post that, I was like

1975
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
fuck, that's what I wanted.

1976
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
That's what I want.

1977
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I think

1978
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
the problem with Nightmare Moon Ark,

1979
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
the greatest video series

1980
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
ever made.

1981
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Pretty keen on that.

1982
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Oh, and my favorite thing

1983
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
from you, Munchy, is

1984
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
arm retrieval.

1985
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Oh, no!

1986
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
My favorite thing is Investigate.

1987
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Wait a minute.

1988
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I'm so sorry.

1989
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I go, like, three people here.

1990
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It's like, we'll do comics someday.

1991
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Someday.

1992
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Hey, man, they're tough.

1993
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I think we all know what the best creation

1994
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
of everybody in here is.

1995
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And it's clearly the Undertailer.

1996
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
The best creation any of us has ever made.

1997
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I got to give props to

1998
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
known member of the PCP, Toby Fox,

1999
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
for his creation of a little game you might know called Undertail.

2000
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
It's really gotten a lot of mileage

2001
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
here on this podcast.

2002
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yeah, Toby isn't a member of the PCP,

2003
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
but Undertail is.

2004
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
That's true. You're not wrong.

2005
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
You're not wrong.

2006
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Also, like,

2007
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
a while ago,

2008
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
you guys made the silly parody

2009
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
with the ponies

2010
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
where you all guys, like, switch cutie masters

2011
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
or something like that.

2012
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Oh, the cutie marker fossil.

2013
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
That's the stuff I was thinking about. It was because it was pony stuff.

2014
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Oh, right.

2015
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I forgot about those. That was, like, my passion project.

2016
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Yeah, it was pretty good.

2017
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And what a passion project was.

2018
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
It's not bad.

2019
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Anything involving

2020
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
T-Bap was incredible.

2021
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It is and slash was incredible.

2022
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Can you just define

2023
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
for me what it is?

2024
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You always talk about how you, like, like, define that for me.

2025
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
No, it's like, you always said

2026
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
that you like the aesthetic of T-Bap,

2027
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
or, like, you like the chemistry

2028
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
that was, like, that good.

2029
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I've never known what the fuck that means,

2030
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
because I'm like an idiot on the piece,

2031
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
you know, because, like,

2032
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
before I learned how to fucking talk,

2033
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
well, the piece of me as well, but on T-Bap.

2034
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Like, I listen back to, like, the things I used to say

2035
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
and the arguments I would make about the show,

2036
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and I'm just like, Jesus Christ, none of this is good.

2037
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I disagree with that.

2038
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I think there was some good shit there.

2039
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
First of all, I think there was good shit,

2040
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
but that's not the reason.

2041
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I don't care about the actual subject matter

2042
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
or the actual conversation going on.

2043
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I care about the meta elements

2044
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
at play within T-Bap,

2045
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
the most important thing

2046
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
in my entire life.

2047
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I care about the professionality

2048
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and, like, how much effort was put

2049
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
into this, like, thing that does not need

2050
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
any effort put into it.

2051
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Just, like, a basic podcast made about the show.

2052
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
But the way there was a lot of, you know,

2053
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
pony expressions been made

2054
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
far more than it was usually made

2055
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
for those types of things,

2056
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
as well as just custom things made for each episode.

2057
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
There's that one where you guys were fucking

2058
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
in the night uniforms.

2059
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
All this different sort of shit going on

2060
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
that didn't have to be made whatsoever.

2061
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And it all added to the experience,

2062
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
as well as intros, which were so far and above

2063
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
beyond what anyone was saying.

2064
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
It's just perfect, because it's so easily digestible,

2065
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
because there are just, like, keynotes and stuff.

2066
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And everyone's on this, like,

2067
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
this, like, pre-planned path.

2068
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
That's super easy. There's a table of contents for everything.

2069
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It's super easy to digest.

2070
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
However, it's so fluthy.

2071
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's just, like...

2072
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It's just, like, you're on a bus stop, and you're going to each stop.

2073
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
You don't know exactly what's at stop,

2074
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
but you have, like, a basic plan for each one.

2075
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
So you're still, like, free-flowing,

2076
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
and you can, like, kind of decide what to do

2077
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
at each given moment.

2078
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And the conversation is still, like, natural and free-flowing,

2079
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
but it's still easily digestible.

2080
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And just the entire aesthetic of it being,

2081
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
you know, this fucking cool thing

2082
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
that you have to put actual effort into

2083
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
moving the pony. And it's not a lot of work,

2084
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
but you just have to move the pony mouths and stuff.

2085
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And there's just a lot of stuff going on.

2086
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And Phantom Reviews and Keg Reviews are fucking incredible.

2087
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And they have so much work in problem

2088
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
with fucking, like, musical segments. It's incredible.

2089
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
That's right. They're legendary.

2090
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
There's so much lore, too, driven in to just these simple reviews.

2091
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It's just, like, you and Ben have a really good dynamic

2092
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
just in general. Yeah, too.

2093
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Because, like, when we would drive to BronyCon,

2094
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
you guys would just get into these heated discussions

2095
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
about everything, and I'd just be in the backseat listening,

2096
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
and I'd just be like, I just got a bonus episode of T-Bab.

2097
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
That's just how you talk.

2098
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And it's a good dynamic.

2099
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Well, that's cool. Thanks for sucking my dicks, fam.

2100
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Yeah, no problem. All my myriad dicks.

2101
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
That'll be 50 bucks.

2102
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Pay Pal now, please.

2103
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Hey, here we go.

2104
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
AtBelity998 asks,

2105
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
if you could create one new law for America,

2106
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
what would it be?

2107
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Munchy?

2108
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
No more ghosts.

2109
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I'm tired of them.

2110
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
We got to get them all out.

2111
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Like, whenever someone dies, just get, like, a vacuum near them.

2112
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Just suck them all up and send them off

2113
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
to us, outsource them to China, do something with them.

2114
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I'm tired of bumping into them on the streets.

2115
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I'm trying to, I'm sorry.

2116
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I'm so getting sick and tired of my Indian

2117
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
drink catcher being clogged up

2118
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
with all the spirits and ghouls constantly

2119
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
after change every single day.

2120
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I hate it. No more ghosts.

2121
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
We got to give ICE the necessary tools

2122
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
they need to deport all these fucking ghosts

2123
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
back to where they came from. The fucking, the fucking grave.

2124
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Right back to the fucking...

2125
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Well, we have to give ICE the necessary tools

2126
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
to get all these ghosts out of our fucking property.

2127
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
No, they need, we need to give ICE

2128
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
the necessary tools to get these ghosts out of our fucking bodies

2129
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
by killing all of us.

2130
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Yeah.

2131
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Hashtag give ISIS nukes.

2132
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Let's make it happen everybody.

2133
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Official sponsor of the PCP ISIS.

2134
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Official PCP partner

2135
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
of ISIS.

2136
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Fucking ISIS.

2137
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
PCP ISIS, they're both letters.

2138
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Oh no!

2139
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
He did it. It's so true.

2140
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It's so true.

2141
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
What even was the question?

2142
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
What law would you make?

2143
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
What law would you make real, if you could?

2144
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
A Trafalgar Dealer.

2145
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Oh no, that's the worst one.

2146
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
By the way, I don't know if I mentioned this,

2147
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
but it just so happens that my guy

2148
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
work with at work,

2149
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
he has like, whatever,

2150
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
he just joined, he's like an intern or something,

2151
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
but he has a little heart pirates logo

2152
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
as his chat icon

2153
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
in our work chat, and it just every day

2154
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
it makes me want to die.

2155
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
He's a cool guy though, and we talk about one piece,

2156
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
so he's an idiot, and he should be

2157
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
purged from existence, he should be

2158
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
eviscerated.

2159
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Indeed, hopefully he doesn't listen to this.

2160
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
We'll see.

2161
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I will be fired, I will be fired.

2162
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
It will be all up to me.

2163
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
If that's what gets you fired from the PCP,

2164
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I know right, I know right.

2165
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Out of everything that's been said,

2166
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
you have some good job security.

2167
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I think we've had the name

2168
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Washington DC for too long.

2169
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Here's my new proposal, Mecca 2.

2170
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
The second, the second Mecca 2.

2171
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I think that's kind of what we like it or not.

2172
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Aka London, London Mecca 2.

2173
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
It's happening.

2174
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Okay, hang on, I want to read,

2175
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
a quick shout out to

2176
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
hashtag worst question of the week

2177
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
at Gabriel underscore freak.

2178
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
You're getting a shout out, my dude.

2179
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
What is the best thing for the members

2180
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
of the TPC?

2181
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
First of all, he said the TPC.

2182
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So you fucked up right there, my dude.

2183
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And what's the best thing?

2184
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
That question is too fucking vague.

2185
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Otaku freak Gabriel

2186
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
to use your full name.

2187
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Oh, you should feel ashamed of yourself.

2188
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
This is a disappointment.

2189
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm just kidding dude, you're fine.

2190
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
He was about to pledge us $50.

2191
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Oh, I fucked up. Gabriel, forgive me.

2192
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
The best thing about the PCP

2193
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
is spending time with all my buddies.

2194
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
No, that's...

2195
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
This gay is not allowed.

2196
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
The best thing about it is

2197
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
the paycheck.

2198
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
He's right.

2199
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Can't argue with that.

2200
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Speaking of paycheck, why are you asking that?

2201
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I thought the question was

2202
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
what is the best thing

2203
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
for members of the...

2204
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It's not even about the PCB.

2205
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
What is the best thing for each of us?

2206
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
The best thing for me...

2207
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
A very small...

2208
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Okay, Lego.

2209
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Lego and Minecraft combined.

2210
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
A very small roll.

2211
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
You get rolled up.

2212
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
You get rolled up hardcore.

2213
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You get twisted.

2214
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
That's the best thing to happen.

2215
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Dude, how many times have you rolled into your duvet

2216
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
and become a worm?

2217
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Many, many times.

2218
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Dude, it's a tradition.

2219
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I think I said this before, everyone in Thanksgiving

2220
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I turn my shirt into pants

2221
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and I wear my pants as a shirt.

2222
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
That's the best thing for me.

2223
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Tom, were you saying something?

2224
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
No, I was just confirming

2225
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
that that story is indeed on the books.

2226
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Oh, yes.

2227
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I don't know what the fuck is the best thing.

2228
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I love my...

2229
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
My Nintendo Switch.

2230
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
My Nintendo Switch.

2231
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
See, I hate this question.

2232
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I fucking hate you, Gabriel.

2233
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
My favorite thing is my Surface Pro

2234
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
because it's a computer and a tablet

2235
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
at the same time, so you can draw on it,

2236
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
you can read manga on it really easy,

2237
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
you can do actual work,

2238
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
computer work with it,

2239
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and it's like a pound and a half,

2240
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
so it's super light, you can take it anywhere.

2241
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh, wait, I got it.

2242
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's the best computing device of all time.

2243
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Excellent.

2244
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
My actual best thing,

2245
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
the best thing for me is

2246
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
when my computer does not just blue screen and turn off.

2247
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's all the times it's not doing that.

2248
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It's the best thing for me, without a doubt.

2249
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Guy ever!

2250
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Oh!

2251
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
It's been saved.

2252
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Oh, no.

2253
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Munchie's out of the piece.

2254
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Even though I said it.

2255
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Any other questions to the fan chat?

2256
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
We're getting close to the end here.

2257
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
The fan chat questions are all terrible.

2258
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I have a question for you, fan chat.

2259
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Can you make better questions?

2260
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You're paying money for this.

2261
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Who's the best dancer in the PCP?

2262
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
They have money, but they don't have wit.

2263
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
That's for sure.

2264
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
They replace it.

2265
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
How all women who are attractive are 0 out of 10 intelligence,

2266
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
by default.

2267
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Dude, I know that. Hardcore.

2268
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It's okay, we like it that way.

2269
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
If you had to choose between money and wit,

2270
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
we'd definitely appreciate your money.

2271
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Agreed.

2272
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Tell you what, here's one more question.

2273
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
At Ramon1234 asks,

2274
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
what is the most time-consuming element

2275
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
of each of your jobs?

2276
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I don't know if it means like PCP,

2277
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
or getting ice,

2278
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
or the fact that ice tries to deport you all the time

2279
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
for being an alien,

2280
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
an illegal alien,

2281
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
violating the sanctity of the American Constitution

2282
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
by being here.

2283
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I'm assuming it's that.

2284
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I would say that the most time-consuming

2285
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
part of my job

2286
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
is the writing of the script,

2287
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
because

2288
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
it takes a while to decide

2289
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
on when it's done

2290
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
and how good it is.

2291
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Recording and editing.

2292
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Actually, no, it's writing slash recording.

2293
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Editing is fine.

2294
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I can do that fine.

2295
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
It may take longer,

2296
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
but there's less time where I'm just fucking around.

2297
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Like, I can just do it when I do it.

2298
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And for writing, a lot of the time,

2299
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I'm just sitting there and I don't know what I'm doing.

2300
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And I'm clicking, clacking at the keyboard

2301
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
and I'm deleting my, you know, my

2302
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Internet system 32,

2303
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
you know, some 64, whatever.

2304
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
The most time-consuming thing about my job

2305
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
is whenever I have to press keys

2306
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
on my keyboard.

2307
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
When I record and when I draw, it's super easy

2308
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and I can't get it done really fast.

2309
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But if I have to, like, press down letters

2310
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
or accumulate

2311
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
exclamation points,

2312
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
then we're going to have real problems.

2313
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
We're going to have some real major problems.

2314
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
That's going to be the end of my band

2315
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
by, like, accumulate exclamation points.

2316
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
That's not bad.

2317
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
The most time-consuming thing

2318
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
is editing. I hate it.

2319
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And it's doubly time-consuming because it takes

2320
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
long time and I also hate it.

2321
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So I procrastinate on doing it.

2322
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
That sucks balls.

2323
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
The most time-consuming thing with 3D

2324
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
is UV unwrapping.

2325
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That's the most time-consuming thing ever.

2326
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's when you take the 3D model once it's done

2327
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and you have to, like, put seams in it

2328
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
and flatten it out like a paper-craft doll

2329
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
kind of flattens out so you can put the texture on it.

2330
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
It's really hard because I'm stupid.

2331
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Interesting.

2332
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Yeah, those both suck balls and I hate it.

2333
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
That's not just really hard because you're stupid.

2334
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
That's just really hard because I can't wrap my head

2335
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
around it when I try to do it.

2336
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
You can't wrap your head around unwrapping

2337
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
the...

2338
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
That's why I said that.

2339
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That was very good.

2340
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I think that would agree with Gib.

2341
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Oh, Midge, go ahead.

2342
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Yeah, the most time-consuming thing for me though

2343
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
is drawing everything out

2344
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
because I do the animation.

2345
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
No, no, no, like drawing everything,

2346
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
every single panel, stuff like that.

2347
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Midge, how about that foreshortening, though?

2348
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Foreshortening.

2349
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Foreshortening's fun.

2350
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Guys, I gotta tell you, foreshortening

2351
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
is a pain for sure.

2352
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
That's a wrap, guys.

2353
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Someone made that joke like a week ago

2354
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
and I've been wanting to use it ever since.

2355
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Do you feel like Midge just steals jokes

2356
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
and that's what he does and that's why he's famous?

2357
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
No, no, no. I misspoke.

2358
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Like, someone said the word foreshortening

2359
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
and I've been wanting to make that joke.

2360
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

2361
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
That's the truth for sure.

2362
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
See, I just did what you did.

2363
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I stole your joke.

2364
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
You stole my fucking...

2365
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Okay, well, I agree with Gib here

2366
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
so it might not even be the longest process

2367
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
because editing does take me a long time,

2368
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
but specifically,

2369
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
and I've worked on improving that,

2370
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
but the writing process,

2371
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
okay, well with Weagua, which is what I'm doing now,

2372
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
nothing takes any time

2373
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
and the thing that takes the most time with that

2374
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
is just once I've recorded, I have to edit it

2375
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
and that, for sure, takes the majority of the time.

2376
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Once all the footage is captured,

2377
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
putting it down, putting in the timelines,

2378
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
doing the color correction, syncing up the audio,

2379
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
et cetera, et cetera.

2380
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
That's not Weagua, but the real

2381
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
bane of my existence is not Weagua

2382
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
because I can bust that out fairly simple.

2383
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
In the bigger videos,

2384
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
my larger projects,

2385
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
it's the phase

2386
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
to get the script together.

2387
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
So all the research,

2388
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
all the planning, all that kind of stuff

2389
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
in order to produce the script.

2390
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Once I have the script, which I do now, incidentally,

2391
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
then it's easy mode.

2392
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Then I just record it, edit,

2393
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
oh, it's fucking, it's simple.

2394
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
It's not required anymore. It just happens.

2395
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Like a Weagua does.

2396
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's everything about preparing the project.

2397
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It's where both the time investment,

2398
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
because A, procrastinating,

2399
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
and the combination with not knowing what the fuck to say

2400
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and having to sit there and think about it,

2401
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
that's the hard shit.

2402
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And I'm hoping to get better at it as I go along.

2403
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
But that's my bane of my existence,

2404
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
for sure.

2405
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I'm pissing into my own rug right now.

2406
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
My dude, Elias.

2407
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
You're on me.

2408
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
What do you got, Munch?

2409
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I've said enough about aliens.

2410
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I love them.

2411
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I love them too.

2412
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
They are my friends. They are my friends.

2413
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Is there a person in here who doesn't believe

2414
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
that aliens are friends?

2415
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Right now, we're gonna decide the PCP,

2416
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
we're gonna contact Nasta.

2417
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Are aliens friends or foes?

2418
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
We decide right now. I vote friends.

2419
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Dude, why the fuck is there not an alien

2420
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
type in Pokemon?

2421
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Oh, that's...

2422
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Actually, there's deoxys.

2423
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
There's Clefairy.

2424
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
What else do we got?

2425
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Jirachi, I think, is from the stars.

2426
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Yeah, Jirachi.

2427
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Requies us from outside the atmosphere, I think.

2428
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
That counts. He's green.

2429
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Yeah, he's green.

2430
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
All aliens are Pokemon.

2431
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Wait, isn't Starmie canonically

2432
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
from Outer Space or something?

2433
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I think he is.

2434
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Alright, that's enough right there.

2435
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Maybe Pokemon Uranium addresses this massive flaw.

2436
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I think Pokemon Uranium should get annihilated

2437
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
because it wasn't made by Nintendo

2438
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
or it shouldn't exist.

2439
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Hashtag DCMA, or have you say it,

2440
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
is perfect.

2441
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
My favorite thing.

2442
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Hashtag legalized DCMA.

2443
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
We gotta legalize it, everybody.

2444
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Make it happen.

2445
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I think we're all set.

2446
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Anybody final points or anybody?

2447
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Kirby's my best alien friend.

2448
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Oh, he's a good alien.

2449
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
He is. And the most powerful.

2450
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
If you plant it in half, if you look at him sideways,

2451
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
he doesn't give a fuck about anything.

2452
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Lilo and Stitch,

2453
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
don't let Hawaii

2454
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
be abducted.

2455
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Stop it!

2456
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Okay.

2457
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Yeah, just letting it happen.

2458
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It's very irresponsible.

2459
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I don't know what's their

2460
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
angle.

2461
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
My closing.

2462
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Oh yeah, go ahead, Mage.

2463
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
What if we are descendants of aliens?

2464
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Oh, I was gonna talk about that.

2465
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
There was a great episode of Ancient Aliens.

2466
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
It was a great episode of Ancient Aliens

2467
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
where they're talking about aliens and Bigfoot.

2468
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Because that's the thrust of the show.

2469
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
It's always aliens and something.

2470
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
And so there was an episode, Aliens and Bigfoot,

2471
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
and they're talking about how Bigfoot was an alien.

2472
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
But then they're like, no.

2473
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
What if, okay,

2474
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
that aliens, they're never depicted

2475
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
with any fur.

2476
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Bigfoot has fur.

2477
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
What if Bigfoot was like

2478
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
a species that existed on Earth

2479
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
and then they genetically modified them

2480
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
and they became humans.

2481
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
So we're genetically modified Bigfoot's.

2482
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And the Bigfoot's that exist now

2483
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
are the natural evolution of species on this planet.

2484
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And we've been modified by aliens.

2485
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Of course. That makes sense.

2486
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And they're like, is it possible?

2487
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Maybe!

2488
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Why the fuck couldn't they just say,

2489
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
instead of Bigfoot, just say Gorillaz?

2490
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Because Bigfoot is

2491
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
the missing link between

2492
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
between Gorillaz

2493
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
and humans.

2494
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Everyone needs to watch the Aliens.

2495
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
It's going to elevate your Christ consciousness.

2496
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
You're going to become aware of everything.

2497
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Do I need to watch?

2498
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Do I need to see Indiana Jones

2499
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
in the fourth one?

2500
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
That's like their movie.

2501
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
And they gave it a budget.

2502
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Things got weird.

2503
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
It definitely has its charm on TV instead.

2504
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
As we all know,

2505
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
this is not to discriminate or discredit.

2506
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
But as we all know,

2507
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
the Hebrews are aliens and they came

2508
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
to Limeria

2509
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
in our mid-evolution cycle.

2510
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
And they sort of assimilated themselves.

2511
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
But technically,

2512
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
all Jews are aliens.

2513
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Just throwing that out there.

2514
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
The Jews are the ultimate vagina aliens.

2515
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
You know, to drop a little

2516
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
truth bomb here,

2517
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
the current science

2518
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
is inconclusive

2519
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
as to exactly how

2520
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
the Jews are human.

2521
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
No, it's okay.

2522
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
To whoever's point it was,

2523
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
maybe it was a major.

2524
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I took a geology class

2525
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
to finish my degree last year

2526
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
or something.

2527
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
There was currently

2528
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
biology.

2529
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
There was no known way

2530
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
that the base amino acids

2531
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
that make up the proteins

2532
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
that cells in most species

2533
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
all organisms depend on

2534
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
in order to function.

2535
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
The thought right now is that amino acids

2536
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
were synthesized outside of the planet

2537
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
and then arrived here later

2538
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
after it had already turned into

2539
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
a fucking planet toyed with shit.

2540
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And then it just from that collision

2541
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
as meteors hit here and brought the amino acids here,

2542
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
they slowly collected and eventually

2543
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
formed life.

2544
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Technically, you can say

2545
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
everything in the universe is from space

2546
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
because we're all in space.

2547
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
We're all from space rocks and shit.

2548
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
The theory is we're all technically Martians

2549
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
because they believe it came from Mars.

2550
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
How did they get here from Mars though?

2551
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Was there like an explosion or something?

2552
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Like a meteor impact or something like that.

2553
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
There was a whole big presentation

2554
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
on it because

2555
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I guess Mars at the time

2556
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
had the conditions necessary

2557
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
to create those amino acids.

2558
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
That would explain the dafty duck

2559
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
with no mouth guide for Mars

2560
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
in Looney Tunes.

2561
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Yeah.

2562
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
He totally explained him.

2563
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Dude, what if the planet of the apes

2564
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
was an Earth

2565
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
and the apes were on a different planet

2566
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
and that was their planet of the apes

2567
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
and then they continued to be apes in charge

2568
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
and then they grew their technology

2569
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
and they made spaceships, they came to Earth

2570
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
and then they turned into humans over many years.

2571
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
You're describing literally

2572
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
the plot of Final Fantasy X.

2573
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
That is literally what happens

2574
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
in Final Fantasy X.

2575
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Spoiler.

2576
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
That's what happens in Final Fantasy X too

2577
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I should clarify.

2578
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
That's where the shit gets real.

2579
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Alright everybody.

2580
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I assume they don't offer that one as well.

2581
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Of course, that's the only way they know how.

2582
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Alright everybody, that's it. Thank God.

2583
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Okay, let's do our plugs here everybody.

2584
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Alright, everybody.

2585
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Don't smoke.

2586
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Don't smoke but go to patreon.com

2587
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
the procrastinators.

2588
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
If you've got discords,

2589
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
pledge some money, be in our discords

2590
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
where we actually hang out and talk to people.

2591
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
We do.

2592
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
You'll get the fuck right in there if you pledge

2593
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
one fucking dollar.

2594
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Slide right the fuck in bro.

2595
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
If you pledge $5 though,

2596
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
that's $5 per episode of the PCP

2597
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
you get access to the bonus episodes

2598
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
of which I believe there are seven now.

2599
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
There are seven that exist now, I think.

2600
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
And the last one is a fucking doozy.

2601
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
We're getting ready to record another one

2602
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
that's coming up. It'll be out.

2603
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
We're trying to get out the first of the month

2604
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
and so that's when you see that shit

2605
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
a couple days.

2606
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
We got some merch.

2607
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
We got some PCP merch down below.

2608
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
We actually just added some more to our red bubble page

2609
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
with a bunch of fucking stickers.

2610
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
You goddamn cheap motherfucker.

2611
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Buy them all.

2612
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Stop advertising that corporate

2613
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
bullshitcompanyapple.com

2614
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
on the front of your MacBook.

2615
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Slap a PCP logo

2616
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
PCP member.

2617
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
This machine kills fascists.

2618
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
This machine promotes fascism

2619
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
with the PCP sticker on it.

2620
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Hell yeah, go on Gil.

2621
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
There's a sticker for each of us.

2622
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
They're all drawn by Mage.

2623
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Me and Tom are kind of stuck together though.

2624
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
We're going to be keeping track

2625
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
of all the ones you buy

2626
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
so we'll know who the most popular PCP member is

2627
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
and then we'll kill that person

2628
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
so I can be the most pop.

2629
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
What if you're the most?

2630
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Tom, we're stuck together

2631
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
so we'll never know who is the most.

2632
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It'll be me and Mage the podcast.

2633
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
The best podcast of all time.

2634
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
And also, there is a t-shirt as well.

2635
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
A t-shirt designed

2636
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
by someone.

2637
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I forget his name.

2638
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Edward D. Al.

2639
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
That's the guy.

2640
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Guys, I just realized.

2641
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I confirm the aliens are real.

2642
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
The procrastinators, TPC,

2643
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
the podcast creators

2644
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
that's also the same

2645
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
initial TPC

2646
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
the podcast creators.

2647
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Get it? Because we create podcasts.

2648
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
What's that going to do with aliens?

2649
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I don't know anything

2650
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
about what the fuck you're talking about right now.

2651
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Because they're the same letters?

2652
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
What are letters?

2653
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
We need to go back to square one here.

2654
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Dumb podcast creators.

2655
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
When we made

2656
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
when you said the name.

2657
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
You fucked it up dude.

2658
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
You had to say the people creators.

2659
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
No!

2660
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
See, that would have made sense.

2661
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
That would have made sense.

2662
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Well, so we got, is there anything else to shill?

2663
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Follow us at TPCrastinators on Twitter

2664
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
so that you can send me your questions.

2665
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
We mostly look at the fan chat these days.

2666
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
But if you also want to just send questions

2667
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
on the Twitter as well and we record on Saturdays

2668
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
you can do that too.

2669
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
So keep an eye out for that.

2670
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Can I show my Patreon?

2671
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Can you show your Patreon?

2672
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
No, absolutely not. That's not what this is for.

2673
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
None of us shill our Patreon.

2674
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
God damn it.

2675
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Well, maybe you should.

2676
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Well, okay, let's re-evaluate this policy.

2677
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Okay, everyone, Mage has a Patreon.

2678
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Now you know.

2679
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
If you want to be a dirty bent saint.

2680
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I just want everyone to look

2681
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
at the tears because I made some cute doodles

2682
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
for the tears.

2683
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Okay, duly noted.

2684
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Go to her Patreon if you're gay

2685
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000

2686
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000

01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Oh, Ben's actually going to get money from this.

2693
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Fuck you, Ben. Alright, that's it.

2694
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000

01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Everyone, it's time to say

01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000

2705
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Yeah.

2706
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000

2707
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000

2708
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000

But I'm not working, I'm doing nothing

2713
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:24,800
