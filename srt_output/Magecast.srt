Hello and welcome to the first and only ever Magecast! I'm your host, Mage, and I'm joined

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,460
today by Mage. Say hi, Mage! Hi! So, the topic for today is actually a YouTube user we both

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,000
are very familiar with. Her channel is Little Aurora, Mage, but that's a mouthful, so we're

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,060
just gonna call her Mage, because it's faster that way. Indeed! Anyway, so a bit about her.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,520
We know that she joined YouTube in 2013, but this isn't her first account, isn't that

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,960
right, Mage? Why, yes. I know for a fact that she has had several YouTube accounts

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,860
over the years, but they were all abandoned when she grew out of the content she had made

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,020
on them. One of her first videos on YouTube was actually a crappy Naruto AMV, I believe.

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,320
She made several of those? Yikes, I built from that ship too, had I been her. But that's

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
all in the past, let us look at what she has been up to in the more recent years. But not

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,920
to every sin, let's start off by looking at her Magnum Opus, the critically acclaimed

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,760
collaboration video from way back when she did pony stuff. The lethal Halloween. Pony

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,320
stuff? Yeah, my little pony stuff, she used to review it. I don't see those videos on

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,400
her channel anymore. Oh, they're just unlisted, just go to her playlist on Mage page. Oh,

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,600
I see. Bit back to the half an hour long product of love and labor. But doesn't she hate that

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,080
video? What? Yeah, she keeps frequently telling people how much she hates it now. Any reasons

17
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,720
as to why? Uh, because it sucks? But Magnum Opus? No, she never claimed it to be. Frankly,

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,480
I can see why. The script is terrible, the voice acting often lacks direction and she

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,000
was too timid to ask people to redo their lines when she thought they didn't sound

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
right. Oh, let's not forget the main premise is just a rip-off of Danganronpa, a game and

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,040
anime series. The art? It's good though. Just barely holds up. Things got rushed there

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,000
at the end too, as she was late to post it on Halloween. Took her months to pull all

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,800
this together. Well, uh, we can still talk about it anyway. Yeah, sure, I guess. Well,

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,760
fun trivia. All the people who participated in this collaboration were politely asked to

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,080
make little videos to link back to this project. Most of them were little skits about how they

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,120
got kidnapped from their channels. Inkrowse had to pull hers down though due to the majority

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,800
of her audience being little kids who got scared by the collaboration video. Seriously. Yeah,

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,200
NKP never put hers up to begin with. At first she said she was just late but then she just

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,080
met. Oh, that's Rich, coming from a person who later asked people who featured for a

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,320
weapon of two seconds in an animation she did, didn't even animate to upload linkbacks

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,360
to her project. Yeah, funny that. So, this was back in her pony days. Three, four years

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,720
ago? Why does she up to now? Means. What? Means. Animation means to be precise. What

33
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,760
are those? Oh, people take snippets from a song and animate a character dancing to it.

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,080
I use the term animate loosely here as some settle for flipping an image or peg just a

35
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,200
slideshow. That sounds lazy. Sure is mage, but mage's animations are not that thankfully.

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Hers take literally days to complete because instead of learning how to use a proper animation

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,240
program like a sane person, she draws everything on Psy and saves each and every individual

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,760
frame separately as a PNG to later be edited in a video editing program that is not made

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,480
to cater to animation makings. To top it all off, she has no clue on how to do fancy

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,240
effects on the video editing program. Nice. But yeah, so, final words on her channel?

41
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:28,120
Uh, give her a 2 out of 10. Needs more edge. What about you? I give her a U-Try Gold Star.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,640
Good luck in the future, mage. Hope you actually do fucking work instead of procrastinating

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,880
by doing stupid things no one asked for. Well anyway, time to wrap this up. Thank you for

44
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,640
joining me, mage. You too, mage. It was nice. I hope to never do this again with you. Me

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,400
too, mage. Me too. If I never see your face again, it'll be too soon.
