00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're riding on the internet. Cyberspace set free. Hello virtual reality. Interactive appetite. Searching for a website. A window to the world. Got to get online.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take a spin now you're in with a techno set. You're going surfing on the internet.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. How are you doing? How are you doing Munchy? How are you doing?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I cannot think of a single worse thing than having only one layer of flesh.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Tom, what's going on with you dude?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I like Chuck and Cheezus.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah we do. Hippocrit, what's up?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For all my social media things, follow all those right now, bitch.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
God damn. Please follow me at atchuckiecheez.com.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, also my Chuckie Cheez account is to be announced.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, we're here to promote our new Chuckie Cheez social media platform that we're getting into. Endless Jess of course is here as well.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Guys, it's me. Five nights at Freddy's. Who let that faggot Chuckie Cheez in here? Where's that fucking, I hate Chuckie Cheez for anything.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You fucking bitch, I'm gonna crack your fucking skull in.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm the only mascot pizza parlor for kids, children place around here. This is only big enough for one.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You're a fucking poser. You're a fucking poser. I'm haunted. You're not even haunted. You're not even fucking haunted.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm haunted with the good times that all of us have.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're wholesome and you suck.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're a gay mouse. You're a gay little mouse faggot bitch.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're a little bitch. All right, all right guys. I'm a sentimental bitch. What can I say?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Fuck your pizza and fuck you.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Guys, break it up. We gotta save this for the bonus episode which you can purchase on patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yep, yep, Freddy Fazbear versus Chuckie Cheez. There it'll be. That's what this month is gonna be. Good job, good job.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Guys, everyone shake hands. It'll print money basically.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm not Freddy Fazbear. I'm five minutes at Freddy's. That's my legal name.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, it's great to have you here as always. So, he's gonna be a regular folks.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So, today we're talking about social media. Social media. So let's see what the old urban dictionaries say about that shit.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Social media. Online networks where both adolescents and young adults go to express one of two statements.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
One, I'm complaining about my boring shitty life used as an alternative to actually making life interesting.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And two, look how superior my boring shitty life is to your boring shitty life.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Used to passively belittle the only 250 people the individual knows.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You know, Nate, one time I want you to go to Urban Dictionary to find that the definition is literally just the word gay and read that.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It just be so much funnier. So much more engaging to me personally.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So much more sentimental. One day. I hope we get there someday.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, our world is controlled by social media, right? We're all slaves to it. There's no escaping it.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've noticed at this point in the way the world works now, all the building stuff is mostly done.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The hard lifting and building and putting together stuff is done.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And now it's about optimizing strats, you know what I mean? It's about optimizing what you can squeeze out of the other people around you.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And that's kind of what social media is. It's about manipulating people to be into your shit for good or ill.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it's pretty good. Big fan. I like it. I do it. I do it.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, you mean that from the perspective of a content creator trying to spread things. It's not just that.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's also a place for people to subscribe to youtube.com slash patreon.com slash Ben St.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And various other things. I like it. It's pretty good. It's the way of the future.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I hate Facebook. Facebook sucks.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It doesn't make any dollars that they give to me. And therefore, what's good are they?

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But then again, if you were a mod, then you'd be doing it for free.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mod VP guys, did you ever hear about that one social media platform called www.4chan.com?

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's really funny guys. It really makes me feel happy. I like to talk about games I've never played before and make fun of them.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Should we define exactly what we're going to talk about?

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Are we talking about the platform or are we talking about our experiences with using it as a content creator to spread our message?

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't even know. I don't talk about the worth of it and specific websites individually.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who do you think wins in a fight, like a cancer fight between anime avatars on Twitter and religious relatives on Facebook?

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Religious relatives all the time.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They own the power to be real people.

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They're real people whereas the anime avatar people are whiny.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to say the anime avatar people because there's literally no end to them.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The religious family members, if you block enough of them, you'll run out of family members.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But the anime avatars, they just keep coming. You squash one and fifty more take their place.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Every second around the world fifty million anime avatars are born.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And you can stop this if you dial this 1-800 number for 1-800 anime avatar genocide to kill them all in their homes while their parents watch them with a gun and a sword.

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
588 ChuckieCheese.com

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please donate to ChuckieCheese.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
ChuckieCheese will come into these people's houses and he'll show them who's the original scary.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Scariest than Five Nights at Freddy. He'll jump out at them with a sword and a knife.

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:19,000
They have to do that. What if we just, you know, bite the bullet and talk to our religious family members and tell them that all these anime avatars are like atheists and against God and then they'll take their guns and kill them themselves.

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh my God. All the division from all of your friends and family on Facebook.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If only they knew about the anime avatars on Twitter that could band together and it would all be good again.

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It'd be just like the ending of Watchmen where they, you know, we save the infighting between humanity by giving them a greater evil enemy.

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes. In order to fix one social media platform you have to band them together against a different social media platform.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's the perfect scheme and it'll never fail. There's no way it can backfire.

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That actually got that. That actually is really good because that reminded me of something.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The other day I was thinking about how I'm going to remake Watchmen but I'm going to replace every character with like different sauces.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So you've got like Worcestershire sauce, you've got ketchup, you've got A1.

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And so like the film starts out normal but then over the course of time each character has their like own like composite layer

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and I just add more and more sauce to them each time and I just watch them go.

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
At the end of the film it's basically all just A1 sauce and you can't see anything.

76
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Unfortunately Munchy, the greatest remake slash parody of Watchmen already exists.

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Some website literally made a version of Watchmen that starred Hillary Clinton.

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh my fucking god.

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Trump the fuck? I'm not joking. This is something that exists.

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But how much sauce is there?

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There's a lot of sauce dude. It's Hillary Clinton.

82
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Blue sauce.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is she white or is she like Owlman or is she...

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
She's Doctor Manhattan my friend. She's the enlightened one.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh the blue penis. The blue penis pill.

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The traps aren't gay guys.

87
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How much sense?

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
To be on topic, I have a thing we could all talk about since we're...

89
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No, no, no, no. I know you hate me.

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Enough!

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But we are of a generation, maybe Munchy less so, but we grew...

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, no, I'm just...

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why don't you just listen to the person than any of us? Let's be real.

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We grew up before social media and now it's fucking everywhere and we're a transitional generation.

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We've seen it come into existence and now it's everywhere.

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We're the last ones who will never know what we've lost as a species and can never get back.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We're the last living souls.

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And I'm wondering how everyone got into social media, whether you resisted at first or what did you first make a social media account on?

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How'd that all go?

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The first social media account I ever made was on a Pokemon fan form and I used to role-play on it all the time.

102
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Sick, dude.

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It was so fucking... That's where I got my name, Bros.

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I guess I would say the...

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I love social media, so good.

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I guess I would say the first thing I ever did was I remember back in the day signing up for AIM, you know, AOL Internet Messenger

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and that's where I came up with my legendary name I've been using, Mega Man X-1331.

108
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah!

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, it's dope, right?

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I mean, other than that, I never got into Facebook.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I remember the original social media in my day was simultaneously the best and worst place in the world, Gaia Online,

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
which was this big retarded anime, video game, everything forum for dumb little teenager nerds.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And you just... The whole... It ran on this really malicious, addicting coin system where all of your posts gave you a penny

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and for a thousand dollars you could buy clothes for your little avatar and it hooked you, man.

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This means, Jesse, you were the original anime avatar social media account.

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh my god!

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Holy shit!

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It was inside of me all along!

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Banned me! Somebody get me out of here!

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Get me out of myself!

121
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Did any of you guys ever use MySpace? Because I totally skipped over that.

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I did, not really because I wanted to.

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I just had friends who were like, I remember my friends sat me down and made me a MySpace account

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and then two years later sat me down and made me a Facebook account, despite the fact that I didn't want any of it.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Probably the only social media account I signed up for back in the day because I wanted to was DeviantArt

126
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
because I drew shit and I was like, this is cool.

127
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You got social media raped, dude. You got raped.

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, multiple times and that's why I'm the fucked up person I am today.

129
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I had a MySpace account, I'm pretty sure.

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It was for a brief time because I only got into it shortly before Facebook came and completely steamrolled it.

131
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But for a while I did have a MySpace account.

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm sure it was really cringey and horrible because it was from when I was 17 or 18 or whatever.

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wasn't that archive? Didn't you have an archive of that? I think I've seen it.

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, I wish I did because I was thinking back on, man, I like to see my old MySpace page.

135
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I like to see some of the weird, cringey messages I sent back and forth to fucking girls and stuff.

136
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So I was trying and I can't remember my login for shit.

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I can't remember how to even get into it.

138
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So it's just lost to the annals of history forever.

139
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I was never really into social media.

140
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It took a long time for me because I didn't have friends and I was like a gay.

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So I didn't know MySpace, I skipped over that.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Facebook was becoming huge and it was actually my mom who pressured me to get it

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
because she saw that people could make friends on it and she's like,

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
you could talk to your friends on this thing.

145
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm like, fine, I guess, I guess I'll get Facebook and now I have Facebook

146
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and I have never used it really.

147
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I just occasionally people upload photos of me and then I can see, oh, cool.

148
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's what I look like at that moment in time.

149
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But I mean really the earliest online interaction account that I ever set up

150
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
was either Club Penguin or RuneScape and I think it might have been Club Penguin

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
which is sad because it's dead and everything ever of it is gone.

152
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Download the app, bro, download the app.

153
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I did download the app.

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Download the app, bro, download the app.

155
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How was the app?

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I undownloaded it because one, it's gay and two, it's like incredibly limiting

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and you need to pay for anything to happen.

158
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It doesn't feel right because it's not even that I care about having a penguin game to play.

159
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's just the memory of that being the first time I've ever talked to people on the internet.

160
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
RuneScape is still around though, so that's cool.

161
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You said, hello, I'm a baby, please nurture me and someone said ASL.

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
RuneScape.

163
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The first time you ever met.

165
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay, so like I just logged into my old Gaia Online account.

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, yes.

167
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And whoever's editing this, when you do the pictures of us in the corner,

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I definitely want my Gaia Online profile pic, my avatar as my picture on this one

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
because it's the fucking sweetest avatar in the history of the world.

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Everyone's gonna see how cool and edgy and cool I am.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think I actually have seen, it wasn't your MySpace, I've seen your Gaia Online before.

172
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's fucking perfect.

173
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We should all put our worst fucking avatars possible from our old.

174
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't even know.

175
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Mine's the best.

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Mine is a masterpiece.

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's 100% good.

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm not even being ironic, I think.

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I think I'm being sincere.

180
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I say that it's probably legitimately cool.

181
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hey, so let's talk about something about social media that you see a lot.

182
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's talk about social media hipsters as in the people who just like reject it entirely

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and say like, oh, it's useless.

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah, like I remember feeling that way about Twitter for a long time

185
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and it only changed when like I started doing YouTube stuff

186
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and it was like, okay, like I guess I'll figure it out

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
because it might be a useful way to talk to people.

188
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I mean really, I was like a social hipster.

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I thought social, I didn't have a phone until I was like right now,

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I just bought a phone right now.

191
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How old is Jesus?

192
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Like I've never, I didn't have any sort of contact with human beings until I was 20.

193
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well like, yeah.

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You see the results.

195
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
How old do you think, like, I've been thinking about this actually myself,

196
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
like at what age would I give like a kid of mine like their own smartphone

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and like connect them to this giant network of fucking shit out here.

198
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I would say 16, 16, 15.

199
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't though, that's the problem.

200
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
12, 14.

201
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The problem, because like it's interesting you mentioned this

202
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
because I have a younger sister who is only 15 right now

203
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
so I have seen this play out in real time as someone who is, you know,

204
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
10 years removed from her generation and can observe it.

205
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Like my parents were super hesitant to like cave into all this like technology and shit

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but like you need it now, you know, like she needed a laptop

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
at like 11 and like all her friends are on social media and using phones like now.

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's what they want, man.

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's what the corporate elites have made this world into.

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Exactly.

211
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's what they want to make, turn our kids into degenerates as early as possible.

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They'll be googling BBC before you know it dude.

213
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's all downhill.

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's all downhill from here.

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That actually reminds me how my mom forced me to love Sonic the Hedgehog

216
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
even though I didn't want to.

217
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah?

218
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Tell me the tale dude, tell me the tale.

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So in kindergarten I would take like...

220
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You poor fucking junkie.

221
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm so sorry.

222
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's abuse.

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Forget Daddy of Five.

224
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is like real abuse here.

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, real shit.

226
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So in kindergarten I would like take a bus and I had to like walk a little bit

227
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
so my mom was like here you need like a flip phone

228
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and so she got me a flip phone and it was fucking sick

229
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and I would whip it out during school and I would pretend it was my dick

230
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and say hey I'm gonna call fucking Obama assholes

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and then be like oh my god.

232
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They'd be like oh my god that's some sauce bro.

233
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's some serious sauce.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Just too powerful dude, too powerful.

235
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So anyway, it was just like a phone like before phones were everything

236
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
they were just phones.

237
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Like imagine like just like the phone little square thing and that's what it was.

238
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't understand.

239
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The little square iPhone little thing you click on

240
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and then it's like oh that's what you can only call things.

241
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's the only thing you can do is you can just talk to people.

242
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's disgusting.

243
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I can't think of a single worse thing than talking to another human.

244
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Anyway.

245
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I agree.

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So there was one thing that like my mom was like you know what?

247
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You know what?

248
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You need to do something here.

249
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You should get a game on your phone and it'll be really fun dude.

250
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And I'm like but I hate video games.

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
All I want to do is fucking hang around people who I don't know is house

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and go through their fucking garbage.

253
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
God damn.

254
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But then she downloaded fucking Sonic 1 on my mobile phone.

255
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Now keep in mind this is not like a like this phone size is like the size of like half of a fucking iPhone.

256
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Like like like really small like I can barely see anything.

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And there's like like there was no like backlight so I'm playing like like like Game Boy Advance

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
no backlight like like Sonic 1 on a fucking tiny screen not even using like a game controller.

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Just using like like the number pad and like arrows.

260
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And that's how I played and beat Sonic 1 for the first time.

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And because I was so fucking shit I literally like I toiled and fucking mined and like starved to death

262
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
on like on like Marble Zone Act 2 for fucking years and I couldn't get past it.

263
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Until like two years later right before I'm about to like get like my first actual real good guy smartphone

264
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I decided to like spin like 72 hours just finally beating Sonic 1.

265
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And that's how I did it.

266
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's my story about how my mom is a mind break dosion and she forced me to like Sonic even though I didn't want to.

267
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You forgot to mention that she also forced your ringtone to be the Sonic sound and made the background Sonic.

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It made all your contact Sonic pictures.

269
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Sweet fucking Gaia Boy.

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Look at this hero this module stud.

271
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Holy shit.

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
God damn.

273
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I have never seen a man more powerful than this dude.

274
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The fucking galaxy behind him.

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Holy shit.

276
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We need to play Gaia Online guys.

277
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We need to all play Gaia Online.

278
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Just how do you.

279
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The crass consciousness was fucking insane.

280
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The crass consciousness levels of that.

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is that a little happy potato in the bottom in the bottom.

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's a little it's a little chick.

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's a little chicken chick.

284
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Okay.

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay.

287
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay.

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm getting mad fucking war from this guy like like like this guy obviously fucked up.

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
He obviously fucked up making like a markable and now his like chakras are inverted and he and he's like a totally like male dominated brain.

290
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So he like he just knows how to plunder puss.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's all he's ever known.

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He's just in a bitter puss famine and all he knows is bitter puss starvation and he's just trying to fucking sling it whenever and all possible.

293
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He's like at a level like like seven seven crass consciousness.

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He's fucking up there.

295
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He's ready.

296
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
How do I get back to the man I once was?

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He's his own beast now Jesse.

298
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You can't control him.

299
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You are.

300
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He's his own person.

301
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We split apart this fall from grace when I stopped using Gaia online.

302
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I just noticed he has a cane too.

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He's a sword and a cane and a fucking nebula behind him.

304
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He's a fucking galactic pimp.

305
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
When we went back to my little pony it wasn't it wasn't far enough.

306
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We have to go backer.

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We have to go back to being in wombs.

308
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:56,000
He's like a combination of like a pimp and a celestial warrior and a school shooter and a god and and and a kingdom hearts and a kingdom.

309
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He's so like oh my god.

310
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He's just gonna rame some fucking dream with that.

311
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You can fuck.

312
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He slammed so much puss he like opened a rift in the universe behind him.

313
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't know.

314
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know what that background is but it looks like he's like really tiny standing on the top of a table in some kitchen.

315
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah.

316
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh it kind of does.

317
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And he's got a tiny galaxy.

318
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah I don't know what the background is like why it's like a weird kitchen thing.

319
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't know if you can change that but I definitely I made sure to put the fucking celestial warp hole behind me.

320
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He's one inch but his density is like the same as our son.

321
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

322
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Because that that celestial warp hole that you know that's where I was born from and where I will return to one day.

323
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
God willing.

324
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If you all pledge enough to my patreon.com slash endless Jess.

325
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I can become that man again.

326
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Please this is my dream.

327
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Please.

328
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That like universe in the background is the endless.

329
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes it's the source of my power.

330
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
God damn.

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh my fucking god.

332
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He's so he's his hat too.

333
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Man I can't wait for Ben not to edit this picture in and everyone is like what the fuck are they talking about.

334
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
No.

335
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Ben you son of a bitch.

336
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
God damn it.

337
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Why do why do we even bother?

338
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Why don't we just hire a big old monkey from the fucking zoo to do our taxes.

339
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Our fucking what is wrong with you.

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Why don't we just get that son of a bitch Donkey Kong and do it.

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah.

342
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
They can prove his worth for once.

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Save the mic.

344
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Pull his own weight.

345
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The most the most useless member of the procrastinators fucking Donkey Kong.

346
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sick of his shit.

347
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
He never shows up and he only was interested when we started doing the Patreon.

348
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Like that's the only reason he's fucking here.

349
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
He's only in for the fucking money.

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We just need to fucking kick him.

351
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Donkey Kong what the fuck.

352
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah that greedy.

353
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You know it's all about the fucking banana horde with him.

354
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's all he talks about.

355
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's all I hear about.

356
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
His precious fucking banana horde.

357
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He's just in it for those Patreon nanners.

358
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And I'm you know and you know what the rest of us need money Donkey Kong okay.

359
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
He converted the Patreon to only pay us in bananas.

360
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And that's not working for anyone but him.

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Perfect banana.

362
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And it's a fucking crime.

363
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I cannot think of a single worst thing than talking about social media.

364
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah.

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I cannot think of like the worst thing.

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I really wish you were doing.

367
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I've been trying to think of this.

368
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I've been trying to think desperately of anything interesting to say about it.

369
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay.

370
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I have a point.

371
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I have a point.

372
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I can bring up about social media.

373
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Please Tom.

374
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay.

375
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you see because everyone except for possibly Bunchy was around before social media.

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Do you find right that it's incredibly frustrating that social media has completely transformed

377
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
our like perceptions of success and audience and like like our perceptions of talent and

378
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
skill and all that.

379
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh yes.

380
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Because I feel like because of social media like now I feel like pressured to like be famous

381
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
almost or like be successful back in the day like it was just like you did shit and

382
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
like you kind of put it out there for your community.

383
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And like if your community that was like the length like the reach of your social kind

384
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
of like perceptions.

385
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But now with social media like celebrities can be like anybody sitting on their couch

386
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
doing whatever.

387
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So like it's like celebrity used to be like this kind of like separate thing where like

388
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
you weren't but now it's anybody.

389
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So it's like well why am I not like have a million subscribers and like all this shit

390
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
because like there's no excuse now for me not to do it.

391
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And like this is and we've like kind of changed our perception of like skill and ability because

392
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I know online and all these exceptions to the rule like these great people kind of rise

393
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
to the top and that kind of changes what that kind of feels like the new norm because that's

394
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
all you see.

395
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So it's just like why am I not that good.

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Why am I not that famous.

397
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Why am I not that successful.

398
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And it's just like if you don't even have a hundred thousand subscribers it's like you're

399
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
not you're not anything.

400
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Right.

401
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Well I don't worry.

402
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I don't worry so much about how it's changing our perception of like fame or success.

403
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I worry about like how it's changing our perception of each other as human beings

404
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and even of ourselves because we all have this like everyone in the world now has this

405
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
alter ego that they sell to the world via social media and like the people you see like

406
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
if there's anyone in your life who you know on social media and also off social media

407
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
it's like the social media person is not them.

408
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's not even like remotely them.

409
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Nobody online is even close to their like you go on Facebook like you know.

410
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You've got friends on Facebook and you see them posting like political shit all the time

411
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
just because that's all there is to talk about on Facebook.

412
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So they're just posting this inane annoying political shit.

413
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
They're getting in arguments and like anyone they look like on Facebook they just look

414
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
like annoying assholes to you who you would never talk to and you look at this person

415
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
who you know as a human being like this is not you this is not this person.

416
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The real version of this person doesn't give a fuck about this.

417
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's only on social media.

418
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Let me tell you about that real quick because I've had a couple experiences that relate to this

419
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and it's so I went skydiving a couple years ago just for fun and I went by myself purely

420
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
for the joy of doing it because I was really interested in trying it and I also want to die

421
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
but so I went and did it and but like the thing about it that was really interesting to me

422
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
was how like the big theme that dominated this whole place was like hey guys

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
you know buy the pictures that we're going to take of you while you're doing it.

424
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Don't you want to upload this to your fucking Facebook?

425
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Don't you want to like tweet about this to everybody?

426
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Like that's what we know that's why you're here right?

427
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You're here so you can put this on fucking Facebook and show everyone how cool you are

428
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
which you're actually not you're just doing this so that you can look cool online.

429
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Like every so many people were just there for that reason and then just the other day

430
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I was at the Creation Museum where it's just my favorite place because I love Jesus

431
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and like I did the zipline thing.

432
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
My parents were in town we did this zipline thing and it was super fun

433
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
but again like there was just so much like there were all these pictures they automatically take

434
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and they're just trying to shill you on like buying the pictures

435
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
obviously so that you can post to social media so that you can look cool

436
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and like feel like a cool boy.

437
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's just God like I that's what I resent about social media.

438
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Now it's got people so focused on like like perception of each other

439
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
as opposed to actually doing things that are actually fun and interesting.

440
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's always weird for me to think about stuff like that

441
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
because like I've never really used social media in the way that a lot of people just you know

442
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
they use it they take pictures of things where they've been

443
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
what food they're eating you know just retweeting,

444
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
re-blogging like things that they see or agree with.

445
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Like I don't do that because I have been primarily a creative person on the Internet.

446
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I've been making stuff I put stuff out there to be to be shown

447
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and it's the same basic principle like I like attention.

448
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I like people to say how good job but for people who don't create stuff for the Internet

449
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
they it's like it's like a totally different side of you know of existence

450
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
just being there I don't I can't really understand exactly what they're going through

451
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
like I get the basic like they just want to feel like the you know people like them

452
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
but I don't know what their their purpose is like what they they expect to get out of something like

453
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
like oh you got like a ton of followers now does that mean you're famous does that mean you're popular?

454
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Social currency yeah it's a social it's yeah it's a currency.

455
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
People they want attention and love and stuff like everybody else

456
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
but they they're doing it in a very passive way they're not really trying

457
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
but they don't feel I don't know what whether they feel like it's like something they're doing actively

458
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and failing at if they're not famous or whether they just do it because they don't realize that you don't need to.

459
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Well I think a lot of people just enjoy any kind of feedback like for a lot of people

460
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm sure like one like on whatever they post is yeah something to make some happy and I admit like

461
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I totally do this as well so I'm not trying to like excuse myself like I think a lot of this just

462
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
appeals to like base human instincts to like feel happy when people give a shit about you in any capacity

463
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and the fact that social media has changed the game so the entire world like can can focus on whatever you're trying to do

464
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you know it's just it's going to change the way we we go about the shit but like you know I tweet pictures of funny things

465
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I see mostly because I think they're funny but but like at the at the base level like yes I'm trying to like I guess

466
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
like get love you know like to feel like people give a shit about me which is why I post things from my day that I enjoy.

467
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I do that stuff as well like I think of something to say I record it or I take a picture of it

468
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
but it always goes back to like making I don't know some sort of video so making it presentable

469
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and I you know like compared to just throwing it out there with nothing and I'm not trying to say like

470
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You make puns all the time that are related to videos or anything.

471
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Well not that not that I mean like like say if I have like a vlog idea like I have a point I want to make

472
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I wouldn't just make it I would put it in a vlog on give and take that would either have something else in it

473
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
or well actually I don't know maybe I'm gay maybe I don't know what I'm saying.

474
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It sounds like you're making a distinction kind of between like I guess this kind of not important things that people put out there.

475
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah that's the thing I was about to say like I don't I don't I'm not saying I'm more important because I put more effort into the things I say

476
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:24,000
but I feel like I don't I don't understand the mindset exactly of people who who just you know throw stuff out there.

477
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I don't know whether they enjoy it or whether they even consider it being anyone really enjoys it.

478
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I think everyone like feels like obligated just like an empty zombie feeling but like they're just like addicted to like this.

479
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:47,000
This this this disturbing endorphin rush of like all day constantly selling yourself for it like we're just endorphin whores now we need that rush.

480
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Would anyone in the world rather like make a tweet and get like I don't know let's say like a thousand likes you know and a bunch of comments.

481
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Would anyone prefer that to like having a good friend that they go spend like a few hours with like which of those sounds more appealing.

482
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's just like it's just like this weird drug that people like nobody I think nobody's like in love with social media like at most people tolerated or accept it.

483
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I think deep down inside we all feel the same way about it.

484
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That's why like Black Mirror is such a successful show because deep inside we all know that this shit is fucked up.

485
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We just can't do anything about it.

486
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We can't pull ourselves away from it as a society like.

487
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It seems harmless and it kind of is but it's just like it's like a cumulative like over time you just forget why you started doing it.

488
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's like it's supposed to be like a nice addition to life to be able to talk to your friends when they're not there.

489
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And then it sort of becomes you know a replacement for it or or it takes over your real life or it just makes you forget what you're doing.

490
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's freaky and it's sad like I remember you know you know like I had this friend who was like really going through a hard time and like really depressed and like you know like we'd sit and talk

491
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and like we'd like connect as humans and she's talk about like how sad she is and like you know like real stuff but then like I'd see her posting on social media constantly

492
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and it's all these like happy like look at me selling yourself smiling fake fucking posts because that's what you have to do and it's just like this can't be healthy.

493
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
This is fucked up that we have to constantly sell ourselves as these people with good lives when all of our lives are secretly terrible.

494
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Like you're not allowed to be sad on social media because then you become that guy and like nobody wants to be that guy.

495
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah I have been that guy but I feel like well like no no I have just been that guy there's nothing more to that I have been that guy.

496
00:31:49,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I feel like occasionally occasionally it's okay but it's it's always like like dangerous like oh you feel bad but you don't want to talk to anybody because you've already talked to them recently about how you feel bad.

497
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So then you're just stuck thinking like well I mean this is what happened to me like if I if I didn't have any like doubts I would be posting constantly about sad things but I don't.

498
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I keep it all bottled up but then I don't have any wanting real life to go and talk to about it so I don't know what to do.

499
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's just it's just one of those things this is gay I don't like it.

500
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Being sad in the modern age I it has gotten like worse than being sad used to be for all of human history because like social media has like worked against us to compound all these feelings of anxiousness and loneliness and like.

501
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's because you just I not to mention not to mention the worst and feeling lonely when it looks like everyone else is having like this fantastic wonderful life and like even though it may be a lie but it looks that way and it's just.

502
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I think I know why that it is is that when you post something like oh man life sucks and it goes on Twitter.

503
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It stays on there like you have to delete it you know have to actively delete it if you're out with a friend and you're like man I'm feeling sad and they're like oh what's up buddy and then you talk to them and then it's done and then.

504
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You know they don't have to constantly know that it's there or see it occasionally again people aren't constantly you know learning of it of the first time like.

505
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You know media has it's very fleeting but it's still sort of permanent this like entire new obstacle to human interaction like it took me this long in my life to master regular face to face human interaction but now there's like a whole new set of rules were like.

506
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:48,000
If I if I want to talk to somebody like especially about something serious like if I'm sad or like if I want to you know like you pull their fucking name up in the little box and you just like stare at it like.

507
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Okay how in the fuck do I start this kind of like what do you even say in that little box I don't know how to start a box conversation on Facebook it's the most nerve wracking thing in the world like.

508
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Hi what's up can I talk to you you can't do it and then you know there's that ever present fucking fear that you're just going to get that scene it's just going to say scene for like 48 hours.

509
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And then you're just dangling from a fucking like a fish hook like what did I say wrong what did I do all I said was hi.

510
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's a nightmare it's a fucking nightmare.

511
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's interesting the way that like those kind of situation.

512
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I just I've never had that but I've but I never use it so like my social media experiences I only talk to people that I don't interact with in like real life on a daily basis.

513
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So like I don't have that weird perception of like trying to interact with like people I know in real life online and for me it's very separate like.

514
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That fucking message box and that fucking like check scene has made it a thousand times harder to like reach out.

515
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's become worse than it's ever been in human history.

516
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:07,000
There's no more like calling someone on the phone and just talking there's no more just you know you just can't you just can't because it's going to say scene for 78 hours and you're going to feel bad for that long because they're busy doing something and you know you know in your in your rational mind.

517
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That life is just hectic for everybody and everyone you know you like I can't respond to a message.

518
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Nobody likes responding to a message and that's part of why you feel bad messaging in the first place.

519
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So you know that like it's nothing personal probably but you don't care you lizard brain you're fucking fearful amygdala fucking animal part of you is sitting there curled up in a corner.

520
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You know like they hate me they want me to die they're never going to talk to me again.

521
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
They just want me to do the wisest guy talking to me and I'm just going to fucking kill myself with a guy that's praying on you when you're already at a low point.

522
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Did I did I ever tell you guys my it's an anxiety machine.

523
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That's what these things do.

524
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I think they do it on purpose.

525
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I think it's they're trying to like they know they know what they're doing.

526
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah like they know that this system is in place.

527
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
They must have heard like you know this is a criticism like sure I guess there are advantages to but you know it's it's inherently creates this problem as well.

528
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And let me tell you guys this the story ahead about this.

529
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So when I was in high school I knew this girl and she was kind of weird but she was she was very I don't know interested in me and I don't know we eventually went our separate ways.

530
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But like a couple years later I just get a message from her on Facebook and this is when I still use it in college sometime and it just like hey what's up or something along those lines.

531
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And I you know I looked at it and I was like I do not want to talk to this person and so I you know went off to do other things.

532
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And like a day later or something I get this fucking message from her again.

533
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's like this giant wall of text called me a fucking piece of shit.

534
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Like I think I'm so much better than her like I can't be bothered to talk to this girl.

535
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's too much trouble for me to go out of my way to talk to this girl who cared about me so much in high school or some shit like that.

536
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And so like and it's all because she saw the like she saw the scene message.

537
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
She knew that I had seen this and chose not to respond.

538
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And as a result she felt all these horrible feelings and I didn't want to feel that way but I what could I do.

539
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
That was Facebook who did that and just to finish it off like I get a message like a year later.

540
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Like I believe that was still mad and just like you know OK I'm still mad about you not responding but you know maybe we can get over this and then I believe like a year after that or so.

541
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
She's like OK you know what I forgive you so thank you young lady for that narrative arc.

542
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Sorry I spaced out there for a second.

543
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I was farming my turnips that I have in my house and I didn't want it.

544
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I didn't want to.

545
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I've told you a thousand times turnip time is not podcast time.

546
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
There's I can't put my turnips on wait then they'll they'll they'll see the box that says seen and they'll know that I'm ignoring them.

547
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I have to tend to them immediately.

548
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah anyway the worst thing in the world even more than the check mark scene box is when is when you're just mind your own business and you get the.

549
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And then you check your phone and then like your brain doesn't even process each words you just see like whoever the fuck huge piece of text.

550
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Like you just see you just see like a paragraph and you know shits about to fucking hit the fan and that you are going to die.

551
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
No good person has ever written that much in a message in the history of the world.

552
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The worst was like before the smartphones when like it would say like text message one slash seven.

553
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh boy.

554
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And you always like to think that you know you don't do it to other people that but it's impossible to not do it.

555
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's just it's everything you don't do affects people and everything you do do is is really terrible.

556
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's it's it's it's just constantly it's constantly like death.

557
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I just don't.

558
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I mean it's constantly death.

559
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yes.

560
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I everything's bad.

561
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:59,000
There's there's a few moments that I can recall where like like reading a big thing like that like oh no no no this is the exact worst thing you could have said it made me literally sick.

562
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I was just like no I just I threw my phone on the bed and I jumped out the window and I'm dead.

563
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I fell into a pile of poop.

564
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's just horrible.

565
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Every single time.

566
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Sometimes even worse than long paragraphs are just messages that are just like oh or like hmm.

567
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:28,000
That just just just like one just like just like I just noise just noise messages just so you know I just wish like I just wish that there was a way to get better at it so that you could you could.

568
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You could just like make people feel better in text but it's so difficult because you can't you can't like you could send them a little emoticon saying you know hug but it's not the same as a hug.

569
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's not the same as like it's not the same as like like like sometimes sometimes people just need to vent in front of you and you just you don't need to say anything you just need to be there and they need to know that you're listening and you can't do that in text.

570
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
If you ignore them they think you're ignoring them and if you say something then they think you you have something to say I don't it's just fucking.

571
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I mean yeah we could talk about the weakness of like text as a medium in general because do you guys ever get this like there's some people I talked to in a very specific like cadence.

572
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Like I'll always put just for whatever reason some people I talked to I always put like lol at the end of my sentences.

573
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So if I ever don't put lol it looks like I'm fucking pissed and this is this is real this is terrible like this yeah like you box yourself into this this sort of thing or like you always put a smiley face if you don't they look you look mad as fuck.

574
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's just I can't fucking hate writing text and talking online that way so limited so bullshit thank God emoticons make things better at least a little bit.

575
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You can't there's no you can't understand like the context and stuff with.

576
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah they won't know that my cadence that I'm using in my words like when I called you a big dick nigg like that was ironic don't you understand.

577
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's no it's it's super fucked up and there's a bunch there's like I mean everyone has this when you you said something in jest or you said something as a joke and they take it seriously like no no like fuck and they're like totally like changes the tone of the entire conversation.

578
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Then you have to fucking backtrack and explain yeah and then you're just like fuck and then like any any kind of energy that was going is gone and then it's just like I guess I'll talk to you later.

579
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You know what I'm glad I'm glad things like Snapchat and Twitter video and YouTube and all this around so that at least there's audio at least there's video and audio that people are communicating with more nowadays instead of just.

580
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's better and and emails and messages as if people are doing that more often if the Internet is getting better at handling video in large quantities than that would be better for everyone I think.

581
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
All that being said you guys are all whining social media spy is matter.

582
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Well I mean there is the fact that he's a symptom of this fuck.

583
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
He was birthed from the fucking wireframe res dimension of the net.

584
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
First I was nothing then I was a tweet.

585
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You're like the roadkill on the information super highway.

586
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Oh oh that reminds me dude OK fucking going back to that one thing Nate said about how people want to take your picture and like use it to like profile like racially profile you.

587
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah that's what I said right.

588
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So so one time I walked into a fucking Mexican restaurant and I was like I was I was looking like a used Band-Aid Sultan motherfuckers I was ready to expend no expenses.

589
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I was ready to throw my green no matter where.

590
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And up comes this fucking like like hunchback hunchback of carne asada.

591
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,000
She comes up and she's like you have to pay for it.

592
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And I fucking I punted her in the next fucking week.

593
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
She's gone.

594
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That's my media story.

595
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Where did this happen.

596
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Where was this.

597
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This was this was my my Mexican zone.

598
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh right.

599
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
OK OK.

600
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The zone.

601
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I like the Twilight Zone.

602
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah I don't like this.

603
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Like the thing that bothers me the most of this shit is this like industry that sprung up around like supporting people's social media addictions in that way like that seems not good.

604
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That's that's a bad thing to me in my in my humble opinion.

605
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah it's just no one's actions should be motivated primarily by wanting to look cool on social media.

606
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You can do that as a consequence.

607
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That's fine.

608
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I just don't like that.

609
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Too focused on that's that's the problem.

610
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You guys are just you're just thinking about it too much.

611
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Just don't use social media for anything other than just like hmm I'm thinking about this.

612
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I guess I'll just say it's not like the goal should never be social media.

613
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Just use it if you want to.

614
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And if you don't want to it's not just like like the social bitch.

615
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's not just the social media like like websites like things like discord as well.

616
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's still the problem with with text is being is bad for for for communicating.

617
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Well sure then yeah.

618
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So like a lot of the time it's just it's just worse than being there in person.

619
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But of course it's necessary because you can't be there in person because I don't live in the same country as any of you people.

620
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I would have never known any of you if it not for the social media.

621
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So like it's it's obviously good that it connects the world but it's it's terrible because we're connected in a weird robotic not real human way.

622
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I would challenge that a little bit and I would say that yes like we absolutely you know like we came to know each other through YouTube which you know.

623
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Well the thing about the YouTube is that it's video is that we could hear each other and we did podcasts.

624
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It was it was more real than just text and comments and things like that.

625
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yeah I just like would our complaint mostly be about like the problematic nature of like just using text and not having context or something.

626
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I would say it's more than that.

627
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I mean the text is a huge fucking problem because like it doesn't matter what medium is if you're communicating through.

628
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Delete language in bullish language.

629
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I actually do kind of hate the spoken word and the written word for that matter they're both bullshit.

630
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But like I was going to say that God I'm looking at this picture this big titted bitch and I forgot what I was going to say.

631
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Social media putting social god damn social media distracted me from the shit I was trying to say.

632
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah I don't know.

633
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It's it's it's gay but like I would say that the way that we talk to each other now like using discord the way we do now just to like you stay in contact with each other and you know like be friends.

634
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's not like the same as social media per se that's that's a difference.

635
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's it's it's not but it's just them.

636
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Social media is like the way people relate to like the mass audience of the people out there you know like that's as opposed to like one on one.

637
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Because you said like the first social network thing you sign up for was AIM and I don't think AIM was social media because that was more about connecting you with people that you already knew like social media is when you

638
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Okay that's true.

639
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Try and project yourself out into an audience.

640
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yeah that's true.

641
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And try and.

642
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
That's not the issue.

643
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Alright Tom.

644
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
There's something shit in my mouth a little more Tom.

645
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
All right.

647
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm sorry.

648
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm just I'm trying to make a distinction.

649
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
All right.

650
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But you're right here.

651
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You're right.

652
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I don't know.

653
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I just it's it's so I think the weirdest thing for me is just like how like there's these huge corporations now that like are subsisting on everyone's desire for for attention.

654
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah.

655
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Like Facebook is like like I mean I always knew that Facebook was like fucked up.

656
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But like when you realize how Facebook makes its money like you know it's just advertising like that's how they make their money.

657
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And the reason they have all these fields you to put in is because you're being logged into an advertising database.

658
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Like the scariest thing for me ever because like I'm doing all this research on like business and stuff is when I found out about Facebook ads.

659
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And like if you use the Facebook ad manager it's the scariest fucking thing in the world because it like it just taps into everyone's profile.

660
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So you just type in whatever you want.

661
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's like here are like seven million people that are exactly the specifications you're looking for.

662
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And we're going to you can pay like 10 cents to shove ads in their face.

663
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Like that's how they make all their money.

664
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And it's like super fucking weird how they've taken your personal life and like are making money off of it.

665
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's super fucked up.

666
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah.

667
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I mean it makes sense logically.

668
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I get the business side of it.

669
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I just don't like it.

670
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Right.

671
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Well that's the whole thing.

672
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It totally makes sense.

673
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I mean that's why like if I was ever going to like start selling a product I'd use Facebook ads because it totally makes sense.

674
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But like it's still like fucking evil and like really creepy.

675
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
When are ads going to die?

676
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I have never bought anything.

677
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
The only time will be ever completely changed like the nature of the economic system of the country.

678
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
That's the only way that advertisement.

679
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:39,000
The only things like I ever buy is when I type in Google for something that I need and I find it and then I research it a bit and then I buy it usually because it's an electronic something or other.

680
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:49,000
But like an ad for like I don't know maybe even something I'd like like oh look Mario Kart 3 like a new one.

681
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Go play it on your Switch.

682
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I'm like well I play video games but you know I'm the right demographic but I'm trying to watch a video right now.

683
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I don't give a shit.

684
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
There's more to advertising than just like saying like here's the thing go buy it.

685
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's planting the seed that you might want in the future in your head.

686
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So like now you're aware that you know Mario Kart 3 for Wii Switch exists or Nintendo Switch exists.

687
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And so like in the future like when you're thinking about like oh what's a game that I might want to get.

688
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I mean that one looked okay.

689
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Maybe I'll do that.

690
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's about like the long term game I think.

691
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It's about planting like brand recognition.

692
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Like subconsciously like everybody knows about the Galaxy S8 because you've seen it everywhere.

693
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So like it's just like in your brain.

694
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And I didn't know what until just now I'm starting to think maybe you're an ad.

695
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm starting to think I'm being shooted to.

696
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Buy the Galaxy S8 from Samsung.com with my affiliate link.

697
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Hey guys.

698
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Welcome to the new Rebel Pixels.

699
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Please please give me quarters.

700
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Oh by the way that was an excellent time to debut.

701
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
What I've decided is your new nickname Tom.

702
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And it's Tom Cintiq Alternative Oliver.

703
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That's you.

704
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That's totally fine.

705
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That's a nice pre-packaged meme there you got there on a silver platter.

706
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I don't even get it.

707
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And I'm proud of not getting it because it means I'm one less into the internet thing.

708
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I take it back.

709
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Advertising is not stupid.

710
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It makes sense.

711
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It works whatever.

712
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But I hate that everything is based on views and clicks and watch time and people having

713
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
and it's like just give me five bucks on Patreon.

714
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But I like Patreon so much more because I don't know where I'm going with this.

715
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It's nothing to do with social media.

716
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I just I just I fucking hate everything about the world and the internet is pretty gay.

717
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
The internet is definitely like all the stuff I hate about the world but like more of it

718
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
all the time.

719
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And right at my computer where I'm trying to play Dark Souls 4.

720
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You know the Facebook is just getting worse.

721
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I was pretty excited to do this topic and then coming here I realized that there's nothing to say.

722
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Yeah.

723
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
No one cares about your turnips.

724
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
We've already talked about them.

725
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
God.

726
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Why do you turn me into the A1 sauce?

727
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Don't put me on your burger.

728
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I can turn into solids.

729
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Please just give me a chance.

730
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
What are you talking about?

731
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Are turnips A1 sauce?

732
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Is that real?

733
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah.

734
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I made it.

735
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Please have some.

736
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Please drink it.

737
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Mom.

738
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
No.

739
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Are you are you fucking me right now?

740
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Is A1 sauce made from turnips?

741
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
No.

742
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You fucking fool.

743
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I deceived you yet again.

744
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
You fucking Washington fat cat.

745
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
You don't deserve to know real things.

746
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I'll only give you lies.

747
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
God damn.

748
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Alright.

749
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
You gotta fucking play dude.

750
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Social media is gay.

751
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We all hate it and it's fine.

752
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I want to talk instead because it's a terrible topic and we should never talk about this.

753
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Instead instead.

754
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
We can go to questions at any time.

755
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Well instead.

756
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You're right.

757
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Let's talk about Munchies turnips.

758
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I don't know.

759
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I want to talk about like fucking RuneScape.

760
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
RuneScape is cool.

761
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I went on RuneScape.

762
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
RuneScape is social media dude.

763
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You were chatting about cuties.

764
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah.

765
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's a multiplayer.

766
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Let's talk about MMOs.

767
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
MMOs are huge and it's like you talk to people and they're nerds.

768
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Sometimes you find out that they're like 30 years old and they're like, whoa, wait,

769
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
a 30 year old can play a game and it's like impossible.

770
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
How are you like talking to me as if anyone could be talking to me?

771
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You're 30.

772
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You're like, that's the size of one of my parents.

773
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
That doesn't make any sense and then I'm like, okay, cool.

774
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah, I can talk to people of any age.

775
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Story sounds like it's going down some dark roads.

776
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It's weird when you realize that you can talk to people of like multiple different big

777
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
ages and realize that they're just human.

778
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I think playing World of Warcraft made me realize that adults are people and that I would become

779
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
one and I wouldn't change.

780
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You know what?

781
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
People interact with teenagers and realize they're not human.

782
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That's true, man.

783
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's one of the great things about a social media in general.

784
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
The tale of two kitties, rape me Eddie Murphy.

785
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Case in point.

786
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Case in point, Munchy.

787
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
He's not a man.

788
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
He's a beast.

789
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
He's a beast.

790
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Social media is really good for getting past any kind of like normal social obstacles

791
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,280
that would be in the way and I met some pretty cool people who definitely would not have

792
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,280
gotten to know because they live a million miles away thanks to social media.

793
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:39,280
This entire time that we've been doing this podcast, I have had non-stop in my ear Facebook

794
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,280
notification dings and dongs and beeps and boops going off.

795
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,280
It's gotten worse to like not let you off of it because even when you don't have it in

796
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,280
a tab, even when it's not open, you'll still hear the notification beats.

797
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,280
How is that possible?

798
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,280
I don't know how they do it.

799
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,280
And now I got to a thing where like not only like a thing will come up on my desktop now

800
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,280
of the notification.

801
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,280
You must have installed something.

802
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,280
You fucked up.

803
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,280
You fucked up.

804
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,280
No, no, you fucked up.

805
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,280
There was notifications, right?

806
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,280
Yeah, there was a little thing.

807
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,280
Some sites do this now that say, oh, do you want to allow this site to enable desktop notifications

808
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,280
which just fucks up everything and you have to turn it, you have to turn it off.

809
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,280
Otherwise you'll die.

810
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Maybe I'd like to ask the internet if they'd like to enable my dick in its ear.

811
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
How'd you like that?

812
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,280
My puppy dog dick in your ear.

813
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,280
Skeetin' on the internet all over here.

814
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,280
That's what I was saying to you.

815
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,280
Hey, hey, is this social media?

816
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,280
Kaiser Permanente, duly exanenite, 60 milligram capsules.

817
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,280
Is this social media?

818
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,280
Because I'm gonna drink it all.

819
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
Oh, there he goes, folks.

820
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,280
There he goes.

821
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,280
He's taking the red pills.

822
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,280
All right.

823
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,280
You know, I'll tell you the ultimate red pill.

824
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,280
I am Red Permanente.

825
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,280
I do not like social media.

826
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Shut up, Sans.

827
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,280
I didn't like that character.

828
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
I did not like him at all.

829
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
I hate him.

830
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,280
You know, I'll tell you the ultimate red pill.

831
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,280
You know, isn't real life the original social media?

832
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
Oh, my God, no.

833
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
This is too black-pilled.

834
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,280
I can't look at that.

835
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
I only see darkness.

836
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,280
Wait, what does that even imply?

837
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,280
That real life is just as good as real life.

838
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,280
Real life is just as good or bad as Facebook.

839
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,280
Maybe it's that we spend all our lives trying to impress people.

840
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,280
Like, okay, yeah, here's a red pill like all men care about

841
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,280
is tricking women into having sex with them.

842
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,280
All women care about is tricking men into giving them resources

843
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,280
and our entire lives are based solely on those facts

844
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,280
and everything else is irrelevant bullshit.

845
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,280
Just beating around the fucking bush.

846
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,280
Are these the red pills?

847
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,280
Are my red pills?

848
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,280
I hate them.

849
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,280
Nowadays, I can put in a good old video game

850
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:57,280
and just go into a microphone for four hours

851
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,280
and people tell me that they enjoyed it

852
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,280
and I can feel so powerful.

853
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,280
That shouldn't happen, but it does.

854
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,280
And I thank social media for making people

855
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,280
emotionless as voids of human beings

856
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,280
that enjoy me just playing a video game.

857
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,280
How stupid is that?

858
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,280
You used to have to go out and make a friend

859
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,280
and now you can just load up a fucking let's play

860
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,280
and you've got an instant friend all pre-packaged

861
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,280
and ready to go.

862
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,280
So, so, so good.

863
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,280
So good for my ego.

864
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,280
Here is the official Munchie stance on social media.

865
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,280
Okay.

866
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,280
People are vapid, people are valid,

867
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,280
connects people, very cool, awful,

868
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,280
no value, very value, fun, being not dead is a lie.

869
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,280
That's the end of my notes.

870
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,280
It's like...

871
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,280
It's like...

872
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,280
It's just like home stuck.

873
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,280
Everything Munchie says is typed into Google Translate

874
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,280
and translated back and forth from different languages

875
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,280
like 20 times.

876
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,280
It's translated into ancient Mesopotamian

877
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,280
and I'm just...

878
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,280
I'm not even talking right now,

879
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,280
I'm just transmitting these ideas

880
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,280
directly into audacity.

881
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,280
Some always figure out how to do that in real time too,

882
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,280
which is a really impressive part.

883
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,280
Yeah.

884
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,280
Very...

885
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,280
Well, I could certainly...

886
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,280
I could talk about this topic for a thousand years

887
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,280
because I hate social media with an intensity

888
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,280
that rivals that of a thousand vengeful gods

889
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,280
and I want to die just thinking about it.

890
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,280
I want to die every aspect of it,

891
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,280
every facet of it is bad.

892
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,280
I actually know how to fix social media.

893
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,280
What if...

894
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,280
You know how like there's like the text boxes?

895
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,280
What if we replaced all of those on every websites?

896
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,280
Instead of them being boxes,

897
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,280
they were cowboy hat shaped.

898
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,280
Hmm...

899
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,280
No, I'll tell you how to fix social media.

900
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,280
Social media.

901
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,280
You...

902
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,280
Control...

903
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,280
Out...

904
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,280
Delete...

905
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,280
This is what I would do.

906
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
I would implement a law.

907
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,280
My favorite webcomic.

908
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
Yes.

909
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,280
There needs to be a law for the entire land,

910
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,280
for all the world.

911
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,280
If anything you say,

912
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,280
anything,

913
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,280
if a hundred people have said it before,

914
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,280
you are executed.

915
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,280
That's a pretty good rule.

916
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,280
Because I'm sick and tired of hearing the same jokes.

917
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,280
I'm sick and tired of people just repeating each other

918
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,280
like thinking they're clever from saying the same shit,

919
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,280
regurgitating memes.

920
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,280
Press one, guys.

921
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Press one in the fucking comments if you hate memes.

922
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,280
Oh, god.

923
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,280
Oh, god.

924
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,280
You guys, god damn it.

925
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,280
You did it.

926
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,280
You know what?

927
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,280
That really bugs me.

928
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,280
Because sometimes I hear a joke somewhere,

929
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,280
and then by the time it gets to my normal friends,

930
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,280
it's gone through its phases of becoming boring and stupid,

931
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,280
and it's gone to various websites like 9Gag,

932
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,280
I don't fucking know,

933
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,280
and they catch onto it and then they say it,

934
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,280
and I'm like,

935
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,280
well, I know that it's a joke to you,

936
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,280
so I'm not going to make fun of you for saying it,

937
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,280
so it's fine,

938
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,280
but I still, I just feel a bit bad.

939
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,280
I just feel a bit bad about the fact that

940
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,280
we see the same things,

941
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,280
and nothing can be unique and fun anymore.

942
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,280
That's why every time I make a joke,

943
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,280
I make sure that it's,

944
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,280
I slave over it to make sure that it's not a meme.

945
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,280
If any of my jokes become memes,

946
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,280
I will kill myself.

947
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,280
Yeah, that's my curse.

948
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,280
Everything I say becomes a meme

949
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,280
because I'm too goddamn funny and cool, I guess.

950
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,280
I can't, I can't not create new memes,

951
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,280
and then people just repeat my own shit back at me,

952
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,280
and I want to strangle them.

953
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,280
I want to strangle everyone all the time

954
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,280
who repeats anything that I've ever said.

955
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,280
It's my jokes, you can't have them,

956
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,280
and if you can't put in the effort

957
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,280
to create your own original jokes,

958
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,280
then you shouldn't be allowed to say anything

959
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,280
that you even think is funny ever, you should be executed.

960
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,280
I agree, and similarly, but a different take on that

961
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,280
is when you have a group,

962
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,280
or you have a joke in a certain group,

963
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,280
there's a lot of 4chan jokes,

964
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,280
just say Pepe, for example.

965
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,280
Pepe was a big dank meme,

966
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,280
and then other people started picking him out

967
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,280
and using him for different stuff,

968
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,280
and Katy Perry tweets a picture of Pepe,

969
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,280
and it just gets out, and the joke becomes diluted.

970
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,280
This one has managed to survive

971
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,280
by just escalating how fucked up Pepe is

972
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,280
and just making people not want to use him anymore.

973
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,280
That was good stuff.

974
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,280
But Reddit constantly is stealing jokes from 4chan

975
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,280
and just reposting it there.

976
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,280
And it's not just me.

977
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,280
My secret club is being infiltrated by other people.

978
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,280
Get out, you fucking normies!

979
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,280
Get out of my secret club!

980
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,280
Nate was the real Pepe all along.

981
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,280
There's a bird! There's a bird on my window!

982
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,280
That wasn't a joke.

983
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,280
I can't tell if you're launching into a bit

984
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,280
or making a real observation.

985
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,280
No, that wasn't a fucking joke.

986
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,280
That wasn't a joke.

987
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,280
There was a bird and he looked at me

988
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,280
and he ran away because he was really scared.

989
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,280
Well, it's probably scared because you just yelled

990
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,280
that there was a bird.

991
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,280
It was the Twitter bird coming into touch.

992
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,280
Oh my god, no!

993
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,280
It was doctor foul play.

994
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,280
It was probably doctor foul, to be honest.

995
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,280
Okay, well, I think we're good.

996
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,280
Shall we go to questions?

997
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,280
Alright, fine, finish your point, god damn it.

998
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,280
Why don't we just put them in the oven

999
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,280
and cook them till you're cooked?

1000
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,280
Let's take a fork in them, alright?

1001
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,280
Go on, go on.

1002
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,280
Just one last thing.

1003
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,280
When I go to my friends and I really like them...

1004
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,280
Hey guys, I'm Munchy.

1005
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,280
Let me tell you all about my new ghetto supernova butt beams

1006
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,280
coming out of the eighth chakra dimension

1007
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,280
of the fucking Flipple Club.

1008
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,280
Listen, someone said to me the other day,

1009
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,280
funny Prozac clown makes me want to kill Christians

1010
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,280
windmill style.

1011
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,280
I thought it was really funny and I really liked it

1012
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,280
and it made me laugh.

1013
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
Thank you, Kyle, for saying that to me

1014
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
and it was really funny.

1015
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
Good job, Kyle.

1016
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,280
Shout out to Kyle.

1017
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,280
Thank you, fan.

1018
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,280
Shout out to Kyle.

1019
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,280
Okay, alright.

1020
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,280
Alright, let's go to questions.

1021
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,280
Everybody remember at Twitter,

1022
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,280
at TP Crassinators,

1023
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,280
ask us questions there on Saturday when we record this shit.

1024
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,280
Okay, let's see what we got here.

1025
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,280
First question by at Wienermeister says,

1026
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,280
what is a Chuck E. Cheese Fun Buck?

1027
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,280
Munchy, tell us, please.

1028
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,280
Why are friends...

1029
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,280
How did you know that we were going to watch Chuck E. Cheese?

1030
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,280
Why do they even watch the show

1031
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,280
if they don't know our official currency?

1032
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,280
The official PCP currency.

1033
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:13,280
It's another example of social media being bad, you know?

1034
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,280
We have these fans that are not even good.

1035
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,280
These fans, they don't even watch the PCP

1036
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,280
in Chuck E. Cheese.

1037
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,280
Like, we keep telling them that they're supposed to.

1038
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,280
You can only watch the PCP in a Chuck E. Cheese.

1039
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,280
That's the only time you're supposed to.

1040
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,280
And you know what?

1041
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,280
If you're not doing it fucking right.

1042
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,280
This question actually just reminded me

1043
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,280
of a point I did want to make about social media.

1044
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,280
And it's a grad to 4chan.

1045
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,280
My social media stuff is totally fine,

1046
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,280
but I spend way more of my time

1047
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,280
just anonymously browsing and posting on 4chan threads

1048
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,280
because I much prefer to be anonymous.

1049
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,280
And it's much more enjoyable to be appreciated

1050
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,280
on the value of your ideals, you know,

1051
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,280
in whatever context, or not your ideals,

1052
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,280
but your ideas that you put forward.

1053
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,280
Like, it's way more enjoyable to succeed

1054
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,280
in a pure meritocratic system like that.

1055
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,280
Okay, that's it. That's the whole point.

1056
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,280
But 4chan, wait a minute.

1057
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,280
Are you telling me that you've been the 4chaner

1058
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,280
this whole time?

1059
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,280
I am.

1060
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,280
The 4chaner 666.

1061
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,280
That is me.

1062
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,280
I am the legendary villain

1063
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,280
who's been playing the PCP for generations.

1064
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,280
It was me all along Jesse.

1065
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,280
It was me all along.

1066
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,280
You're that son of a bitch

1067
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,280
who said all the wrong things on 4chan

1068
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,280
about the stuff I like.

1069
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,280
I'm saying of all of you, dude.

1070
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,280
Oh my fucking god, Jesse.

1071
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,280
Oh my god. Oh my god.

1072
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,280
I hear you want to die real quick?

1073
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,280
Hold on. Let me tell you how you should do it.

1074
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,280
So I was on 4chan once.

1075
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,280
I'm sorry.

1076
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,280
Don't do it. Big mistake.

1077
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,280
But also, I saw a fucking web him

1078
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,280
of your video, of one of your videos.

1079
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,280
It was the Super Mario Bros. 3 one

1080
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,280
and it blew my gosh dang gasket out.

1081
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,280
Whoa, what?

1082
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,280
That's awesome.

1083
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,280
You said, well, I knew that

1084
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,280
a bunch of my shitty videos

1085
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,280
are memes and viral things.

1086
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,280
You're telling me

1087
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,280
that my Super Mario Bros. 3

1088
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,280
masturbating on the couch video

1089
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,280
that people actually...

1090
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,280
a web him?

1091
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,280
Yeah, I saw it on 4chan.

1092
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,280
I saw it on V1s.

1093
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,280
Was it the whole thing?

1094
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,280
I don't think it was the whole thing.

1095
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,280
I think it was just like 30 seconds.

1096
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,280
Well, that's pretty cool.

1097
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,280
It's the whole thing I'm fucking pissed

1098
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,280
because that's free-booting

1099
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,280
and I'll kill everyone involved.

1100
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,280
But if it's just a clip

1101
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,280
with big fucking gigantic words on it that says

1102
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,280
it's just property, go there.

1103
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,280
Then it's okay.

1104
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,280
You need to put giant watermarks

1105
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,280
across all your videos.

1106
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,280
We're not allowed to laugh at this

1107
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,280
unless you laugh at it on YouTube,

1108
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,280
on my channel, and subscribe,

1109
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,280
and Patreon, me and Les Jess.

1110
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,280
Speaking of that,

1111
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,280
I actually, you know,

1112
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,280
my Galco video has got a lot of views and shit.

1113
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,280
It's like somebody posted a 30-second clip of it

1114
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,280
on their Tumblr

1115
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,280
and got 17,000 responses or something,

1116
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,280
and I'm like, that's my 17,000.

1117
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,280
Give him back.

1118
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,280
Give him back, guys.

1119
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,280
Weaponize thickness, bro!

1120
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,280
No, no.

1121
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,280
Guys, shut up.

1122
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,280
He's weaponize thickness guy ever.

1123
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,280
You know what?

1124
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,280
That video going as viral as it did

1125
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,280
makes me so angry,

1126
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,280
not just because it sucks,

1127
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,280
but because all of your other videos

1128
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,280
are so good.

1129
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,280
And like, that weaponize thickness meme,

1130
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,280
everyone keeps repeating it.

1131
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,280
That's what I said before.

1132
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,280
People just repeat shit.

1133
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,280
It's so fucking annoying.

1134
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,280
No one has any creativity,

1135
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,280
no spark of life to them.

1136
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,280
And it's like, God,

1137
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,280
there's so many things that you've said

1138
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,280
that are funnier than that line.

1139
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
I know.

1140
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,280
It's funny if you're like an 80-year-old

1141
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,280
who's never heard a joke before.

1142
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,280
Guys, you know the show?

1143
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,280
Here's what the show said.

1144
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,280
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

1145
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,280
And you know, like, it's weird.

1146
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,280
I'm getting the sense that I think

1147
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,280
a lot of the reason the video was so popular

1148
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,280
is because it was passed along to like,

1149
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,280
I mean, I don't want to jump the gun and be too...

1150
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,280
Social justice warrior fat chicks.

1151
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,280
Kind of.

1152
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,280
Like, a lot of people I see

1153
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,280
responding to the thickness meme by being like,

1154
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,280
yeah, because I also say like real women have curves.

1155
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,280
Meanwhile, like in context,

1156
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,280
we're talking about fucking Galco,

1157
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,280
like the sexiest woman in the world,

1158
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,280
talking to a literal child with like,

1159
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,280
it's not that she's talking to like skinny bitches,

1160
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,280
like, yeah, I'm, you know, big and beautiful.

1161
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,280
No, you're not...

1162
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,280
You're not...

1163
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,280
If that's what you got out of that scene,

1164
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,280
you do not understand what I was trying to say.

1165
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,280
So please, people,

1166
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,280
educate yourselves.

1167
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,280
Those SJW fat chicks, you know,

1168
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,280
I used to think that SJWs were a force for good,

1169
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,280
but then the fat chicks started infiltrating their ranks.

1170
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,280
And they just tainted it like a cancer from within,

1171
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,280
a fat cancer.

1172
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,280
Yeah.

1173
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,280
Like, what is ethics in our journalism?

1174
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,280
God damn it!

1175
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,280
All I want is ethics!

1176
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,280
Damn you fat people!

1177
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,280
You ruined social justice!

1178
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,280
You ruined the movement!

1179
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,280
Now I have to go be a fucking all right F.A. Meemerman!

1180
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,280
Guys, please drop in our music job of the hut.

1181
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,280
I want one of those.

1182
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,280
Yep, it's true.

1183
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,280
Okay, I guess let's go to the next question.

1184
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,280
Okay, here's one.

1185
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,280
I don't know.

1186
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,280
This might be self-injured in masturbation,

1187
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,280
but after Kraft's dwarf here,

1188
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,280
my buddy, you know, a friend of the show,

1189
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,280
says, is there a PCB betting pool

1190
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,280
on the likelihood of Nate succeeding in Mia Maffova?

1191
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,280
Do you guys think I'm going to succeed?

1192
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,280
Do you think I'm going to fail?

1193
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,280
No.

1194
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,280
What do you think?

1195
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,280
You've already basically failed, haven't you?

1196
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,280
No.

1197
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,280
Like the second one was like after midnight, right?

1198
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,280
It was not.

1199
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,280
Look at the fucking date.

1200
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,280
It was on time.

1201
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,280
God damn it, they've all been on time so far.

1202
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,280
All right, all right.

1203
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,280
Yeah, I give that like two more days.

1204
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,280
You think so?

1205
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,280
We'll see.

1206
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,280
We'll see.

1207
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,280
Sorry, I cut out for the entirety of that question.

1208
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,280
Is Mama Mia fuck a butcher?

1209
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,280
This guy's like, is there a betting pool

1210
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,280
that Nate's going to fail at Mia Maffova?

1211
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,280
Nate, I watched the first one.

1212
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,280
Yeah.

1213
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,280
And I just saw, I was just like,

1214
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,280
all right, Nate's finally just going to make some vlogs.

1215
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,280
No, there's still a fuck ton of editing.

1216
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,280
I'm just like, what is wrong with you?

1217
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,280
I know, I can't stop.

1218
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,280
Just fucking talk.

1219
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,280
Like I'm trying to force myself to stop.

1220
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,280
Like that, but it's very hard.

1221
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,280
You know what, we need to,

1222
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,280
the new challenge for Mia Maffova,

1223
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,280
you should just make it all in Windows Movie Maker.

1224
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,280
You have to make it in that.

1225
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,280
That's not a bad idea.

1226
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,280
Maybe I'll do something like that.

1227
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,280
Yeah, you'll still make cuts.

1228
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,280
I will make cuts.

1229
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,280
And you'll do the thing where it goes all the different colors.

1230
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,280
Yeah, half the video will just be in Spectrum View

1231
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,280
and it'll just be like flashing colors.

1232
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,280
Yeah.

1233
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,280
By the way, teach me what Spectrum View is,

1234
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,280
because that sounds awesome.

1235
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,280
I don't actually understand what that is.

1236
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,280
It's like, have you ever seen,

1237
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,280
like all the old Windows Movie Maker,

1238
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,280
like AMVs where it like goes from like,

1239
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,280
it's like goes through the color spectrum,

1240
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,280
like it's all red and it's orange

1241
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,280
and it's, you know, yellow.

1242
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,280
Oh my God, that's awesome.

1243
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,280
Like phases through all the different colors.

1244
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,280
I really want to do that for like actual videos,

1245
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,280
but it's too difficult.

1246
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,280
Yeah, in the way.

1247
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,280
You want to click on Windows Movie Maker.

1248
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,280
We need to all get Windows Movie Maker.

1249
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,280
That's the end of it.

1250
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,280
By the way, guys, by the way, guys,

1251
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,280
if you want to know what Munchie sees the world as,

1252
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,280
like, I don't know if you guys know this,

1253
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,280
but I am, I'm like, I'm like reverse blood.

1254
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,280
Like I see way too much.

1255
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,280
I'm not supposed to be able to see.

1256
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:50,280
And if you want to be able to see the way I see,

1257
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,280
you have to do this.

1258
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,280
Download, hit, hit, like, like, hit Film 4,

1259
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,280
like, like record your day and then go in

1260
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,280
and you do the following.

1261
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,280
Maximize contrast.

1262
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,280
Crush blacks and whites.

1263
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,280
Then turn saturation all the way up.

1264
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,280
And then go into audio and turn gain all the way up

1265
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,280
and add reverb.

1266
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,280
And that's what everyday life is like.

1267
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,280
I thought crushing blacks and whites is what you did all day.

1268
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,280
Oh my God, I 100% believe you.

1269
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,280
Fuck yeah, that was awesome.

1270
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,280
That was the best joke ever.

1271
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,280
It's the only reason I fucking live, dude.

1272
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,280
It's the only reason I fucking live.

1273
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,280
That's the most like plausible, munchy theory.

1274
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:29,280
Like I totally believe that's how you see and hear the world.

1275
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,280
The only thing that makes sense.

1276
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,280
I don't know if you mentioned, maybe I missed this,

1277
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,280
but I expect some sort of like bug vision

1278
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,280
where there's like a thousand of each image

1279
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,280
appearing on your vision, on your eyes at all times.

1280
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,280
Something like that.

1281
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,280
Okay, here's bug vision, but it's all different images.

1282
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,280
Yeah.

1283
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,280
It's all the multiple realities that exist simultaneously

1284
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,280
being perceived at once.

1285
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,280
Of course, of course.

1286
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,280
I'm gonna call, bro.

1287
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,280
What can I say?

1288
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,280
I'm gonna call.

1289
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,280
Okay, here we go.

1290
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,280
At Anna Allen, I guess.

1291
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,280
At Anna Allen 4-4 says,

1292
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,280
Have any of you guys ever thought

1293
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,280
to go into stand-up comedy?

1294
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,280
Well, none of us really have any experience

1295
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,280
with stand-up comedy or anything.

1296
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,280
None of us have any interest in that.

1297
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,280
Whatever.

1298
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,280
Wait, I'm a real comedian.

1299
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,280
I'm not a YouTuber.

1300
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,280
I don't want to be this.

1301
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,280
This isn't me.

1302
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,280
This isn't the real me.

1303
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,280
I'm gonna get out of this one day.

1304
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,280
It's gonna be a fucking distant memory.

1305
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,280
I swear to God, I'll be a real boy.

1306
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,280
I'm gonna be real.

1307
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,280
This isn't me.

1308
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,280
This isn't YouTube.

1309
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,280
It's not real.

1310
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,280
I hate social media.

1311
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,280
I hate podcasts.

1312
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,280
You know what?

1313
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,280
I would love to...

1314
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,280
This is what I was supposed to be.

1315
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,280
You're right, dude.

1316
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,280
We all need to escape.

1317
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,280
I think...

1318
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,280
I've thought about it.

1319
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,280
I mean, you know, Jesse's actually done it,

1320
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,280
so he's a real boy.

1321
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,280
I've just thought about it a little bit,

1322
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,280
and I like the idea of doing it,

1323
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,280
because you're around actual human beings,

1324
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,280
and that appeals to me.

1325
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,280
But, Nate,

1326
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,280
how are you gonna cut between clips?

1327
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,280
Oh, no!

1328
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,280
How are you gonna crush blacks and whites, Nate?

1329
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,280
How are you gonna crush black and whites?

1330
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,280
I'll bring my crowbar and see what I can do with that.

1331
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,280
Crowbar is crowbar,

1332
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,280
and you'll fucking destroy the timeline.

1333
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:57,280
By killing so many white people and black people,

1334
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,280
you'll fucking evaporate everything.

1335
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,280
That's enough undertale references

1336
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,280
for one-day munchie, okay?

1337
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,280
Oh, no!

1338
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,280
It's the only thing I care about!

1339
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,280
Love is Sonic 1,

1340
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,280
and I'm social media,

1341
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,280
which I love,

1342
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,280
and I'm just the biggest postage child for.

1343
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,280
Remember when we finally beat Undertale,

1344
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,280
and right at the end,

1345
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,280
like, Asgore comes out and he goes,

1346
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,280
okay, that's enough munchie references for one day.

1347
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,280
That was pretty good.

1348
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,280
And then Fly comes in and says,

1349
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,280
get on the ground!

1350
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,280
Life is really the biggest undertale of all.

1351
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,280
Okay, here we go.

1352
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,280
At ZombieNinjaCow says,

1353
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,280
opinion on birds,

1354
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,280
gay or okay, cool or drool.

1355
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,280
Good question, dude.

1356
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,280
Both cool and okay.

1357
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,280
Birds are tight.

1358
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,280
I think it's a combination of cool and drool.

1359
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,280
You know what, okay.

1360
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,280
Birds are tight, they're sweet,

1361
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,280
they're hella good,

1362
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,280
and hella nice, too.

1363
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,280
I drool whenever I see one.

1364
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,280
That wasn't a joke.

1365
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,280
I drool because...

1366
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,280
I saw a bird at my window.

1367
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,280
I saw him, and he was fine.

1368
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,280
I'm the hunger.

1369
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,280
I drool at them because they are delicious

1370
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,280
and also sexually arousing.

1371
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,280
Right, right.

1372
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,280
And also the, you know, the birds.

1373
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,280
All right, I'm hearing a lot of positive bird,

1374
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,280
you know, propaganda going on here.

1375
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,280
I think you guys might be all Twitter sleeper agents

1376
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,280
with your fucking social media.

1377
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,280
Fuck you, okay.

1378
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,280
Birds invented Twitter,

1379
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,280
and they can destroy it.

1380
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,280
I'm gonna crack your poop.

1381
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,280
Here we go.

1382
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,280
At MichaelCera4,

1383
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,280
hey Michael,

1384
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,280
I enjoy your content,

1385
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,280
says Nate,

1386
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,280
how do I become a strong boy?

1387
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,280
And you guys can all feel free to comment on this.

1388
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,280
You eat rocks and...

1389
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,280
Yes!

1390
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,280
Oh my god.

1391
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,280
Oh my god.

1392
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,280
Okay, okay, okay.

1393
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,280
Here's how you do it.

1394
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,280
Nate, shut the fuck up and learn your place,

1395
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,280
you goddamn bitch.

1396
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,280
Yes, sir.

1397
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,280
Get rocks.

1398
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,280
You get rocks and sharpen your mouth with them.

1399
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,280
You get the dirtiest rocks you can,

1400
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,280
and just sharpen your teeth

1401
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,280
until you can bite off more.

1402
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,280
It's like webkins, you know?

1403
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,280
You gotta crush some fucking heads

1404
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,280
so you can crush even more heads.

1405
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,280
It's like Cookie Clicker,

1406
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,280
only with rocks and teeth

1407
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,280
and grinding and destroying your enemies.

1408
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,280
You just have to make your teeth so sharp

1409
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,280
and crack bones just by licking them

1410
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,280
with your fork-tooth tongue.

1411
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,280
Uh, that's a good start.

1412
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,280
After that,

1413
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,280
just go to 4chan.org.

1414
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,280
No, go to the gym.

1415
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,280
Don't go to 4chan, you idiot.

1416
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,280
You gotta get educated

1417
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,280
or you'll go to the gym

1418
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,280
and you'll just fuck around

1419
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,280
and waste your time.

1420
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,280
Okay, do a little bit of research

1421
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,280
so you can come up with a plan.

1422
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,280
Just do starting strength.

1423
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,280
Just Google starting strength,

1424
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,280
just do exactly that,

1425
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,280
and just by doing it,

1426
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,280
you'll be like,

1427
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,280
okay, I need to learn other things

1428
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,280
and you'll figure out other shit you can do.

1429
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,280
There you go.

1430
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,280
Here's your cheat sheet.

1431
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,280
Rocks.

1432
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,280
Dirty rocks.

1433
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,280
Yeah, just powerful rocks.

1434
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,280
Rock soup.

1435
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,280
I play Wii Fit

1436
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,280
and that's all I need.

1437
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,280
I bought Wii Fit once

1438
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,280
and I thought it was gonna be fun.

1439
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,280
I spent like $200 on the Wii Fit

1440
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,280
and all the accessories.

1441
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,280
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.

1442
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,280
I was gonna be really fun.

1443
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,280
God, such an idiot.

1444
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,280
How we fit this fucking rocket

1445
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,280
down your fucking throat?

1446
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,280
What do you think about that?

1447
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,280
You fucking government insider?

1448
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,280
You fucking neo-Nazi skinhead?

1449
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,280
I got my drones patrolling.

1450
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,280
They're gonna defend me from that shit.

1451
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,280
Okay, last question.

1452
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,280
Here we go.

1453
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,280
At Miguel Achoans 1,

1454
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,280
I think that's right,

1455
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,280
says,

1456
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,280
do you guys ever feel like doing YouTube

1457
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,280
isn't worth all the bullshit?

1458
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,280
No, I've never had that thought

1459
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,280
in my entire life.

1460
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,280
I've never had any sentiment

1461
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,280
even close to that.

1462
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,280
I think not doing YouTube

1463
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,280
is probably a bad idea.

1464
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:43,280
Well, you know,

1465
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,280
YouTube has given me hope

1466
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,280
that I'll be able to do something more interesting

1467
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,280
than just code all my life.

1468
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,280
YouTube has given you all the hope

1469
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,280
it's sapped away from me.

1470
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,280
Yeah, that's definitely...

1471
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,280
I'd say so.

1472
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,280
Before I started doing any YouTube shit,

1473
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,280
I was just doing my school shit.

1474
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,280
It was really boring.

1475
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,280
I was not really having a good time.

1476
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,280
And doing YouTube is what I enjoy most in life

1477
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,280
and just want to do it all the time.

1478
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,280
I feel similarly.

1479
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,280
If I hadn't tried at all,

1480
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,280
then I wouldn't have any friends

1481
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,280
and I would be really, really bad at talking still, probably.

1482
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,280
That's good.

1483
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,280
Be worse, I'm sure.

1484
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,280
How many clothes do you think can fit on your body

1485
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,280
and have it still be comfortable?

1486
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,280
Oh, I've done this.

1487
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,280
I've done this.

1488
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,280
All of them.

1489
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,280
Good, good job.

1490
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,280
You won.

1491
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,280
You won.

1492
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,280
You passed the test.

1493
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,280
I'm going to send you to Antarctica.

1494
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,280
Cool.

1495
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,280
That's right, that's what you'll find with my dad.

1496
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,280
I did actually wear all of my underwear at once

1497
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,280
just because I had a lot of it.

1498
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,280
And it really hurt.

1499
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,280
Dude, everything's giving.

1500
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,280
Everything's giving as your tradition.

1501
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,280
I wear my pants as a shirt and my shirt as pants.

1502
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,280
That's not a joke.

1503
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,280
I do that every year as tradition.

1504
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,280
That's impressive.

1505
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,280
Dude, I disagree.

1506
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,280
I hate, I'm only comfortable.

1507
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,280
The only clothes that is good is no clothes.

1508
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,280
The only time I'm comfortable is when I'm like butt naked,

1509
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,280
maybe socks, and like a big blanket,

1510
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,280
and I can like spread it open like a moth man

1511
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:14,280
and be like, like captured girls in my wingspan.

1512
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,280
If you're a man walking on the streets tonight.

1513
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,280
Yes.

1514
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,280
Munchy, Munchy, I must know, do you have it

1515
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,280
so that the bottom of the t-shirt goes up

1516
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,280
and then your legs go through the arms

1517
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,280
and then your penis is dangling from the ankle.

1518
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,280
That's exactly how it is.

1519
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,280
Oh, that's great.

1520
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,280
Good job.

1521
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,280
I love that.

1522
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,280
Somebody draw that.

1523
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,280
You crazy, you draw that shit.

1524
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,280
I know you're on this.

1525
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,280
Guys, if you just draw me, then you will see Pee Pee

1526
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,280
out of the corner of your eye.

1527
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,280
Oh, God.

1528
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,280
You're gross.

1529
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,280
That's a sin.

1530
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,280
Okay, that's enough.

1531
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,280
Thanks for asking all the questions, everybody.

1532
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,280
Make sure you tweet us more at attpcrasinators

1533
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,280
next time, next Saturday.

1534
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,280
Support my watch, my watch sauce.

1535
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,280
I'm going to remake Watchman with sauce.

1536
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,280
That wasn't a joke.

1537
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,280
That's an actual thing.

1538
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,280
I'm going to be doing that.

1539
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,280
I hope you look forward to it.

1540
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,280
Every character will be sauce, report to me

1541
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,280
which sauce you want to be who.

1542
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,280
I'm going to put it A1.

1543
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,280
I'm going to get all the sauce.

1544
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,280
I'm going to get all it in real life

1545
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,280
and actually get the film and put it on

1546
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,280
an actual real millimeter film.

1547
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,280
I'm going to put the sauce over it

1548
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,280
and it'll be really good, guys.

1549
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,280
Thank you for having me to support my book,

1550
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,280
Watch Sauce.

1551
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,280
Thank you.

1552
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:22,280
Also send boobs to my Snapchat, the Hippocrite man.

1553
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,280
That's the only social media I will be using

1554
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,280
from now on.

1555
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,280
Please, please.

1556
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,280
Yes, also all sexy women.

1557
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,280
Send me pictures of yourself.

1558
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,280
Or, you know, alternatively, have sex with me.

1559
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,280
But Snapchat me at, was it Nate Bestman?

1560
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,280
Yeah, do that.

1561
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,280
Do that.

1562
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,280
That's what I want.

1563
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,280
Also everything those guys said,

1564
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,280
but for me and not them.

1565
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,280
Don't say you're a woman.

1566
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,280
And then I'll leave you.

1567
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,280
Wait, Jesse, what did you say?

1568
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:48,280
Everyone, not them, but me.

1569
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,280
What they said, but with me.

1570
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,280
All the women, all the money, all the girls,

1571
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,280
all the good stuff.

1572
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,280
I said it first like it first dibs.

1573
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,280
First is the worst dibs.

1574
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,280
First is the worst.

1575
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,280
All the motorcycles, all the fancy sneakers.

1576
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,280
It's all mine, baby.

1577
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,280
I've got it.

1578
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,280
It's all, I'm hoarding it.

1579
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,280
I'm going to try out my new brand of shoes.

1580
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,280
I refuse this reality.

1581
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,280
No, guys, protect your fancy sneakers from Ben.

1582
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,280
He's a known sneaker thief.

1583
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,280
Watch out.

1584
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,280
That was the best thing that ever happened

1585
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,280
to any of us all the time.

1586
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,280
Nate, Nate, please.

1587
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,280
I don't know if you ever said this before.

1588
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,280
Bring me to the masses, guys.

1589
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,280
Make this a meme.

1590
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,280
Explain the sneaker story.

1591
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,280
Please, Nate.

1592
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,280
Yeah, okay.

1593
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,280
I think this is going to be covered in something before.

1594
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,280
Okay, but I'll just tell it before we end.

1595
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,280
So I had these fancy ass sneakers in college,

1596
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,280
and they were fucking dope.

1597
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,280
And I didn't bring them with me

1598
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,280
when I moved out to fucking Ohio.

1599
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,280
So they were still in Massachusetts

1600
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,280
in the closet or whatever.

1601
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:42,280
And so when RideCon 2 happens, I believe,

1602
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,280
or maybe it was RideCon 1,

1603
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,280
I get to Digi's house,

1604
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,280
and I embrace Digi as a brother.

1605
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,280
I turn the corner, and what do I see

1606
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,280
adorning the feet of this Judas?

1607
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,280
Of this Judas Ben St.

1608
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,280
But my fucking immaculate sneakers,

1609
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,280
my fucking pricey ass sneakers,

1610
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,280
that when I say,

1611
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,280
Ben, why have you done this to me?

1612
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,280
Why have you taken what was rightfully mine?

1613
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,280
My poor sneakers.

1614
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,280
And he just looks at me,

1615
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,280
he's like,

1616
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,280
Mom said I could have them.

1617
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,280
Mom said I could take them.

1618
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,280
They were my sneakers.

1619
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,280
She didn't have permission

1620
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,280
to give away my fucking sneakers.

1621
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,280
So Ben, to this day,

1622
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,280
insists that no wrongdoing was ever committed

1623
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,280
on anyone's behalf,

1624
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,280
and he will not apologize

1625
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,280
for the sin he has committed

1626
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,280
against me and our family.

1627
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,280
And until he does,

1628
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,280
I will have his blood.

1629
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,280
I will kill him.

1630
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,280
Introducing a new brand of shoes

1631
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,280
by Munchy Minstrel shoes.

1632
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,280
I get Air Jordan's,

1633
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,280
and I cover them in Minstrel sauce.

1634
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,280
Is that what Robo Boop de Wares?

1635
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,280
Is that his tactical dancing skills?

1636
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,280
Yeah, it's tactical dancing

1637
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,280
for ninja footing.

1638
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,280
Fuck this, fuck this.

1639
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,280
Yeah, we're done.

1640
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,280
Bye.

1641
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,280
See you later everybody.

1642
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,280
Bye.

1643
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,280
Bye.

1644
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,280
Don't come back.

1645
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,280
Don't.

1646
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,280
That wasn't me,

1647
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,280
like putting on the drums.

1648
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,280
Oh Munchy,

1649
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,280
I'm taking,

1650
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,280
I'm crapping my pants

1651
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,280
all over your turnips.

1652
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,280
I'm crapping on your turnips.

1653
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,280
I'm sorry,

1654
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,280
I can't help myself.

1655
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,280
Stop it.

1656
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,280
I'm

1657
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,280
crapping

1658
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,280
my

1659
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,280
pants.

1660
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,280
I'm

1661
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,280

1662
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,280

1663
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,280

1667
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,280

1668
