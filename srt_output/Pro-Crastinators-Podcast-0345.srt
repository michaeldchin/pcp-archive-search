1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Gibb, you start the shit.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, no, you interrupted me.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Sorry, sorry.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
My intro was so good and you ruined it.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now it's shattered into little pieces.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've fallen over.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's like that image of the Pepe Frog.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When they have the lunch tray and they fell over and they're crying.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They're crying and everyone around them is laughing about it.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, it's that other frog.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No, it's the Pepe Frog.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The Pepe Frog.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, but it's not Pepe.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's like the little autistic one.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, yeah.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's like the slightly melty looking one.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I always think of them as the same guy.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's just drawn funny.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think he's...

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think he might be named Pipo or something.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, Pipo.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's the one that Amy Therese always posts.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Welcome to the Procrastinus podcast.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What can I get for you?

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll have...

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll have a...

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
a Pedialyte.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We run out.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What?

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We run out of those.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Can I have a glass of seawater?

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just jump in the ocean.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Just jump in the ocean.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Idiot.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I want to pay for it.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Andrew Tate said that I shouldn't just drink water because water is free.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I should drink sparkling water because it costs money.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's rich man's water.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's piss man's water.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Same with the ocean.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I need to pay two and a half dollars for it.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I need you to put a slice of lemon in it.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Instead of wading out into the ocean to piss,

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
he wades out into a swimming pool of sparkling water.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I need to go to a restaurant to piss.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I need to piss in my seawater

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
from an establishment.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I needed electrolytes.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I was...

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I think I was depleted of electrolytes this morning.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh no.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Where did you put them?

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know, that's a great question.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've recently learned that apparently people drink Pedialyte

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
as like a hangover cure.

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Even though it's baby food.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's like baby food.

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you a hangover?

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, I'm not a hangover.

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I just...

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I just think I needed some salt.

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's okay.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I ate some Kirkland brand

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
cauliflower crust supreme

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
pizza, so I think I'm good now.

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Alright.

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah. Okay.

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Welcome to the Procrastiners podcast.

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Welcome to the show. Hey, I finished Medical Soul.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Did you get around to watching any more of it?

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No shit.

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have not

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
got watched any more of it, actually.

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I've had a...

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have a lot of things that I

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
have meaning to

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
finish that I have not finished yet.

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You and everybody.

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah.

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I could get into those things, but

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
how is

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Better Call Saul?

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I like it. It's a very, very good show.

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And it was good.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't want to spoil anything.

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's good. That's good.

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Tell me

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
what happens, but without spoiling anything.

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well,

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
let's just say

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Saul got a call

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and he spoke on the phone.

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And he's better.

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And he's better now.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes. Nice.

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
did not play anymore. I have not made any more progress in Disco Elysium.

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, I started that.

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I started that today.

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, you did. Cool.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How is that for you?

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm liking it. I like the detective work.

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I like the...

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I like how when you've got like stats

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
in various mind

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
things and body things, they'll come up

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
in your internal dialogue.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So like...

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Somebody says something and then your logic

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
brain comes in and says, well, what that means

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is this. And I'm like, oh,

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
thanks. I'm dumb. I wouldn't have known.

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah.

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So I think this has been

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
much remarked upon,

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but it's interesting how

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
in Disco Elysium, those stats,

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
they're not just things that you can do.

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They're proclivities

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
of yours. So like if you have a lot of logic,

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it's not just that you can

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
logically deduce things

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that you couldn't otherwise.

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's that you will approach

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
a task with logic, even if another

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
solution might be better.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So like if you have lots of

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
stats in logic, you might

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
use a logical approach to a solution

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
when like a more emotional one

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
might have been better. Just because

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that's like what you are

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
geared towards doing.

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, it's interesting. There's a few times

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
when it's like a part of

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
my psyche comes forward and says,

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
how about this? And I'm like,

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
eh. Yeah.

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Nah. And they're like, um,

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
come on though. Come on.

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Electrochemistry is always trying to get me

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to do drugs.

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah.

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And he's got to stop that

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
because I'm staying clean.

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, I'm playing as

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
a person would.

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Not like a gamer.

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because I've seen that it's

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
like role playing,

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but you're an

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
amnesiac. You forgot everything.

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So I'm as the player learning

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
this character I'm playing as.

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But I'm only doing things

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I feel like I would do if I

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
was also trying to figure out

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
who I was. Yeah.

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's fun that way.

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm pretty much doing the same.

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm picking

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the most me

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
answers to things.

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And yeah, generally

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
that means that I'm apologizing

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
a lot because I feel bad because

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
apparently I went on a drug bender

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and gave myself brain damage and now

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't do my job as a policeman

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and I'm a huge failure.

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's funny. I've seen all

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the sorry options and I haven't been

180
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
clicking them mostly because I'm too awkward

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to admit that I was I've lost

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
my memory. Have you are you just trying

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
to like you just trying to play it cool?

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm trying to wing it and hoping that nobody

185
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
notices. That's good.

186
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The more information I get, I'm like, oh, okay,

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm on a case and I got this.

188
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I did have to tell my partner

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
at some point because

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I had to radio in say I lost my badge,

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
but earlier I told him that I had

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
the badge and he's like, oh,

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
oh, okay.

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I'm like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied.

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I died a couple

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
time where I lost a couple times and I had to

198
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
restart. And I think the first couple

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
times I told my station that I lost the

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
badge, but like

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I didn't deliberately save scum, but I just

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
had to do that section again. And so I think

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the third time I did it, I told them like,

204
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
nah, I'm just going to tell him I didn't lose

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the badge and they believed it. So

206
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
it actually worked eventually.

207
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, they made fun of me.

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I was like, yeah, okay.

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I need to do,

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I need info.

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They still made fun of me because they know

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I lost my gun, but

213
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
they don't know. Oh, I lied about that.

214
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They made fun of me. No, they did.

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They know I lost my badge. I lied about losing

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
my gun. They don't, they don't know I lost my

217
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
gun. So it was the same then. Yeah.

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I was like, I can't, I can't take

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
double

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
laughter. I need to pretend I'm cool.

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Mm-hmm.

223
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We'll see how long that lasts.

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I died immediately

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
upon starting the game.

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I clicked around on things

227
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and I turned the light on, which gave me

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
one point of damage and I was like, ah, fuck.

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But then I tried to grab

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,680
the ceiling, the tie on the ceiling fan, and I failed and I died.

232
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,120
I have died twice.

233
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,600
The only time it's happened, but it's funny that, like, before I even knew how the game

234
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,000
worked, I died him immediately.

235
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,600
That's really funny.

236
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Okay, have you met, have you met Measurehead?

237
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,120
No, I'm not too far in.

238
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
I've walked around a couple places.

239
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,960
I haven't talked to the rioters or the union people.

240
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,480
I talked to the old lady on the boat.

241
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,240
I talked to the little kids.

242
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,120
You met Kuno and the, and the far, well, I call her the forest girl.

243
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,680
Yeah, I met them.

244
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,960
Um, okay, I've had two losses and they're like, I'm doing a lot better now.

245
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,040
Like I got a bunch of medicine and now I'm like not really in danger of losing anytime

246
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
soon.

247
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,120
But like early on, I was very, very frail and I died once.

248
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,480
I won't say anymore.

249
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,800
I'll just say it was a, it wasn't even really a fight.

250
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,680
It was just, I got in like a physical, some in a bit of a physical confrontation and just

251
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,520
like the strain of it made me have a heart attack and die because of my weakened state

252
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,520
and I just died.

253
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,840
And then the other time I lost was, um, it was when the forest girl just started crying

254
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,680
and the rape just started yelling that I was going to rape her and I was just so demoralized

255
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,960
by that, that I lost my morale points and I lost my will to be a cop and I quit the

256
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
forest.

257
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Oh, whoa.

258
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Yeah.

259
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,200
I haven't run into a situation where I lose a morale point for some reason.

260
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,720
No, I, yeah, I've had, I've had one physical loss and one morale loss and the morale loss

261
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,200
was a lot funnier.

262
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Yeah, I think.

263
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,240
It was when I asked who's Kuno.

264
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,520
The girl just starts crying, rape, rape.

265
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
I'm like, oh God, no.

266
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,800
Yeah, they, they did that for a bit.

267
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
I could tell he was trying to get a rise out of me.

268
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,040
He wanted like me to do something and I turned around like, yeah, I don't need, I don't have

269
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
time for this.

270
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
And he said, ha, ha, you're my bitch.

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
You'll do, I got you.

272
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,120
Kuno rides the lightning.

273
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,280
He's a little, he's a little, he's a little freak.

274
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
He's riding the lightning.

275
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
You know what?

276
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Just let him.

277
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Let him cook.

278
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Yeah, let him cook.

279
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,240
Let him cook.

280
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,600
Have you investigated his, his, his like area?

281
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
I've looked around.

282
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,200
I found a door and I went in.

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah.

284
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,720
It's like a little kid's playhouse.

285
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
His little shack.

286
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Yeah.

287
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Kuno's shack.

288
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,640
I tried to investigate the body.

289
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,320
I'm, I went, I threw up the first time.

290
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Yeah.

291
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
They said, boy, should get ammonia.

292
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
So I went, found, got ammonia, bought it from the store, I came back.

293
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,560
Failed again.

294
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Yep.

295
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,880
Then it was what happened to me.

296
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,520
Then you got to get your shit together.

297
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
I got my shit together.

298
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,080
I failed again.

299
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
And then.

300
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,720
Even after getting your shit together.

301
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Yeah.

302
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,960
It was like a 50% chance and I failed.

303
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,960
And then it was like, okay, well, I just got to go do something else.

304
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,880
I think if you just, I think if you just wait a while, like I think it gets easier and easier

305
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,040
like as the days pass.

306
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,920
Uh, I think.

307
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm still on day one.

308
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,280
So I haven't done that much because I think, I think I, I think I investigated the body

309
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,280
on day two and yeah, I got my shit together and I think I also got an extra modifier

310
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,360
because like time had passed and like the smell had become not as like less bad.

311
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
That's odd though.

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,440
It's already been there for like a week.

313
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,120
Why would the smell get better?

314
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Yeah.

315
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,720
I mean, it would eventually start to get better.

316
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
I don't know if it would.

317
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Maybe you just get used to it a week.

318
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Yeah.

319
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,160
I don't know.

320
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Maybe because it had, it had frozen.

321
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Uh, no.

322
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,480
But if it's getting warmer, it would smell even worse.

323
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,440
Did you investigate the footprints?

324
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I did.

325
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
I did all the footprints.

326
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
I was so smart.

327
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,080
How is he so good at identifying shoe sizes?

328
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,880
Uh, he's a rain man.

329
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
He is.

330
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Do you know?

331
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,600
He's got that, that autistic sight.

332
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Do you know your name?

333
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,560
I know the, I'm a clipboard.

334
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,880
There's initials and I assumed that there's a, some, probably my name.

335
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't know what it is though.

336
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Yeah.

337
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
All right.

338
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm thinking that coat that's hanging up is my coat.

339
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,680
The one on like the railing?

340
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Yeah.

341
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,840
It's my coat and it's probably got my gun on my badge in it because I mean, they'd probably

342
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,920
be in that if I leave them anywhere.

343
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,520
A reasonable assumption.

344
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,880
I tried to jump over the thing, but he got, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he

345
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
bitch out.

346
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
He bitched out.

347
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Yeah.

348
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
I bitched out.

349
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
I didn't, I didn't make the jump.

350
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,760
I, well, I won't, I won't, uh, I think, you know, spoilies.

351
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
I like to figure stuff out.

352
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,560
I think I got to the coat in an unusual way.

353
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,280
I think I got there in a way that I kind of like wasn't supposed to, but like, I mean,

354
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,840
there is a door, but I just don't know how to get to that door.

355
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
So yeah.

356
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
For sure.

357
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,280
I'm going to, I think my plan right now is to spend my experience points to level up

358
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,520
my endurance or something so I can try approaching the body again.

359
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,280
There's another, there's a couple other things.

360
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,640
I still haven't got my tie.

361
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,120
I failed to get my tie.

362
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,240
You still haven't gotten like from the fan.

363
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Yeah.

364
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
That's funny.

365
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
It's just up there.

366
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,880
I have to, I have to spend a point in Savoy fair or whatever.

367
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Yeah.

368
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,160
I have to try again.

369
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,040
My, um, I think they were, okay, I've heard that there's like things to do with the tie,

370
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,320
but like I think my stats are just like wrong and I, and like they're not, none of them

371
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
have happened for me.

372
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,440
What are your like stats in, by the way, what's what like class did you choose?

373
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I made my own.

374
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I did.

375
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Uh, good.

376
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
I can't remember the top two were good and good.

377
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,560
And then it was weak and weak, but you don't remember what the ones were that you like

378
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
focused on.

379
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,800
I think it was an intellect.

380
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,720
Um, and I chose the, the conceptualize as my special skill.

381
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,680
I'm pretty good with empathy.

382
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,280
So whatever one that is in, interesting.

383
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,360
And the ones I'm bad at are like, uh, like acrobatics and fucking endurance or whatever.

384
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Yeah.

385
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,840
I'm a nerd, but I'm a smart nerd.

386
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,880
I, I went, I went with thinker.

387
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,320
So I'm, I'm like maxed out in an encyclopedia.

388
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,480
And I think like logic is pretty good and I'm pretty, I'm pretty bad at everything else.

389
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,120
I like the conceptualize cause it comes off occasionally as like, that's like, yeah, I

390
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,760
like that.

391
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,400
I let encyclopedia is fun just cause it gives you like facts that you wouldn't know otherwise.

392
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,800
Um, what are their, uh, what are their like NPCs?

393
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,560
Have you talked to that have been interesting?

394
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,560
Uh, I talked to the manager of the little place.

395
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,480
The whirling and rags, the whirling and rags.

396
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,880
And yeah, I talked to the manager.

397
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
I'm not the bartender.

398
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Yeah.

399
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:33,480
Uh, there was the thing where he thought he made the lady quit cause he asked for her

400
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
number.

401
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,680
And when I talked to her through the radio, yeah, I tried to be, I tried to get the way

402
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm playing it as I'm like, if I sense that there might be like, if somebody might clam

403
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,640
up, if I say the wrong thing, I try to be cautious.

404
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,840
So I managed to go get some, sometimes they do.

405
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,360
Sometimes you can say something that will like change a person's attitude.

406
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,800
Yeah.

407
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,240
And so I was, I was pretty cautious with the lady cause she seemed like she didn't like

408
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,040
me and it was, it became clear.

409
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,440
That I was, I was a bad guy.

410
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Yeah.

411
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,800
But I managed to clear things up between her and the guy cause she doesn't hate him.

412
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,040
And I told him that it was a good Samaritan.

413
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,960
Oh, that's funny.

414
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,320
Yeah.

415
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,360
She told me like she, she was like surprised that I thought that it was because of him.

416
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,800
But I didn't get any like options to maybe it's because you have empathy and I don't.

417
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,400
But like, yeah, I didn't, I didn't get the option to tell him that lol.

418
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,560
Sucks to be him.

419
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,720
Yeah, I'm buttering people up.

420
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,880
I'm the butter guy.

421
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Butter guy.

422
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,160
Have you, have you been in the bookstore?

423
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
No, I saw that.

424
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
I didn't go in.

425
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,960
I spoke, I went past it, spoke to the lady on the boat.

426
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,680
Oh, Joyce, Joyce, the, the, the rich woman, wild, the wild pines lady.

427
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes.

428
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,680
Yeah, talked to her about state of the, state of the union.

429
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,000
The ultra liberal.

430
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,040
Yeah.

431
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,840
If you, if she will admit to being an ultra liberal, if you ask the right questions.

432
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,120
I, I did not.

433
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,080
I see.

434
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,120
I, I didn't want to like, because I was still, I don't know, early in investigating.

435
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:24,960
Yeah.

436
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,800
I didn't really want to make anyone mad at me.

437
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,920
So I'm just sort of like nodding, sagely, quiet and not really saying anything.

438
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,800
That could make them upset.

439
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,120
I still, I still haven't really like, firmly picked sides in anything.

440
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,160
I see the things where it's like, haha, yeah, unions are cool.

441
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,120
I hate the rich, you know, things where you can say that.

442
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,760
And I'm like, yeah, but I shouldn't say that to her, though.

443
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,120
I need her for info.

444
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,640
Yeah.

445
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,400
I don't, I mean, hmm.

446
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,760
I did, I did say some, I did say some pretty communist stuff to her, actually.

447
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,320
I don't know if you want to know what she said.

448
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,480
It's not a huge spoiler or anything, but if you want to.

449
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,040
Well, the ultra liberal thing.

450
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
She was, she didn't say that to me.

451
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,800
She's, she's actually, she's cool with it.

452
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,840
She just kind of laughs.

453
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,320
She's kind of like, haha, yeah.

454
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,880
It's like, it's kind of charming.

455
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,280
I think she probably is bad.

456
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,520
Like, I think her company.

457
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,600
Honestly, I'm still, I'm still feeling it out.

458
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,760
I think wild pines is probably bad, but she seems nice.

459
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,840
She, she, uh, did she talk about disco at all?

460
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,560
Uh, no.

461
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,920
She and, uh, the protagonist seem to be of an age and seems like they were both

462
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,200
like around when they were younger, you know, disco was the big thing.

463
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,840
She's just like, yeah.

464
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,560
Hey, I remember, I remember disco.

465
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,440
Yeah.

466
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,000
Communism might have been cool, but they lost.

467
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,640
Oh, well.

468
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
Uh, very nice.

469
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,640
I like her.

470
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,440
I assume you have not met the union boss.

471
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,640
No, I saw the people shouting and I'm like, okay, well, I still don't know.

472
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,360
Yeah.

473
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,040
I'm still trying to get in to, uh, to, uh, to inspect the body.

474
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,440
So I just, I didn't want to like open too many threads.

475
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,000
So I left them for a moment.

476
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,160
I need to go back and talk to the, uh, the, the right to work, uh, protest people.

477
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,720
There's like, I know there's like, there's like threads there that I have

478
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,920
not followed up on.

479
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,160
And, uh, I guess the last thing that happened was I found a bag and now I'm

480
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,280
picking up trash.

481
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,840
Oh, I was so stoked when I found the bag.

482
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,440
I, I didn't find it until the second day, which.

483
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,720
Was really frustrating because, uh, I really wanted money on the first day.

484
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,600
I was really hurting for money and I saw all these bottles around.

485
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,360
I was like, I just want to collect the bottles.

486
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,160
I just want money.

487
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,440
And I didn't, and, uh, oh, I just, I just had to live with that.

488
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,000
But it was, I think they should have allowed you to pick up a single

489
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,720
bottle with one hand instead of like, if you don't have a bag, you can't

490
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,440
pick up any.

491
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,520
Honestly, what?

492
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,520
And like, bring it, bring it, bring one bottle at a time to the bottle return.

493
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,960
Like if you're, if, if you're like, this is all you got.

494
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,240
It's the only thing you can do and you really need cash.

495
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,480
Like, I think if you're desperate enough, you would do that.

496
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,240
I think that that would know, you know what?

497
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,440
I think you're totally wrong and it's good that they did what they did.

498
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,920
They should not, they should not allow you to play the game in such a miserable way.

499
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,160
Yeah.

500
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,760
No, like if you take your pants off, you tie the ends of the pants, you got a huge bag.

501
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,200
And you go around picking up trash off naked.

502
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,200
Yeah.

503
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,760
Okay.

504
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
The thing is, if, if you know what you're doing, like you would just

505
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,000
know where the bag was and you could just go get it, like immediately.

506
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,120
If you just wanted to collect all that stuff, like I didn't know where it was.

507
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,360
I had to find it, but that's okay.

508
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,680
I was like deliberately like not looking up things in advance.

509
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,360
I have other things I could say about some characters, but you haven't met

510
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
several of them yet.

511
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,640
So I won't get into it.

512
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,520
I'm sort of being a communist, but like I said, I haven't really like firmly

513
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,440
committed to it.

514
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,920
I haven't like, yeah.

515
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,400
I feel committed to being a detective.

516
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
I like figuring stuff out.

517
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,080
Yeah.

518
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
I'm going to, I'm going to find this mystery.

519
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,520
Yeah.

520
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,160
Who did the killings and how did they do the killings?

521
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,840
That's my first.

522
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
Do you have, do you have any leads?

523
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
Do you have any leads on the, on the, the murder?

524
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,840
Well, I know all the work boots in the, the footprints and stuff as the small set

525
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,520
of footprints could be a lady, could be a child.

526
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,440
And there's the, you know, there's like something, but like nothing that I can

527
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
really follow up on.

528
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,320
I'm mostly at the, I'm trying to find my badge and gun.

529
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,400
Okay.

530
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,680
So I took to the, what's her face?

531
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,760
Still don't know who called in the body.

532
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,880
And you mean the woman on the phone?

533
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,280
Yeah.

534
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,360
She didn't call in about the body.

535
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,120
Yeah.

536
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,720
And so I need to go check out the phone that was used because it's like one phone

537
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,760
or two phones.

538
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,440
Oh, where's, where's that?

539
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,960
Well, remember that she talked about like people, she didn't call it in.

540
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:06,400
Nobody would call in because one, nobody calls the cops because the union runs

541
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,680
the town union already knew.

542
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,480
And people call the people, like people steal the copper from the wires.

543
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,400
So there's a union phone that the union uses that is still got its wires.

544
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,320
And then there's one down near the coast.

545
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,080
That's what she said.

546
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,960
So I'm like, okay, maybe I can go find something there.

547
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,640
Come to think of it.

548
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,320
I don't think I have figured out who called in the body.

549
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,600
And I don't think I have, I remember mention of the phone.

550
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,240
I don't think I've investigated the phone.

551
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,200
So thanks for reminding me about those leads I should follow up on.

552
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,520
It's just like we're two detectives.

553
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,840
But you don't know like whose boots they were.

554
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,200
No, I mean, they're all workers boots aside from maybe one of them.

555
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,640
So they're probably a bunch of people with workers boots on.

556
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,800
And there's only like sea people around here, the union people.

557
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,600
The debaude, the debaude's union.

558
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,640
Yes, yes.

559
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,160
Do you I was going to do you know who the victim was?

560
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,200
No. OK, I think I'm on day like three.

561
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:33,040
And I think I have a pretty clear idea of what happened with the murder itself.

562
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,280
But there's like a bunch of like other like stray details surrounding it

563
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,360
that I like am aware of, but like don't understand.

564
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,960
And I want to, you know, that that's kind of where I'm at with it.

565
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,400
Oh, I haven't found a place to sleep.

566
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,360
You haven't. It's like two p.m. in my game.

567
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,760
That's the thing I need to figure out before it gets too dark.

568
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,120
Yeah. Yeah, you better.

569
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,240
Oh, or else.

570
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,120
They're going to get you.

571
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,920
The night terrors, the old sleep gremlins.

572
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,560
Do you know?

573
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,520
Do you know what the pale is like a bucket?

574
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,440
No, P.A.L.E. Nope.

575
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,960
You know what?

576
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,600
I also don't know what it is.

577
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,720
I've just heard it mentioned and I don't know what it means.

578
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,680
Did I hear it mentioned?

579
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,840
I feel like, no, maybe I did.

580
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Maybe I can check the logs or like if there's a notes thing I can see.

581
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,400
Hmm. Well, well, that's it, officer.

582
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Good over and out. All right.

583
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:57,640
Thank you for helping me with my investigation into your time playing that video game.

584
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,880
Pleasure doing business with it.

585
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,400
I did not play any more of it because I've been I played Mega Man battle

586
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,680
network on stream, a much worse game.

587
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,880
It's actually it's all right.

588
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,760
It's honestly a bit of that.

589
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,560
Yeah. Oh, yeah, you popped in.

590
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,880
I saw you. How long was the stream?

591
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,800
I've done two now and the first one was like four hours and the second one was

592
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,400
like five hours and I think I'm about like halfway through the first game.

593
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,920
Which is there's they're long, they're long.

594
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,960
So extrapolate.

595
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,120
Let's see how many games are there?

596
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,920
I think there's like.

597
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,320
Eleven. Eleven.

598
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,720
So like 10 hours, 20 hours.

599
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,720
Twenty hours. It's going to be like 11. Yeah, yeah.

600
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,160
Well, you know what? It's OK.

601
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,840
I'll just it'll just be a project.

602
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,320
It'll just be a project.

603
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,280
I like the combat.

604
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,320
I like the battles. They're pretty fun.

605
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,920
It I just hate I hate the random battles.

606
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,200
I hate that when I'm in a dungeon walking around trying to figure

607
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,880
shit out every so the random battles come and just interrupt what I'm doing.

608
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
And those battles are not fun.

609
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,680
They're repetitive.

610
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,720
They're not they're not very taxing.

611
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,960
They're not very interesting.

612
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,800
They're just they're just fucking bullshit you have to deal with.

613
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,440
And it makes up a significant portion of the time spent playing.

614
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,960
It's just getting through random battles.

615
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,600
Do you get like experience points or money?

616
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,240
You get you get money and you get new chips,

617
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,720
which are basically like spells, attacks and stuff.

618
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
OK, you basically use like a deck.

619
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,920
You basically build a deck of chips and that's like what you use to do damage.

620
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,920
So you do benefit from doing them.

621
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,920
But I still don't like them and it doesn't make for a good gaming experience.

622
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,640
Now, I mean, generally in a game with random battles,

623
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,040
it depends mostly on if the battles you have to participate in

624
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,120
helping the pacing of the game overall.

625
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,680
Like if you get to a boss and because of the random battles,

626
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,320
you have a good chance at winning.

627
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,840
If the pacing is fine, then you can just move on through and it's OK.

628
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,640
But if it turns out that so much of the random battles

629
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,080
were completely superfluous and you didn't need them, then it sucks.

630
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,200
I've been trying to flee from as many of them as I can.

631
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,640
And it's I think that's the right move.

632
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,560
I still like I can't flee from every battle.

633
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,160
I have to get I have to do enough that like.

634
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,080
I haven't I haven't I haven't hit any difficulty spikes

635
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,760
that I like have not been able to deal with, so it's OK.

636
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
I just think.

637
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,960
I just think the game.

638
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,360
Like the game as it exists now, like if you took random battles out,

639
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,880
yeah, you would never get any money and you would never get any chips

640
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,960
and you couldn't beat the bosses and stuff and like I get that.

641
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,560
I think the game would be better if it were just balanced

642
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,600
so that the random battles just weren't there.

643
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,640
You know what I mean?

644
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,480
Yeah, yeah, it would make the game shorter and better.

645
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,400
It would be that difficult to have.

646
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,640
Like I've seen other games, even on the GBA,

647
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,120
we're like you have little sprites of enemies moving around.

648
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,080
And if they see you, they'll run towards you or they're running,

649
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,200
they're moving in a pattern.

650
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,640
And if you can get out of the way of the pattern,

651
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,360
God, I wish the the combat.

652
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,920
That's how Mega Man Legends.

653
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
Well, Mega Man Legends is an action game.

654
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,200
Yeah, but I mean, you can you can run by the enemies if you want to.

655
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,680
And if you know how to avoid them, yeah,

656
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,040
that would improve the game a lot.

657
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,920
But I, you know, whatever, I just got to deal with it.

658
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,120
Other than that, it's kind of good.

659
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,400
And it's fun and the battles are pretty fun when they're not just

660
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,560
throwing a bunch of bullshit at me.

661
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,160
So, you know, not not an entirely positive experience,

662
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,720
but it's not a completely negative one.

663
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,000
They say they say the games get better

664
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,360
until like the like five and six.

665
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,240
And I think they say like six is terrible.

666
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
I don't know what's terrible about that,

667
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
but everybody seems to agree that it's bad.

668
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,520
So I think things might get better before they get worse, Lamal.

669
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
I don't know.

670
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,160
Is there anything so far that has been an interesting lore bit

671
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,760
when compared with compared with what you know from Wikipedia?

672
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,600
Is there anything like, oh, interesting?

673
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,520
I mean, the most I mean, that network one pretty much just sets up the premise.

674
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,120
And like the interesting thing about the premise is just what I said

675
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,240
in the lecture that like it's it's kind of what I don't know

676
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,000
if I really went into this in the lecture, actually.

677
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,200
But like the fact that like the world is completely different

678
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,600
pretty much just based on what Dr. Light decided to do.

679
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,720
And that's and that's kind of interesting.

680
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,480
And the the.

681
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,280
There there is a big twist that you only find out at the end of the first game.

682
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,040
And it.

683
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,400
I mean, do you want to know what it is?

684
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,280
I could just say it.

685
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,040
Yeah, I probably wouldn't want to play them.

686
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,680
Well, I mean, you find it at the very end.

687
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,160
OK, I mean, you know that like you're this kid

688
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,360
and you have this little personal computer

689
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,680
and everyone's personal computer has a little program inside it.

690
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,520
And your little program is like what

691
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,920
your little battler goes in and like kills viruses.

692
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,760
And like does it's a light world, dark world sort of thing.

693
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,840
But sort of it's it's sort of like everything interacts with computers

694
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,480
and like the computer is sort of just its own sort of separate reality

695
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,520
that like programs live in.

696
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,720
And your guy is a little Mega Man.

697
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,960
You're your little yeah, your little net navi,

698
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,160
your little interface program is a little Mega Man, Mega Man dot exe.

699
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,480
The the twist is you find out at the very end

700
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,680
that actually Mega Man dot exe is like is your dead brother

701
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,800
who your dad like fucking digitized because he was dying.

702
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,360
Yeah, you used to have a brother,

703
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,520
but he died and your dad turned him into a turned him into Mega Man dot exe

704
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,120
to be your little your little internet slave.

705
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,280
It's so fucked.

706
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,960
More like dot executable because he got he was he died.

707
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,160
He was extremely executable. Yeah.

708
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,560
So, you know, that's that's the

709
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
that's like the the the premise.

710
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,120
And I don't know.

711
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,440
I don't know if like that.

712
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,320
I don't know how that impacts later games in the series.

713
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,880
I know in this one, it's pretty much just like a last minute twist revelation.

714
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,960
Oh, my God, you're my brother.

715
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,680
What the fuck have my brother is inside a computer?

716
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Get out of there. Get the heck out of there.

717
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,160
And he says, I can't. I'm stuck in the computer.

718
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,720
And you say, no.

719
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,800
Quick, we got to invent 3D printing.

720
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,880
We got to get him out.

721
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,120
If only if only someone would build like a robot body that like a sentient

722
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,880
that like a sentient AI could like inhabit and it could like walk around.

723
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,160
Yeah. Why couldn't they do that?

724
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,720
If only Dr.

725
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,480
Light had started had studied robotics instead of AI.

726
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,960
Oh, fuck.

727
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,800
Um, Lamal.

728
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,520
Yeah, Dr. Light, you could have been could have been like a

729
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:12,080
or the Boston Dynamics or he could have got into like chat GBT.

730
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,360
Yeah, it's too dark, dark timelines.

731
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,040
Yeah. He he it's like

732
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,400
looked at in the way that like these are like two versions of the same world.

733
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,080
It's it's kind of interesting to think like,

734
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:36,240
is a net navi essentially like a cyber elf that just like is inside the network

735
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,880
and like has not developed the technology to like

736
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,520
exit the network yet or or is a net navi more like a robot master?

737
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,240
And that is not truly sentient.

738
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,880
Hmm. Well, if it was a real boy before.

739
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,560
What has become of him?

740
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,280
Yeah, turned into a net navi.

741
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,560
It would be pretty it would be if he's if he's merely been cyberized

742
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,800
like a cyber elf, like that's kind of OK.

743
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,760
But if he's been like reduced in his complexity

744
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,600
to be like a non sentient, a not fully sentient robot master, like that's grim.

745
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,120
That's grim, but if he was going to die, then he would be nothing.

746
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,720
Well, yeah.

747
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,440
Well, sure. Yes.

748
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,920
Maybe it may be a little like odd for the brother to be like,

749
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,280
oh, your family.

750
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,080
Yeah, but you're you're like a machine.

751
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,920
You don't have emotions.

752
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,800
I don't know.

753
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,480
I kind of think part of me wants to say that like

754
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,680
if the option if if if like true true like self determination

755
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,360
and sentience is off the table because the technology is just not there.

756
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,000
And like the choice is like either you die or I turn you into a

757
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,320
not entirely sentient like cyberized like quasi humanoid.

758
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
I kind of think maybe you should just let him die

759
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,040
because like the alternative is kind of it's it's ghoulish that the like I'm

760
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,160
imagining like a family member comes back as Clippy, Microsoft Clippy.

761
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,880
And I'm like, oh, no, you've got the face of my person.

762
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,000
I know that's soul.

763
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,080
But you but all you could all you can do is is tell me is recommend me

764
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,320
how to like improve my document writing.

765
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,840
And I'm like, this isn't what you're like.

766
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,200
This is fucked up.

767
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,560
Yeah, not real.

768
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,440
Yeah, ghoulish.

769
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,520
That would be a little bit.

770
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
I guess, did he know his brother?

771
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
No, he didn't even know he had a brother.

772
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,920
They were I think they were like twins or something.

773
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,480
And like one of them like had like a congenital problem

774
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,120
like when they were born and died like pretty much immediately

775
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,480
or was going to die like shortly after childbirth or something like that.

776
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,840
OK, I guess since he didn't know him before,

777
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,320
it's a little less freaky for that person.

778
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,640
But he didn't he didn't know.

779
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,920
But MegaMan.exe did know that he was like your long lost brother

780
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,480
the whole time and just didn't tell you because your dad like programmed him

781
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,680
not to tell you. Oh, you bet that.

782
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
That's.

783
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,440
It's sentient, but he can have his brain altered in the net.

784
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,160
I can have like folders of memories digitized,

785
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,280
but reshuffled and deleted.

786
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,040
Actually, I'm not 100 percent sure if he was like programmed not to tell you

787
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,360
or if just like the dad like just asked him not to tell you.

788
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,720
And he said like, OK, I'm not sure which it is.

789
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,880
I I'll have to find out soon.

790
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,280
And, you know, the sequel series to Battle Network Star Force.

791
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,440
Apparently, it takes place about 200 years in the future.

792
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,400
So about at the same time as MegaMan Zero happens

793
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,440
is when the battle network world like goes to space and like aliens are there.

794
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,600
I think that's zero.

795
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,000
Does zero have aliens? Zero does not have aliens.

796
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,040
No, zero is is like in the far future,

797
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,840
X has become or like the copy of X has become the like emperor

798
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,760
of the Neo-Arcadian Empire and is like ruling with like an iron fist.

799
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,080
Oh, yeah, and like fascist dictatorship.

800
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,680
And then there's the anti-reploit.

801
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,080
The the cop, the copy of X has become this fascist dictator

802
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,480
who is persecuting reploids and the real X has become a cyber.

803
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,120
Ralph, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

804
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,680
There's no aliens.

805
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,800
But in no, in in in the battle network timeline,

806
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,000
yeah, there's a sequel series called Star Force, where they go into space.

807
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,080
And I don't really know that much about it other than that.

808
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,360
I know that you like merge with an alien.

809
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,840
And you become and there are wizards.

810
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,240
There are wizards and aliens and I get.

811
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,160
But it's all the same because it's all on the Internet.

812
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,720
You can't tell. But it's but it's all on the Internet, I think.

813
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,200
I think that like the alien, I think that like you and an alien have like your

814
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,080
you each have like an individual

815
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,000
like data self representation that you put into the Internet.

816
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And then you like merge them together into like a a shared being on the Internet.

817
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,160
You know what, I'm this is like half remembered stuff that I don't even know.

818
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,920
So this is I have to I'll have to discover this seven games or nine games from now.

819
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,320
Oh, those games are long as fuck.

820
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,840
Those games are like 30 hours long because they're like fully realized JRPGs on the freaking DS.

821
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,120
Just like bigger than PlayStation games.

822
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,000
So that's a nightmare.

823
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,440
It's going to be one of those games where like, oh, if you want to if you want to get

824
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,600
some secret extra law, you're going to have to fill out the best bestiary.

825
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,400
And yeah, I'm not going to do that and do like a hundred percent completion.

826
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,200
Then you get a sentence from somebody and he says, I'm Dr.

827
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,320
Light is alive and he's here.

828
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,200
Here he is. No, I didn't even I didn't even I didn't a hundred

829
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,400
percent all like Mega Man games like I didn't even play through.

830
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,800
This probably the biggest thing that I didn't do was I didn't play through

831
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,760
Mega Man X for as zero.

832
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,560
I only played through as X and like zero's play through is kind of like the more

833
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,000
canon of the of the two.

834
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,520
You talked about the the different playthroughs, though, right?

835
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,960
In the lecture, I did.

836
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Yeah, I only played one of them.

837
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,160
I mean, gameplay wise, they're mostly the same.

838
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,520
It's just like slightly different bosses and like the dialogue you.

839
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,480
Oh, well, I mean, zero doesn't collect the light capsule upgrades, but like whatever.

840
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,320
I just I mean, I looked up the differences in any of them all.

841
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,600
But but yeah, that game's two different

842
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,120
playthroughs for the two different characters and I only did one and that's

843
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,480
and I kind of did the wrong one zeros is like

844
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,800
because zeros has like Iris, it has it has the famous cutscene

845
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
X's X's play that doesn't even have that cutscene.

846
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,440
Ah, so he was just fighting for something without even questioning it.

847
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,520
Yeah, X doesn't even ask at least zero asks what he's fighting for.

848
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,560
X doesn't even ask.

849
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,280
I just love killing.

850
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,160
He just that's the thing about X is that he just loves killing so much.

851
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,480
Mega Man X is a game series about a robot who just loves to kill.

852
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,000
He's highly, highly relatable.

853
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,880
Yeah, so I'm going to be doing that for a while.

854
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,240
You know what I think I'm going to do?

855
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,160
I think if I'm going to keep doing this, I should make like an announcement

856
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,120
video on YouTube and put on my YouTube channel like, hey, guys,

857
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,160
I'd like to make a follow up to the Mega Man lecture about Battle Network,

858
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,680
but I want to play the games first.

859
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,160
So I'm playing them on Twitch.

860
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,040
Follow me on Twitch.

861
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,480
I think that would be a reasonable way to drive

862
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,880
some eyes toward my Twitch channel if I'm going to be doing that.

863
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,800
Yeah, put it up the next time you go live or to, yeah.

864
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,960
Yeah, live when you're live.

865
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,520
It'd be like, oh, got to go right now.

866
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,200
I probably would put it out like.

867
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,960
I would probably say like I'll be I'll be live this Friday or something.

868
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,400
Like I would pronounce in advance, like.

869
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,520
I'll be I'll be doing it like this Friday.

870
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,080
I kind of want to do like maybe a Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

871
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,040
or maybe just like a Monday, Friday kind of schedule with it is something.

872
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,840
I don't. But I also don't want to.

873
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,600
I don't want to commit to a schedule because I hate commitment.

874
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,240
But also, I feel like I should do that if I'm going to announce it.

875
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,520
And if I want to tell people like you can watch me do this

876
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,160
and like here's when you can here's when I'll be doing it, you know,

877
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,120
like that's kind of the point of like announcing it.

878
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,760
Yeah. So I have to.

879
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,080
I was I was going to stream yesterday or I was going to stream on Friday.

880
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,160
I had kind of planned to, but I just didn't feel up to it.

881
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,640
I just didn't want to.

882
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,760
So I didn't because I hadn't really like committed to doing it on a schedule yet.

883
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,200
And I was the problem. Yeah.

884
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,240
It's like I guess not do it.

885
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,200
I like to be able to just not do it if I don't want to.

886
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,040
But also being on a schedule is good and it makes you do things.

887
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,480
Yeah.

888
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,240
And generally doing things is better than not doing them.

889
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,280
Hmm. Well, I don't know.

890
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,120
What if what if you did nothing?

891
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,640
What if you just laid face down?

892
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,400
Yeah, in the dirt. Yeah.

893
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,400
That's what I'm thinking.

894
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,120
That's what I'm like.

895
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,000
Stream that. No.

896
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,600
CCT likes hot wire, a CCTV camera lying the dirt face down.

897
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Ben St is live.

898
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,480
Why are you why you got a why we got a why we got to make content out of everything?

899
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,160
If I want to just lie that face down in the dirt,

900
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I should do it just for my own sake.

901
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,920
But what if you're lying face down in the dirt

902
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,200
and there's a little jingle goes off, somebody donated.

903
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,160
That would be the funniest clip.

904
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,320
Me like face down in the dirt like.

905
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,800
Little thing.

906
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,760
Thank you. Thank you for the follow.

907
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

908
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,720
I'm not going to look and see who followed, but whoever you are.

909
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,800
Thank you. OK, leave me alone.

910
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,880
Yeah.

911
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,240
Feeling I'm feeling a little I'm feeling a little demotivated lately.

912
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,360
Yeah, I'm trying to push.

913
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,920
I'm trying to push myself with stuff like this,

914
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,960
like stuff like I'm going to start streaming again.

915
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,360
I'm going to make I want to start working.

916
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,800
I need to release.

917
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,280
Well, I haven't really started a new lecture yet

918
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,320
because I've still been trying to grind that fucking the book.

919
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,880
OK, not to not to derail myself,

920
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,080
but I must complain again about how seemingly endless

921
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,160
and never ending and impossible.

922
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,760
The task of like satisfactorily putting the stupid fucking index together

923
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,680
is and it feels like I'll never be done.

924
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,360
But that's what I've been doing.

925
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,920
And again, I don't know, I just got to finish it.

926
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,040
And then I want to start working on a new lecture.

927
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,080
I haven't really started another one, even though I need to.

928
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,400
And I've been streaming and stuff.

929
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,760
And it's like, OK, I got to I should probably commit.

930
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,760
I should probably commit to doing that again.

931
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,400
But I feel I feel overwhelmed.

932
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,240
I feel overwhelmed by all of it. There's too many things.

933
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,440
Now, I feel you.

934
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,880
I mean, at least you're doing a little bit of something,

935
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,120
a little bit of indexing.

936
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,080
I'm trying. I'm trying to I'm trying to chip away at stuff.

937
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,200
I felt I was I seriously worked like all last night on it.

938
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,360
And it. I did make progress, but like I look at the whole document

939
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,600
and I'm like, how have I been?

940
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,840
It's literally been like months.

941
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,400
I've literally been doing this shit for months.

942
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,360
And like, how is it not even? It's not even like.

943
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,000
I guess it's getting there, but like it's not.

944
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,200
I wouldn't say it's like almost done.

945
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
It's mostly done.

946
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,320
Nevermind.

947
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,640
That's it.

948
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,200
I mean, I felt pretty overwhelmed as well with.

949
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:01,320
Obligations and projects and like that's a new year, you know.

950
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,320
Yeah, get to work for holidays are over.

951
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,120
Yeah, got to get something done.

952
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,320
Yes, stupid idiot.

953
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,520
Famously, I said that the book that I would have the book done by New Year's

954
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,240
and it's not done.

955
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,360
Yeah, it's just I don't know what if what if nothing happened?

956
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,120
I'm thinking about it more and more and I'm like, you know what?

957
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,960
I don't want to never do anything ever again.

958
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:38,360
But but it's it's it's it's not.

959
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,960
It's not doing me any favors constantly feeling stressed out

960
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,880
about everything.

961
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,800
So I don't know.

962
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:54,480
So are you saying you are stressed because of how many things you want to do?

963
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,960
Yeah. Yeah.

964
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,560
Overwhelmed, stressed, you know.

965
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,160
Yeah.

966
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,120
And it's it's it's not a simple like, oh, just do it or oh, just take a break.

967
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,600
Sort of thing, because it's like can't take a break forever on everything.

968
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,160
Yeah. And doing it.

969
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,040
Is just so hard, especially when it's a creative thing and I need to like focus.

970
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,320
Yeah. And it's like I just.

971
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,920
I don't know.

972
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,720
I've just been playing.

973
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,920
Well, I guess I've been I've been binging medical sore.

974
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,320
That's what I've been doing until that's that was finished.

975
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,280
Now that's finished.

976
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,280
I don't know what I'm doing.

977
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,760
I'm just sort of waking up.

978
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,840
I'm feeling very feeling very numb.

979
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,360
He's telling you what you're doing.

980
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,360
I'll tell you what you're doing.

981
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,600
You know, you're playing inscription again.

982
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,400
You got to finish inscription, Gabe.

983
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,320
You didn't finish inscription.

984
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,360
Oh, but I don't care.

985
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,560
You didn't get to the twists.

986
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,240
There are two.

987
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,200
Oh, what's the twist?

988
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,440
The butler is the one giving me a card.

989
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,800
Like the butler, two T's.

990
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Yes.

991
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,640
Look, it's a good game.

992
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,680
All right. Look, I know it's a good game.

993
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,480
OK, sometimes a good game.

994
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,800
You didn't look all right.

995
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,840
I just you didn't you didn't you didn't you didn't experience.

996
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,400
It's true. It's riches. OK.

997
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,240
It has it has undiscovered riches.

998
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,200
It's hard, Ben.

999
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,960
It requires that I play it and gosh darn it.

1000
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,680
I'm a casual and I don't run away from that fact.

1001
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,360
In fact, it's my identity.

1002
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,360
I identify strongly with casual gamer.

1003
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,440
It's not.

1004
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,240
I don't like it when it's a game is hard and I lose.

1005
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,280
It hurts my soul.

1006
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,400
I don't fragments it.

1007
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,280
I don't want to go.

1008
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,920
Look, OK, look, I know.

1009
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,200
I know I'm trying to keep it.

1010
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm trying to operate.

1011
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,440
I'm trying to keep a cool head, but I must.

1012
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,240
But I must.

1013
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,320
But I must once again say that losing losing is part of the game.

1014
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
You're supposed to lose it a bunch of times.

1015
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,440
And every time you lose it, it gives you more stuff that you can.

1016
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,760
That's what they say about real life, but it's false.

1017
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,200
No, that that definitely is not that definitely is not true of real life.

1018
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,560
Definitely not.

1019
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,640
You're supposed to lose and you get nothing.

1020
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,320
No, every time you lose in real life, you get worse and worse

1021
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,200
and your situation degrades more and more.

1022
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,560
Every time you lose, that's the the the the escapist fantasy of inscription

1023
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,880
is that every time you lose, you get better and better and you get more stuff.

1024
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,600
You know, what I like.

1025
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,120
Only it were like that.

1026
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,640
I like playing a fucking catamari to mercy.

1027
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,280
You know what you do in that?

1028
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,920
You roll around and you get bigger and bigger and then you win.

1029
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,440
That's a that's understand.

1030
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,680
Well, no, you can we can lose.

1031
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,640
Honestly, I've lost catamari a lot of times.

1032
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,040
I've found it kind of frustrating when I don't I don't get on a roll and I lose.

1033
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,640
Oh, no, I'm too good at that game.

1034
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,120
And I guess I'm so good at that.

1035
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,040
I'm so fucking good at catamari.

1036
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,200
I never lose.

1037
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,440
I have. Except I I lose on the ones that are like weird missions

1038
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,840
where you have to get one bear, like when you're trying to make Ursa major,

1039
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,000
you need to get one bear.

1040
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,800
And there are lots of things that count as bears or cows.

1041
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,080
There's another one about cows.

1042
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,280
And if you get like a milk carton that counts.

1043
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,000
And so you have to avoid picking up certain things until you're big enough

1044
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,920
to pick up like a big cow.

1045
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,000
I hate those ones because it I want to collect everything.

1046
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,400
Yeah.

1047
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,600
But any any normal mission I usually am fine with.

1048
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,960
Like I beat those had missions that are like I just can't.

1049
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,600
I can't maneuver around.

1050
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,800
I'm not finding the places I need to go where like this stuff is just the right

1051
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,320
size for me to be, you know, growing.

1052
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,560
I mean, yeah, there's some learning curve to to knowing how big you are

1053
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,760
and how big where the where to go.

1054
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,400
And maneuvering is like what my my big tip to Katamari Demas years

1055
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,320
we're having trouble maneuvering is the double tap, like click in L3R3

1056
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,840
to jump over to the other side of the ball, which is basically like a 180

1057
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
without having to slow down.

1058
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,520
You just do a 180 and you can easily change your direction completely,

1059
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,400
which is very good for zigzagging, picking up things instead of smashing

1060
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,600
into something and slowly turning around and then going at it again.

1061
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,120
Anyway, Katamari is easy.

1062
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:33,120
It's that's even if you fail, it's just fun clicking, getting getting little bits

1063
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,360
getting bigger. Yeah. Yeah.

1064
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,960
I played it and I never got like super into it.

1065
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,560
Really good.

1066
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,160
I think I just like I think I really rented it at some point.

1067
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,160
They made a they never sold the original game in the UK.

1068
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,720
So I have only played it.

1069
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,760
Well, actually, I played it at in America, I think at Red Con 3.

1070
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,680
I think we had it.

1071
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,320
Is this think Trixie had it?

1072
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,320
But then that's on steam.

1073
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,080
There's a PhD remake of the first game.

1074
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,560
It's great.

1075
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
Get that one.

1076
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,600
Oh, I just remember it.

1077
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,280
I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be on a on a on a draw cast,

1078
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,040
like oblivion oblivion falls draw cast this afternoon.

1079
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,040
We're really busy Sunday today.

1080
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,440
What what's the the theme?

1081
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,200
I think he said that the theme is.

1082
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,800
If I remember correctly, it's like you're supposed to first you draw

1083
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,640
like an an edgy OC like like a do not like a like a do not steal

1084
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,840
deviant are edgy OC and then you like swap with someone and you like fix each

1085
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,440
other's edgy OC's or I think that's that's like that.

1086
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,400
I feel like I did one of those with them.

1087
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,720
I remember I remember drawing a shitty OC.

1088
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:16,640
And then I also drew I think Seatull drew like a Ben Saint OC.

1089
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,280
And I drew that I think I can't remember.

1090
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,960
I have those images in my folder.

1091
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,920
Occasionally, I remember like I see them.

1092
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,160
I'm like, oh, yeah, that was a weird one.

1093
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,800
I don't know if that became a video.

1094
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,600
It probably did.

1095
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,160
They still have not finished the freaking art telephone.

1096
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
I hate my drawing for that.

1097
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,960
I'm glad it's not out.

1098
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,560
I'm glad it will never come out.

1099
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,560
Mine was never to see it.

1100
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,560
Mine was OK.

1101
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,560
I don't know.

1102
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,560
I kind of like.

1103
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,960
I always like wanted that to happen and then it like has been like a year

1104
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,160
and it like has not happened.

1105
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,960
I feel like it's time to just cut anyone who has not completed their freaking

1106
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,960
drawing for that.

1107
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
But maybe it's too late.

1108
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
Bummer.

1109
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,760
Bummer.

1110
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,720
Anyway, I'm feeling feeling a little bit

1111
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,920
feeling a little pressed, even though that's literally not for like six hours.

1112
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,840
But you know how it is.

1113
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,400
It's like, oh, no, I got to do something six hours from now or I can't do anything.

1114
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,440
Yeah.

1115
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,360
I can't start anything now.

1116
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,120
I don't only have five hours to do it in.

1117
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
I think.

1118
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,640
The last time I was on a draw cast.

1119
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,080
Actually, no, they've asked for people.

1120
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,040
Just randomly and they usually record like one a.m.

1121
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,840
And I'm like, I don't know.

1122
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
There's a slot for you.

1123
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,640
Did somebody help?

1124
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,080
I'm like, I don't know.

1125
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,080
It's fucking late.

1126
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,320
Right.

1127
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,720
Time zines.

1128
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,920
Well, what else have I been doing this week?

1129
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,040
I don't know.

1130
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,840
I found a YouTube guy that I like.

1131
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,560
He's called the Burger Creek.

1132
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,760
And he made. OK.

1133
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,720
He's made a bunch of he's made a bunch of lore videos explaining the lore

1134
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,840
of World of Darkness.

1135
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,840
Do you know what that is?

1136
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,200
Is that the

1137
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,280
French designer

1138
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
SNES game?

1139
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,200
No, it's not the guy who made something or is it like

1140
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,760
it's the is it the one with the Mike Gruber guy, the little egghead man?

1141
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,320
Oh, no, you're talking about

1142
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,720
another world.

1143
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,800
Another world. I think it's in Europe.

1144
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,520
It's called another world in America.

1145
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,880
I think it's called out of this world or something like that.

1146
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,800
And then there was another game by that same guy who did on SNES.

1147
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,120
The like black with like shadow hands.

1148
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,720
The black shadow hands and then the kid with the little laser gun.

1149
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,840
I know what you mean.

1150
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,080
I watched Game Grumps play. It was very cool.

1151
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,440
I know what you're talking about, but that's not what I am talking about.

1152
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,720
World of Darkness is a like it's a set

1153
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,920
of like tabletop RPGs that all kind of like work together with each other.

1154
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,560
So like they're all kind of set in the same world and they're like compatible with each other.

1155
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,760
The main one is is Vampire the Masquerade, where you play as vampires.

1156
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,960
But there's like a werewolf one.

1157
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,200
There's one about being ghosts.

1158
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,080
There's one about being wizards.

1159
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,000
There's a couple others, I think.

1160
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,800
But anyway, yeah, World of Darkness is this like set of games.

1161
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:50,440
And this guy, the Burger Creek, he's made a bunch of like lower videos explaining the lore of each one.

1162
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,800
And he also has made a bunch of like.

1163
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,920
Like philosophy, like history videos.

1164
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,800
It's stuff that like I have not watched that.

1165
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,720
But the funny thing about Burger Creek is that he just looks exactly like a Jesse,

1166
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,320
but he's like German.

1167
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,880
Oh, that's cool.

1168
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,320
Let me let me show you what he looks like.

1169
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,880
You can tell me if you agree with me or not.

1170
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,200
Like complete with Hawaiian shirt.

1171
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,400
No, he does not dress like Jesse.

1172
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,280
He just has his face and hair.

1173
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,600
Like I'm like, like, look at this, look at this.

1174
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,680
Well, yeah, a little bit.

1175
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,400
Yeah, his nose is bigger.

1176
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,840
It's kind of got the hair.

1177
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,640
Kind of got the hair.

1178
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,200
Sort of got the beard.

1179
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,400
And he's also standing in front of a very close behind bookshelf.

1180
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,200
Yes.

1181
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,080
I thought he was British at first because he speaks with a British accent.

1182
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,560
But I think he's actually German and I think he just learned British English.

1183
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,560
Um, he's talking into a sock.

1184
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,920
Yeah, he just puts a sock over his microphone for some reason.

1185
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,840
It's a pop filter.

1186
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,440
Yeah, easy pop filter.

1187
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,440
Yeah, it's funny.

1188
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,440
He's he's he's got a bunch of he's got a bunch of videos about like masculinity.

1189
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,320
But I think he's a leftoid, so it's probably OK.

1190
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,440
Don't worry about it.

1191
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,920
Uh, it is kind of on candy.

1192
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,280
Yeah. Right.

1193
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,520
I think it's something about the eyes, the very similar.

1194
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,920
The eyes, the hair.

1195
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,760
Yeah, I just I just saw this guy in a thumbnail.

1196
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,800
And I saw he was he had like a long video talking about vampire clans.

1197
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,240
That was like, I think he he used to do videos

1198
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,080
like a couple years ago, and I think he like came back to it

1199
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,760
like this year and he had a big hit.

1200
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,960
But he did like a like a two or three hour video where he explained

1201
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,000
all like the lore of all the clans in in Vampire, the masquerade.

1202
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,640
And I guess that was like sort of a big hit.

1203
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,440
And then he just he just did more of that.

1204
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,640
And that's what you do.

1205
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,800
That's what you do on the Internet.

1206
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,280
You just play the hits.

1207
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,360
You just play the hits.

1208
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,080
Duh, I stopped working.

1209
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,160
What was that?

1210
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,560
No, my brain stopped working.

1211
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,400
Oh, yeah, no, it's fine.

1212
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,920
I don't know. Yeah, I've been watching like a bunch of this guy's crap.

1213
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,480
They did they did a new GDC or GDQ, rather.

1214
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,440
That was there was one like last week.

1215
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,160
I didn't even realize.

1216
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,120
Game's done quietly.

1217
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,080
But now, yes, because I didn't hear about it.

1218
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,640
But now there's a bunch of new.

1219
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,920
There's a new Final Fantasy 7 speedrun that I watched.

1220
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
That was great.

1221
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,720
You know, I never go into those.

1222
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,760
I always forget that I can watch speedruns of any game I want.

1223
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,880
I have watched a lot.

1224
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,440
I don't usually watch them live.

1225
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,200
I just watch the VODs.

1226
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
Yeah, yeah.

1227
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,080
Like, oh, oh, a game I like.

1228
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,480
I wonder if there's a speedrun.

1229
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,520
Well, of course there is.

1230
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,080
But is it fun? Is it cool?

1231
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,280
Is it interesting?

1232
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,080
Often not.

1233
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:16,320
I usually prefer better than like a like a live recorded VOD

1234
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,040
of a speedrun from GDQ.

1235
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:23,120
What's the what's better than that is like a commentated speedrun.

1236
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,840
Oh, yeah, those are always nice.

1237
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,480
Have you seen the ones about Kirby?

1238
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,800
Hang on. I've seen ones where there's like a person playing

1239
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,040
and another person commentating what's being done

1240
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,240
or like the person playing is commentating.

1241
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,240
I like those.

1242
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,760
There's a yeah, there's a there's a channel called Sample

1243
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,480
and he has he has a video with one point one million views

1244
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,800
and it's a commentated task of Kirby Super Star Ultra 100 percent

1245
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,640
in an hour thirty five.

1246
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,280
And that one's really good because like

1247
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,760
the movement tech that he uses in the task is like really interesting.

1248
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,320
Like the way that he uses different powers in like a weird way

1249
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,880
to like squeeze the most movement potential out of them

1250
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,560
is like just really just really neat.

1251
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,600
I think I've seen a few speedruns of games that I like

1252
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,960
or games from childhood games that I know what it's like to play through.

1253
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,360
And I often like ratchet and clank.

1254
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,960
I don't like watching the speedruns for that for some reason.

1255
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,800
And I think it's because there's so many glitches involved

1256
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,120
that doesn't feel relatable.

1257
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,080
Doesn't feel like playing the game.

1258
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,920
It doesn't feel like I'm watching somebody play this game

1259
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,960
that I know with extreme precision, precision that I could not achieve.

1260
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,480
Now, they're doing glitches and like skipping past areas.

1261
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,560
I'm like, but what if you did that area and just did it really well?

1262
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,920
I'd like to see that.

1263
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,880
But I don't know.

1264
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,560
I guess I need need to specify like glitchless or exploitless runs of things.

1265
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,440
I mean, I like especially with like old like NES games.

1266
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:04,920
I do like to see when they like do weird shit that glitches the game out.

1267
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,240
Like that is fun in its own way.

1268
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,040
Oh, yeah.

1269
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,840
Like when they scroll the screen in Metroid, you ever seen that?

1270
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,400
I haven't I haven't seen, but I think I know what that there.

1271
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,320
There's ways that you can like go up too high on the screen

1272
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,200
that it like that it like overflows your position

1273
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,440
and like scrolls you up from like the bottom and like just puts you on the bottom

1274
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,560
of the screen and you can like skip you can skip like through floors and stuff that way.

1275
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,720
Or like zips and Mega Man where like there's ways to position yourself inside a wall.

1276
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,360
And when you're in a wall, the game tries to deposit you outside of the wall on the right side.

1277
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,880
So we just like shoots you like across the whole level.

1278
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,760
Sometimes if you're like inside a wall, that's like really long.

1279
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,680
Very funny.

1280
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,600
Oh, you know, it would be weird.

1281
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,800
I don't know how, whether I'd like this or not, but like speed runs of strategy games

1282
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,200
like Fire Emblem.

1283
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,040
Like those are not just about how quickly you can do it, but like

1284
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,400
you have to know the exact right thing to do.

1285
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,400
And there's some some maps and some moments that will probably be like random numbers

1286
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,600
will determine whether it's a good run or not, whether you get a crit at the right time

1287
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,000
or whether they get a crit.

1288
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,840
I think I've seen speed runs.

1289
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,520
Oh, I think I've seen I saw a speed run of

1290
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,720
Final Fantasy Tactics and they were explaining that like

1291
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,960
they were using a route that like didn't involve numerology.

1292
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,360
Do you know what that is?

1293
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,560
Numbers.

1294
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,760
Well, there. Well, there's like a shit.

1295
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,200
I think there's like a there's like a particular class or there's like a particular NPC

1296
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,600
that has like a unique class that has like some like highly random

1297
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:56,720
abilities and there are ways to like there are ways to like cheese the RNG

1298
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,760
that make this like a numeral this numerology ability like really strong.

1299
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,840
Like you can you can cheese the results to get like things that are like way more

1300
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,440
powerful than it's supposed to be or something like that.

1301
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,240
But they were like

1302
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,760
they had like developed a route that like didn't involve that

1303
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,240
because that like trivialized the game or something.

1304
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,320
So yeah.

1305
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,840
There's no.

1306
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,840
I'm trying.

1307
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,280
Yeah, game is like games is like strategy involves

1308
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,680
or like, I mean, you ever watch Pokemon speed run where they're talking about like

1309
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,560
I've seen so many challenge runs and I've seen glitchful speed runs,

1310
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:42,440
but not like yeah, just regular speed runs of a Pokemon game.

1311
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,240
They're the way the way they route it so that like

1312
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,640
they'll they'll use like one mon and they'll like

1313
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:57,080
like they know they know like which which NPCs have like AI that they can exploit

1314
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:01,400
to like get an opportunity to like use all the like X items that they need

1315
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,160
to like steamroll through the rest of the of the party and stuff.

1316
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,600
Or like they'll know

1317
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:14,200
like based on their EVs and based on like the moves, power and stuff,

1318
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,160
like they'll know exactly like like when they'll be able to out speed

1319
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,920
in one shot, everything and they'll like they'll carefully plan their route.

1320
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:28,280
So like they get there at the exact time that they that they can do that without any risk.

1321
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,480
It's interesting. Those are like really long, but they're fine.

1322
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,840
Now, I watch a lot of speed runs.

1323
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,560
Oh, I just remembered like a.

1324
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,840
A tactic in Fire Emblem or at least in the Fire Emblem

1325
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,280
on GBA that I remember.

1326
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:53,160
I want I remember it's such a weird it's a random number like manipulation tactic.

1327
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,160
That you can use to guarantee high stats on a level up.

1328
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,680
It was like in which game Fire Emblem 7 on GBA.

1329
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,080
I guess on Fire Emblem 8 as well.

1330
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:09,120
It could be other ones like the because when you when you level up,

1331
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,880
you gain like a random bonus to a bunch of different stats.

1332
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,480
Yeah, you gain random bonuses to a bunch of different stats

1333
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,720
and you want like a high role on each one of those stats.

1334
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,000
Sometimes you get like plus one to health and that's it.

1335
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,880
Sometimes you get plus one to health, speed, strength, skill,

1336
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,280
defense and you know, everything.

1337
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:36,320
And what you can do is since again, I don't know why this is the case.

1338
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:42,160
When you play a map, the the numbers that are generated

1339
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,200
are like they're set in stone kind of.

1340
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,320
You can see what they are by doing some actions

1341
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,280
and then load your point by like turning the game off

1342
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,160
and then coming back to wherever you were.

1343
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,400
And then it's hard to explain.

1344
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,840
But like the series of saves saves coming your level up basically.

1345
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,160
Yeah, you save like every every action is saved in Fire Emblem.

1346
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,760
So if you move a unit, you can't like undo it.

1347
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,040
You can't set a load, a point from that map that it's always saved,

1348
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,400
which is always a cool part of like if you turned the console off,

1349
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,640
it would remember because it's constantly saving,

1350
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,480
which is to prevent saves coming.

1351
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:33,680
But because of this, there's a way to check the random numbers

1352
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,480
that are about to happen in the game that you're playing

1353
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,920
by having a unit, selecting them and then moving their cursor

1354
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,760
like a certain number of tiles away in a diagonal direction.

1355
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,000
And then the arrow that indicates the path they'll take.

1356
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,040
If it's two different potential paths to that one square,

1357
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,720
the game will roll a random number to generate which arrow is shown,

1358
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,960
whether it's go up and then right or right in an up.

1359
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,320
And you can tell

1360
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,000
whether it's a high or low number

1361
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,080
based on whether it does one or the other.

1362
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,360
And then you can write down whether it was a high number or low number.

1363
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:25,800
And if you get like 23 like random numbers later,

1364
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,920
you have like a high, a long string of high numbers rolled.

1365
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,360
Then, you know, you turn the game off

1366
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,960
and then you count up to that number.

1367
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,240
You spend those random numbers, you generate them again

1368
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,240
with the same arrow method, and then you level up, you kill an enemy,

1369
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:50,000
you level up, and then they use the next set of random numbers

1370
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,200
in the list that you already have predetermined.

1371
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,880
You already know what they're going to be.

1372
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,680
And so you level up and you get like a bunch of random numbers

1373
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,240
that you've seen from the future.

1374
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,160
I see.

1375
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,680
It's it was so complicated when I was young.

1376
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,360
I was like, what?

1377
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,200
What the fuck?

1378
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,880
But I remember spending like hours and hours trying to understand it.

1379
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,600
And I think I've worked a couple of times.

1380
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,320
It was just so time intensive because you had to like.

1381
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,480
When you're ready to level up,

1382
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:23,200
you have to like get into a position where you can kill an enemy and level up

1383
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:28,080
and then do the arrow thing until you get a good string of numbers.

1384
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,040
And it could just take forever until that happens.

1385
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:33,680
Weird.

1386
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,120
It's very weird.

1387
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,280
How do you reset the timer, though?

1388
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,760
Like or reset the numbers?

1389
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,840
You can you just turn off and turn it on and like,

1390
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,920
do you like save scum the numbers, basically?

1391
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,120
You you you can leave the map or turn off the console

1392
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,280
and it will have saved at that point.

1393
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,880
I think the idea is it uses random numbers to generate the arrow,

1394
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,520
but it doesn't bother saving after that point.

1395
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:02,360
So like generating those arrow numbers, the game doesn't update.

1396
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,400
It doesn't save your state.

1397
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,440
So you can return to before you generated those numbers.

1398
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,880
And for some reason, those numbers generate the exact same way every time.

1399
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,560
Weird, weird.

1400
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,840
So it's RNG manipulation.

1401
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,640
That's my that's my big trivia about that.

1402
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,240
That's fucked up.

1403
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,720
How could you let that happen?

1404
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,080
Because I was a nerd and I.

1405
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,960
Fire Emblem was a very important game to me, but I sucked at it.

1406
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,720
I lost so many times.

1407
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,160
I was like, how do I become the strongest?

1408
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,960
And they said, you do this.

1409
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,560
Well, that explains it.

1410
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,640
Video games, I watched them.

1411
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,840
I've seen I've now seen every every video on Hazel's channel.

1412
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,960
You know, Hazel.

1413
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,840
Uh, she makes anime videos.

1414
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,240
Oh, wait, I think I know all of them.

1415
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,160
I never watched their video.

1416
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,080
She did because it's because it is anime.

1417
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,520
And I'm like, what the fuck?

1418
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,160
So some of them are about anime.

1419
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,400
Some of them are about like RPGs.

1420
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:11,920
Some of them are about just like lost media in in general, but mostly anime.

1421
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,480
Oh, she did one.

1422
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:17,200
This one about the time Tokyo pop made a weeaboo reality show.

1423
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,400
That one's really funny.

1424
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,520
I'd never heard of that before.

1425
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,480
Oh, I watched the one about.

1426
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,960
Oh, the the the the the backstory of I can.

1427
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,880
The like weird big boob anime by which I hear this one specifically

1428
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,480
specifically this big boob anime.

1429
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,600
Oh, this one's this one was really good.

1430
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,240
Oh, yeah, I love that big boob anime.

1431
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,320
No, you don't know you don't.

1432
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,640
Was that the one, you know, I think when I was really young,

1433
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,960
like 11 or 12 or whatever, I found something like this.

1434
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,960
Maybe it was this.

1435
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,840
I've seen this character somewhere and it was like, I was like, oh, my God.

1436
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,840
Like I typed in boobs on Google and she showed up.

1437
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,440
Yeah.

1438
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,840
And I learned about it from that.

1439
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,800
And I was like, oh, my God, you can watch that.

1440
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,840
The funny that was there was a scene where the main character was like,

1441
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,520
well, I tripped and I put my hands on the big boobies and that's wish.

1442
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,240
That's what happened.

1443
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,760
And I was like, I was like, oh, my God, that would be so cool.

1444
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,920
It was before I realized this was a stupid trope.

1445
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,000
I was like, I wish that could happen to me.

1446
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,720
That's so funny and awesome and cool.

1447
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:35,800
The funny OK, the takeaway that I learned from this is like, OK.

1448
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,560
This anime exists.

1449
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,560
It only exists because.

1450
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,040
The guy drew the biggest boobs that had existed in anime up till that time.

1451
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,280
That's the only that's like the only interesting thing about it at all.

1452
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:57,080
It is the original manga has it legitimately has like dog shit art

1453
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:02,040
and looks like garbage and the guy can't draw and it's shit.

1454
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,240
And also the guy sucks.

1455
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:09,720
And the next manga that he did after this was called like my bride is 12 years old.

1456
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,200
But it's just about marrying a fucking grade school.

1457
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,720
And there was a big like freaking there was a big freaking

1458
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,680
political backlash against it.

1459
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,120
Basically, basically Japanese legislation.

1460
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,440
Remember when like freaking Joseph Lieberman and whatever?

1461
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,720
We're all like, oh, doom is making kids shoot up schools.

1462
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,720
Basically, basically Japan did that, but they did it with my bride

1463
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,680
is an elementary schooler.

1464
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,640
And they said like manga is turning our generation into like weak degenerates

1465
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,760
and destroying traditional masculinity.

1466
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,600
And you know what, God damn it, they had a freaking point.

1467
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,840
They were in this one case.

1468
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,960
The grade schooler.

1469
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,840
I mean, how many grade schools got married as a result?

1470
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,520
Huh, it was stats.

1471
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,640
Well, I mean, damn, you got a point there.

1472
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,240
But I don't know.

1473
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:06,320
It's very it's very it was very interesting to learn what this freaking guy did.

1474
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,600
This freaking big boob anime man.

1475
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,880
Wow. Mm hmm.

1476
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,560
Japan, huh?

1477
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,120
I have watched them.

1478
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,840
Oh, I learned something.

1479
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,480
She she was using she used like video game level

1480
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,360
as like background art in some shots.

1481
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,360
And I looked she she she cited like where she got that from.

1482
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,400
And it was this thing called let me find it.

1483
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:35,320
Yeah, it was this thing called no clip, the note that no clip website.

1484
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,120
And on. Oh, I've seen that.

1485
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,800
You've seen. Yeah, I found this from her.

1486
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,280
And if you can just go and you can freaking like put a camera anywhere

1487
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,640
in like all these like old like PlayStation and Wii and GameCube games.

1488
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,440
And you just put them anywhere in like a level in a video game.

1489
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,680
And you can like film a little like Zoom shot.

1490
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,240
In a video game, I'm looking at Okami.

1491
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,680
I'm looking at the Divine Spring and Okami right now.

1492
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,800
It looks great. I've also clicked on Okami.

1493
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,080
I love it. I think I forget about it every so often.

1494
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,680
And I'm like, yeah, what?

1495
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,080
How does this work so well?

1496
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,000
This is just the map data in a browser.

1497
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,760
I'm leaving this frickin this frickin tab open.

1498
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,200
I'm leaving this tab open forever.

1499
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,680
We can get Fes. I mean, I'm in Cousa village right now.

1500
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,160
Oh, I'm looking at Fez.

1501
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,640
Oh, yeah. Fez. You can use WASD.

1502
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,160
Use WASD Banjo-Kazooie fucking.

1503
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,080
I like that they have like some of the models in there just sort of hanging out.

1504
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,520
Oh, I was looking at the Jet Set Radio.

1505
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,200
They have some of the games they have like textures for objects.

1506
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,520
Also, not all of them.

1507
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,600
Like Banjo-Kazooie has like little little eggs and some of the enemies.

1508
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:55,320
Do they not have games from the original PlayStation?

1509
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,720
I see PlayStation 2.

1510
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,720
Maybe they're weirder like map files.

1511
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,800
Xbox PC, Xbox PC.

1512
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,240
Wait, what was Okami? Experimental.

1513
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,240
Was Okami on the Wii?

1514
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,240
Yeah.

1515
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,360
I guess they just have the Wii version.

1516
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,360
But that was on the PlayStation.

1517
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
It was.

1518
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,360
You saw it?

1519
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,360
Maybe they can rip it from the Wii better than other things.

1520
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,360
I mean, I guess they have a somewhat limited selection here.

1521
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Psychonauts.

1522
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:32,360
The one level in Psychonauts that looks like a black velvet painting.

1523
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,360
Black velvetopia, black velvetopia.

1524
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
There we go.

1525
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:45,880
I can zoom in on like on like the far off depictions of places from Del Fino Plaza.

1526
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,880
I can see the low poly Del Fino Harbor stuff.

1527
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,880
Oh, some of these.

1528
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,880
Some of these actually look kind of bad.

1529
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,880
Like some of them.

1530
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:04,880
Some of them you look at and like very little of the level is actually textured.

1531
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,880
And that's kind of disappointing.

1532
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,880
Look at this.

1533
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:09,880
Only so much you can do.

1534
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:18,880
Well, how does it look good in the game if this is what the model looks like?

1535
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,880
Like what is this?

1536
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,880
Games that from?

1537
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,880
It's from Psychonauts.

1538
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,880
I'm not familiar.

1539
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:31,880
But I guess there's lots of things that are not like rendering like in Super Mario Sunshine.

1540
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:36,880
There's no heat wave for distant objects, which would obviously obscure stuff.

1541
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:45,400
This is like basic models, textures, lighting sometimes.

1542
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:52,000
Probably not procedurally generated, just sort of like like painted on or pre rendered

1543
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,240
lighting shadows and stuff.

1544
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,280
Is it like what the hell is this?

1545
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:00,520
Is it like a lot of the like untextured areas?

1546
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,680
Is it just like was there would there have just been like a flat texture like behind

1547
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,680
like a skybox?

1548
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,680
I don't know.

1549
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:14,680
Yo, it's fucking Metroid Prime.

1550
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:19,680
Sometimes there's just like shit floating around.

1551
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,680
Look at this.

1552
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,680
This weird image that says channel one.

1553
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,680
And I don't know what that is.

1554
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,680
That could be.

1555
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:36,680
I assume they would have put a gift there or something or some kind of animation animated

1556
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,680
texture.

1557
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,680
Yeah, I'm not familiar with the game.

1558
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,680
I played it a long time ago.

1559
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,680
I don't exactly remember.

1560
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,680
It could be an animation.

1561
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:55,680
It could be like a video feed, like a camera that shows what's happening in game.

1562
01:19:55,680 --> 01:20:00,680
I mean, there definitely was not a yellow checkerboard that says channel one.

1563
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,680
Would I have PlayStation 2 here?

1564
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,680
I feel like maybe.

1565
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,680
Okay.

1566
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,680
You ever seen?

1567
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,680
There's a Kingdom Hearts.

1568
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,680
Yo, there's a I'm going to go to fucking.

1569
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,680
Okay.

1570
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:16,680
The Destiny Islands.

1571
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,680
There's a there's a channel on YouTube that does this.

1572
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:24,680
It like breaks games and it goes it like goes around in the levels and games.

1573
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,680
And I remember I watched a video where it was exploring the levels in like it was Simpsons

1574
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:30,680
hit and run.

1575
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:34,680
And it's like, is that boundary break?

1576
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,680
Yes.

1577
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:36,680
Yes.

1578
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:37,680
Boundary break.

1579
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:42,680
And it's literally like parts of the level just have like flat textures.

1580
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,680
And they're like just like hidden inside walls and stuff.

1581
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:51,680
And it like the way that it will do cut scenes is it will literally just like take the in-game

1582
01:20:51,680 --> 01:21:01,680
camera and just put it in a place in the 3D level that just shows the image in the form

1583
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,680
of like an in-game texture on like a flat plane.

1584
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,680
But like that texture is just is just floating somewhere in the level.

1585
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:14,680
And they just move the camera to point at that image and like that's how they show the

1586
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,680
image.

1587
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,680
Do you know what I mean?

1588
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,680
I guess.

1589
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,680
Yeah.

1590
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,680
Yeah.

1591
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,680
I know what you mean.

1592
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:27,680
It's I think just because it's easier to move a camera's position that it is to load in

1593
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:33,680
an image to show on screen, they just move the camera to wherever the scene needs to be.

1594
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,680
That's why they have like, like, I don't know.

1595
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,680
I can't remember if this is actually in Simpsons hit and run.

1596
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,680
But like levels would be like just far below.

1597
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:51,680
Like an interior would just be a little like model set that would be below the real level.

1598
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,680
Yeah.

1599
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:57,680
There were, I was looking at some of these levels and you know, Kami, I saw there were

1600
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:03,680
some levels that, yeah, like one area will actually have multiple different like areas

1601
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,680
in it.

1602
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:08,680
And they're just sort of like separated.

1603
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:13,680
But like it's one map that just has a bunch of these like kind of rooms sort of built

1604
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,680
into it.

1605
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,680
And they're technically the same area.

1606
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:22,680
You're just like positioned differently inside of them.

1607
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:29,680
And they may or may not even like have any relation to each other in game in context.

1608
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,680
Oh my God, I love video games.

1609
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,680
I do love video games.

1610
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,680
Do you?

1611
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,680
Okay.

1612
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,680
Do you ever watch?

1613
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,680
Do you ever watch any?

1614
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,680
Okay.

1615
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,680
Well, there's two different things.

1616
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:47,680
Any John Boyce documentaries and or Bobby Broccoli videos.

1617
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,680
I think you talked about John Boyce.

1618
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,680
He did the baseball stuff.

1619
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,680
He does.

1620
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,680
He does many sports related documentary type videos.

1621
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,680
Okay.

1622
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,680
But you, but you haven't, you're not familiar.

1623
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,680
No.

1624
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,680
You don't know Bobby Broccoli?

1625
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,680
Nope.

1626
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,680
Okay.

1627
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,680
I think it, okay.

1628
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:13,680
I think, I think it was Chip Wiseman that turned me on to this, but I could be misremembering.

1629
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:21,680
But yeah, I noted that like Bobby Broccoli makes videos that are basically the same.

1630
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,680
Like he uses the same like format as John Boyce did.

1631
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,680
And I noticed that like there's only these two channels that I'm aware of that do this

1632
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:37,680
very particular style of video making wherein they'll have like a graph or they'll have

1633
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:42,680
some sort of a data.

1634
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,680
What do you, what do you call it in infographic?

1635
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,680
They'll have like, they'll build like a graph or an infographic showing some information.

1636
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:52,680
And what they'll do is they'll have, they'll have, have it in like a 3D space and they'll

1637
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,680
kind of swoosh the camera around to show the graph.

1638
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:00,680
And then maybe they'll have like, you know, points appear on the graph and you'll sort

1639
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,680
of watch them like animate and like appear and the data will appear and it will, you

1640
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,680
know, form some pattern and they'll talk about it.

1641
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:14,680
And yeah, they, they do this thing and they swoosh it around in the 3D environment.

1642
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:21,680
And I mentioned this and someone, and I think it was Chip Wiseman said, yeah, they, Bobby

1643
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:26,680
Broccoli made a video that's just explaining how they do it and the video is called how

1644
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,680
to make videos like John Boyce.

1645
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:33,680
So Bobby Broccoli is explicitly like, yes, I stole my method from John Boyce and like

1646
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,680
good on him.

1647
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,680
You know, I admire the gumption.

1648
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:43,680
And it turns out, and I couldn't fucking believe this, you will never, they actually make the

1649
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,680
videos in Google Earth.

1650
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:49,680
Like Google Earth has like video making tools in it.

1651
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,680
Well, like, did you, like, did you know that?

1652
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,680
Like, like you can set a key frame and a camera move in Google Earth.

1653
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,680
Yes.

1654
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,680
Yes.

1655
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,680
And you, and you can load 3D models.

1656
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,680
You can load 3D models into Google Earth.

1657
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:09,680
I, I assumed the, okay, John Boyce made the first thing I ever saw of him was 17776, which

1658
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:13,680
is that sort of like almost, it's a bit homestuckish, but not really.

1659
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:19,680
It's a comic, but it includes videos and it's set in the future.

1660
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:25,680
And he'll show like a, like a Google Earth landscape, but in Google Earth, he will have

1661
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:30,680
these like, he'll have like fantastical structures and like things that don't exist sort of placed

1662
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,680
on top of Google Earth.

1663
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:37,680
And it's like, oh, in the future, this, this thing is here and it's some weird building.

1664
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:43,680
Turns out, and I assumed he was using Google Earth and then like taking Google Earth footage

1665
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:50,680
and putting something into it or putting superimposing an image or maybe loading Google Earth models

1666
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,680
into some other thing like Blender or something.

1667
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:58,680
No, you can just straight up load 3D models into Google Earth and then use like fricking

1668
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:05,680
video tools and key frames and stuff in Google Earth to like record in software footage in

1669
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,680
Google Earth.

1670
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,680
That's what Bobby Broccoli does too.

1671
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:12,680
He just loads Google Earth, turns off the Earth, so it's just in like a black void.

1672
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,680
And then he just puts these infographics into the Google Earth software and that's it.

1673
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,680
That's the whole method.

1674
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,680
And I can't fucking believe because it's so good.

1675
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,680
It's like really good.

1676
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,680
The result rules.

1677
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,680
Yeah.

1678
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:32,680
Why would Google Earth have that built in?

1679
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:39,680
I guess they anticipated that people would want to make videos using it, but like I've

1680
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:45,680
never seen anyone do it other than John Boyce and then Bobby Broccoli.

1681
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:50,680
But they don't, I mean John Boyce will sometimes, he'll use the Earth itself and he'll use it

1682
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,680
as like, he'll show a location where he's talking about it.

1683
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,680
Bobby doesn't even use the Earth.

1684
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,680
He has everything just floating in a void.

1685
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:02,680
And it's just, it's amazing.

1686
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:09,680
It's amazing to me because I'm sure that they did not, I'm sure that the creators of Google

1687
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:16,680
Earth did not intend for it to be used to make documentaries, but they put these video

1688
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:23,680
making tools in it and just because of the way that they built that into it, these documentary

1689
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:29,680
videos became possible to make and John just did that.

1690
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:34,680
Well, what were the, like what did they expect?

1691
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,680
Like if they had video making capabilities.

1692
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,680
Well, I don't know.

1693
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,680
I genuinely don't know.

1694
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,680
We're a business and here's our video.

1695
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:49,680
You see, we want to build our new structure on this straight here, swoop.

1696
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,680
Maybe.

1697
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:55,680
Look at it with the, it'll add to the skyline.

1698
01:27:55,680 --> 01:28:04,680
Maybe it was assumed that like, yeah, using rendered footage from Google Earth would be,

1699
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:12,680
yeah, just useful for like, showing the locations of things or showing like, geographic data.

1700
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,680
I don't know.

1701
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:20,680
Yeah, that's maybe the biggest question that leaves me with is why does Google Earth have

1702
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:24,680
this functionality?

1703
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,680
Google probably doesn't know.

1704
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:31,680
You could, I mean, you could theoretically just like, just fricking use a screen capture

1705
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:35,680
software to record Google Earth footage.

1706
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,680
Does that mean I could put like a little model, like a little punk model in Google Earth and

1707
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,680
have her destroy all the buildings?

1708
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:47,680
Bobby Broccoli has a video explaining step by step exactly how to load 3D models into

1709
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:51,680
Google Earth and make videos with them.

1710
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,680
So if you can make videos, can you make an interactive something or other?

1711
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,680
That would be so cool if you could like make a game, because you can already make.

1712
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:03,680
I mean, you can't like program like game logic into it.

1713
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:09,680
No, but it would be so cool if you could take the Google Maps, like when they do like 3D,

1714
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:14,680
like the little 3D versions of instead of just a flat image, and you can have a little

1715
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,680
character run around and jump on them.

1716
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,680
That'd be cool.

1717
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:25,680
I mean, you would have to animate it and then load the animation into the into the Earth.

1718
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,680
Yeah, it wouldn't be the animation software.

1719
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:32,680
I'm thinking of like somehow getting the data to do that.

1720
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:37,680
Because what's the game that uses, what's it called?

1721
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,680
GeoGuessr.

1722
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:42,680
GeoGuessr uses Google Earth data to make its game.

1723
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,680
Hmm.

1724
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,680
I don't know.

1725
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,680
You know GeoGuessr, right?

1726
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,680
Sort of.

1727
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:57,680
It's a game where it plops you down in a random Google Street View area and you have to guess

1728
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,680
where you are.

1729
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:08,680
And it knows the location, so they have the Google data and they make a game out of it.

1730
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:14,680
I don't know anything about that.

1731
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,680
It's fun.

1732
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,680
Hmm.

1733
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,680
I'm sorry, I'm trying to find this video.

1734
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:28,680
I thought someone linked it to me in the PCP, frickin, in the PCP server.

1735
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,680
Kirby Return to Dream Land.

1736
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,680
Cookie Country.

1737
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,680
Yo.

1738
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:36,680
Yo, what the fuck?

1739
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,680
Wait, what?

1740
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:42,680
Kirby Return to Dream Land, two-dimensional game, you know, with a 3D background.

1741
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,680
And now you can go into the 3D background.

1742
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,680
Return to Dream Land is so beautiful.

1743
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,680
I found the video.

1744
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,680
Raising Road.

1745
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:57,680
It's called How to Animate in Google Earth Like John Boyce by Bobby Broccoli.

1746
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,680
He posted it two years ago.

1747
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,680
Well, this is interesting.

1748
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,680
The Kirby Return to Dream Land is just the background.

1749
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,680
There is no level.

1750
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:08,680
Are you still looking at what's it called, no clip?

1751
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,680
Yeah.

1752
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,680
Mario Kart.

1753
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,680
Oh, I can pretend to Mario Kart.

1754
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,680
I'm going so quick.

1755
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,680
You can just use WASD and go...

1756
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,680
Yeah, WASD and then like right arrow, right mouse button.

1757
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,680
Mm-hmm.

1758
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,680
Mm-hmm.

1759
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,680
Aw.

1760
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,680
Bobby says in the comments of these,

1761
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:35,680
it was pointed out to me that the best way to animate scrolling without zoom outs and zoom ins is not actually to use a path.

1762
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,680
Paths have weird camera restrictions.

1763
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:43,680
The easier and more versatile method is to just record yourself manually pressing the arrow keys to scroll.

1764
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,680
Well, that sounds inconvenient.

1765
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:48,680
Holy shit.

1766
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:53,680
I wouldn't the tool be better, but okay, sure, whatever.

1767
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,680
Did you try Pokemon Platinum?

1768
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,680
No, I still haven't played it.

1769
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:04,680
No, I mean like in no clip because the entire map, the entire game is one big model.

1770
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:05,680
What?

1771
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,680
Hang on.

1772
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,680
The entire Sinnoh region or whatever.

1773
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,680
I'm flying over it.

1774
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:12,680
Is that on the DS?

1775
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,680
Yeah, I think so.

1776
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,680
Sinnoh region and underground.

1777
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:20,680
Wow, yeah, there's only two maps.

1778
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,680
Let's check it out.

1779
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,680
These little Pokemon Sinnohs are so cute.

1780
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,680
Oh, it's in 3D.

1781
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,680
Yeah.

1782
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,680
Oh my god, it actually looks great.

1783
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:38,680
What are these big black beams coming out of a...

1784
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:39,680
Beams?

1785
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,680
What is that?

1786
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:44,680
There's these two like black beams emanating from...

1787
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,680
Are they like spotlights?

1788
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,680
They're coming out of...

1789
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:55,680
Let me get a little image that kind of shows what I'm talking about.

1790
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,680
All the trees are slanted in the direction of the camera, that's funny.

1791
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,680
This.

1792
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,680
And they have like the flat...

1793
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:08,680
Oh, they have the log texture just flatly on the ground underneath.

1794
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,680
Oh, because you only see them from up above.

1795
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, lol.

1796
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,680
Because the tree is just a sprite.

1797
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:19,680
Yeah, the tree can shake, right, in the wind.

1798
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,680
Oh my god, they're all tilted.

1799
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,680
They're all like a tilted flat sprite floating in the air.

1800
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,680
The log is just a flat texture.

1801
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,680
Holy shit.

1802
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,680
That's so fucking funny.

1803
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,680
Amazing.

1804
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,680
I love Pokemon now.

1805
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,680
That's hilarious.

1806
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,680
That's so stupid.

1807
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,680
Oh, no, it's great.

1808
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:48,680
The boulders in these pits.

1809
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:52,680
Also a flat angled texture.

1810
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,680
Games are just fake.

1811
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,680
Games aren't real.

1812
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,680
The artifice is disgusting.

1813
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,680
They tricked me.

1814
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,680
No, I like it.

1815
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,680
Because it makes me feel like this is like a little paper.

1816
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,680
This is like a big...

1817
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:14,680
You go sound someone's basement, they've made this in paper and cardboard.

1818
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:15,680
Yeah.

1819
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:18,680
And they got their tiny little Pokemon trainer walking through it.

1820
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:22,680
It really does just feel like, yeah, they cut out little paper dolls.

1821
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,680
Is there a Mega Man game in here?

1822
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,680
Metroid Prime?

1823
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,680
If there was, it would probably be on the PlayStation 2.

1824
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,680
No.

1825
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,680
No, I don't see anyone.

1826
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,680
Dang.

1827
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,680
No Mega Man 64.

1828
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,680
Oh, that would be awesome.

1829
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:41,680
Well, not 64.

1830
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:44,680
Legends is better.

1831
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,680
Sure, but like if it's not PlayStation, that's what the only other one would be.

1832
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,680
Yeah, 64 would be acceptable.

1833
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,680
Ah, well.

1834
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:59,680
Honestly, those would be fun levels to zoom around in.

1835
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,680
In no clip.

1836
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,680
Get on it, no clipper.

1837
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,680
Honestly, yeah.

1838
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:12,680
It's a beloved game from a beloved franchise, so you're just missing out.

1839
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:16,680
Oh, you can't see anything from down below.

1840
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:21,680
Like most of the textures do not draw if you see them from below.

1841
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:26,680
So if you go, it's kind of spooky if you go below it and look up at the map.

1842
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,680
Oh, in the Pokemon?

1843
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,680
Yeah.

1844
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:29,680
Let me go back to that.

1845
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,680
Here, I'll show you what it looks like.

1846
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:36,680
This is what it looks like in, if you're a Diglet.

1847
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,680
I thought you were going to say if you're Giratina.

1848
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,680
This is what Giratina sees.

1849
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,680
Is Giratina of the Void?

1850
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:53,680
Yeah, he's in like the, um, what, he's in like, he lives in like the hell dimension.

1851
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,680
Ah, hell.

1852
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,680
Distortion world, distortion world.

1853
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:00,680
Hmm.

1854
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:02,680
This is fun.

1855
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,680
This is a cool little thing.

1856
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,680
Oh my God, I'm zooming around on grand level.

1857
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,680
I really wonder what goes into something like this.

1858
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:20,680
Cause like, it's, it, there's no way it's just as simple as getting the file.

1859
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:25,680
You've got to do a lot of stuff to it to make it just work like this.

1860
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,680
Like in a browser.

1861
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:30,680
Oh, you mean into building this, this website?

1862
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,680
Yeah.

1863
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:32,680
Yeah.

1864
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,680
Um, God, yeah.

1865
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:40,680
Like imagine if it was easy, they would probably have like tons of things, but.

1866
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:49,680
Yeah, I mean, you think they have to like, they must have to, they must have to like

1867
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:53,680
build it from like, sort of from scratch, right?

1868
01:36:53,680 --> 01:37:00,680
They must have to like take the game parts and like, uh, yeah.

1869
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:06,680
Or there must be some, maybe there's some kind of algorithm for like, reading the game files

1870
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:16,680
to sort of like, generate a sort of basic like map shape and then maybe you might have

1871
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:20,680
to go in and like manually apply textures or something.

1872
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:21,680
Yeah.

1873
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:27,680
It's cause it's like, not, not every game is exactly the same, even among the same console

1874
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:30,680
of how they load in everything.

1875
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:36,680
There's probably like juggling like emulating technology and their own thing.

1876
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:40,680
There's probably tools that will get you like much of the way there that can like read the

1877
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,680
data and sort of interpret it into like a level geometry.

1878
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:49,680
But then you, there's probably a lot of like going through it manually and like checking

1879
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,680
everything and like if, if something's texture didn't load, right?

1880
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,680
You have to like manually replace it.

1881
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,680
Oh shit.

1882
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,680
I'm going to go to Halo.

1883
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:00,680
I'm going to see if the Halo is, is, is, is real.

1884
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,680
I'm going to see if Halo is real.

1885
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,680
Big ring.

1886
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:04,680
Yeah.

1887
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,680
I've never played a Halo game.

1888
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,680
Not even a little bit.

1889
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:12,680
I mean, barely.

1890
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:18,680
I remember playing the campaign on PC of the first Halo game and it was fun.

1891
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,680
I liked the aliens.

1892
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,680
I liked shooting them.

1893
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:22,680
Yeah.

1894
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:23,680
Well.

1895
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:27,680
But multiplayer, I was never good and I went to a friend's house once and they were playing

1896
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,680
multiplayer and I died over and over again.

1897
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:30,680
They were laughing.

1898
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:31,680
Yeah.

1899
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,680
They have it.

1900
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:33,680
They play it all the time.

1901
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:39,680
And I'm like, okay, well, yeah, I'm just going to go back to my Game Boy over here.

1902
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,680
Yeah.

1903
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:45,680
I'm not, I'm not super good at first person shooters and I often found them kind of frustrating

1904
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,680
because I would lose at them.

1905
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,680
I know I loaded the wrong map.

1906
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:53,680
I'm still, I'm still zooming around in, in Sinnoh.

1907
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,680
It's for, it's pretty fun.

1908
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,680
Link in the description, of course.

1909
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:01,680
Everyone should be like swinging, flying around with us.

1910
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,680
Yeah.

1911
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:05,680
As they listen.

1912
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,680
Hot tip.

1913
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,680
Use the mouse wheel.

1914
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:11,680
Pull up your mouse wheel and you will zoom faster using WASD.

1915
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:12,680
What?

1916
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,680
Mouse wheel adjusts your camera movement speed.

1917
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,680
It's true.

1918
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,680
That's fucked.

1919
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,680
It's true.

1920
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:19,680
Yeah.

1921
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,680
It's fucked.

1922
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:21,680
Yeah.

1923
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:22,680
It's fucked.

1924
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:28,680
How fucking, uh, I see the halo is merely a skybox.

1925
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,680
No.

1926
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,680
I've broken the illusion.

1927
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,680
Is that on Xbox?

1928
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,680
I don't know.

1929
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,680
PC.

1930
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,680
PC.

1931
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,680
Oh no.

1932
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,680
It's on experimental.

1933
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:39,680
Right at the bottom.

1934
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:40,680
Hmm.

1935
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:41,680
Halo.

1936
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,680
Wait.

1937
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,680
Oh, there.

1938
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:48,680
Why, these are not in, uh, these are not in, in order.

1939
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,680
Uh, what'd you mean?

1940
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:57,680
I mean, why is halo at the bottom of, why are they not in alphabet, they're not in alphabetical

1941
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,680
order.

1942
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:59,680
What the hell?

1943
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:03,680
What is the, what map are you looking at in halo?

1944
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,680
Blood Gulch.

1945
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,680
Campaign halo.

1946
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:10,680
This is the first level of, when you land on the halo and you get out and you're like,

1947
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,680
oh shit, aliens, get him.

1948
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,680
Campaign.

1949
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:15,680
Oh yeah.

1950
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,680
I'm tired.

1951
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,680
Oh yeah?

1952
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:18,680
Yeah.

1953
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,680
Well, I'm Gibb and take.

1954
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:33,680
I had to wake up a little earlier than I wanted to today.

1955
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,680
Do you have any idea what that's like?

1956
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,680
Yes.

1957
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:41,680
No, you don't.

1958
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:46,680
If I had my way, I would wake up when I'm asleep.

1959
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,680
Never.

1960
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,680
Never.

1961
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:52,680
You should watch some John Boyce document.

1962
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,680
I remember trying to read.

1963
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,680
They're so good.

1964
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,680
I remember trying to read 1770, 1776.

1965
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:03,680
And I got like little ways into it and I was like, oh cool.

1966
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:06,680
Yeah, I guess I'll read the rest of it later and I never did.

1967
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,680
Yeah.

1968
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:17,680
You know, I like 17776, but it is a bit of a, it's a bit of a tough read, I guess.

1969
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:23,680
You kind of have to like really sort of focus.

1970
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:30,680
And the premise was interesting, like a satellite that was just realizing that it was a satellite

1971
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:35,680
communicating with something else that was like really far away.

1972
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,680
Yeah, that sounds right.

1973
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:42,680
There was some time stuff like, oh, it's been a long time or like transmissions take a long

1974
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,680
time to travel or something.

1975
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,680
But then they were talking about baseball and then I died.

1976
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,680
You mean football?

1977
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,680
Football.

1978
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,680
Yeah.

1979
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,680
It was one of those spherical games.

1980
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:56,680
For, okay.

1981
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:59,680
Well, I mean a football, an American football is not.

1982
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,680
It's not even a sphere.

1983
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,680
It is oblong, but you know.

1984
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,680
See, that's why I much I know.

1985
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,680
Yeah.

1986
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,680
What's a, what's a good one?

1987
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:09,680
A good, good John.

1988
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,680
Okay.

1989
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:14,680
I mean, it's kind of a long series, but the series about the Atlanta Falcons is pretty

1990
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:15,680
good.

1991
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:16,680
That one's pretty fun.

1992
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:17,680
Interesting.

1993
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,680
What's, what's, what's like a short-ish one?

1994
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:22,680
Just like a one-off.

1995
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,680
That's really good.

1996
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:31,680
Oh, it's another series, but the story, the story of Dave Steeb is really good.

1997
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:37,680
The story of Dave Steeb was like, I saw a list of like best video essays of like the year

1998
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:41,680
and yeah, the series about Dave Steeb made it on that list.

1999
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,680
I think it was a Kotaku list.

2000
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:46,680
There were a couple other videos on that list that I wanted to check out.

2001
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:54,680
There was one where like a guy is giving like a live tour of like a real world bridge, but

2002
01:42:54,680 --> 01:43:01,680
he's doing it like in Battlegrounds 3 and like the people he's giving the tour to are like

2003
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:05,680
these other players in like Battlegrounds and they're just like fricking World War 2 soldiers

2004
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,680
or whatever.

2005
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,680
And he's just leaving them around.

2006
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,680
Or maybe not Battlegrounds.

2007
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,680
Some armor.

2008
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,680
Some war game.

2009
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:19,680
Some like some World War, it might have been a World War 1 game actually.

2010
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:23,680
But he's just leading them around this map in the game and like giving them real world

2011
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,680
information about this bridge that has been recreated.

2012
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:28,680
You know what?

2013
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,680
Let me, you know what?

2014
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:32,680
Let me just find that video because I didn't get all the way through it.

2015
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:38,680
But I started it and I was like, what the fuck is this?

2016
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:41,680
Like why?

2017
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:45,680
I kind of meant to get further through it because like maybe there would be a point

2018
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:50,680
and I'd go, oh, I see why this exists.

2019
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,680
But I like the video or like the bridge.

2020
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,680
The video.

2021
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:59,680
Maybe it's just like you want to know some history.

2022
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:00,680
I got a virtual tour.

2023
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:01,680
I got to be honest.

2024
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:09,680
I didn't really, I didn't immediately understand why I should care about this bridge.

2025
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:10,680
Here's the video.

2026
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:15,680
It's on Vimeo of all things.

2027
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,680
Actually, you know what?

2028
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:19,680
Here's the, here's that list that I found.

2029
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:20,680
No, it's not Kotaku.

2030
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:21,680
It's Polygon.

2031
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:28,680
These are like 10, 10 video essays.

2032
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,680
And yeah, one of them was a John Boyce.

2033
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:35,680
The Captain Ahab, the story of Dave Steeb by Secret Base is on there.

2034
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:41,680
So they must have somewhat decent taste.

2035
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,680
Oh, and then they have a Jacob Geller on here and I'm on the record.

2036
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:49,680
I don't like Jacob Geller.

2037
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:50,680
I'm on the record.

2038
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:53,680
I'll put it out there.

2039
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:57,680
The 10 best video essays of 2022.

2040
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:02,680
What a pathetic theme for an article.

2041
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:07,680
You say, I mean, you say that and yet, and yet, I mean, looking through the list, I

2042
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,680
was not familiar with most of these channels.

2043
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:13,680
And so I thought maybe, and so I thought maybe I should give them a chance.

2044
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:21,680
I find, even though it's like hypocritical of me, I find the idea of caring about like

2045
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:27,680
video essays like dumb, they dumb.

2046
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,680
It's nice and I like them.

2047
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:33,680
So it's really just, it's just like a weird snobby thing I have.

2048
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:42,680
I don't care about them as a medium, but I mean, I don't know if I would even describe

2049
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,680
the story of Dave Steeb as an essay.

2050
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:47,680
It's sort of, it's sort of an essay.

2051
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:54,680
It's sort of a documentary, but it's, um, yeah.

2052
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:58,680
I mean, I guess I wouldn't, you couldn't, I wouldn't say you can't call it an essay.

2053
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:05,680
It is one, but there's more to it than, than just that.

2054
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:11,680
And I mean, this, um, deconstructing the bridge seems like it's more of like a lecture than

2055
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:14,680
an essay.

2056
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:19,680
Oh yeah.

2057
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,680
University level lecture.

2058
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,680
What makes an essay?

2059
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,680
Exactly.

2060
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:33,680
I mean, it really just comes down to like, it is a video presentation with probably a

2061
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:38,680
question at the beginning and explanations with evidence or something.

2062
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:43,680
I guess, I guess all it really takes to be an essay is just that like you wrote it and

2063
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,680
it's like written.

2064
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:46,680
Yeah.

2065
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,680
Yeah.

2066
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:52,680
Like it's meant to convey musings on a point.

2067
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:56,680
And the good essay has a good interesting question that you want to know.

2068
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:00,680
That's why I feel like view source videos are the best video essays because they're like,

2069
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:01,680
I like that.

2070
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:05,680
He's good at speaking and he has nice questions.

2071
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:12,680
Like I don't really give a shit about, uh, a bridge even if it may make me feel smart

2072
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:15,680
to know about it.

2073
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:19,680
Maybe there's a, maybe there's a, what does it say?

2074
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,680
Yeah.

2075
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:24,680
It's more of a university level lecture set in the least academic form imagine a session

2076
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:30,680
of battlefield five, uh, within the battlefield five map is a recreation of Dutch city of

2077
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:36,680
Nijmegen, Nijmegen, the site of a decisive battle during World War two.

2078
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:40,680
Total refusal takes viewers on a survey of the area in virtual form and in the process

2079
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:44,680
they delve not just into the history involved, but also the entire concept of war, tourism

2080
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:48,680
and recreations questioning how culture remembers these events.

2081
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:51,680
Maybe it goes somewhere.

2082
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,680
Yeah.

2083
01:47:52,680 --> 01:48:00,680
I could take or leave a thoughtful topic essay on something.

2084
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,680
What do you mean?

2085
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:06,680
I don't find them, like I don't find them to be something I need to spend my time finding

2086
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:12,680
and watching as opposed to like, oh, there's all these cool shows and films and games.

2087
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,680
Like I feel like I should get around to those things.

2088
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:17,680
But like video essays are like, hmm.

2089
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:18,680
Yeah.

2090
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,680
Sure.

2091
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:22,680
They're a good ones.

2092
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,680
Yeah, it's reasonable.

2093
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:25,680
What is it?

2094
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:26,680
What does it say about me?

2095
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:36,680
What does it say about me that I might be more drawn to a medium about discussing things

2096
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:41,680
than I am drawn to actually like watch or experience the things themselves.

2097
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:45,680
Because I hate shows and I hate art.

2098
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:51,680
I think it's not a bad thing to enjoy a video essay.

2099
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:59,680
Like to have, I mean, it's just sort of, it's a more direct than an art piece.

2100
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:03,680
And art pieces like could be anything.

2101
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:08,680
You're to be entertained usually and feelings are elicited.

2102
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,680
Like an essay sets out with a goal.

2103
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:15,680
Here's a question and we're going to try and we're going to figure this shit out.

2104
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,680
And you're going to learn about it.

2105
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:21,680
And I'm like, well, okay, I can, I can, I'll learn about that.

2106
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,680
Yes.

2107
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:25,680
I know exactly what I'm going to get out of this.

2108
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:27,680
And so it's easier to approach maybe.

2109
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,680
There must be something wrong with me.

2110
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:33,680
It's just a matter of finding out what.

2111
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:36,680
I mean, I don't watch too much stuff either.

2112
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:40,680
I only watch things that are like everyone's saying, you got to, you got to watch it.

2113
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:41,680
Yeah.

2114
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,680
Like eventually I do.

2115
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,680
And I'm like, okay, that was good.

2116
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:47,680
I guess, I guess I'm the same way.

2117
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:52,680
It's like, if I, if enough people recommend me, like Ben, you got to watch this thing.

2118
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:53,680
You got to play this thing.

2119
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:57,680
If enough people tell me that, then I'll, then I'll do it.

2120
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:08,680
Oh, speaking of hypocriticalness, the, I finished medical soil and immediately I went for video

2121
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:13,680
essays or like episode analysis of various things.

2122
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:16,680
And I found this guy truly logical.

2123
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:23,680
A logical has really good, like on a higher level than like your generic, like, here's

2124
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,680
what we know about this scene.

2125
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:26,680
Yeah.

2126
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:27,680
Like it.

2127
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:29,680
He's, he's a little more clued in.

2128
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:37,680
You can tell he is a little more of a smarty pants about like themes and use of color to

2129
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:40,680
denote theme and stuff.

2130
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:43,680
And, you know, use of shots.

2131
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,680
He spends a long time.

2132
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:46,680
Misunseen.

2133
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:47,680
Yeah.

2134
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,680
Whatever that you said.

2135
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:49,680
Yeah.

2136
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:50,680
Yeah.

2137
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:57,680
He spends a long time going over certain shots and the usage of those shots and why and the

2138
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:02,680
character bits and is like, ah, yeah, you know, that's why beyond what I would have

2139
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,680
brought out of it, but just watching it.

2140
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:09,680
But now that I know the story, I can really appreciate those added details.

2141
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:12,680
And there are some things I did have questions on.

2142
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:19,680
Like some scenes are just a little, a little obtuse.

2143
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:20,680
He breaks them down.

2144
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:26,680
I'm like, oh, yeah, that's so smart that it, it does the thing.

2145
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,680
And I get it.

2146
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:29,680
Now I'm smart.

2147
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,680
And that's why I like videos.

2148
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:32,680
Very good.

2149
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,680
Very good.

2150
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,680
His name is all logical.

2151
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:39,680
All logical with an O at the beginning.

2152
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,680
The two L's.

2153
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:42,680
Oh, no.

2154
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,680
One L.

2155
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:47,680
Let me just get a random, a random one.

2156
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:48,680
Hmm.

2157
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,680
What does the blue flower mean?

2158
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:50,680
Oh my God.

2159
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:52,680
It's a Game of Thrones reference.

2160
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:53,680
Yeah.

2161
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:56,680
It's so, so good.

2162
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:59,680
That's a spoiler for you though.

2163
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:00,680
You shouldn't click on that.

2164
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:01,680
I probably shouldn't click on it.

2165
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,680
I should watch better.

2166
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:08,680
I mean, I've watched all of Breaking Bad and most of Better Call Saul, I think.

2167
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:11,680
So I should probably finish it at some point.

2168
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:12,680
Yeah.

2169
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:15,680
I mean, I do like Bob.

2170
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,680
Who doesn't like Bob?

2171
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:19,680
Oh yeah.

2172
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:20,680
Everyone loves Bob.

2173
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:24,680
And then the best thing about finishing a show, especially a really good dramatic show,

2174
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:28,680
is that now you can watch all the bloopers without being spoiled.

2175
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:34,680
And you can see the characters that have been so expertly played.

2176
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,680
Be a little silly.

2177
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:37,680
Be a little silly.

2178
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:38,680
Finally.

2179
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:41,680
You see Gus going, wah!

2180
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,680
Gus Fring going, woohoo!

2181
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:46,680
And jumping like Mario.

2182
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,680
Perfect.

2183
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:51,680
That's just what I want.

2184
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:55,680
That's the only reason you should watch any show, is so you can get invested in a serious character

2185
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,680
and then you can see them be a real person in an interview.

2186
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:01,680
You're going to build them up so you can break them down and watch them go, ha ha ha ha.

2187
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,680
Ha ha ha.

2188
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:04,680
Oh, Jollity and Gaity.

2189
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:05,680
How I missed you.

2190
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:12,680
You slap your head off the forehead and go, oh my God, they were just acting this whole time.

2191
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,680
I love that.

2192
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:15,680
Yeah.

2193
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:16,680
Jonathan Banks.

2194
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:17,680
What a sweetie pie.

2195
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:18,680
What a cutie pie.

2196
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:19,680
But in the show.

2197
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:20,680
Jonathan Banks.

2198
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:21,680
Who's that?

2199
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:22,680
Mike Herman Trout.

2200
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:23,680
Oh yeah.

2201
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:27,680
And so he's like, he's a grizzled, like I listen here, Walter.

2202
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:33,680
You're going to take your pants off and you're going to piss right on my face, Walter.

2203
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:34,680
Like that's what he says in the show.

2204
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,680
But in reality.

2205
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:36,680
It's the only way to get the poise now.

2206
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,680
I got stung by a jellyfish, Walter.

2207
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,680
You got to pee on it.

2208
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:42,680
Pea on it, Walter.

2209
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:46,680
And in real life, he's a nice, he's a nice boy.

2210
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:49,680
He doesn't want to get peed on in real life.

2211
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:50,680
Oh, good.

2212
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,680
What a relief.

2213
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:58,680
You see, when we were filming that scene, I didn't want piss on me because I don't actually

2214
01:53:58,680 --> 01:53:59,680
like that.

2215
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,680
But I thought, but I thought, you know, I was going to do it for the part.

2216
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:05,680
But I thought, you know, the, you know, Mike, the character, you know, I thought he would

2217
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:09,680
probably want to get pissed on because like, you know, that's what it would take to like

2218
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:12,680
keep his daughter safe and like his grandson safe.

2219
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,680
So he would say piss on me.

2220
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:20,680
So that's what I said in that scene because I was playing the character you see.

2221
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:22,680
He would need to be pissed on.

2222
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:24,680
You see, there's this thing called acting.

2223
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:29,680
You see, it's like playing pretend, but on a, with camera, they film you.

2224
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:31,680
Put it on TV.

2225
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:35,680
It's wild.

2226
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:41,680
My impression of him is morphing into a Sylvester Stallone.

2227
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:46,680
I'm trying to think of, did I, did I, did I experience anything else this week?

2228
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,680
No.

2229
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:49,680
Did you have feelings?

2230
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:53,680
Did you have touch and sound the site smell?

2231
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:58,680
I felt depression, despair, despondency, the three D's.

2232
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:00,680
Nuts.

2233
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:10,680
Devastation, disenfranchisement, denouement.

2234
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,680
Denouement.

2235
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:14,680
Yeah.

2236
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:18,680
Is that like a, like a French thing, like meaning the end?

2237
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:19,680
Yeah.

2238
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,680
Oh no.

2239
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:24,680
The French, the French are ending.

2240
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:26,680
Um.

2241
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:29,680
But they made so much good bread.

2242
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:35,680
Yeah, well, it wasn't enough, unfortunately.

2243
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:46,680
Oh, um, I think tomorrow, I think tomorrow I'll be able to restore, add, add revenue functionality to the channel.

2244
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:52,680
Or if not, or if not tomorrow, shortly thereafter, the nightmare.

2245
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:55,680
The nightmare is almost over.

2246
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:59,680
Um, Lamal, sorry about that.

2247
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:02,680
Uh, it's okay.

2248
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:07,680
Yeah, it was a mistake that I made and I won't make it again.

2249
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:14,680
Cost us like 150 bucks, but I got probably at the 80 bucks out of the, of the account.

2250
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:20,680
So, you know, costs like 90, like seven bucks.

2251
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:22,680
Sorry.

2252
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:25,680
It's all coming out of your.

2253
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,680
It's all, it's all coming out of your.

2254
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:33,680
Uh, I don't know.

2255
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:34,680
This week felt really long.

2256
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:38,680
This week felt really long and yet I can't remember anything that happened.

2257
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:41,680
God.

2258
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:47,680
There's a thing with the Scottish parliament trying to get.

2259
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,680
God.

2260
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:53,680
Trying to get that gender reform, gender bill through.

2261
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,680
And that's good, right?

2262
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,680
Scotland is the good guys.

2263
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:58,680
Yes.

2264
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:12,680
They want, they, they realize that the, um, the way to get gender help in, you know, the UK is evil and distressing on purpose.

2265
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:13,680
Yeah.

2266
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:15,680
And, uh, it's, uh, bad.

2267
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:17,680
So they're going, they want to change it.

2268
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:18,680
They want to make it easier.

2269
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:25,680
They want to remove the requirement, uh, for a doctor's note, uh, to determine that you are trans.

2270
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:28,680
You can now self-identify or at least that's what they want.

2271
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:41,680
Was it, was it the thing where like to be like legally change your gender, you have to have like a doctor's note, but like the doctor won't like acknowledge it unless you've already been on hormones for like two years.

2272
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:48,680
But to get on hormones, you have to have a doctor's note saying that you're trans, but the doctor won't say that unless you've been on hormones.

2273
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:51,680
It's not like a criss-cross thing like that.

2274
01:57:51,680 --> 01:58:07,680
It's, um, if you want to get on hormones, you need, uh, to be certified trans by a board of people who determine whether you're not you're trans, uh, by interviewing you.

2275
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:17,680
And the waiting, the wait for the interview, uh, takes usually two years, um, sometimes longer.

2276
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:22,680
And it's clear they just don't put the money in to staff it correctly.

2277
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:24,680
They have thousands upon thousands of people waiting.

2278
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:26,680
And so the queue is extremely long.

2279
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:30,680
And the people in there don't seem to give a shit.

2280
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:35,680
And they're horrible and demeaning from, you know, stories I've heard.

2281
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:43,680
And they just, you know, it's very clear that the system doesn't like trans people at all.

2282
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:45,680
What's nothing to do with them.

2283
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:48,680
So what's the Scottish legislation?

2284
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:53,680
They want to cut out all of that bullshit to get a gender recognition certificate.

2285
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:55,680
They just want, they want it to be.

2286
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:59,680
Like in Scotland or would it apply to the UK generally?

2287
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:03,680
It would apply to Scotland, as far as I understand.

2288
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:12,680
But the UK is, was concerned that people would go to Scotland to get a gender recognition certificate.

2289
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:21,680
It can be easier to get one, like to be able to change their gender for stuff and then come back to the UK.

2290
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:27,680
And they'd be like, nah, we can't have this allowed thing.

2291
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:32,680
We can't allow it to happen because it'd be confusing because we won't do that.

2292
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:37,680
We won't recognize that as a legitimate thing.

2293
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:43,680
So like if you're a Scottish national and you get your gender changed and you go to the UK,

2294
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,680
they will not recognize it if that were to go through.

2295
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,680
So they said, no, we're just going to block it entirely.

2296
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:54,680
And now Scotland is going to have to go to court to fight it.

2297
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:57,680
And it looks like they want to.

2298
01:59:57,680 --> 02:00:01,680
And it's a big sort of like thing.

2299
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,680
I'm wondering what's going to happen.

2300
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:09,680
I've seen JK Rowling has been like, she seems agitated.

2301
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:11,680
She seems agitated about it.

2302
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:16,680
And the way that you can tell that she's agitated is she's like gone.

2303
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:20,680
The last couple of days, I think she's been like even more so than usual.

2304
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:26,680
Retweeting people with like a thousand followers being like this person wants to commit violence against women.

2305
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:29,680
This person wants to kill women.

2306
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,680
Yeah, it's great.

2307
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:33,680
She's a real ghoul.

2308
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:36,680
She's a real demon woman.

2309
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:40,680
It's pretty sick.

2310
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:44,680
And I know she has her claws in the BBC.

2311
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:47,680
I know she has her tendrils all over that place.

2312
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:57,680
BBC is like sort of consistently painting the Scottish Parliament and what's her name?

2313
02:00:57,680 --> 02:01:00,680
The important lady at the front of the top of it.

2314
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:02,680
Is it Nicola Sturgeon?

2315
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:03,680
Can't remember.

2316
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:05,680
That's a lady.

2317
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:08,680
Like the leader of the Scottish Parliament.

2318
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:11,680
Nicola?

2319
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,680
Nicola.

2320
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:16,680
Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland.

2321
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:21,680
Like if Scotland had a prime minister, she would be it basically.

2322
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,680
I see, yeah.

2323
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:26,680
Are they going to do separatism?

2324
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:28,680
Are they going to do a secede from the Union?

2325
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:30,680
Is it going to be civil war?

2326
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:32,680
They have wanted to.

2327
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:41,680
Scotland has wanted to be allowed a vote to leave the UK because for such a long time,

2328
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:48,680
they always vote for a left-leaning, good, nice human person stuff.

2329
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:51,680
I did not know that about Scotland.

2330
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:54,680
No, they're cool people up there.

2331
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:56,680
They vote left-leaning.

2332
02:01:56,680 --> 02:02:00,680
They're more labour, far more labour than conservative.

2333
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:08,680
And they just want to leave because every election, the majority is always conservative because there are more English people

2334
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:10,680
and most English people are conservative.

2335
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:19,680
I kind of thought Northern UK was more conservative and Southern England was the more urban, liberal centre.

2336
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,680
It's actually not so much.

2337
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:30,680
Urban is generally more liberal, but there are lots of urban areas that are extremely exclusive,

2338
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:34,680
upper-class, super-white areas as well.

2339
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:41,680
Ancient areas that only extremely wealthy people and really snobby people go to.

2340
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:47,680
So it's not like the urban environment is integrated smoothly through all the places.

2341
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:55,680
So there are pockets of left-leaning stuff in London and stuff, but there's a lot of conservatives in the South

2342
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:58,680
as well as some parts of the North.

2343
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:03,680
The North has historically been more left-leaning, more labour, worker-focused.

2344
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,680
I see.

2345
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:12,680
In America, you look at maps of which districts voted for which presidential candidates.

2346
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:18,680
There are blue states and red states, but if you actually look at it by district,

2347
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:27,680
the blue centres are always clustered around the major cities and the red districts are outside of the major cities.

2348
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:32,680
Blue states are just states that have a bigger urban population,

2349
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:35,680
and 90% of the time that's how it breaks down.

2350
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:37,680
That's the real split.

2351
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:42,680
I would say that's the same in the UK.

2352
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:51,680
It's not like city areas, just adjacent to cities that have lots of mansions in them

2353
02:03:51,680 --> 02:04:04,680
and big suburban, rich suburbs, but big house suburbs near London and around London, some in London.

2354
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,680
I think I understand.

2355
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:14,680
It's a little bit of this and that, but Scotland has always been not happy with things like Brexit

2356
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:20,680
and other various conservative decisions that are awful and terrible.

2357
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:27,680
This seems to be a linchpin moment.

2358
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:36,680
It seems to be a turning point where if they go to court against the UK,

2359
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:42,680
it could set things in motion for another attempt at seceding from the kingdom.

2360
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:44,680
That'd be so fucking funny.

2361
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:49,680
It would be funny, and honestly, I want that for them because I hate the UK.

2362
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:54,680
The UK, the England part, it sucks.

2363
02:04:54,680 --> 02:05:02,680
I mean, frankly, your people need to be punished for their transgressions.

2364
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:04,680
They need to suffer some consequences.

2365
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:10,680
They fucking voted for Brexit, and they're just generally idiots, and I hate them.

2366
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:15,680
If Scotland manages to secede, I'd move.

2367
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:16,680
I'd go to Scotland.

2368
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:21,680
I know it'd be probably difficult because it's moving to a different country is always difficult.

2369
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:22,680
Like, fuck it.

2370
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:26,680
Maybe you should move now before they break officially.

2371
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:32,680
Maybe you could move before they officially announced they had actually left.

2372
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:34,680
I could try.

2373
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:39,680
But then probably once they split, they probably would need new paperwork or something.

2374
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:42,680
You'd be like, you haven't lived in Scotland for that long.

2375
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:46,680
It'd be suddenly like, oh, you're here, but you're a UK citizen,

2376
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:49,680
so now you're going to need a visa or something like that.

2377
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:52,680
Yes, it's always going to be a thing.

2378
02:05:52,680 --> 02:06:00,680
But if Scotland secedes and they're their own nation, they'll probably join the European Union,

2379
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:05,680
and they'll be so embarrassing for England.

2380
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:10,680
They will have gender thing, and I'm like, fuck it.

2381
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:11,680
I'm gone.

2382
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:13,680
I'm going to be Scottish now.

2383
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:14,680
Damn.

2384
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:15,680
Yeah.

2385
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:19,680
That's pretty wild if it shakes out like that.

2386
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:21,680
It'll be pretty fucking wild.

2387
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:25,680
And then the Union flag will have no blue in it.

2388
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,680
It'll be red and white.

2389
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:30,680
Would you think they'd change the flag?

2390
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:34,680
Because it's the symbol of the countries that are involved.

2391
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:35,680
So, yeah.

2392
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,680
Yeah.

2393
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:37,680
Oh, my God.

2394
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:41,680
I mean, I guess, yeah, if Texas seceded from America,

2395
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:45,680
I guess we'd need a new flag with 49 stars on it.

2396
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:49,680
So, LeMalle.

2397
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:53,680
And then it would be so much less cool of a color scheme.

2398
02:06:53,680 --> 02:06:59,680
So it would just be the big middle cross and the red X behind it.

2399
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:04,680
It would be the big middle cross with the white outline and then the diagonal X,

2400
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:07,680
the red X with the white outline.

2401
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:09,680
I guess it would just be white.

2402
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:11,680
So it would just be red Xs.

2403
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:15,680
It would just be a red cross and a superimposed on a red X.

2404
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,680
Uh-huh.

2405
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:17,680
Hang on, hang on.

2406
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:19,680
I wonder if someone's mocked this up.

2407
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:22,680
UK flag without Scotland.

2408
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:26,680
Oh, my God.

2409
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:31,680
Well, someone has this one, and I think this one includes like whales,

2410
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:35,680
which like whales is like not represented on the flag currently.

2411
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:37,680
No.

2412
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:39,680
I don't know why.

2413
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:40,680
Yeah.

2414
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:42,680
I never really thought about it though.

2415
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:45,680
Because I always assume, you know what?

2416
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:49,680
I don't know what the diagonal X cross is for.

2417
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:51,680
I remember learning about it once.

2418
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:56,680
I know the horizontal big cross in the middle is England

2419
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:58,680
and the blue is Scotland.

2420
02:07:58,680 --> 02:08:01,680
Gee, I just don't know what that other one is.

2421
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:04,680
Oh, that one, that second one sucks.

2422
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:08,680
Yeah, they should, it needs the white bars.

2423
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:15,680
It needs the white bars and breaking up the, I mean, here's one that's kind of...

2424
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:16,680
No.

2425
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:17,680
Oh, dear.

2426
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:23,680
I think the first one just without the green is probably the best.

2427
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:27,680
Okay, now I'm curious.

2428
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:33,680
Okay, the Union Jack is the flag and...

2429
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:36,680
Oh, my God, it's complicated.

2430
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:37,680
Fuck.

2431
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:40,680
Vexillology is complicated.

2432
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:44,680
Okay, the flag consists of the Red Cross of St George,

2433
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:47,680
Patron State of England, which also represents whales,

2434
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:52,680
aged in white, superimposed on the salt here of St Patrick, Patron State of Ireland.

2435
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:53,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2436
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:54,680
Oh, St...

2437
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:56,680
Oh, so it's the Irish part.

2438
02:08:56,680 --> 02:09:00,680
So if Northern Ireland leaves, then you would get rid of the diagonal.

2439
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:01,680
Oh.

2440
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:06,680
If Northern Ireland goes back to becoming part of Ireland, then that part would leave

2441
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:08,680
and then it would just be England.

2442
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:12,680
There'd be no kingdom, except Wales, I guess.

2443
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:16,680
Wales is the only one left.

2444
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:21,680
And then it would just be, it would just be, yeah, the Red Cross of England,

2445
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:24,680
but like the bottom two quarters would just be green.

2446
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:29,680
I think the Union Jack came together pretty well in its current state.

2447
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:31,680
I think it looks pretty good.

2448
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:32,680
Yeah, it's three different saints.

2449
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:35,680
St George, St Patrick and St Andrew.

2450
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:37,680
See, look at this.

2451
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:40,680
Wales is not represented in the Union flag by Wales as Patron St David,

2452
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:44,680
because the flag was designed whilst Wales was part of the Kingdom of England.

2453
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:47,680
Wait, it's not, their patron saint isn't St George,

2454
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:49,680
even though they have a freaking dragon on their flag?

2455
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:51,680
No, that's the English one.

2456
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:56,680
St George is like a saint who slayed a dragon and Wales is a guy they like.

2457
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:57,680
They is the dragon.

2458
02:09:57,680 --> 02:09:58,680
Oh, fuck.

2459
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:02,680
Your dragon can't be on our flag.

2460
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,680
We killed your guy.

2461
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:06,680
That might literally be it.

2462
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:09,680
Here's a suggestion.

2463
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:14,680
Slay the dragon could mean like, oh, we took over this kingdom

2464
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:17,680
and this is the flag we both fly under now.

2465
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,680
That's hilarious.

2466
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:20,680
Cucked.

2467
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:21,680
Wales cucked.

2468
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:28,680
Wales, you know, if the dragon was more prominent, it'd be even cooler, I think.

2469
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:30,680
Wales should be the important one.

2470
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:32,680
I have mixed feelings about the dragon.

2471
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:38,680
On the one hand, the dragon is cool and like the old school like design of it is cool.

2472
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:46,680
But also, I kind of feel like busy drawings are kind of weak flag design.

2473
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:49,680
I think that I think they're not very iconic.

2474
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:58,680
I think the Welsh flag is I think the best way that sort of a type of flag has been

2475
02:10:58,680 --> 02:10:59,680
because it is iconic.

2476
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:01,680
It's only got a few colors.

2477
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:02,680
Yeah.

2478
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:05,680
And it's like unique in that it has an animal.

2479
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:07,680
It has a depiction of a creature.

2480
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:11,680
No, you're, yeah, you're kind of right.

2481
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:15,680
You're kind of like for that type, I think it's good.

2482
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:22,680
Generally, I feel like if you can if you can have a strong and iconic flag design without

2483
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:26,680
just like fucking draw in a thing on it, I think it's better.

2484
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:28,680
I agree.

2485
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:33,680
But I think the fact that most other flags don't have a dragon or some sort of elaborate

2486
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:39,680
creature on it means that it is allowed to stand out in a way that that is like not because

2487
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:41,680
if everybody drew stuff, it would be very confusing.

2488
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:45,680
The fact that it's the only one means that it's good and it's fine.

2489
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:48,680
I, yeah, I agree.

2490
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:49,680
I agree.

2491
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:51,680
Have I showed you the Massachusetts flag?

2492
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:54,680
I've probably seen it before, but no.

2493
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:55,680
It sucks.

2494
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:57,680
It's dog shit.

2495
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:04,680
I know the New Mexico flag because they show it in medical soul a few times.

2496
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:06,680
The, or wait a minute.

2497
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:14,680
Yeah, it's the the the Massachusetts flag is this weird like shield with a Native American

2498
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:19,680
like brave on it and then the freaking like sword arm.

2499
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:22,680
I don't know if it's meant to crest.

2500
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:26,680
I don't know if it's meant to be like, yeah, we freaking like killed these guys, but it

2501
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:29,680
kind of looks like, yeah, we freaking conquered these dudes.

2502
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:34,680
I think it's actually not meant to mean that, but the sword over them is really grim.

2503
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:37,680
Yeah, like he's about to swing around, chop his head off.

2504
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:38,680
That's what it looks like.

2505
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:39,680
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

2506
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:43,680
There's some like Latin, some Latin phrase or whatever.

2507
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:49,680
This is the sort of thing you would put on like an official document, not like a flag.

2508
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:52,680
I think it's, it's, it's a, this is a crest.

2509
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:53,680
This is not a flag.

2510
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:54,680
No, of course.

2511
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:55,680
Yeah.

2512
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:59,680
But if it counts as the flag of the state.

2513
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:01,680
This, this is the official.

2514
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:04,680
Wall flag of Massachusetts.

2515
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:08,680
Although there is also a.

2516
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:11,680
Yeah, the New Mexico flag is great.

2517
02:13:12,680 --> 02:13:15,680
I really like the Maryland flag a lot.

2518
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:17,680
What's the New Mexico flag?

2519
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:20,680
That's like, yeah, that one's pretty good.

2520
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:23,680
It's like the sun because it's hot.

2521
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:25,680
And it's yellow.

2522
02:13:25,680 --> 02:13:29,680
It looks like it looks like one of those Japanese like district flags.

2523
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:30,680
Yes.

2524
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:36,680
The you, you have probably seen this because it was flying everywhere at Brony con, but

2525
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:40,680
the Maryland flag is like this.

2526
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:44,680
Oh, and it's a little busy, but like it's really striking.

2527
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:45,680
I think it looks awesome.

2528
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:47,680
Yeah.

2529
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:53,680
The black and yellow makes me think of driver, the video game series.

2530
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:55,680
Crazy taxi.

2531
02:13:56,680 --> 02:14:00,680
But the white and red part is like medieval looking.

2532
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,680
Yeah.

2533
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:02,680
For sure.

2534
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:03,680
Like nights on bikes.

2535
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:10,680
By jousting on.

2536
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:11,680
Yeah.

2537
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:13,680
I'm trying to.

2538
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:19,680
I'm trying to read up on like why what is like the the symbolism of the

2539
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:21,680
Massachusetts flag meant to represent.

2540
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:24,680
Yeah, we killed all those natives.

2541
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:28,680
The shield is meant to depict an Algonquin native American with bow and arrow.

2542
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:31,680
The arrow is pointed downward signifying peace.

2543
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:36,680
However, the face of the figure is modeled on a photo of Ojibwe chief Thomas little shell.

2544
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:41,680
A white star with five points appears next to the figure's head signifying Massachusetts as a U.S.

2545
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:42,680
state.

2546
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:43,680
Okay.

2547
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:48,680
I mean, it's not like any of the other state flags have a little white star to be like, yeah,

2548
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:50,680
we're one of the stars on the American flag.

2549
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:51,680
Yeah.

2550
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:55,680
A blue ribbon surrounds the shield bearing the state motto.

2551
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:06,680
This is weird.

2552
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:11,680
Above the shield is the state military crest, the bent arm holding a broad sword aloft.

2553
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:17,680
The sword has its blade up to remind that it was through the American Revolution that Liberty was one.

2554
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:23,680
The sword itself is the copy of one belonging to Miles Standish and signifies the philosophy

2555
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:26,680
that one would rather lose their right arm than live under tyranny.

2556
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:27,680
Holy shit.

2557
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:29,680
Pretty cool.

2558
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:33,680
Kind of cool, but there's like a lot of just a lot going on.

2559
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,680
Just a lot freaking going on.

2560
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:41,680
What if you did a cosplay as the flag?

2561
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:45,680
I like that would be racist.

2562
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:50,680
No, you dress up as a shield with a blue ribbon around it and you wear it like you have your

2563
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:53,680
hand like holding a sword above your head the whole time.

2564
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:58,680
And you've got a white sheet on underneath.

2565
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:03,680
Sounds a little, I don't know.

2566
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:05,680
I don't know if the message would come across.

2567
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:13,680
Yeah, I mean, I guess the Indian is just there to just be like, yeah, these guys lived here.

2568
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:15,680
It's like, OK.

2569
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,680
Chief Thomas Little Shell.

2570
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:21,680
I wonder what his deal was.

2571
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:22,680
Do we like him?

2572
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:24,680
Do we stand Thomas Little Shell?

2573
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:26,680
Let's find out.

2574
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:27,680
Yeah.

2575
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:34,680
Chief of a band of the Ojibwa Chippewa tribe in the second half of the 19th century.

2576
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:41,680
Little Shell attempted to sell his remaining lands for $1 per acre and be allowed to have at least

2577
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:44,680
10 million acres of remaining lands in Montana.

2578
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:51,680
OK, it seems like he refused to negotiate with the United States about seeding more land for

2579
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:52,680
almost another 30 years.

2580
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:55,680
Little Shell refused to negotiate with the United States over land.

2581
02:16:55,680 --> 02:17:00,680
Together the Anishinabeg occupied an area.

2582
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:02,680
I mean, OK.

2583
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:18,680
He seems like just he was chief of the tribe at that time and we had relations with him, some amicable and some not.

2584
02:17:19,680 --> 02:17:21,680
So neutral, I guess.

2585
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:24,680
So we put his likeness on a shield.

2586
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:31,680
So we put his likeness on a state shield maybe to be like, we respect those guys?

2587
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:33,680
I guess.

2588
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:36,680
I guess you had to be there.

2589
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:40,680
At the time, it made perfect sense at the time.

2590
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:42,680
Yeah.

2591
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:46,680
Yeah, seems like it's...

2592
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:48,680
I think people...

2593
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:58,680
I think there's been a bit of a movement to change the flag, but I don't know if it's like that big of one.

2594
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:07,680
You know, I think some people say that it's a bit of like a, you know, the Washington Redskins situation, but there's a little antiquated.

2595
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:09,680
Yeah, but I don't know if there's like that.

2596
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:12,680
But I just kind of think it's just kind of think it's ugly.

2597
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:14,680
I think it's an ugly flag design.

2598
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:20,680
I'm not sure if I think it's like bad representation or appropriation or whatever.

2599
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:26,680
What would you, what would you as a Massachusetts, what would you have on your flag?

2600
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:30,680
God, I'm the wrong person to ask.

2601
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,680
There is like another...

2602
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:40,680
Okay, well, there's a there's a Massachusetts naval ensign that just looks like this.

2603
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:44,680
I don't know if I am super into it.

2604
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:45,680
It's a tree.

2605
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:47,680
Just a pine tree.

2606
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,680
Yeah.

2607
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:50,680
We got those all over the place.

2608
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:59,680
There's also, yeah, that was like, well, that was like when we had a state Navy and we don't.

2609
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:11,680
Ooh, the Massachusetts state flag, according to a survey, was the 38th, ranked 38th best flag in America.

2610
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:14,680
So not very, not very high.

2611
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:21,680
Oh, 38th out of 72, which included US state, US territorial and Canadian provincial flags.

2612
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:23,680
So it's mid, it's mid.

2613
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:25,680
I guess it can get worse.

2614
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:31,680
What's that like extremely embarrassing one that looks like Microsoft Paint with like the trees in the river?

2615
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:35,680
Yeah, that wasn't, I don't think that was a state flag.

2616
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:38,680
I think that was like, I know the one you're talking about.

2617
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:40,680
Really bad flag Google.

2618
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:42,680
Immediately.

2619
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:47,680
River G County, Liberia.

2620
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:52,680
Actually, if I can see a picture of the Liberian flag, like a photograph of it in real life.

2621
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:53,680
Oh, no.

2622
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:58,680
No, they only show the, the star and bar part of it.

2623
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:01,680
I'm, I'm learning so much.

2624
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,680
Okay.

2625
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:04,680
So, okay.

2626
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:13,680
So there's a flag called the English Red Ensign, which is the civil ensign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain.

2627
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:17,680
And Northern Ireland, it is one of the British ensigns.

2628
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:18,680
What does that mean?

2629
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:25,680
What is a, in British maritime law and custom and ensign is the identifying flag flown to designate a British ship.

2630
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:26,680
Okay.

2631
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:27,680
So.

2632
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:29,680
Just the Liberian G County.

2633
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:32,680
God, what the fuck?

2634
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:35,680
That's not, that's not the one I was thinking of.

2635
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:38,680
It's the one I was thinking of.

2636
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:43,680
Well, there's that one that has like, it has like a freaking like gradient on it.

2637
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:45,680
Yeah, I don't know that one.

2638
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:46,680
Wait, is this?

2639
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:48,680
I'm going to search shitty flags.

2640
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:54,680
There's like, there's, there's versions of this flag.

2641
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:55,680
Some of these are not that bad.

2642
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,680
This Liberian flag.

2643
02:20:57,680 --> 02:20:59,680
They just look like someone else drew it.

2644
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:01,680
But like, which one is the actual one?

2645
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:02,680
Is it that one?

2646
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:04,680
Oh, this is, I found a list.

2647
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:08,680
I found a list of shitty flags and like, this is dog shit.

2648
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:10,680
Some of these are like good, actually.

2649
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,680
This is like, this is like a joke list.

2650
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:13,680
This is garbage.

2651
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:15,680
Okay.

2652
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:16,680
The Liberian flag.

2653
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:17,680
Yeah, I see that one.

2654
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:21,680
What's the one that has the freaking gradient?

2655
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:24,680
It has like a gradient and like a full sentence on it.

2656
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:28,680
Oh, you know, I think I know that one, but yeah, I can't remember it either.

2657
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:32,680
I think it was from somewhere in like Utah or.

2658
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:35,680
It was like anim.

2659
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:37,680
It was like, it was like a city flag.

2660
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:40,680
I can't, I can't find it right away.

2661
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,680
All right.

2662
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:44,680
So, so, so check this out, right?

2663
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:52,680
So this is, this is the red, the English red ensign, which you flew to designate that your ship was English.

2664
02:21:52,680 --> 02:22:03,680
And then to that, they added this freaking Massachusetts naval sign to make this was like the flag of New England.

2665
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:07,680
They added the freaking Massachusetts tree on it.

2666
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:09,680
So that's flying in the wind.

2667
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:12,680
You can see the red, you see, okay, it's an ensign ship.

2668
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:15,680
And then that tiny little bit of green right in the corner.

2669
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:19,680
And then they, and then they took, they took off, I think this was post-revolution.

2670
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:25,680
They took off the British ensign part and they just made it this and this, and this became the flag of New England.

2671
02:22:26,680 --> 02:22:27,680
And okay, look at this shit.

2672
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:33,680
That looks like you had a PNG of a tree, but you didn't know how to cut around the white.

2673
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:36,680
You didn't know how to cut out the white around the tree.

2674
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:38,680
Oh my God.

2675
02:22:38,680 --> 02:22:39,680
Wait a second.

2676
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:40,680
You're going to love this.

2677
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:41,680
Okay.

2678
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:47,680
This was, this is the, I'm about to show you the first flag adopted by the state of Massachusetts after independence.

2679
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:49,680
And it's called the pine tree flag.

2680
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:50,680
And it looks like this.

2681
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:51,680
And it looks like this.

2682
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:57,680
This, this really does look like MS paint.

2683
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:58,680
That's so sad.

2684
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:00,680
An appeal to heaven.

2685
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:01,680
What are they asking for?

2686
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:04,680
I, I don't, I don't quite get it.

2687
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:06,680
Please put us out of our misery.

2688
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:08,680
It's what it seems to be saying.

2689
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:10,680
Please.

2690
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:11,680
Yeah.

2691
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:12,680
A simp emoji.

2692
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:15,680
Heaven, please.

2693
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:17,680
Heaven, please swallow us up.

2694
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:21,680
And then, and then this one's a little better.

2695
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:23,680
Reverse side of the flag of Massachusetts.

2696
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:26,680
The reverse side looked like this.

2697
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:28,680
It's a little better.

2698
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:32,680
It's a little more iconic, but I really, I really don't like that green on blue.

2699
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:34,680
It's very dull.

2700
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:36,680
It is pretty dull.

2701
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:42,680
I think an actual shield like that would be pretty cool, but on a flag, it's like, it's too small.

2702
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:44,680
The colors are too similar to each other.

2703
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:45,680
Yeah.

2704
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:51,680
So I kind of appreciate what they were going for, but I don't know if this really, this one really does it for me.

2705
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:54,680
Is that not symmetrical?

2706
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:55,680
Yeah, it's not.

2707
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:56,680
Yeah.

2708
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:57,680
The tree is not quite symmetrical.

2709
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:58,680
I noticed that too.

2710
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:00,680
It's, it's so annoying to me that like.

2711
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:02,680
Yeah.

2712
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:03,680
Why wouldn't you just make it?

2713
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:08,680
It's not just that it's not symmetrical, but like the top of it seems more jagged and flat.

2714
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:11,680
And then that one part in the bottom left is like really loosey-goosey.

2715
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:12,680
Squeeze.

2716
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:13,680
Yeah.

2717
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:15,680
Yeah.

2718
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:18,680
I, I, I don't understand.

2719
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:20,680
I don't.

2720
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:22,680
This is why they need us up on that crew.

2721
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:26,680
Everybody needs an us up.

2722
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:29,680
If you, if you can, when you get right down to it.

2723
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:33,680
Well, that's a, I like flags.

2724
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:34,680
I like symbols.

2725
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:36,680
Yeah.

2726
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:37,680
And signs.

2727
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:38,680
We should have a flag.

2728
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:39,680
We should have a PCP flag.

2729
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:42,680
Hmm.

2730
02:24:44,680 --> 02:24:47,680
The letters PCP drawn and quartered.

2731
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:49,680
No.

2732
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:57,680
Apparently, you know how they, they put the tree, they put the tree in the little window there.

2733
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:04,680
Apparently when you add another symbol onto an existing flag, it's called defacement.

2734
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:09,680
So we defaced the British red ensign with the, the tree of New England.

2735
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,680
Good job.

2736
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:15,680
Defacement, parentheses, complimentary.

2737
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:18,680
Oh, you know what we should do?

2738
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:22,680
You know how like we all had in the PCP, like a color association.

2739
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:23,680
Yeah.

2740
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:27,680
I had like that turquoise greeny blue because of my Gibb and takeo scene.

2741
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:29,680
You had like gray or black.

2742
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:31,680
I was usually like black or white.

2743
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:32,680
Yeah.

2744
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:33,680
Yeah.

2745
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:35,680
We should make a flag that's our two colors because we're the only ones left.

2746
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:37,680
Yeah.

2747
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:38,680
You know what?

2748
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:40,680
It's a great idea.

2749
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:44,680
And I mean, I think I'm, I think I'm solidly purple now.

2750
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,680
Purple?

2751
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:52,680
I think I've, I think I've, um, what's, what's the word for like, uh, oh, I learned from Burger Creek.

2752
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:59,680
When one vampire like fully drains another and eats them to gain their power and take their domain over.

2753
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:00,680
Um.

2754
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:01,680
Voir.

2755
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:02,680
Diablerize.

2756
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:07,680
I've, I've diablerized Mage and taken over her purple domain and now I'm the purple one.

2757
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:08,680
I see.

2758
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:10,680
Purple and purple, black and white.

2759
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:12,680
I thought you'd be purple, black and green.

2760
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:13,680
Yeah.

2761
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:14,680
But you're green.

2762
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:15,680
So.

2763
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,680
Um, I guess so.

2764
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:22,680
I feel like, I feel like, I don't know, it's to be confusing if I'm like one shade of green

2765
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:25,680
and you're another slightly different shade of green.

2766
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:28,680
Uh, true.

2767
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:32,680
Honestly, I don't really use the Gibb and take pony that much.

2768
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:35,680
The color is like a historical color.

2769
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:37,680
I don't really know if I have like a color.

2770
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:40,680
Like thing anymore.

2771
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:41,680
Yeah.

2772
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:48,680
Um, I was, um, you know, I was going through, I was doing the book, the, the, the book, uh,

2773
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:55,680
index like editing formatting and I had, originally I had your text in a couple of relevant messages.

2774
02:26:55,680 --> 02:27:04,680
I had it in like red, like red man, but, um, I, I, I eventually like, there was a couple

2775
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:09,680
of like, uh, uh, messages that like a canny had posted and canny is red and I thought

2776
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,680
it was bad to have two reds.

2777
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:18,680
So I, I, I made yours, uh, the teal color, but then that was very similar to the bright blue

2778
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:21,680
that I had, uh, Christine's text in.

2779
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:27,680
So then I like changed her blue to a different blue, like a more like mild blue, but then

2780
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:30,680
I had, then I had to go through and like change all of her texts line by line.

2781
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:32,680
Oh, is this why the book's taken so long?

2782
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:37,680
It's, it's, it's, um, a heap of reasons like that.

2783
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:43,680
That's just one in a long list of like little, little things that I'm like, I got to change

2784
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:48,680
a bunch of stuff to make it all fit, make it all fit on as few, on as few pages as possible.

2785
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:50,680
Um, yeah.

2786
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:55,680
So color shit is bad.

2787
02:27:55,680 --> 02:28:00,680
I kind of want to design a flag, but I'm kind of, I've never, I've tried to do it before

2788
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:03,680
and I'm like, I don't know, put the colors.

2789
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:05,680
Honestly, you know what?

2790
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:07,680
Fucking there's a shape maybe.

2791
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:15,680
I think it would be cool if we came up with a new PCP symbol to symbolize that it's just

2792
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:17,680
you and me now.

2793
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:22,680
Uh, cause the old one is just the, the gray tombstone version of the old one.

2794
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:23,680
Right.

2795
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,680
Yeah.

2796
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:25,680
And that's not cool.

2797
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:29,680
The time for, I feel like the time for that is over.

2798
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:32,680
Um, we'll take submissions.

2799
02:28:32,680 --> 02:28:33,680
Yeah.

2800
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:34,680
Yeah.

2801
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:35,680
Got any, got any ideas?

2802
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:36,680
Cause I don't right now.

2803
02:28:36,680 --> 02:28:41,680
Uh, not off the top of my head, but if anyone has any ideas and they want to submit one,

2804
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:47,680
I mean, I'll take a look and uh, we'll gladly steal somebody else's work.

2805
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:50,680
It could be a pirate flag.

2806
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:53,680
We could put like skulls and evolved.

2807
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:54,680
I like skulls.

2808
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:55,680
You like skulls.

2809
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,680
I guess we both like skulls.

2810
02:28:57,680 --> 02:28:58,680
So.

2811
02:28:58,680 --> 02:28:59,680
Okay.

2812
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:00,680
Yeah.

2813
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:01,680
Skulls are good.

2814
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:02,680
You know what?

2815
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:03,680
Skulls are good.

2816
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:04,680
Yeah.

2817
02:29:04,680 --> 02:29:05,680
We need them.

2818
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:06,680
Yeah.

2819
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:07,680
Yeah.

2820
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:09,680
We need a Jolly Roger for our, oh shit.

2821
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:11,680
That just, that does remind me.

2822
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,680
Did a new one piece chapter come out?

2823
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:14,680
Oh fuck.

2824
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:15,680
I don't think so.

2825
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:18,680
I think one's coming out this week.

2826
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:19,680
Uh, 1072.

2827
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:21,680
Is that the one?

2828
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:23,680
Uh, oh shit.

2829
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:26,680
I, I don't remember.

2830
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:28,680
I read 1072 already.

2831
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:31,680
Oh no, I don't think we talked about this one.

2832
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:33,680
Ah fuck.

2833
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:35,680
The weight of memory.

2834
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:41,680
It's a, I remember reading this, but I forget when I did, but it's, it's got Kuma in it.

2835
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:46,680
Hey, give me a, what website do we use that isn't shit for reading one piece?

2836
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:47,680
TCB scans.

2837
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:48,680
TCB?

2838
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:49,680
Yeah.

2839
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:50,680
TCB.

2840
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:53,680
The coconut brothers.

2841
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:55,680
I assume.

2842
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:56,680
Definitely.

2843
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:57,680
Um.

2844
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:58,680
Yeah.

2845
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:01,680
It's, it's one about Kuma and, and Bonnie.

2846
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:08,680
1071 starts with, that should start with the, like the scientists band.

2847
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:09,680
Wait.

2848
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:10,680
No.

2849
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:11,680
I read, I, okay.

2850
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:12,680
I read this one.

2851
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:15,680
I'll, I'll, if you want to talk about it, I'll have to read it right now.

2852
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:21,680
Uh, well, we'll, we'll save it as like the last thing we talked about before question,

2853
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:22,680
for voice mails.

2854
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:23,680
Okay.

2855
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:26,680
I mean, I feel like we're getting on towards that point.

2856
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:27,680
Yeah.

2857
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:30,680
Shall we do the one piece now then?

2858
02:30:30,680 --> 02:30:31,680
I could.

2859
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:34,680
Um, unless you have any more topics.

2860
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:36,680
Uh, I don't know.

2861
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:38,680
Um, not really.

2862
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:41,680
Um, I'm depressed.

2863
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:43,680
My life sucks.

2864
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:45,680
Uh, but what else is new?

2865
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,680
No, that's it.

2866
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:49,680
Nah, I'm just gonna throw that out there.

2867
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:51,680
I don't want to follow up that up with anything.

2868
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:56,680
I mean, I'm also depressed, but I've been feeling all right.

2869
02:30:56,680 --> 02:31:02,680
It's just sort of, I've been very numb, you know, like I'm thinking about things that

2870
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:03,680
make me sad.

2871
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:04,680
And I'm like, you know what?

2872
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:07,680
I'm not, I'm fuck feelings.

2873
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:08,680
No more.

2874
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:12,680
And then I woke up and I was like, I guess it's just a day.

2875
02:31:12,680 --> 02:31:14,680
I don't feel good, but I don't feel bad.

2876
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:15,680
I feel nothing.

2877
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:20,680
And I went through a few days like that and I'm like, this is fine.

2878
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:25,680
Uh, and I just sort of had no response to anything that was happening.

2879
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:28,680
I had no, no reaction to stimulus.

2880
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:30,680
And I'm like, this sucks as well.

2881
02:31:30,680 --> 02:31:34,680
Actually, I don't know what to do about it.

2882
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:37,680
Hmm.

2883
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:40,680
I mean, I'm dying.

2884
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:42,680
Yeah.

2885
02:31:42,680 --> 02:31:44,680
I'm over here.

2886
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:49,680
I'm just like, um, uh, yeah.

2887
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:54,680
When I say, when I say I'm depressed, I don't mean that I'm like sad constantly.

2888
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:59,680
I just mean I'm, I'm just like, uh, what's the point?

2889
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:00,680
What are we doing?

2890
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:01,680
Yeah.

2891
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:02,680
Same.

2892
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:03,680
Yeah.

2893
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:05,680
Uh, okay.

2894
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:10,680
Well, what else is there really to say about it?

2895
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:11,680
Yeah.

2896
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:12,680
When two depressed people are saved, what's the point?

2897
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:13,680
Yeah.

2898
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:14,680
What is the point?

2899
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:15,680
Yeah.

2900
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:16,680
Hey, you're right.

2901
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:17,680
I guess at that point you just move on.

2902
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:18,680
Yeah.

2903
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:19,680
All right.

2904
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:20,680
So let's read one piece.

2905
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:21,680
Yeah.

2906
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:22,680
All right.

2907
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:23,680
I'm reading.

2908
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:25,680
Genuinely a best reaction.

2909
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:26,680
True.

2910
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:27,680
Okay.

2911
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:28,680
Okay.

2912
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:36,680
Should I, should I like react as I read or should I just, uh, I've read it already.

2913
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:39,680
So you do whatever you feel like.

2914
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,680
Okay.

2915
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:41,680
Yeah.

2916
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:42,680
So 10, 72.

2917
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:45,680
Oh, there's the one piece corner, everybody.

2918
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:50,680
What do you have to say about the, the three scientists on the, the front cover?

2919
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:56,680
Oh, um, oh, that's, um, that's, uh, uh, frickin.

2920
02:32:56,680 --> 02:33:01,680
It's Caesar, um, the Sanji's dad.

2921
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:02,680
Judge.

2922
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:03,680
Judge.

2923
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:09,680
And, uh, is that, did we, we never figured out who the big guy is, right?

2924
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:14,680
I was told it was queen, which made sense to me as queen was, was like.

2925
02:33:14,680 --> 02:33:22,680
Um, one of the, you know, it's the scientist engineer, uh, person of.

2926
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:27,680
I guess he's wearing, I guess he is wearing the same pants.

2927
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:28,680
Yeah.

2928
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:30,680
I think it's pretty clear that he's supposed to be queen.

2929
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:32,680
He's just, he wasn't as fat back then.

2930
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:34,680
He really does not.

2931
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:40,680
And he doesn't have any, like he dyed his hair and turned it into like a long ponytail.

2932
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:41,680
Maybe.

2933
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:47,680
But I mean, if that's supposed to be queen, it does not look like the same guy.

2934
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:48,680
Yeah.

2935
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:51,680
It's a little harder to tell compared to the other two.

2936
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:57,680
The other two I can, I can at least tell, but, um, I don't know, what are they doing?

2937
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:58,680
They got a fruit.

2938
02:33:58,680 --> 02:33:59,680
They got chemicals.

2939
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:01,680
Mass producing deadly weapons.

2940
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:02,680
Oh yeah.

2941
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:09,680
Queen's got, well, the artist potentially queen, uh, has.

2942
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,680
Bottles of secret evil poisons.

2943
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:13,680
Yeah.

2944
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:17,680
And we know queen did that with the disease disease stuff.

2945
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:23,680
George has a weird laser spear and we know he has that weapon.

2946
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,680
And then Caesar clown has the devil fruit.

2947
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:30,680
And we know Caesar clown was working with smile to create artificial devil fruits.

2948
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:33,680
So I guess they're, you know, they're in.

2949
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:39,680
They're a little science nerd group and they're chuckling about all the things, all the people

2950
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:42,680
they'll kill with these things.

2951
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:45,680
I'm okay.

2952
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:55,680
So Bonnie just like whacked Vega punk and turned him into a kid and like fruits exploded out

2953
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:57,680
of him.

2954
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:02,680
Uh, fruits or like little jewel bits, little little gummies.

2955
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:03,680
Yeah.

2956
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:07,680
Is that how it usually works with her?

2957
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:12,680
We have not seen her use her powers for anything other than shape shifting or not shape shifting,

2958
02:35:12,680 --> 02:35:14,680
but changing her own age.

2959
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:19,680
She turned herself into like a beefy, like muscle monster.

2960
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,680
What does she say?

2961
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:21,680
Distorted future.

2962
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:26,680
Like in a potential future, I could have been this and she can somehow do that, which is

2963
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:28,680
pretty cool.

2964
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:30,680
I see.

2965
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:32,680
It's like everything everywhere all at once.

2966
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:34,680
You ever seen that?

2967
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:35,680
Yeah.

2968
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:42,680
It's like she got a future where, uh, wait a minute, where she was a sumo wrestler or

2969
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:46,680
like a regular wrestler where she's jacked.

2970
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:54,680
Is there's, is there's another, um, oh God, is there another thing where like someone

2971
02:35:54,680 --> 02:36:01,680
uses like the power of like the potential future to like become like a theoretical alternate

2972
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:02,680
version of them?

2973
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:04,680
Is that the thing someone doesn't like Jojo?

2974
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:06,680
Oh, it could be.

2975
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:07,680
I haven't read Jojo.

2976
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,680
That sounds, that sounds familiar.

2977
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:14,680
Someone being like drawing on, drawing on the power of like a potential future version

2978
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:19,680
of myself to do something that that version of me could do.

2979
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:20,680
I don't know.

2980
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:23,680
Well, that's exactly what happens in everything everywhere all at once.

2981
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:25,680
Like the, is it?

2982
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:26,680
Yeah.

2983
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:31,680
Um, but it's not like potential, it's, it's divergent presence.

2984
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:35,680
So like, yeah, that's not exactly what I'm, that's not exactly what I'm thinking of.

2985
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:39,680
That's like when you, when you jump to another version of yourself in it, in another, well,

2986
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,680
that's like jumping into a different timeline.

2987
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:42,680
Yeah.

2988
02:36:42,680 --> 02:36:43,680
Yeah.

2989
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:48,680
No, no, that's when you, they do that thing to like, to like, no, they like learn a thing

2990
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:53,680
that like that alternate self, you know, because they inhabit the other timelines

2991
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:56,680
mind temporarily.

2992
02:36:56,680 --> 02:36:57,680
Yeah.

2993
02:36:57,680 --> 02:36:58,680
I only saw that.

2994
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:00,680
I only saw it once.

2995
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:01,680
Right.

2996
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:04,680
Maybe, maybe, I don't know if that's what I'm thinking of, but that is kind of what they

2997
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:05,680
do in that movie, I guess.

2998
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:06,680
Yeah.

2999
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:11,680
I guess this is different in that she is going from the present into a future where she's

3000
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:12,680
jacked.

3001
02:37:12,680 --> 02:37:14,680
She doesn't look older though.

3002
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:15,680
So I don't know.

3003
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:16,680
Yeah.

3004
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:17,680
She doesn't look that much older.

3005
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:20,680
Maybe it's like she's, maybe it's like she's seeing an alternate version of herself that's

3006
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:24,680
like two years older, but it's like, what if I spent two years just like getting really

3007
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:26,680
ripped and working out a lot?

3008
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:27,680
Yeah.

3009
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:29,680
This is very funny.

3010
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:33,680
It's actually, it's actually a pretty funny use of that fruit.

3011
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:34,680
Yeah.

3012
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:38,680
And then taking someone's age, it's more powerful than I had considered because I never really

3013
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:43,680
think about jewelry bunny and her devil fruit, the idea of like her changing age.

3014
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:44,680
Yeah.

3015
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:46,680
Kind of seem like a throwaway power.

3016
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:53,680
The ability to change someone else's age, maybe change the age of like a metal thing to make

3017
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:54,680
it rust.

3018
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:59,680
There's lots of potential there.

3019
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:00,680
Yeah.

3020
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:10,680
Isn't that kind of what, wasn't there one of those, a ninja that did something like that?

3021
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:12,680
The one that would make things rot.

3022
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:13,680
Oh yeah.

3023
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:14,680
The ninja would be.

3024
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:15,680
Shinobu.

3025
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:16,680
Yeah.

3026
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:18,680
What did she do?

3027
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:24,680
She had a power that could make things, I don't know if it specifically made them older or

3028
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:27,680
if it just made them like wither and rot.

3029
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:30,680
Now if I type in Shinobu, I get so many other things.

3030
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:33,680
But she ended up, didn't she end up like becoming young again?

3031
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:34,680
Or was that just like in a flashback?

3032
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:36,680
We saw her young version.

3033
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:38,680
Blah blah blah.

3034
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:39,680
What happened?

3035
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:41,680
What happened in that whole fucking arc?

3036
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:42,680
She's such a small part of it.

3037
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:44,680
Too many fucking things.

3038
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:45,680
Yeah.

3039
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,680
Relationships, blah blah blah.

3040
02:38:48,680 --> 02:38:49,680
Abilities and powers.

3041
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:51,680
Njutsu, marksmanship, Delafruit.

3042
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:59,680
The juku juku juku no mi gives her the ability to make anything she touches rapidly mature.

3043
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:06,680
So yeah, like rotting, like getting older, but really quick.

3044
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:11,680
I think it's like she calls it maturing, but everyone else calls it like rotting.

3045
02:39:11,680 --> 02:39:12,680
Yeah.

3046
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:16,680
What was the name of the fruit?

3047
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:17,680
Juku juku.

3048
02:39:17,680 --> 02:39:18,680
What does that mean?

3049
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:20,680
I don't know.

3050
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:27,680
Well, there must be a translation.

3051
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:34,680
Not in the little bit of Wikipedia I'm looking at.

3052
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:37,680
I'll look it up on the wiki.

3053
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:40,680
The juku juku no mi.

3054
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:41,680
Further information.

3055
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:42,680
Okay.

3056
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:44,680
It seems like it just means mature.

3057
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:47,680
Juku comes from jukusura, which means too mature.

3058
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:50,680
Its English name is ripe, isn't it?

3059
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:51,680
Okay.

3060
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:58,680
She could turn grape juice into alcohol.

3061
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:04,680
She can use this power to physically age living beings, although they do not mature mentally.

3062
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:05,680
Oh yeah.

3063
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:10,680
So she turned a little boy, Momonosuke, into an adult.

3064
02:40:10,680 --> 02:40:12,680
That's a big important thing.

3065
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:13,680
I forgot all about that.

3066
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:17,680
But hers is permanent and Jullery and Bonnie's is temporary, right?

3067
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:18,680
Yeah.

3068
02:40:18,680 --> 02:40:19,680
Yeah.

3069
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:22,680
Well fucked up.

3070
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:24,680
Like if she got her hands on something, just makes them really old.

3071
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:28,680
They can't do anything anymore.

3072
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:32,680
So Jullery, Bonnie turned a punk into a tiny old baby.

3073
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:33,680
Yeah.

3074
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:34,680
He's gotten a little further.

3075
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:39,680
I think he's got like Kuma's memories there in like the paw paw orb.

3076
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:41,680
I'm reading.

3077
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:48,680
I promise Kupa, Kuma, that I will keep his secret from you no matter what.

3078
02:40:48,680 --> 02:40:52,680
Power can take something intangible like pain and give it a physical form.

3079
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:56,680
Not only that, but what is fucking up with the paw paw fruit?

3080
02:40:56,680 --> 02:40:59,680
The paw paw fruit is freaking stupid.

3081
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:02,680
It's, I mean, it's pretty fine.

3082
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:06,680
Not complaining, but like why the fuck can it do all these things?

3083
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:12,680
You know, it's probably some sort of pun with paw and I don't get it.

3084
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:13,680
Yeah.

3085
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:19,680
Like what is about a bear's paw that can do any of these things?

3086
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:22,680
I guess it pushes really hard.

3087
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:27,680
Pushes it so hard that it pushes feelings out of you, pushes memories.

3088
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:30,680
So I'm wondering if that same logic could be applied to other nervous signals.

3089
02:41:30,680 --> 02:41:35,680
To determine whether things like imagination and memories have massive volume as well.

3090
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:38,680
So you want me to pull out my memories and show you.

3091
02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:41,680
Please, it will help me advance science.

3092
02:41:41,680 --> 02:41:42,680
Okay.

3093
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:44,680
I see.

3094
02:41:44,680 --> 02:41:46,680
Whoa.

3095
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:50,680
There's nothing, nothing there but pain, he says.

3096
02:41:50,680 --> 02:41:51,680
Okay.

3097
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:54,680
So Kuma, holy shit.

3098
02:41:54,680 --> 02:41:59,680
So Kuma took out his own memories and they're in this orb.

3099
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:06,680
He's a crazy robot now, but his memories are there so he could theoretically become his old self maybe.

3100
02:42:06,680 --> 02:42:07,680
He could.

3101
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:08,680
Maybe.

3102
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:14,680
But right now he's like climbing the red line and he's getting shot at.

3103
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:22,680
And they said that he was able to, didn't they say that he was allowed to give himself like one directive?

3104
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:27,680
Like they would, they would program him one command that like he got to choose himself.

3105
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:28,680
Yeah.

3106
02:42:28,680 --> 02:42:32,680
And he was to protect the, the, the sunny.

3107
02:42:32,680 --> 02:42:34,680
The sunny go.

3108
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:37,680
Yeah.

3109
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:39,680
Okay.

3110
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:41,680
Okay.

3111
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:42,680
Holy shit.

3112
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:43,680
All right.

3113
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:49,680
I'm fucking, I don't know what's happening but I'm, I'm excited.

3114
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:58,680
For one brief moment, I forget about the misery and tedium of my actual life and I inhabit the world of the blue, of the, of the red line.

3115
02:42:58,680 --> 02:42:59,680
It's glorious.

3116
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:03,680
One glorious moment.

3117
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:06,680
It's like I'm there.

3118
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:07,680
Okay.

3119
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:08,680
Okay.

3120
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:09,680
Reading.

3121
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:10,680
Okay.

3122
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:11,680
The seraphim.

3123
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:12,680
Two against seven.

3124
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:13,680
Yeah.

3125
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:14,680
So the seraphim are up there.

3126
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:23,680
They have, have the CP zero taking control of the seraphim because they got rid of.

3127
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:24,680
Sentomaro.

3128
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:29,680
Sentomaro is, is down still presumed dead.

3129
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:33,680
I think they got him or at least knocked him out.

3130
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,680
He's bleeding.

3131
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:38,680
But Vega punk still has authority.

3132
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:46,680
So if a Vega punk is in like hearing range of the seraphim, they will obey Vega punk instead.

3133
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:51,680
And I assume all the different Vega punks count as Vega punk.

3134
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:54,680
Yeah.

3135
02:43:54,680 --> 02:44:00,680
As we're hiring, we can turn, he says we can turn the seraphim back to our sides since we're hiring the command hierarchy.

3136
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:03,680
That's assuming we get in there to holler our orders at them.

3137
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:05,680
Okay.

3138
02:44:06,680 --> 02:44:12,680
So they should be able to turn the seraphim back.

3139
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:15,680
And Sanji and Frankie are going to fight as well.

3140
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:17,680
Gonna be a brawl.

3141
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:23,680
Why does Frankie call Sanji swirl of him?

3142
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:25,680
What's the joke?

3143
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:34,680
I think Sanji, they're talking about seraphim over and over and then he says Nami's orders are absolute for mere of him.

3144
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:36,680
Yeah.

3145
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:38,680
Okay.

3146
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:42,680
So they're riffing on it.

3147
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:45,680
Fair enough.

3148
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:50,680
Oh my god, it's Kaku. I love Kaku.

3149
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:53,680
Kaku. Oh yeah, Brooke doesn't know them.

3150
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:55,680
He's never met them.

3151
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:57,680
Yeah, that was before.

3152
02:44:57,680 --> 02:44:59,680
The guys before.

3153
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:01,680
They fought him in water, was it at water seven?

3154
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:03,680
And he's lobby.

3155
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:04,680
Okay.

3156
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:08,680
Which is directly after and then directly before a thriller bark.

3157
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:12,680
Wait, are you sure?

3158
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:15,680
Didn't they fight CP nine at water seven when they found Frankie?

3159
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:18,680
Yeah, no, they did, but like it was very brief.

3160
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:20,680
They fought like Bruno.

3161
02:45:20,680 --> 02:45:27,680
And then they all got on the train and then everyone was, Luffy was like stuck between the chimney and the Aqualagano was coming.

3162
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:29,680
It was like the big wave.

3163
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:31,680
And they got on the train and they left with Robin.

3164
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:33,680
Sanji saw them.

3165
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:35,680
And Sanji got on the train.

3166
02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:40,680
And then everyone else, I want to stop, I think it was also on the train or something.

3167
02:45:40,680 --> 02:45:44,680
And then the rest of them got on the puffing Tom Frankie edition.

3168
02:45:44,680 --> 02:45:46,680
And they followed.

3169
02:45:46,680 --> 02:45:50,680
And then like they, they, they, yeah.

3170
02:45:50,680 --> 02:45:53,680
And then they, I think they caught up to them.

3171
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:55,680
And it was a whole bunch of stuff on the train.

3172
02:45:55,680 --> 02:46:00,680
And then they got to Annie's lobby, which they only managed to fight CP nine.

3173
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:07,680
CP nine after they got over the, like the drawbridge into the other island.

3174
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:10,680
The other, you know, the castle at the end.

3175
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:12,680
Hmm.

3176
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:13,680
Okay.

3177
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:14,680
All right.

3178
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:18,680
I remember it very vividly because I love that fucking arc.

3179
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:22,680
Kaku looks freaking.

3180
02:46:22,680 --> 02:46:24,680
Kaku's awakened.

3181
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:26,680
Zoan is pretty cool.

3182
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:28,680
Uh, who me?

3183
02:46:28,680 --> 02:46:30,680
I'm just putting him to sleep.

3184
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:35,680
Wait, did she just, she just bit, she's bite Kaku drink his little giraffe blood.

3185
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:37,680
It's a little giraffe blood.

3186
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:38,680
Yeah.

3187
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:40,680
Clone of miss, clone of miss Buckingham.

3188
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:43,680
Stussy of the rocks pirates.

3189
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:44,680
What?

3190
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:46,680
Mads first successful clone.

3191
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:48,680
Unit zero one.

3192
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:49,680
Stussy.

3193
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:50,680
Oh, oh, okay.

3194
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:51,680
It's Stussy.

3195
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:53,680
Do we know Stussy?

3196
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:55,680
Does that, should I, should I recognize that name?

3197
02:46:56,680 --> 02:47:02,680
Stussy is the person that this lady has been the whole time, but we didn't know she was a clone.

3198
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:03,680
Yeah.

3199
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:04,680
Okay.

3200
02:47:05,680 --> 02:47:07,680
She's like a freaking vampire.

3201
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:09,680
She's like a freaking succubus vampire.

3202
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:10,680
Yeah.

3203
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:11,680
This is, this is a revelation.

3204
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:13,680
This is a weirdo thing.

3205
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:14,680
So like,

3206
02:47:14,680 --> 02:47:17,680
Definitely weirdo shit going on here.

3207
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:19,680
So this is so much.

3208
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:20,680
All right.

3209
02:47:20,680 --> 02:47:25,680
So she is a clone of a rocks pirates member, which was.

3210
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:32,680
And that's, that's the, that's with the, with the, the other, the emperors, um, big mom and, uh,

3211
02:47:32,680 --> 02:47:33,680
Keido.

3212
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:34,680
Keido.

3213
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:38,680
And I think white beard was on the crew at some point as well.

3214
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:39,680
Yeah.

3215
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:40,680
Sounds right.

3216
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:51,680
They're like, and I forget the, the captain of the rocks pirates, very important guy that we've only heard of in like brief mention and, and stuff.

3217
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:53,680
Uh, but yeah, rocks pirates, very important pirate crew.

3218
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:58,680
She's a clone and MADS first successful clone.

3219
02:47:58,680 --> 02:48:05,680
And as far as I understand MADS being the science like group that we're seeing in the, in the.

3220
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:07,680
MADS was on that ship, right?

3221
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:10,680
It was on, it was that, that, that like little boat with all the stuff.

3222
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:11,680
Yeah.

3223
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:16,680
That ship that had, that had all the scientists at Vega punk had, um, uh,

3224
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:19,680
George Caesar clown and potentially queen.

3225
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:20,680
Yeah.

3226
02:48:20,680 --> 02:48:25,680
And that guy with like the glasses and like the, the, the, the streaks in his hair.

3227
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:26,680
Yeah.

3228
02:48:26,680 --> 02:48:27,680
Yeah.

3229
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:34,680
So they're like, they made a clone of one of the strongest pirate crews ever and she's it.

3230
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:43,680
So I don't know whether this means that, um, Miss Buckingham Stussy was a vampire devil fruit user.

3231
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:44,680
Or they gave her.

3232
02:48:44,680 --> 02:48:47,680
Or they gave her vampire power.

3233
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:48,680
Yeah.

3234
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:51,680
And, you know, that's one thing.

3235
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:54,680
This has got to be like a vampire bat zone.

3236
02:48:54,680 --> 02:48:55,680
Right.

3237
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:56,680
Yeah.

3238
02:48:56,680 --> 02:48:57,680
Probably something like that.

3239
02:48:57,680 --> 02:48:58,680
Yeah.

3240
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:01,680
But like that's a whole lot of stuff.

3241
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:06,680
But then on top of that, she is betraying CP zero.

3242
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:15,680
And now Kaku and Luchi look like they're going to be like, they're the ones who need saving at this point.

3243
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:22,680
Because the seraphim, they might like, I don't think they are going to follow.

3244
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:23,680
They're going to follow.

3245
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:24,680
They're going to follow.

3246
02:49:24,680 --> 02:49:28,680
They're also going to follow until Vega punk is there, whoever has the controller.

3247
02:49:28,680 --> 02:49:30,680
And I think she had it.

3248
02:49:30,680 --> 02:49:31,680
Yeah.

3249
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:34,680
She, well, she's part of, I think all the CPO.

3250
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:35,680
Have it.

3251
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:36,680
Okay.

3252
02:49:36,680 --> 02:49:38,680
Maybe it's not a single item.

3253
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:39,680
I.

3254
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:40,680
Yeah.

3255
02:49:40,680 --> 02:49:44,680
I think it's just any anyone in CPO has like a command.

3256
02:49:44,680 --> 02:49:45,680
Shit.

3257
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:47,680
That was my understanding at least.

3258
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:50,680
So they might just like equally obey both of them.

3259
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:52,680
Or maybe she's got it.

3260
02:49:52,680 --> 02:49:53,680
Yeah.

3261
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:54,680
I don't know.

3262
02:49:54,680 --> 02:49:58,680
But yeah, this is like, like what is her deal?

3263
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:03,680
If she's with Mads and Vega punk was on Mads.

3264
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:07,680
Is she aligning with Vega punk?

3265
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:09,680
Is this like a sneaky?

3266
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:11,680
Yeah, maybe.

3267
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:13,680
And like, how long does this con go?

3268
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:21,680
Because she, she is in like, she is in the highest level of assassins.

3269
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:24,680
It's like, I'm really intrigued.

3270
02:50:24,680 --> 02:50:30,680
I'm really intrigued by the freaking Paw Paw memory orb.

3271
02:50:30,680 --> 02:50:32,680
Yeah.

3272
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:40,680
Freakin legitimately, Kuma has done some like light Yagami, like remove my own memories of

3273
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:41,680
Death Note.

3274
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:42,680
Shit.

3275
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:44,680
What has he got in there?

3276
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:47,680
What does he, what does he want to forget?

3277
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:49,680
Maybe he lost in a video game.

3278
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:52,680
I mean, it seems like it's just all his memories.

3279
02:50:52,680 --> 02:50:54,680
But like, why specifically?

3280
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:59,680
Like in this flashback, it looks like it's like a nothing in particular.

3281
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:07,680
Like, oh, it would help me advance science if you let me take your memories out of your

3282
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:08,680
head.

3283
02:51:08,680 --> 02:51:10,680
That'd be so cool.

3284
02:51:10,680 --> 02:51:13,680
And he's like, that's far too personal.

3285
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:19,680
But like, I guess he ended up doing it because Bonnie recognizes it as a memory thing.

3286
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:20,680
It's okay.

3287
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:21,680
He must know something.

3288
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:29,680
He knows something really important that that Vega punk wanted to learn about.

3289
02:51:29,680 --> 02:51:39,680
And I guess it's, I still don't know why he wanted to become a robot.

3290
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:43,680
But I guess he was like, all right, take my memories out.

3291
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:48,680
So when you make me a robot, I can like come back for them later.

3292
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:51,680
I mean, it's got to be some shit about like the void century, right?

3293
02:51:51,680 --> 02:52:00,680
He must know some ponyglyph shit, some secret government stuff.

3294
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:09,680
You know, there's a potential here for like a fake out like Lunarian secrets.

3295
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:15,680
There's a potential here for this to have been like a Vega punk, like prank bro.

3296
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:19,680
Like Kuma didn't do any of this of his own volition.

3297
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:22,680
Vega punk just really wanted the science.

3298
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:25,680
And so he tricked him and he doesn't want Bonnie to find that out.

3299
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:26,680
So he says, don't touch it.

3300
02:52:26,680 --> 02:52:27,680
Please don't touch it.

3301
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:28,680
I did it.

3302
02:52:28,680 --> 02:52:30,680
But she's going to find out.

3303
02:52:30,680 --> 02:52:31,680
She's going to know.

3304
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:33,680
And then she's going to kill him.

3305
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:35,680
She's going to really, really hate him.

3306
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:37,680
But it's probably more serious than that.

3307
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:43,680
Given the weight of Kuma and like what he's doing right now with his buddy.

3308
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:46,680
He's, he's just climbing red line.

3309
02:52:46,680 --> 02:52:47,680
So he's going to marry.

3310
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:49,680
He's going to marriage war, right?

3311
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:51,680
He's going to marriage war for some reason.

3312
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:55,680
I don't know why he can't like poor, poor fruit his way up to the top.

3313
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:56,680
Yeah.

3314
02:52:56,680 --> 02:52:57,680
That's I don't know.

3315
02:52:57,680 --> 02:52:58,680
Maybe it doesn't work like that.

3316
02:52:58,680 --> 02:53:01,680
Maybe it only goes horizontally, but like it doesn't.

3317
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:02,680
It goes up as well.

3318
02:53:02,680 --> 02:53:08,680
Maybe it's exactly it's exactly like building up horizontal speed in Mario when you want

3319
02:53:08,680 --> 02:53:11,680
to go to a parallel dimension.

3320
02:53:12,680 --> 02:53:13,680
You can only.

3321
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:14,680
Yeah.

3322
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:17,680
You can only move horizontally building a vertical speed is like a whole different

3323
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:18,680
thing.

3324
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:19,680
Ah, did you?

3325
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:20,680
All right.

3326
02:53:20,680 --> 02:53:25,680
This is there are vertical parallel universes in Mary 64 as well.

3327
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:26,680
Yes.

3328
02:53:26,680 --> 02:53:29,680
I was aware.

3329
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:31,680
And they're like different.

3330
02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:37,680
You have to get stuck under something and falling and then fall down onto one.

3331
02:53:37,680 --> 02:53:38,680
Yeah.

3332
02:53:39,680 --> 02:53:51,680
So I mean, I guess I don't have that much more to say about this other than I sure am

3333
02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:53,680
intrigued by all these mysteries.

3334
02:53:53,680 --> 02:54:01,680
I like the bit where jewelry is like throwing Vega punk when he's a child version and he

3335
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:03,680
calls it child abuse.

3336
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:04,680
Yeah.

3337
02:54:04,680 --> 02:54:05,680
She just.

3338
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:06,680
Yeah.

3339
02:54:06,680 --> 02:54:11,680
She just punched out all these little little frickin little what do you call them little

3340
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:13,680
Mike and Ike's.

3341
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:15,680
What are those?

3342
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:19,680
You know those little like hard candies that are in the shape of fruits?

3343
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:22,680
What are those?

3344
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:24,680
A little fruit.

3345
02:54:24,680 --> 02:54:26,680
I don't know.

3346
02:54:26,680 --> 02:54:28,680
All right.

3347
02:54:28,680 --> 02:54:31,680
Gummy winegums hard candy in the shape of fruits.

3348
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:32,680
They're not gummies.

3349
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:34,680
They're like.

3350
02:54:34,680 --> 02:54:35,680
Oh, Runtz.

3351
02:54:35,680 --> 02:54:40,680
I think they're called Runtz or rascals or nitwits.

3352
02:54:40,680 --> 02:54:44,680
I guess they have a bunch of different names.

3353
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:47,680
The years just turned into these.

3354
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:56,680
I just noticed the one panel where they see Kuma climbing and it's like, look, Kuma's

3355
02:54:56,680 --> 02:54:58,680
trying to climb the red line.

3356
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:01,680
There's no way he'll make it all the way to the top.

3357
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:02,680
Impossible.

3358
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:04,680
It's just something funny about that.

3359
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:11,680
There's no like like first panel, little meme guy eating cereal.

3360
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:13,680
There's no way he'll make it all the way to the top.

3361
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:16,680
And then he does and he spits out the cereal.

3362
02:55:16,680 --> 02:55:18,680
That's what I'm imagining.

3363
02:55:18,680 --> 02:55:20,680
Wait, why is he eating cereal?

3364
02:55:20,680 --> 02:55:23,680
You know the meme where the little guys eat cereal?

3365
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:24,680
It's like, there's no way.

3366
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:28,680
He will never reach the top of the red line.

3367
02:55:28,680 --> 02:55:29,680
Yeah.

3368
02:55:29,680 --> 02:55:30,680
Next panel.

3369
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:31,680
No, I got you.

3370
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:32,680
Yeah.

3371
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:35,680
I don't know, man.

3372
02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:37,680
I kind of think he's going to probably do it.

3373
02:55:37,680 --> 02:55:42,680
I kind of think Kuma is capable of such a thing.

3374
02:55:42,680 --> 02:55:48,680
They got all those marines with like mortar bombs and bazookas and sniper rifles.

3375
02:55:48,680 --> 02:55:50,680
They're shooting at him.

3376
02:55:50,680 --> 02:55:52,680
Oh, yeah.

3377
02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:56,680
He'll be fine.

3378
02:55:56,680 --> 02:56:01,680
This is just like in Drum Island when Luffy climbed up the fucking thing.

3379
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:07,680
This is just like in Dragon Ball when Goku climbed up the tower.

3380
02:56:07,680 --> 02:56:10,680
The Karin Tower?

3381
02:56:10,680 --> 02:56:12,680
Is that what I don't remember what it was called?

3382
02:56:12,680 --> 02:56:14,680
I can't remember.

3383
02:56:14,680 --> 02:56:18,680
I think it was Karin or Karin or something because it's the name of the cat at the top.

3384
02:56:18,680 --> 02:56:24,680
The one that made me really mad because when he gets to the top, the cat says like, he

3385
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:28,680
says like, oh, you've gotten stronger.

3386
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:31,680
You've gotten faster and you've increased your endurance.

3387
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:36,680
So you see, you've tripled your strength and it's like that math doesn't make any fucking

3388
02:56:36,680 --> 02:56:38,680
sense.

3389
02:56:38,680 --> 02:56:44,680
Just because you just because you increased three things does not mean you tripled it.

3390
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:46,680
You fucking moron.

3391
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:49,680
He's just a cat.

3392
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:50,680
He doesn't know.

3393
02:56:50,680 --> 02:56:52,680
He doesn't even know basic math.

3394
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:53,680
Yeah.

3395
02:56:53,680 --> 02:56:55,680
All that guy's good for is that bean shit.

3396
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:56,680
He's got that good shit.

3397
02:56:56,680 --> 02:56:57,680
That is all he's good for.

3398
02:56:57,680 --> 02:57:00,680
That is genuinely all he's good for is his bean shit.

3399
02:57:00,680 --> 02:57:02,680
He's on his bean shit.

3400
02:57:02,680 --> 02:57:04,680
He's in his bean arc.

3401
02:57:04,680 --> 02:57:08,680
I hope he stays that way.

3402
02:57:08,680 --> 02:57:17,680
Hey, one piece freaking ruled again and I have a feeling the next one will rule also.

3403
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:19,680
I love egghead.

3404
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:21,680
I love egghead arc.

3405
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:22,680
Oh, yeah.

3406
02:57:22,680 --> 02:57:24,680
It's hits after hits.

3407
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:27,680
Bunny did do the thing that I talked about oil breakdown.

3408
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:29,680
She touched something.

3409
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:33,680
I guess it was plastic and turned it back into oil.

3410
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:35,680
So that it's crumbled.

3411
02:57:35,680 --> 02:57:38,680
It fell to pieces.

3412
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:40,680
I think that's what that implies.

3413
02:57:40,680 --> 02:57:50,680
I wonder if it will turn back into plastic later because she says the power is temporary.

3414
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:53,680
Yeah.

3415
02:57:53,680 --> 02:58:01,680
Whereas didn't the ninja turn something into oil?

3416
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:09,680
Why do I have the weird memory of that she turned a dinosaur carcass into oil or something by aging it millennia?

3417
02:58:09,680 --> 02:58:11,680
That probably didn't happen.

3418
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:12,680
Who?

3419
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:15,680
The ninja with the ripe, ripe fruit.

3420
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:18,680
Oh, a dinosaur into oil?

3421
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:20,680
No, there's no way.

3422
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:23,680
No, I probably had it.

3423
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:26,680
Maybe they made a joke about her doing something like that?

3424
02:58:26,680 --> 02:58:27,680
Maybe.

3425
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:31,680
I mean, the only dinosaurs were people and nobody died.

3426
02:58:31,680 --> 02:58:33,680
Nobody was turned into fucking oil.

3427
02:58:33,680 --> 02:58:34,680
Am I crazy?

3428
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:41,680
Did she threaten to turn Queen's bones into oil like a dinosaur would be?

3429
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:43,680
That sounds pretty fucking cool.

3430
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:46,680
Yeah, yeah.

3431
02:58:46,680 --> 02:58:52,680
Or some other dino, man.

3432
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:54,680
God damn.

3433
02:58:54,680 --> 02:58:57,680
One piece is better than ever.

3434
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:00,680
How do they do it?

3435
02:59:00,680 --> 02:59:12,680
Somebody on this page, somebody on this page down in the comments posted this always relevant meme from Bakuman.

3436
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:14,680
Every fucking week.

3437
02:59:14,680 --> 02:59:16,680
Oh God, fuck another banger.

3438
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:20,680
Damn it.

3439
02:59:20,680 --> 02:59:25,680
How does he just keep churning out the hits?

3440
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:29,680
So fucking Kaku is just defeated.

3441
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:34,680
Like as far as we know, like he's out called and she just bit him.

3442
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:36,680
Yeah, seems like he just got owned.

3443
02:59:36,680 --> 02:59:38,680
She put him to sleep.

3444
02:59:38,680 --> 02:59:41,680
She put him to sleep.

3445
02:59:41,680 --> 02:59:46,680
And then look, she's like, oh, oh, no, I'm so outnumbered.

3446
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:47,680
I'm sweating.

3447
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:52,680
I can't believe the vampire was evil.

3448
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:56,680
Did they know she was a vampire?

3449
02:59:56,680 --> 02:59:59,680
I don't think we've ever seen her do anything like that.

3450
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:03,680
We haven't seen her do anything, so they might have known.

3451
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:09,680
It was already a revelation that this lady was there at all.

3452
03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:23,680
No, no, like the first time you see her, she's like, oh, she's an underground kingpin of some sort of business at Big Mom's, the wedding for pudding and Sanji.

3453
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:25,680
Right, right, right.

3454
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:27,680
It's so hard to remember.

3455
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:30,680
And she's like, oh yes, I'm evil.

3456
03:00:30,680 --> 03:00:32,680
That's why I was invited.

3457
03:00:32,680 --> 03:00:36,680
But then she goes off and does something sneaky and she's like, actually, I'm a secret agent.

3458
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:47,680
I don't know whether she mentions she's in CP Zero at that point, but now she is in CP Zero, but now she's also a clone, actually, of a famous pirate.

3459
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:50,680
Yeah, that's about the size of it.

3460
03:00:50,680 --> 03:00:55,680
There's a lot going on with Stussy.

3461
03:00:55,680 --> 03:01:08,680
So like there's going to be the Seraphim and Zoro, Brooke, Sanji, Frankie, Luchi, Kaku, and Stussy in this area, and something's going to happen.

3462
03:01:08,680 --> 03:01:12,680
And also the warships are coming and also the Admiral.

3463
03:01:12,680 --> 03:01:13,680
The warships are coming.

3464
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:21,680
Yeah, I kind of think maybe you're right, and Vegapunk is going to betray them and he's evil, because like things are going a little too well.

3465
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:28,680
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

3466
03:01:28,680 --> 03:01:33,680
Why is a clone of the Rocks Pirates even here?

3467
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:41,680
And if it's Madd's first successful clone, who's to say that she's aligned with Madd's?

3468
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:45,680
Maybe she's just being the new Rocks Pirates.

3469
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:50,680
She could be the Primordial Seraphim.

3470
03:01:50,680 --> 03:01:53,680
Like she's a clone of a famous pirate.

3471
03:01:53,680 --> 03:01:59,680
Just like the Seraphim are clones of the Warlords, but she doesn't have green blood.

3472
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:02,680
She has normal blood.

3473
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:06,680
It doesn't look like she's got green blood.

3474
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:07,680
But she doesn't have a thing.

3475
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:14,680
She does not seem to have a green blood armlet.

3476
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:18,680
Who knows?

3477
03:02:18,680 --> 03:02:22,680
At this point, it's just too mysterious.

3478
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:34,680
And then in my mind still is the knowledge that nearby this island, Garp, is going on a rescue mission to save Kobe from Blackbeard.

3479
03:02:34,680 --> 03:02:37,680
Oh, right.

3480
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:38,680
And the reason...

3481
03:02:38,680 --> 03:02:39,680
Is that nearby?

3482
03:02:39,680 --> 03:02:41,680
I don't, I remember that that is happening.

3483
03:02:42,680 --> 03:02:45,680
I believe there was some...

3484
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:50,680
Yeah, like Helmapo said, we're close by to Egghead.

3485
03:02:50,680 --> 03:02:53,680
Why don't we just get the Seraphim to go save Kobe?

3486
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:56,680
You know, that's what Helmapo mentioned.

3487
03:02:56,680 --> 03:02:59,680
So they could go here to get a Seraphim.

3488
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:01,680
Maybe they'll turn up.

3489
03:03:01,680 --> 03:03:04,680
I feel like Grandpa Garp's in trouble.

3490
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:08,680
Oh, what's going on?

3491
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:10,680
There's a lot of shit happening.

3492
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:14,680
A lot of shit happening.

3493
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:17,680
A lot of shit happening.

3494
03:03:17,680 --> 03:03:21,680
But it is happening.

3495
03:03:21,680 --> 03:03:24,680
What I mean, I don't know.

3496
03:03:24,680 --> 03:03:30,680
It still feels like it's moving fast.

3497
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:31,680
Oh, yeah.

3498
03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:32,680
That is great.

3499
03:03:32,680 --> 03:03:33,680
Yeah.

3500
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:35,680
Damn.

3501
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:39,680
Well, another successful one-piece chapter in the bag.

3502
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:41,680
You think we should do voicemails?

3503
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:42,680
Oh, yeah.

3504
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:44,680
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

3505
03:03:44,680 --> 03:03:47,680
So I'll be back in a second, then we'll do that.

3506
03:03:52,680 --> 03:03:55,680
Okay, I'm back.

3507
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:58,680
And I got ice cream.

3508
03:03:58,680 --> 03:04:00,680
From the toilet?

3509
03:04:00,680 --> 03:04:02,680
Yeah.

3510
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:07,680
Delicious.

3511
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:09,680
Okay.

3512
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:13,680
Our first voicemail is called Krabrawler.

3513
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:15,680
Oh, wait.

3514
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:19,680
If you would be so kind to include a time stamp

3515
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:23,680
for when the one-piece discussion begins and ends,

3516
03:04:23,680 --> 03:04:27,680
I think some viewers might appreciate that.

3517
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:30,680
So if you would please stop setting the show notes.

3518
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:31,680
Thank you.

3519
03:04:31,680 --> 03:04:32,680
Okay.

3520
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:35,680
First voicemail is called Krabrawler.

3521
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:37,680
Three, two, one, go.

3522
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:40,680
Hey, what are your thoughts on Krabrawler?

3523
03:04:40,680 --> 03:04:42,680
I've been playing a lot of Pokemon lately.

3524
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:43,680
Boy, howdy.

3525
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:44,680
Let me tell you.

3526
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:47,680
I love Krabrawler.

3527
03:04:47,680 --> 03:04:49,680
It's okay.

3528
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:50,680
Oh, yeah.

3529
03:04:50,680 --> 03:04:52,680
It's not as cool.

3530
03:04:52,680 --> 03:04:54,680
There's like a crab.

3531
03:04:54,680 --> 03:04:55,680
There's a new crab.

3532
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:59,680
There's a new crab in Scarlet Violet.

3533
03:04:59,680 --> 03:05:02,680
This guy's from Sun and Moon, I think.

3534
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:04,680
Yeah, I remember him.

3535
03:05:04,680 --> 03:05:06,680
I remember having him in Sun and Moon.

3536
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:07,680
Okay.

3537
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:09,680
I think Obama...

3538
03:05:09,680 --> 03:05:11,680
Is it Obama crab?

3539
03:05:11,680 --> 03:05:14,680
Krabomable.

3540
03:05:14,680 --> 03:05:16,680
Krabomable is not that good.

3541
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:19,680
Like Fighting Ice is not a great type combo.

3542
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:23,680
And like his stats are okay.

3543
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:25,680
So I kind of don't...

3544
03:05:25,680 --> 03:05:29,680
Don't really care for Krabrawler.

3545
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:31,680
Krabomable.

3546
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:34,680
There's not much to recommend him, honestly.

3547
03:05:34,680 --> 03:05:36,680
He's... yeah.

3548
03:05:36,680 --> 03:05:39,680
I think when it comes to like Sun and Moon Pokemon,

3549
03:05:39,680 --> 03:05:41,680
he's like pretty alright.

3550
03:05:41,680 --> 03:05:43,680
He's okay.

3551
03:05:43,680 --> 03:05:47,680
He's got little funny punchy gloves.

3552
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:51,680
And I guess like a slick back hairdo that is pincers.

3553
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:52,680
He's got like...

3554
03:05:52,680 --> 03:05:56,680
I think he's got like a Sylvester Stallone, like one eye.

3555
03:05:56,680 --> 03:05:57,680
Like a lazy eye.

3556
03:05:57,680 --> 03:05:59,680
I think that's what that's supposed to be.

3557
03:05:59,680 --> 03:06:02,680
Yeah, yeah. Boxer.

3558
03:06:02,680 --> 03:06:05,680
Or like he's got one black eye or something? Yeah.

3559
03:06:05,680 --> 03:06:07,680
He's fine.

3560
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:10,680
Yeah. No real complaints.

3561
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:14,680
I always find like Kingler is the coolest crab they ever made.

3562
03:06:14,680 --> 03:06:15,680
Yeah.

3563
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:18,680
That might have a lot to do with the episode of the Pokemon anime

3564
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:22,680
where Krabby turns into a Kingler and saves the day.

3565
03:06:22,680 --> 03:06:26,680
The new crab from Scarlet Violet is okay.

3566
03:06:26,680 --> 03:06:28,680
Whatever he's called.

3567
03:06:29,680 --> 03:06:31,680
Crabbitch.

3568
03:06:31,680 --> 03:06:33,680
Yes.

3569
03:06:33,680 --> 03:06:35,680
Much, much better.

3570
03:06:35,680 --> 03:06:37,680
Okay, that's all I have to say about that.

3571
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:41,680
Next one is Am I Right? 3, 2, 1, go.

3572
03:06:44,680 --> 03:06:45,680
What are you saying?

3573
03:06:45,680 --> 03:06:49,680
Do you remember that political take you had 30 years ago?

3574
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:52,680
Do you want to discuss about it when you said...

3575
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:53,680
Yeah.

3576
03:06:53,680 --> 03:06:55,680
He's right.

3577
03:06:55,680 --> 03:06:57,680
It do be like that.

3578
03:06:58,680 --> 03:07:00,680
Okay, next one.

3579
03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:03,680
Next one is called...

3580
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:07,680
Oh, well, there's an image, but there's also a voicemail.

3581
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:09,680
Let's listen to that first.

3582
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:11,680
3, 2, 1, go.

3583
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:17,680
I've been clicking through random on the RFCK borough looking at art

3584
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:20,680
and I simply need to ask,

3585
03:07:20,680 --> 03:07:24,680
what did Gibbon take mean by this?

3586
03:07:25,680 --> 03:07:28,680
As a Dutch person, I'm very disturbed.

3587
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:29,680
Wait a minute.

3588
03:07:29,680 --> 03:07:31,680
I didn't do this.

3589
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:32,680
I did.

3590
03:07:32,680 --> 03:07:34,680
I made Green Man.

3591
03:07:34,680 --> 03:07:37,680
That's my original character is Green Man.

3592
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:39,680
But I don't remember.

3593
03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:41,680
I don't think I put this thing behind him.

3594
03:07:41,680 --> 03:07:46,680
It must be listed as artist Gibbon take because it has your character.

3595
03:07:46,680 --> 03:07:51,680
Yeah, like that is original artwork.

3596
03:07:52,680 --> 03:07:54,680
Of Green Man.

3597
03:07:54,680 --> 03:07:58,680
You'll have to ask someone else why they put them in the Netherlands.

3598
03:07:58,680 --> 03:07:59,680
Okay.

3599
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:01,680
Mystery solved.

3600
03:08:01,680 --> 03:08:03,680
I remember...

3601
03:08:03,680 --> 03:08:07,680
Let me get the original image of Green Man.

3602
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:13,680
Because Green Man is like Green in terms of save the trees,

3603
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:15,680
save the environment.

3604
03:08:16,680 --> 03:08:18,680
Is it 2020?

3605
03:08:18,680 --> 03:08:20,680
Yeah.

3606
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:24,680
Do you have all your drawings organized by date?

3607
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:26,680
By year.

3608
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:28,680
So yeah, like 2020 folder.

3609
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:30,680
I go back in there.

3610
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:34,680
Don't use toilet paper, save the trees.

3611
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:36,680
Save the trees.

3612
03:08:36,680 --> 03:08:38,680
Looks amazing.

3613
03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:42,680
I have no idea.

3614
03:08:42,680 --> 03:08:44,680
This doesn't answer why he's in the Netherlands.

3615
03:08:44,680 --> 03:08:47,680
Maybe they don't use toilet paper over there.

3616
03:08:47,680 --> 03:08:49,680
Yeah, I think that's probably true.

3617
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:51,680
Almost definitely.

3618
03:08:52,680 --> 03:08:54,680
I'm satisfied.

3619
03:08:55,680 --> 03:08:57,680
Next one.

3620
03:08:57,680 --> 03:09:00,680
A couple more images.

3621
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:02,680
Let's check them out.

3622
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:09,680
I used to think my life was a cringe compilation until I realized it's actually a try not to laugh challenge.

3623
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:11,680
That's pretty good.

3624
03:09:11,680 --> 03:09:13,680
That's pretty good.

3625
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:16,680
Um...

3626
03:09:16,680 --> 03:09:18,680
Yep.

3627
03:09:19,680 --> 03:09:21,680
Next one.

3628
03:09:22,680 --> 03:09:24,680
Let's fucking look at it.

3629
03:09:24,680 --> 03:09:26,680
Let's look at it.

3630
03:09:26,680 --> 03:09:27,680
Let us look.

3631
03:09:27,680 --> 03:09:29,680
Uh-oh.

3632
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:31,680
Oh god.

3633
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:33,680
Hi, few things to start off with.

3634
03:09:33,680 --> 03:09:36,680
Yes, I add you because you're a Pegasus to reviewer.

3635
03:09:36,680 --> 03:09:37,680
Tis an awesome thing to see.

3636
03:09:37,680 --> 03:09:38,680
I'm Phantom Horn.

3637
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:41,680
Don't be intimidated, but I'm not a stereotypical guy like my brother.

3638
03:09:41,680 --> 03:09:42,680
Anything.

3639
03:09:42,680 --> 03:09:44,680
I'll be the one in the kitchen.

3640
03:09:50,680 --> 03:09:53,680
Jenny Knit sent us so many subscribers.

3641
03:09:54,680 --> 03:09:56,680
Wow.

3642
03:09:56,680 --> 03:09:58,680
She's overflowed.

3643
03:10:00,680 --> 03:10:03,680
Why is that her icon in the Sonic hat?

3644
03:10:04,680 --> 03:10:07,680
This is what the internet was like back in the Brony days.

3645
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:09,680
We were still using AIM.

3646
03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:11,680
Is that AIM?

3647
03:10:11,680 --> 03:10:13,680
I think it's AIM.

3648
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:15,680
There was me back in the day.

3649
03:10:15,680 --> 03:10:17,680
So much potential.

3650
03:10:17,680 --> 03:10:19,680
Before I squandered it.

3651
03:10:21,680 --> 03:10:23,680
I'll be the one in the kitchen.

3652
03:10:23,680 --> 03:10:25,680
If I was a lady, that's what I would want to hear.

3653
03:10:25,680 --> 03:10:27,680
But you wouldn't be in the kitchen.

3654
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:29,680
That would be effeminate of you.

3655
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:34,680
That was before I had my hard MRA turn.

3656
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:38,680
Yeah, this is what I would have said back then.

3657
03:10:38,680 --> 03:10:40,680
That's what I mean.

3658
03:10:40,680 --> 03:10:42,680
Now I know that you should never go in the kitchen.

3659
03:10:42,680 --> 03:10:44,680
Period.

3660
03:10:44,680 --> 03:10:46,680
Because there's rats in there.

3661
03:10:49,680 --> 03:10:51,680
They ate my tortillas, by the way.

3662
03:10:51,680 --> 03:10:54,680
I accidentally left a package of tortillas out in the counter.

3663
03:10:54,680 --> 03:10:57,680
And I came back and it was ripped open and rats had eaten it.

3664
03:10:58,680 --> 03:11:01,680
Can you imagine how fucked up that is?

3665
03:11:02,680 --> 03:11:04,680
Do you have any fucking concept?

3666
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:06,680
I had a little bit of a concept.

3667
03:11:06,680 --> 03:11:08,680
Did they climb up to the counter?

3668
03:11:10,680 --> 03:11:12,680
They must have been on the counter.

3669
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:14,680
Gross.

3670
03:11:14,680 --> 03:11:16,680
Gotta spray that.

3671
03:11:16,680 --> 03:11:18,680
Gotta spray it down.

3672
03:11:18,680 --> 03:11:23,680
Yeah, I can't eat anything that's been in contact with the counter.

3673
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:26,680
Alright, next one is a Vokeroo.

3674
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:28,680
3, 2, 1, go.

3675
03:11:28,680 --> 03:11:30,680
Guys, listen.

3676
03:11:30,680 --> 03:11:33,680
Planks are totally worthless and I don't care.

3677
03:11:33,680 --> 03:11:35,680
You just do this unpaid job.

3678
03:11:35,680 --> 03:11:37,680
Then you'll have nothing to complain about.

3679
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:43,680
I don't get it.

3680
03:11:43,680 --> 03:11:45,680
Do this unpaid job.

3681
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:47,680
And then he whips us.

3682
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:49,680
Slavery.

3683
03:11:49,680 --> 03:11:53,680
You know, I don't really remember what we were talking about.

3684
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:58,680
So, I don't know what the take was.

3685
03:11:58,680 --> 03:12:00,680
Exactly, but I get it.

3686
03:12:00,680 --> 03:12:02,680
Slavery.

3687
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:06,680
Very good.

3688
03:12:06,680 --> 03:12:08,680
Alright, next one is...

3689
03:12:09,680 --> 03:12:11,680
An egg woman.

3690
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:13,680
Let's see.

3691
03:12:13,680 --> 03:12:15,680
As a woman.

3692
03:12:15,680 --> 03:12:17,680
I can get away with murder.

3693
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:21,680
True.

3694
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:23,680
True. That's why my egg cracked.

3695
03:12:24,680 --> 03:12:27,680
I saw Frisco. She said, I'll do evil things.

3696
03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:29,680
And I'm like, I love that.

3697
03:12:29,680 --> 03:12:30,680
I want to do that.

3698
03:12:30,680 --> 03:12:32,680
Love that for you.

3699
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:34,680
Love that for you.

3700
03:12:34,680 --> 03:12:36,680
Next one.

3701
03:12:36,680 --> 03:12:38,680
Wrestling Battle Royale.

3702
03:12:38,680 --> 03:12:40,680
3, 2, 1, go.

3703
03:12:42,680 --> 03:12:45,680
You probably won't ever play.

3704
03:12:45,680 --> 03:12:47,680
Just look.

3705
03:12:47,680 --> 03:12:49,680
I rumble verse the game.

3706
03:12:49,680 --> 03:12:52,680
It's the most fun normie shit there is.

3707
03:12:54,680 --> 03:12:58,680
I feel like he's recommended this before.

3708
03:12:58,680 --> 03:13:00,680
Maybe not.

3709
03:13:00,680 --> 03:13:02,680
Rumble verse.

3710
03:13:02,680 --> 03:13:04,680
Free to play Brawler Battle Royale.

3711
03:13:04,680 --> 03:13:06,680
Yeah, Battle Royale.

3712
03:13:08,680 --> 03:13:11,680
You know, I've never played a Battle Royale.

3713
03:13:11,680 --> 03:13:13,680
I think I've said this before.

3714
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:15,680
I like the idea of them.

3715
03:13:15,680 --> 03:13:18,680
I think the idea of last man standing multiplayer.

3716
03:13:18,680 --> 03:13:20,680
Deathmatches are fun.

3717
03:13:20,680 --> 03:13:22,680
They are.

3718
03:13:22,680 --> 03:13:24,680
It's just the fact that.

3719
03:13:24,680 --> 03:13:28,680
In a, you know, like mathematically you join a game.

3720
03:13:28,680 --> 03:13:30,680
And there are a bunch of people.

3721
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:42,680
And only one person, like a handful of people get to experience the intense stress and exhilaration of being one of the last few and trying to be the last one.

3722
03:13:42,680 --> 03:13:48,680
But most people die instantly or die really quickly and they just have to wait for a long time or leave.

3723
03:13:48,680 --> 03:13:49,680
Well.

3724
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:58,680
And like statistically, you're going to have a lot of games where nothing happens and then you have to load another match and it's a lot of waiting.

3725
03:13:58,680 --> 03:13:59,680
And I don't like that.

3726
03:13:59,680 --> 03:14:03,680
But if you die, doesn't it just like put you in a new game somewhere else?

3727
03:14:06,680 --> 03:14:10,680
You don't have to like wait for the old game to conclude, I hope.

3728
03:14:10,680 --> 03:14:11,680
No, no.

3729
03:14:11,680 --> 03:14:15,680
But like if you're doing a bunch of matches.

3730
03:14:15,680 --> 03:14:16,680
Well, yeah.

3731
03:14:16,680 --> 03:14:19,680
But I mean, if you die fast, at least it's over soon.

3732
03:14:19,680 --> 03:14:21,680
At least it's over quickly.

3733
03:14:21,680 --> 03:14:25,680
Yeah, so still don't feel like good.

3734
03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:27,680
I'm not good at these sorts of games.

3735
03:14:27,680 --> 03:14:30,680
I mean, obviously it's better to win.

3736
03:14:30,680 --> 03:14:31,680
I like games.

3737
03:14:31,680 --> 03:14:38,680
I like multiplayer games where you can respawn and like it's like a back and forth like team versus team struggle.

3738
03:14:38,680 --> 03:14:41,680
So like if you're losing, it's not instant death.

3739
03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:42,680
It's not the end of the world.

3740
03:14:42,680 --> 03:14:43,680
You can come back.

3741
03:14:43,680 --> 03:14:47,680
You can make a comeback in a game like this.

3742
03:14:47,680 --> 03:14:51,680
You just have to play perfectly until you win.

3743
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:53,680
And then I don't know.

3744
03:14:53,680 --> 03:14:56,680
I mean, it's kind of like it's a little bit like a roguelike.

3745
03:14:56,680 --> 03:14:58,680
You know, that's why I hate it.

3746
03:14:58,680 --> 03:15:03,680
You start and you go and it's like, OK, this run, maybe you'll do good.

3747
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:07,680
Maybe you do bad, but sometimes you have a good run and then you win and you're like, yes.

3748
03:15:07,680 --> 03:15:09,680
Yes.

3749
03:15:09,680 --> 03:15:11,680
Honestly, I get it.

3750
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:14,680
That's probably why I dislike it.

3751
03:15:14,680 --> 03:15:17,680
But I haven't really played games like this.

3752
03:15:17,680 --> 03:15:21,680
TF2 is the best multiplayer game ever.

3753
03:15:21,680 --> 03:15:26,680
Well, you can add me because I can defend myself.

3754
03:15:26,680 --> 03:15:27,680
OK.

3755
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:28,680
All right.

3756
03:15:28,680 --> 03:15:29,680
I got you.

3757
03:15:29,680 --> 03:15:30,680
I hear you.

3758
03:15:30,680 --> 03:15:31,680
I hear you.

3759
03:15:31,680 --> 03:15:32,680
All right.

3760
03:15:32,680 --> 03:15:33,680
Next one.

3761
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:35,680
Another image.

3762
03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:36,680
Gold.

3763
03:15:36,680 --> 03:15:37,680
Oh, yeah.

3764
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:38,680
It doesn't have a name.

3765
03:15:38,680 --> 03:15:39,680
It's just an image.

3766
03:15:39,680 --> 03:15:40,680
Oh, what is this?

3767
03:15:40,680 --> 03:15:45,680
The procrastinator is dating Sim, but there is the Sims.

3768
03:15:45,680 --> 03:15:46,680
Sloth.

3769
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:50,680
I don't know what Asidia even is.

3770
03:15:50,680 --> 03:15:51,680
OK.

3771
03:15:51,680 --> 03:15:53,680
Tom Sloth.

3772
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:54,680
Yeah, maybe.

3773
03:15:54,680 --> 03:15:55,680
Munchy Lust.

3774
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:58,680
I'm not sure about that one.

3775
03:15:58,680 --> 03:16:00,680
Nate Pride.

3776
03:16:00,680 --> 03:16:01,680
Yeah.

3777
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:03,680
Trixie Gluttony.

3778
03:16:03,680 --> 03:16:04,680
Yeah, I could see.

3779
03:16:04,680 --> 03:16:06,680
I see the case for it.

3780
03:16:06,680 --> 03:16:07,680
Ben Wrath.

3781
03:16:07,680 --> 03:16:08,680
Yep.

3782
03:16:08,680 --> 03:16:09,680
Flattering.

3783
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:10,680
Flattering.

3784
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:11,680
Davoo Envy.

3785
03:16:11,680 --> 03:16:13,680
I'm not sure.

3786
03:16:13,680 --> 03:16:15,680
Maybe.

3787
03:16:15,680 --> 03:16:16,680
Jesse Vainglory.

3788
03:16:16,680 --> 03:16:19,680
First of all, that's not a...

3789
03:16:19,680 --> 03:16:20,680
I guess so.

3790
03:16:20,680 --> 03:16:24,680
Seven deadly sins and they're trying to like turn it to nine people.

3791
03:16:24,680 --> 03:16:25,680
What is Asidia?

3792
03:16:25,680 --> 03:16:26,680
I've never heard that word before.

3793
03:16:26,680 --> 03:16:27,680
I typed it in.

3794
03:16:27,680 --> 03:16:32,680
It's like Asidia has been variously defined as a state of listlessness or torpor or not

3795
03:16:32,680 --> 03:16:37,680
caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world.

3796
03:16:37,680 --> 03:16:40,680
So like sloth, but like a little more specific.

3797
03:16:40,680 --> 03:16:41,680
Yeah.

3798
03:16:41,680 --> 03:16:47,680
Dictionary.com says it's spiritual or mental sloth apathy.

3799
03:16:47,680 --> 03:16:48,680
So.

3800
03:16:48,680 --> 03:16:49,680
Yeah.

3801
03:16:49,680 --> 03:16:54,680
And then Mage letting others speak over you and bitching about it later, but never just

3802
03:16:54,680 --> 03:16:56,680
speaking up, fuck.

3803
03:16:56,680 --> 03:17:00,680
I mean, yeah, the worst crime imaginable.

3804
03:17:00,680 --> 03:17:01,680
Straight to hell.

3805
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:05,680
No, no, no chance at salvation for that one.

3806
03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:06,680
Who's Wrath?

3807
03:17:06,680 --> 03:17:07,680
Where's Wrath?

3808
03:17:07,680 --> 03:17:08,680
Me.

3809
03:17:08,680 --> 03:17:09,680
Oh, you.

3810
03:17:09,680 --> 03:17:10,680
Okay.

3811
03:17:10,680 --> 03:17:14,680
One, two, three, four, five, six.

3812
03:17:14,680 --> 03:17:16,680
What's the seventh one?

3813
03:17:16,680 --> 03:17:17,680
Uh.

3814
03:17:17,680 --> 03:17:20,680
Is Vainglory and Asidia like neither of those are?

3815
03:17:20,680 --> 03:17:21,680
None of them are greed.

3816
03:17:21,680 --> 03:17:22,680
Greed.

3817
03:17:22,680 --> 03:17:23,680
Yeah.

3818
03:17:23,680 --> 03:17:24,680
Where's that?

3819
03:17:24,680 --> 03:17:25,680
There's no greed.

3820
03:17:25,680 --> 03:17:30,680
And I mean, technically greed is split into, well, I mean, in Dante's Inferno, in the Purgatorio,

3821
03:17:30,680 --> 03:17:37,680
greed comes in two forms, parsimony and prodigality.

3822
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:41,680
One is like extreme spending and the other is extreme hoarding.

3823
03:17:41,680 --> 03:17:48,680
So you could have split that into two, but instead we got Asidia and Vainglory.

3824
03:17:48,680 --> 03:17:52,680
Um, I mean, good, good vocab words.

3825
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:54,680
Did you, did you learn those?

3826
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:57,680
Did Mr. Willaker teach you those in your high school lit class?

3827
03:17:57,680 --> 03:17:59,680
You fucking hack.

3828
03:17:59,680 --> 03:18:01,680
No, they Googled it.

3829
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:02,680
Yeah.

3830
03:18:02,680 --> 03:18:03,680
They typed in thesaurus.com.

3831
03:18:03,680 --> 03:18:04,680
That's what I would do.

3832
03:18:04,680 --> 03:18:07,680
They typed in, they typed in Asidia to find out what it means.

3833
03:18:07,680 --> 03:18:11,680
And they were like, yeah, I'll call, give that.

3834
03:18:11,680 --> 03:18:14,680
Uh, okay.

3835
03:18:14,680 --> 03:18:15,680
Pretty funny.

3836
03:18:15,680 --> 03:18:16,680
All right.

3837
03:18:16,680 --> 03:18:17,680
All right.

3838
03:18:17,680 --> 03:18:18,680
I had a laugh.

3839
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:19,680
I had a little laugh.

3840
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:22,680
Uh, next one is called What You Think About That, huh?

3841
03:18:22,680 --> 03:18:24,680
Three, two, one, go.

3842
03:18:24,680 --> 03:18:26,680
She said, past the weed, bitch.

3843
03:18:26,680 --> 03:18:27,680
I don't like to pass the gas.

3844
03:18:27,680 --> 03:18:29,680
Slowin' bubble, blowin' zaza.

3845
03:18:29,680 --> 03:18:30,680
She got big old titties.

3846
03:18:30,680 --> 03:18:31,680
I said, Goo Goo.

3847
03:18:31,680 --> 03:18:32,680
Goo guy got it a zoo.

3848
03:18:32,680 --> 03:18:33,680
Monkey ass niggas.

3849
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:36,680
Ooh, ooh, I'm playing with me.

3850
03:18:36,680 --> 03:18:39,680
When the money talking, I cannot hear what you're saying to me.

3851
03:18:39,680 --> 03:18:40,680
Little bitches.

3852
03:18:40,680 --> 03:18:42,680
Uh, what do I think?

3853
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:44,680
Uh, you know.

3854
03:18:44,680 --> 03:18:46,680
I think it's time.

3855
03:18:46,680 --> 03:18:47,680
Guys be farting.

3856
03:18:47,680 --> 03:18:51,680
I think it's time to toke that fucking blunt.

3857
03:18:51,680 --> 03:18:55,680
It's time to fucking smoke up and escape this world.

3858
03:18:55,680 --> 03:19:01,680
Escape this cycle of, of yearning and dissatisfaction.

3859
03:19:01,680 --> 03:19:08,680
We've got to escape the Dharma and achieve Nirvana.

3860
03:19:08,680 --> 03:19:12,680
It's time to free myself from the shackles of this mortal coil.

3861
03:19:12,680 --> 03:19:16,680
But first I'll have another scoop of ice cream.

3862
03:19:16,680 --> 03:19:20,680
Was that your like, like, was that like, uh, your like,

3863
03:19:20,680 --> 03:19:23,680
your like, rep rebuttal?

3864
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:24,680
No.

3865
03:19:24,680 --> 03:19:25,680
Put a beat on that.

3866
03:19:25,680 --> 03:19:27,680
That was just Buddhism.

3867
03:19:27,680 --> 03:19:29,680
Nah, there was a beat there.

3868
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:31,680
There were some bars in that.

3869
03:19:31,680 --> 03:19:32,680
All right.

3870
03:19:32,680 --> 03:19:33,680
Damn.

3871
03:19:33,680 --> 03:19:36,680
It's only because you rhymed Nirvana with something.

3872
03:19:36,680 --> 03:19:37,680
With Dharma?

3873
03:19:37,680 --> 03:19:38,680
Yeah.

3874
03:19:38,680 --> 03:19:42,680
I think that's just because a lot of those words just kind of,

3875
03:19:42,680 --> 03:19:47,680
kind of have this end in the same vowel sound.

3876
03:19:47,680 --> 03:19:48,680
That's the secret.

3877
03:19:48,680 --> 03:19:50,680
That's the secret of rap.

3878
03:19:50,680 --> 03:19:52,680
Find those vowel sounds.

3879
03:19:52,680 --> 03:19:57,680
You know, you know, the thing about rap is that it's not really a creative medium

3880
03:19:57,680 --> 03:19:59,680
because all you're doing is rhyming words,

3881
03:19:59,680 --> 03:20:01,680
but like the words already rhymed, right?

3882
03:20:01,680 --> 03:20:04,680
Like it's not like you invented those words and made them right.

3883
03:20:04,680 --> 03:20:05,680
No, you just found them.

3884
03:20:05,680 --> 03:20:06,680
They were already there.

3885
03:20:06,680 --> 03:20:07,680
You just found them and put them together.

3886
03:20:07,680 --> 03:20:09,680
You're not really making anything.

3887
03:20:09,680 --> 03:20:13,680
You know, you know, and, and, and when you get right down to it,

3888
03:20:13,680 --> 03:20:17,680
you know, baristas, they don't even actually make coffee, right?

3889
03:20:17,680 --> 03:20:19,680
They don't even actually make coffee.

3890
03:20:19,680 --> 03:20:20,680
They just serve it.

3891
03:20:20,680 --> 03:20:21,680
Okay.

3892
03:20:21,680 --> 03:20:23,680
They're not actually doing anything.

3893
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:24,680
They're just enriching.

3894
03:20:24,680 --> 03:20:26,680
They're just enriching the billionaires.

3895
03:20:26,680 --> 03:20:27,680
They got.

3896
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:28,680
We should kill them.

3897
03:20:28,680 --> 03:20:30,680
They got that acedia.

3898
03:20:30,680 --> 03:20:31,680
Acedia.

3899
03:20:31,680 --> 03:20:32,680
Acidic.

3900
03:20:32,680 --> 03:20:35,680
They got pure acedia.

3901
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:39,680
They put, they put, they've put citric acedia all over their freaking cheerios.

3902
03:20:39,680 --> 03:20:43,680
They're putting citric acedia all over the cheerios of society.

3903
03:20:43,680 --> 03:20:46,680
You know, you know exactly what I'm saying.

3904
03:20:46,680 --> 03:20:48,680
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

3905
03:20:48,680 --> 03:20:50,680
The cheerios of society.

3906
03:20:50,680 --> 03:20:51,680
Yes.

3907
03:20:51,680 --> 03:20:52,680
Thank you.

3908
03:20:52,680 --> 03:20:53,680
That's what I'm saying.

3909
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:58,680
In meaning that like society could be normal, regular, or it could have honey all over it.

3910
03:20:58,680 --> 03:21:01,680
Or, you know, I learned something.

3911
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:08,680
I learned that the state drink of Rhode Island is coffee milk.

3912
03:21:08,680 --> 03:21:09,680
Coffee milk.

3913
03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:10,680
Coffee milk.

3914
03:21:10,680 --> 03:21:12,680
Like, like not coffee with milk.

3915
03:21:12,680 --> 03:21:13,680
No.

3916
03:21:13,680 --> 03:21:14,680
Coffee milk.

3917
03:21:14,680 --> 03:21:19,180
Coffee milk is, it's, I mean, you know, you put chocolate syrup in your milk to make a

3918
03:21:19,180 --> 03:21:20,680
chocolate milk, right?

3919
03:21:20,680 --> 03:21:21,680
Yeah.

3920
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:24,680
Well, they have a similar thing, but it's coffee flavored.

3921
03:21:24,680 --> 03:21:25,680
Um.

3922
03:21:25,680 --> 03:21:28,680
Is that not a latte?

3923
03:21:28,680 --> 03:21:31,680
Well, no, you don't really get hot.

3924
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:33,680
Cold latte.

3925
03:21:33,680 --> 03:21:36,680
Well, what is a latte?

3926
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:39,680
It's an espresso with a lot of milk.

3927
03:21:39,680 --> 03:21:41,680
No.

3928
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:44,180
You pretty, listen, there's no actual coffee.

3929
03:21:44,180 --> 03:21:45,180
It's coffee.

3930
03:21:45,180 --> 03:21:51,180
It's coffee derived, coffee flavored syrup that you put it in milk to flavor your milk.

3931
03:21:51,180 --> 03:21:54,180
How can you be coffee flavored without it having coffee in it?

3932
03:21:54,180 --> 03:21:57,180
I mean, it's probably, it probably has coffee in it, but it's like a syrup.

3933
03:21:57,180 --> 03:21:58,180
It's a syrup.

3934
03:21:58,180 --> 03:22:01,180
It's a sugar syrup that's, that's flavored with coffee.

3935
03:22:01,180 --> 03:22:05,180
And you put it in your milk and it's not a latte.

3936
03:22:05,180 --> 03:22:07,180
It's coffee milk.

3937
03:22:07,180 --> 03:22:08,180
It's coffee milk.

3938
03:22:08,180 --> 03:22:14,180
And, um, uh, there's a brand.

3939
03:22:14,180 --> 03:22:16,180
There's a brand of this stuff called Autocrat.

3940
03:22:16,180 --> 03:22:19,180
The brand is called Autocrat and it's from Rhode Island.

3941
03:22:19,180 --> 03:22:21,180
And it's the state drink of Rhode Island.

3942
03:22:21,180 --> 03:22:27,180
And, uh, you could put it on anything.

3943
03:22:27,180 --> 03:22:30,180
Can you believe that?

3944
03:22:30,180 --> 03:22:32,180
I guess I can now.

3945
03:22:32,180 --> 03:22:33,180
Can you fucking believe that?

3946
03:22:33,180 --> 03:22:37,180
Wait, what were we talking about?

3947
03:22:37,180 --> 03:22:40,180
Um, wrap.

3948
03:22:40,180 --> 03:22:41,180
Let's move on.

3949
03:22:41,180 --> 03:22:42,180
Wait.

3950
03:22:42,180 --> 03:22:45,180
I swear I had a point.

3951
03:22:45,180 --> 03:22:46,180
I swear I had a point.

3952
03:22:46,180 --> 03:22:47,180
A seed oil.

3953
03:22:47,180 --> 03:22:48,180
The honey.

3954
03:22:48,180 --> 03:22:49,180
Citric acid.

3955
03:22:49,180 --> 03:22:50,180
Citric acid.

3956
03:22:50,180 --> 03:22:51,180
Honey.

3957
03:22:51,180 --> 03:22:52,180
Cheerios.

3958
03:22:52,180 --> 03:22:53,180
Put it on your cheerio.

3959
03:22:53,180 --> 03:22:54,180
That's a fuck.

3960
03:22:54,180 --> 03:22:55,180
Let's, okay.

3961
03:22:55,180 --> 03:22:56,180
Next one.

3962
03:22:56,180 --> 03:22:57,180
Next one is called Did You Miss Me?

3963
03:22:57,180 --> 03:22:59,180
Did I download that last one?

3964
03:22:59,180 --> 03:23:00,180
Yeah, I did.

3965
03:23:00,180 --> 03:23:01,180
Did you miss me?

3966
03:23:01,180 --> 03:23:02,180
Three, two, one, go.

3967
03:23:02,180 --> 03:23:03,180
Oh no.

3968
03:23:03,180 --> 03:23:04,180
God.

3969
03:23:04,180 --> 03:23:05,180
It's farting.

3970
03:23:05,180 --> 03:23:06,180
I stopped it.

3971
03:23:06,180 --> 03:23:11,180
The guy's just playing the record button when he's on the toilet.

3972
03:23:11,180 --> 03:23:15,180
I don't think we need to play this, but yeah, it's just, it's the sound of shitting.

3973
03:23:15,180 --> 03:23:16,180
It's the sound of shitting.

3974
03:23:16,180 --> 03:23:18,180
Have you stopped?

3975
03:23:18,180 --> 03:23:20,180
No, I'm still playing.

3976
03:23:20,180 --> 03:23:22,180
We don't have to, don't actually play it.

3977
03:23:22,180 --> 03:23:27,180
I did listen to the whole thing just to confirm that it's just the sounds of shitting.

3978
03:23:27,180 --> 03:23:28,180
My Christ-like sacrifice.

3979
03:23:28,180 --> 03:23:30,180
I have taken it upon myself.

3980
03:23:30,180 --> 03:23:34,180
I have taken it on the chin, so our audience doesn't have to.

3981
03:23:34,180 --> 03:23:41,180
I saw a tweet the other day that was like, it was an old tweet, screenshot it.

3982
03:23:41,180 --> 03:23:47,180
And the screenshot to tweet was like, we should just pin all the debt that everybody has.

3983
03:23:47,180 --> 03:23:51,180
We should pin everybody's debt on one guy and then kill him.

3984
03:23:51,180 --> 03:23:56,180
And the response was like, this is Christianity.

3985
03:23:56,180 --> 03:23:58,180
This is literally just what Christianity is.

3986
03:23:58,180 --> 03:23:59,180
Yeah.

3987
03:23:59,180 --> 03:24:00,180
And it's true.

3988
03:24:00,180 --> 03:24:01,180
Yeah.

3989
03:24:01,180 --> 03:24:02,180
Pretty good.

3990
03:24:02,180 --> 03:24:03,180
Pretty good.

3991
03:24:03,180 --> 03:24:06,180
Okay, next one is called Two Mean for No Reason.

3992
03:24:06,180 --> 03:24:07,180
Three, two, one, go.

3993
03:24:07,180 --> 03:24:10,180
Thoughts on the YouTube comments of these?

3994
03:24:10,180 --> 03:24:11,180
Did you understand that?

3995
03:24:11,180 --> 03:24:14,180
No, but I think somebody was too mean for no reason.

3996
03:24:14,180 --> 03:24:17,180
Thoughts on the YouTube comments of these?

3997
03:24:17,180 --> 03:24:19,180
The YouTube comments of these?

3998
03:24:19,180 --> 03:24:23,180
Maybe the guy feels the people being mean about him.

3999
03:24:23,180 --> 03:24:26,180
I felt like there was voicemails about him.

4000
03:24:26,180 --> 03:24:28,180
Did people comment?

4001
03:24:28,180 --> 03:24:30,180
All right, next one.

4002
03:24:30,180 --> 03:24:33,180
I need other people to appreciate how bad this video is.

4003
03:24:33,180 --> 03:24:35,180
Three, two, one, go.

4004
03:24:35,180 --> 03:24:37,180
Remember Nate's Mickle video from way back when?

4005
03:24:37,180 --> 03:24:41,180
I do because back when it came out, you know, obviously it was trying to communicate some

4006
03:24:41,180 --> 03:24:45,180
very simple ideas in an overly complex babble that just goes in one ear and out the other.

4007
03:24:45,180 --> 03:24:49,180
But when I recognized that, I was like, okay, well, I don't remember any of the arguments

4008
03:24:49,180 --> 03:24:50,180
he even said.

4009
03:24:50,180 --> 03:24:54,180
So let me go back and try to parse what he's actually saying to figure out if there's any

4010
03:24:54,180 --> 03:24:56,180
worthwhile meaning in this whatsoever.

4011
03:24:56,180 --> 03:24:59,180
And when I did, I realized that the video isn't just bad.

4012
03:24:59,180 --> 03:25:01,180
It doesn't work on any level.

4013
03:25:01,180 --> 03:25:06,180
He constantly introduces terminology under one definition and then later in the video

4014
03:25:06,180 --> 03:25:10,180
just contradicts that completely or otherwise misuses terms.

4015
03:25:10,180 --> 03:25:13,180
The whole point of the video is that he's making this math formula to represent these

4016
03:25:13,180 --> 03:25:17,180
ideas that he has, but he visualizes, you know, this is how the graph would change

4017
03:25:17,180 --> 03:25:18,180
in these different contexts.

4018
03:25:18,180 --> 03:25:22,180
But if you plug in the numbers from those contexts, the graph doesn't change like that.

4019
03:25:22,180 --> 03:25:24,180
So it doesn't have the relationship he's describing.

4020
03:25:24,180 --> 03:25:26,180
Why even bother with the graph?

4021
03:25:26,180 --> 03:25:31,180
And then he has a second graph that he says is different, but it's the same thing.

4022
03:25:31,180 --> 03:25:34,180
It's just the same formula with different letters.

4023
03:25:34,180 --> 03:25:39,180
Every time I think of this, I have to obsess over it for a while because it just drives

4024
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:40,180
me insane.

4025
03:25:40,180 --> 03:25:41,180
It is.

4026
03:25:41,180 --> 03:25:44,180
It's like staring into the abyss to the point that I'm like, I attempted to make my own

4027
03:25:44,180 --> 03:25:48,180
video response, breaking down all of the ways that Mikkel is ridiculous.

4028
03:25:48,180 --> 03:25:50,180
But I can't justify the time.

4029
03:25:50,180 --> 03:25:52,180
So instead of making a voicemail.

4030
03:25:52,180 --> 03:25:53,180
Exactly.

4031
03:25:53,180 --> 03:26:00,180
And I'm not saying this to be like, you should be an attack dog and attack Nate, but I would

4032
03:26:00,180 --> 03:26:08,180
be interested to hear someone point out like, here is just a list of the things that are

4033
03:26:08,180 --> 03:26:09,180
wrong.

4034
03:26:09,180 --> 03:26:10,180
I would be interested.

4035
03:26:10,180 --> 03:26:11,180
Ice.

4036
03:26:11,180 --> 03:26:12,180
Here's what's wrong with it.

4037
03:26:12,180 --> 03:26:16,180
I have similarly had like, I watched it the first time.

4038
03:26:16,180 --> 03:26:18,180
It's like, huh?

4039
03:26:18,180 --> 03:26:19,180
Huh?

4040
03:26:19,180 --> 03:26:21,180
Like I didn't get it.

4041
03:26:21,180 --> 03:26:26,180
It's sort of like incomprehensible in a really like compelling way.

4042
03:26:26,180 --> 03:26:27,180
Like I want to figure it out.

4043
03:26:27,180 --> 03:26:35,180
I want to figure out this, this, this, these words, these, these hieroglyphs.

4044
03:26:35,180 --> 03:26:41,180
I don't think I watched the entire video, but I remember the equation.

4045
03:26:41,180 --> 03:26:47,180
And okay, I don't exactly remember what you mean about like he introduces a new equation

4046
03:26:47,180 --> 03:26:49,180
and it doesn't have the relationship.

4047
03:26:49,180 --> 03:26:55,180
I'm not exactly sure how that goes down, but I remember thinking that like all the, all

4048
03:26:55,180 --> 03:27:01,180
the, the graph really is, is just like anything that like Adam toxic, Adam tautically approaches

4049
03:27:01,180 --> 03:27:04,180
asymptotically approaches a point.

4050
03:27:04,180 --> 03:27:10,180
Like it's, like it's not hard to come up with a formula that asymptotically approaches a,

4051
03:27:10,180 --> 03:27:12,180
a discreet value.

4052
03:27:12,180 --> 03:27:15,180
And you could do that any number of ways.

4053
03:27:15,180 --> 03:27:19,180
And there's nothing really very remarkable about it.

4054
03:27:19,180 --> 03:27:23,180
Like that's, like that's all he's describing is that a, is that a value asymptotically approaches

4055
03:27:23,180 --> 03:27:29,180
a predefined value and cannot exceed it.

4056
03:27:29,180 --> 03:27:33,180
And that's just, and that's just the, and that's just the 80 20 rule.

4057
03:27:33,180 --> 03:27:38,180
It's just, that's just, you know, the first it's, it's multiple layers of weird beyond

4058
03:27:38,180 --> 03:27:44,180
that because like the value that it can't get higher than is like game quality, which

4059
03:27:44,180 --> 03:27:50,180
is not a value you can, you can even like measure or like cap.

4060
03:27:50,180 --> 03:27:52,180
It's not measurable.

4061
03:27:52,180 --> 03:28:01,180
I mean, you can assign it a value, a subjective value, like if the game is good, you can say.

4062
03:28:01,180 --> 03:28:06,180
But like it's a graph that can't be finished because like you, how could you ever say that

4063
03:28:06,180 --> 03:28:12,180
you found like the most quality something can have and then plot everything in, you know,

4064
03:28:12,180 --> 03:28:15,180
the gaming sphere on that graph.

4065
03:28:15,180 --> 03:28:21,180
It just feels like a, it's like not useful for anything.

4066
03:28:21,180 --> 03:28:23,180
It's pretty weird.

4067
03:28:23,180 --> 03:28:32,180
It's pretty weird to like correlate like technology with quality like, like, like that like technology

4068
03:28:32,180 --> 03:28:39,180
somehow determines like the highest possible level of quality as though, as though we didn't

4069
03:28:39,180 --> 03:28:45,180
all lose our fucking minds and say that Undertale was the best game ever made when it's like

4070
03:28:45,180 --> 03:28:47,180
some fucking RPG maker shit.

4071
03:28:47,180 --> 03:28:48,180
You know?

4072
03:28:48,180 --> 03:28:49,180
Yeah.

4073
03:28:49,180 --> 03:28:50,180
Yeah.

4074
03:28:50,180 --> 03:28:52,180
Kind of just a weird premise.

4075
03:28:52,180 --> 03:28:53,180
The weirdest part.

4076
03:28:53,180 --> 03:28:58,180
A weird premise and like the attempt to like justify it mathematically.

4077
03:28:58,180 --> 03:28:59,180
Yeah.

4078
03:28:59,180 --> 03:29:03,180
I would say just kind of doesn't, doesn't really do anything.

4079
03:29:03,180 --> 03:29:11,180
It's, it's just the, the, the most like memorable part of it for me is that it was meant to

4080
03:29:11,180 --> 03:29:20,180
like launch a series of merch off of the idea and it's like the most poorly thought out

4081
03:29:20,180 --> 03:29:24,180
formula as well as I don't know.

4082
03:29:24,180 --> 03:29:25,180
It's crazy.

4083
03:29:25,180 --> 03:29:29,180
I would, I would like, I would also like a video explaining.

4084
03:29:29,180 --> 03:29:37,180
I, I, I say this with love, but I would watch a video that like point by point explained

4085
03:29:37,180 --> 03:29:39,180
why Mikkel is nonsense.

4086
03:29:39,180 --> 03:29:40,180
Yep.

4087
03:29:40,180 --> 03:29:49,180
Um, um, the, the, I think if you were doing, if you were doing Mikkel Apologia, well not,

4088
03:29:49,180 --> 03:29:54,180
not really Mikkel Apologia, but like Apologia for that video and especially for like the,

4089
03:29:54,180 --> 03:30:01,180
the, the, the sort of campaign that preceded it, I think you could maybe call it satire

4090
03:30:01,180 --> 03:30:05,180
in that, okay, hang on.

4091
03:30:05,180 --> 03:30:11,180
Mikkel is about like technology and like the level of quality that like technology makes

4092
03:30:11,180 --> 03:30:12,180
possible.

4093
03:30:12,180 --> 03:30:18,180
It's not really about hype, but like the, the, the lead up to it, does it, is it about

4094
03:30:18,180 --> 03:30:19,180
hype also?

4095
03:30:19,180 --> 03:30:23,180
Isn't it sort of about how like hype can never truly reflect the game's quality?

4096
03:30:23,180 --> 03:30:32,180
Because technology limits quality in a way that hype does not respect or reflect or something.

4097
03:30:32,180 --> 03:30:39,180
Another complication is that the video is about multiple different gaming, like topics

4098
03:30:39,180 --> 03:30:46,180
and opinions he has, um, that are not related, but are nonetheless under the Mikkel umbrella.

4099
03:30:46,180 --> 03:30:49,180
Like they don't, they don't have anything to do with one another.

4100
03:30:50,180 --> 03:30:55,180
I, I think, I feel like I remember that in some portion of the video, he is talking about

4101
03:30:55,180 --> 03:31:05,180
hype culture and, and hype, and on that level, I feel like the, the, uh, like the, the campaign

4102
03:31:05,180 --> 03:31:11,180
ahead of time could be taken as satire because he sort of was doing like a hype campaign

4103
03:31:11,180 --> 03:31:13,180
for a video about hype.

4104
03:31:13,180 --> 03:31:18,180
Only that's not really, that's not really the main thing that the video is about.

4105
03:31:18,180 --> 03:31:19,180
No.

4106
03:31:19,180 --> 03:31:21,180
Uh, yeah.

4107
03:31:21,180 --> 03:31:25,180
So it's a bit, yeah, it's a little-

4108
03:31:25,180 --> 03:31:29,180
That feel when sometimes video games don't do what you like.

4109
03:31:33,180 --> 03:31:37,180
I almost dropped my empty ice cream tub.

4110
03:31:37,180 --> 03:31:46,180
You know, uh, I, you know, there, there is, there is a lot to unpack in that video, honestly.

4111
03:31:46,180 --> 03:31:47,180
There really is.

4112
03:31:47,180 --> 03:31:50,180
Honestly, not the worst idea.

4113
03:31:50,180 --> 03:31:53,180
Someone make a video dissecting it.

4114
03:31:53,180 --> 03:31:54,180
Yeah.

4115
03:31:54,180 --> 03:31:55,180
I don't know.

4116
03:31:55,180 --> 03:31:57,180
I, I would, I would watch it.

4117
03:31:57,180 --> 03:31:58,180
Same.

4118
03:31:58,180 --> 03:32:03,180
Um, the, the next one is, uh, it says, Nate, is that you?

4119
03:32:03,180 --> 03:32:05,180
And it's a, an image.

4120
03:32:05,180 --> 03:32:07,180
What is this?

4121
03:32:07,180 --> 03:32:14,180
Oh, it's a, it's an AI generated version of an image that already exists.

4122
03:32:14,180 --> 03:32:18,180
Well, it's the, it's that, um, that like sad Wojak.

4123
03:32:18,180 --> 03:32:20,180
The sad, like doomer Wojak.

4124
03:32:20,180 --> 03:32:26,180
The sad doomer gray defeated Wojak with the prompt, my beautiful wife who loves me.

4125
03:32:26,180 --> 03:32:27,180
Haha.

4126
03:32:27,180 --> 03:32:29,180
And it just became long-haired Nate.

4127
03:32:29,180 --> 03:32:31,180
Long-haired female Nate.

4128
03:32:31,180 --> 03:32:32,180
Right.

4129
03:32:32,180 --> 03:32:33,180
Like biting her lip.

4130
03:32:33,180 --> 03:32:35,180
It looks like.

4131
03:32:35,180 --> 03:32:36,180
Yes.

4132
03:32:36,180 --> 03:32:38,180
I think so.

4133
03:32:38,180 --> 03:32:40,180
The teeth are a little weird.

4134
03:32:40,180 --> 03:32:43,180
Uh, AI is not good at teeth.

4135
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:46,180
AI is not good at a lot of things.

4136
03:32:46,180 --> 03:32:47,180
Yeah.

4137
03:32:47,180 --> 03:32:48,180
But, uh.

4138
03:32:48,180 --> 03:32:50,180
This is a very odd hairstyle actually.

4139
03:32:50,180 --> 03:32:51,180
Now I'm looking at it.

4140
03:32:51,180 --> 03:32:53,180
Like that one strand pushes back.

4141
03:32:53,180 --> 03:32:54,180
Weird.

4142
03:32:54,180 --> 03:32:57,180
The rest sits behind the ear.

4143
03:32:57,180 --> 03:32:59,180
Teeth, teeth in particular.

4144
03:32:59,180 --> 03:33:05,180
Like if an AI, if an AI makes a face and something is wrong about it, it's usually the teeth.

4145
03:33:05,180 --> 03:33:08,180
Like especially if it has like a mouth, it's like its mouth is open.

4146
03:33:08,180 --> 03:33:11,180
A lot of the time I see like there's multiple rows of teeth.

4147
03:33:11,180 --> 03:33:12,180
Oh yeah.

4148
03:33:12,180 --> 03:33:15,180
I can't exactly tell where the teeth end and the mouth begins.

4149
03:33:15,180 --> 03:33:16,180
Yeah.

4150
03:33:16,180 --> 03:33:17,180
Or whatever.

4151
03:33:17,180 --> 03:33:19,180
Teeth and fingers.

4152
03:33:19,180 --> 03:33:20,180
Definitely.

4153
03:33:20,180 --> 03:33:21,180
Yeah.

4154
03:33:21,180 --> 03:33:22,180
Teeth and fingers.

4155
03:33:22,180 --> 03:33:24,180
And uh.

4156
03:33:24,180 --> 03:33:25,180
Yeah.

4157
03:33:25,180 --> 03:33:26,180
Um.

4158
03:33:26,180 --> 03:33:28,180
Don't.

4159
03:33:28,180 --> 03:33:31,180
It says don't link to it.

4160
03:33:31,180 --> 03:33:32,180
NSFW.

4161
03:33:32,180 --> 03:33:34,180
The next one is an image.

4162
03:33:34,180 --> 03:33:36,180
So maybe you won't.

4163
03:33:36,180 --> 03:33:38,180
I just got text under the thing.

4164
03:33:38,180 --> 03:33:40,180
You'll want to click on the link.

4165
03:33:40,180 --> 03:33:43,180
We'll have to read this.

4166
03:33:43,180 --> 03:33:47,180
In Ben's stream today in Mega Man, the water was hacked and undrinkable.

4167
03:33:47,180 --> 03:33:50,180
But Ben St. wasn't worried.

4168
03:33:50,180 --> 03:33:51,180
Okay.

4169
03:33:51,180 --> 03:33:57,180
Vinny is obsessed with me like drinking sweat off of Celestia's huge wobbly ass.

4170
03:33:57,180 --> 03:34:00,180
Vinny will not stop.

4171
03:34:00,180 --> 03:34:02,180
He just won't stop.

4172
03:34:02,180 --> 03:34:03,180
That's it.

4173
03:34:03,180 --> 03:34:05,180
I mean.

4174
03:34:05,180 --> 03:34:07,180
Looks pretty good.

4175
03:34:07,180 --> 03:34:10,180
Looks like a nice full glass right there.

4176
03:34:10,180 --> 03:34:18,180
I don't want to contribute anymore to this campaign.

4177
03:34:18,180 --> 03:34:24,180
When Ben was playing Mega Man Battle Nightmare, Ben St. had a Princess Celestia's big fat

4178
03:34:24,180 --> 03:34:29,180
wobbling ass sweat to drink when there was no other liquid he could consume.

4179
03:34:29,180 --> 03:34:34,180
Ben St. couldn't help but let it slip in front of his impressionable young new ball streaming

4180
03:34:34,180 --> 03:34:38,180
audience, one of his most darkest desires in life.

4181
03:34:38,180 --> 03:34:40,180
Did you say that, Ben?

4182
03:34:40,180 --> 03:34:42,180
Is this true?

4183
03:34:42,180 --> 03:34:44,180
I say a lot of things.

4184
03:34:44,180 --> 03:34:45,180
Gotta go to-

4185
03:34:45,180 --> 03:34:48,180
I say a lot of fucked up things when I'm streaming.

4186
03:34:48,180 --> 03:34:51,180
Gotta go to twitch.tv slash-

4187
03:34:51,180 --> 03:34:53,180
There's only one way to find out.

4188
03:34:53,180 --> 03:34:54,180
Is it Ben St. on Twitch?

4189
03:34:54,180 --> 03:34:56,180
No, it's St. Comics.

4190
03:34:56,180 --> 03:34:58,180
St. Comics.

4191
03:34:58,180 --> 03:35:01,180
Or is it?

4192
03:35:02,180 --> 03:35:03,180
I think it's-

4193
03:35:03,180 --> 03:35:05,180
Yeah, St. Comics with an X.

4194
03:35:05,180 --> 03:35:07,180
That's right.

4195
03:35:10,180 --> 03:35:12,180
I've themed the whole channel.

4196
03:35:12,180 --> 03:35:13,180
I've themed my whole channel.

4197
03:35:13,180 --> 03:35:14,180
I made a new banner.

4198
03:35:14,180 --> 03:35:17,180
I've made thumbnails for the episodes.

4199
03:35:17,180 --> 03:35:19,180
It's all Battle Network.

4200
03:35:19,180 --> 03:35:22,180
It's Battle Network all the way down from now until the end of time.

4201
03:35:22,180 --> 03:35:24,180
Wow.

4202
03:35:24,180 --> 03:35:25,180
Yeah.

4203
03:35:25,180 --> 03:35:27,180
Next one is Crooked Beetles.

4204
03:35:27,180 --> 03:35:29,180
OK Hand.

4205
03:35:29,180 --> 03:35:31,180
3, 2, 1.

4206
03:35:31,180 --> 03:35:33,180
Go.

4207
03:35:33,180 --> 03:35:36,180
Search for Crooked Beetles.

4208
03:35:36,180 --> 03:35:39,180
On TikTok, whatever.

4209
03:35:39,180 --> 03:35:41,180
The best thing the community ever did.

4210
03:35:41,180 --> 03:35:44,180
It looks like my little pony things.

4211
03:35:44,180 --> 03:35:47,180
What are these?

4212
03:35:47,180 --> 03:35:52,180
That's just some sort of pony meme stuff.

4213
03:35:52,180 --> 03:35:56,180
With comics, with art done.

4214
03:35:56,180 --> 03:35:57,180
OK, I mean-

4215
03:35:57,180 --> 03:35:58,180
Looks like it could be funny.

4216
03:35:58,180 --> 03:36:00,180
It doesn't seem like my sort of thing.

4217
03:36:00,180 --> 03:36:01,180
OK.

4218
03:36:01,180 --> 03:36:05,180
I've still watched two of them and they've been amusing.

4219
03:36:05,180 --> 03:36:06,180
All right.

4220
03:36:06,180 --> 03:36:08,180
Next one is Vokeroo.

4221
03:36:08,180 --> 03:36:11,180
Let's freaking go.

4222
03:36:11,180 --> 03:36:14,180
Let's freaking go.

4223
03:36:14,180 --> 03:36:15,180
All right.

4224
03:36:15,180 --> 03:36:16,180
3, 2, 1.

4225
03:36:16,180 --> 03:36:18,180
Go.

4226
03:36:18,180 --> 03:36:20,180
I did it.

4227
03:36:20,180 --> 03:36:22,180
I am enabled.

4228
03:36:22,180 --> 03:36:23,180
I am loved.

4229
03:36:23,180 --> 03:36:26,180
Everybody likes me.

4230
03:36:26,180 --> 03:36:28,180
We're best friends already, right?

4231
03:36:28,180 --> 03:36:30,180
We're hanging out.

4232
03:36:30,180 --> 03:36:31,180
Bad and Gib.

4233
03:36:31,180 --> 03:36:32,180
Yeah.

4234
03:36:32,180 --> 03:36:38,180
But actually, at this point, I think you recognized me already,

4235
03:36:38,180 --> 03:36:44,180
but I have something I need to confess.

4236
03:36:44,180 --> 03:36:51,180
It's really hard to say, but...

4237
03:36:51,180 --> 03:36:54,180
Haha, just kidding.

4238
03:36:54,180 --> 03:36:55,180
No.

4239
03:36:55,180 --> 03:36:58,180
It was me, Oblivion, fall the whole time.

4240
03:36:58,180 --> 03:36:59,180
No.

4241
03:36:59,180 --> 03:37:01,180
Oh, you fell for it.

4242
03:37:01,180 --> 03:37:03,180
Oh, you're so gullible.

4243
03:37:03,180 --> 03:37:06,180
You're so gullible.

4244
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:07,180
I don't believe it.

4245
03:37:07,180 --> 03:37:09,180
I believe this is there in Cahoots.

4246
03:37:09,180 --> 03:37:13,180
It kind of been Oblivion Fall just far away from the mic doing an exit,

4247
03:37:13,180 --> 03:37:14,180
and it kind of been.

4248
03:37:14,180 --> 03:37:16,180
It must have been two different people.

4249
03:37:16,180 --> 03:37:18,180
I don't think Oblivion Fall would lie.

4250
03:37:18,180 --> 03:37:19,180
I think-

4251
03:37:19,180 --> 03:37:22,180
No, I feel like Oblivion Fall is the ultimate liar.

4252
03:37:22,180 --> 03:37:24,180
No, you're right, though.

4253
03:37:24,180 --> 03:37:26,180
You know what?

4254
03:37:26,180 --> 03:37:28,180
You're absolutely right.

4255
03:37:28,180 --> 03:37:30,180
Well, I didn't see that coming.

4256
03:37:30,180 --> 03:37:34,180
There's no way all the voicemails are a whole module news.

4257
03:37:34,180 --> 03:37:36,180
There's no way there's all the same guy.

4258
03:37:36,180 --> 03:37:38,180
There's different people, I swear.

4259
03:37:38,180 --> 03:37:40,180
They're all different people.

4260
03:37:40,180 --> 03:37:44,180
He's been doing a bit this whole time for years.

4261
03:37:44,180 --> 03:37:46,180
Every single viewer is the same.

4262
03:37:46,180 --> 03:37:48,180
It's all Oblivion Fall.

4263
03:37:48,180 --> 03:37:49,180
I believe it.

4264
03:37:49,180 --> 03:37:51,180
I believe Oblivion-

4265
03:37:51,180 --> 03:37:55,180
He just spams the refresh button to give every one of our videos like a thousand views now

4266
03:37:55,180 --> 03:37:57,180
just to give up the illusion that anyone is still listening.

4267
03:37:57,180 --> 03:38:01,180
Just to keep us trapped in our little fishbowl for him to tap on.

4268
03:38:03,180 --> 03:38:07,180
Next one is called A.I. Ramblings.

4269
03:38:07,180 --> 03:38:09,180
Three, two, one, go.

4270
03:38:09,180 --> 03:38:14,180
I find A.I. generated images very fascinating.

4271
03:38:14,180 --> 03:38:19,180
The thing is, you know, the A.I. struggles with generating hands

4272
03:38:19,180 --> 03:38:23,180
and if you're in a dream and you look at your hands,

4273
03:38:23,180 --> 03:38:28,180
then they look fucked up and I'm not making this up.

4274
03:38:28,180 --> 03:38:31,180
They look fucked up.

4275
03:38:31,180 --> 03:38:33,180
And the thing is, right?

4276
03:38:33,180 --> 03:38:35,180
Get away from the microphone.

4277
03:38:35,180 --> 03:38:38,180
The A.I. is similar to my unconscious brain.

4278
03:38:38,180 --> 03:38:40,180
It's dreaming. The A.I. is dreaming.

4279
03:38:40,180 --> 03:38:42,180
This is a common comparison.

4280
03:38:42,180 --> 03:38:47,180
Does that say that the A.I. is unconscious?

4281
03:38:47,180 --> 03:38:49,180
It's like an unconscious mind.

4282
03:38:49,180 --> 03:38:52,180
It doesn't have a soul or something.

4283
03:38:52,180 --> 03:38:54,180
That's kind of a crazy idea.

4284
03:38:54,180 --> 03:38:56,180
What are you talking about?

4285
03:38:56,180 --> 03:39:01,180
You know how you don't remember your dreaming when you wake up?

4286
03:39:01,180 --> 03:39:05,180
What if when you're a child, you're just dreaming.

4287
03:39:05,180 --> 03:39:10,180
You're in a dream before your soul comes into your body

4288
03:39:10,180 --> 03:39:14,180
at a certain age and then you wake up

4289
03:39:14,180 --> 03:39:17,180
and you don't remember your dream anymore.

4290
03:39:17,180 --> 03:39:20,180
Kind of a crazy notion.

4291
03:39:20,180 --> 03:39:26,180
But I find it really weird that I was able to talk

4292
03:39:26,180 --> 03:39:30,180
many years before I could actually remember what I said.

4293
03:39:30,180 --> 03:39:34,180
Like, why the hell was I fully conscious and intelligent

4294
03:39:34,180 --> 03:39:37,180
before I was able to form memories?

4295
03:39:38,180 --> 03:39:40,180
What the fuck?

4296
03:39:40,180 --> 03:39:42,180
That is kind of interesting.

4297
03:39:42,180 --> 03:39:45,180
The idea that you may have been dreaming

4298
03:39:45,180 --> 03:39:49,180
before you came out of the womb, but you forgot it.

4299
03:39:49,180 --> 03:39:54,180
Even after that, I don't remember when I was like one, two...

4300
03:39:54,180 --> 03:39:55,180
No, yeah.

4301
03:39:55,180 --> 03:39:58,180
I don't really have memories until I was maybe like four or so.

4302
03:39:58,180 --> 03:40:05,180
And yet you probably had input.

4303
03:40:05,180 --> 03:40:06,180
Yeah.

4304
03:40:06,180 --> 03:40:12,180
But I mean, there's lots of times in my life that I was conscious

4305
03:40:12,180 --> 03:40:14,180
but I don't remember them.

4306
03:40:14,180 --> 03:40:16,180
I don't remember my whole life.

4307
03:40:16,180 --> 03:40:18,180
No, yeah.

4308
03:40:18,180 --> 03:40:22,180
If you get drunk and you black out and you don't remember the next day,

4309
03:40:22,180 --> 03:40:24,180
were you dreaming?

4310
03:40:24,180 --> 03:40:25,180
Were you just dreaming?

4311
03:40:25,180 --> 03:40:29,180
That's why it's really important to use recording technology

4312
03:40:29,180 --> 03:40:33,180
to record babies and drunk people so they remember it.

4313
03:40:34,180 --> 03:40:35,180
And you can show them later.

4314
03:40:35,180 --> 03:40:37,180
Yeah, this is when you were so young

4315
03:40:37,180 --> 03:40:41,180
that you didn't know how to fucking not cry, you idiot.

4316
03:40:41,180 --> 03:40:43,180
I'm going to blackmail you with this.

4317
03:40:43,180 --> 03:40:46,180
I'm going to show everyone that you used to cry when you were a baby

4318
03:40:46,180 --> 03:40:50,180
and you used to throw up and you didn't even say you were sorry.

4319
03:40:50,180 --> 03:40:51,180
You're such a rude baby.

4320
03:40:51,180 --> 03:40:53,180
You didn't even pay rent.

4321
03:40:53,180 --> 03:40:57,180
You got to pay it back at some point.

4322
03:40:57,180 --> 03:41:00,180
Do you have to pay rent while you're in the womb?

4323
03:41:00,180 --> 03:41:01,180
Do you count?

4324
03:41:01,180 --> 03:41:03,180
Do you have to do that?

4325
03:41:05,180 --> 03:41:09,180
Could you be charged rent while in the womb?

4326
03:41:09,180 --> 03:41:12,180
You could charge anyone anything you want.

4327
03:41:15,180 --> 03:41:17,180
It's like Calvin's dad.

4328
03:41:17,180 --> 03:41:20,180
Calvin's dad says like,

4329
03:41:20,180 --> 03:41:26,180
there's one stripper he tells him that it costs like $10,000 to raise a kid to adulthood

4330
03:41:26,180 --> 03:41:27,180
and that's a lot of money.

4331
03:41:27,180 --> 03:41:31,180
He says, like, is that a gift or is that a loan, Calvin?

4332
03:41:31,180 --> 03:41:33,180
It's like, that's kind of fucked up.

4333
03:41:33,180 --> 03:41:34,180
Yeah.

4334
03:41:34,180 --> 03:41:35,180
Calvin's dad.

4335
03:41:35,180 --> 03:41:39,180
Calvin's dad is usually cool, but he's got a bunch of boomerisms.

4336
03:41:39,180 --> 03:41:42,180
He's got a bunch of like shitty, like reactionary boomerisms.

4337
03:41:42,180 --> 03:41:45,180
His shovel the walk, like labor builds character thing sucks.

4338
03:41:45,180 --> 03:41:51,180
His like, should I make you pay back what it cost to raise you, Calvin?

4339
03:41:51,180 --> 03:41:53,180
Like that sucks.

4340
03:41:53,180 --> 03:41:57,180
This was an investment and I expect to return.

4341
03:41:57,180 --> 03:42:00,180
Yes, exactly.

4342
03:42:06,180 --> 03:42:07,180
What was I talking about?

4343
03:42:07,180 --> 03:42:08,180
Is the AI dreaming?

4344
03:42:08,180 --> 03:42:09,180
I don't know.

4345
03:42:09,180 --> 03:42:10,180
AI is dumb.

4346
03:42:10,180 --> 03:42:15,180
AI couldn't beat me in a punching match.

4347
03:42:15,180 --> 03:42:17,180
I've never noticed.

4348
03:42:17,180 --> 03:42:20,180
I've never noticed my hands looking weird in a dream,

4349
03:42:20,180 --> 03:42:25,180
but I guess I've never really like tried to like carefully examine them.

4350
03:42:25,180 --> 03:42:30,180
I mean, AIs do, like, yeah, they do kind of look like a dream

4351
03:42:30,180 --> 03:42:33,180
because it's sort of like, sort of makes sense when you look at it,

4352
03:42:33,180 --> 03:42:36,180
but then when you try to examine the details, it's like, wait,

4353
03:42:36,180 --> 03:42:37,180
what is that?

4354
03:42:37,180 --> 03:42:38,180
Wait, this doesn't make any sense.

4355
03:42:38,180 --> 03:42:39,180
Yeah.

4356
03:42:39,180 --> 03:42:45,180
I have enjoyed like the technology like in its infancy being like fucking weird

4357
03:42:45,180 --> 03:42:51,180
but still recognizable kind of like a really blurry image of a bunch of stuff on a table

4358
03:42:51,180 --> 03:42:58,180
that all looks like it's fine until you recognize that nothing is a real object that you would ever see.

4359
03:42:58,180 --> 03:43:04,180
Did you see those images of like people partying that were AI generated?

4360
03:43:04,180 --> 03:43:05,180
No.

4361
03:43:05,180 --> 03:43:09,180
There were some, I think it was like last week, there was a set of images going around

4362
03:43:09,180 --> 03:43:14,180
and someone posted them like, AI generation is getting really good.

4363
03:43:14,180 --> 03:43:17,180
They posted it like, it's really good.

4364
03:43:17,180 --> 03:43:21,180
Like, these aren't, these are not even real people, believe it or not.

4365
03:43:21,180 --> 03:43:24,180
And it was like pictures, I mean, I'll find them.

4366
03:43:24,180 --> 03:43:25,180
I'll find them.

4367
03:43:25,180 --> 03:43:37,180
There was that one website that was like, it purported to completely generate a fake human using AI,

4368
03:43:37,180 --> 03:43:47,180
but then it came out later that they were only sort of like changing like an entirely real photo of a person

4369
03:43:47,180 --> 03:43:50,180
but just changing some small aspect of it.

4370
03:43:50,180 --> 03:43:51,180
Okay.

4371
03:43:51,180 --> 03:43:55,180
I saw that thread and like, I thought it was a hoax.

4372
03:43:55,180 --> 03:43:58,180
I thought the person who was posting those images and saying like,

4373
03:43:58,180 --> 03:44:03,180
this is basically just like, it was like they were faking it.

4374
03:44:03,180 --> 03:44:10,180
It wasn't, or I saw at least one thread where like, it wasn't actually doing that.

4375
03:44:10,180 --> 03:44:11,180
I don't know.

4376
03:44:11,180 --> 03:44:19,180
I mean, they had like, they had the AI generated version and then the image it was based on and it was very, very similar.

4377
03:44:19,180 --> 03:44:24,180
It was like the AI had not really taken aspects of the face.

4378
03:44:24,180 --> 03:44:27,180
They've taken like almost the entire face.

4379
03:44:27,180 --> 03:44:41,180
So it's like technically AI generated using input, but like, it was more successful because it was using such huge amount like percentages of images rather than mixing and matching.

4380
03:44:41,180 --> 03:44:42,180
Yeah.

4381
03:44:42,180 --> 03:44:49,180
I have seen some that like, they come out and you can kind of be like, well, this mostly just copied another image.

4382
03:44:49,180 --> 03:44:52,180
Anyway, yeah, it was these, it was these pictures.

4383
03:44:52,180 --> 03:44:54,180
Say I'm like, oh, AI is getting so good.

4384
03:44:54,180 --> 03:45:05,180
And like, yeah, they do look like photographs when you look at them until you like, I mean, look at the teeth.

4385
03:45:05,180 --> 03:45:08,180
Look at the teeth and look at the fingers.

4386
03:45:08,180 --> 03:45:11,180
And it's really scary.

4387
03:45:11,180 --> 03:45:12,180
It's really uncanny.

4388
03:45:12,180 --> 03:45:17,180
Like you can, it looks like a picture, but you can tell there's something wrong.

4389
03:45:17,180 --> 03:45:26,180
And it's only when you like start to look for what it is that's wrong, you know, you start to, it starts to get really like uncomfortable.

4390
03:45:26,180 --> 03:45:29,180
The second one is just like a hand floating in air.

4391
03:45:29,180 --> 03:45:30,180
I just noticed that.

4392
03:45:30,180 --> 03:45:34,180
Like with a bit of a thumb, like hovering next to it.

4393
03:45:34,180 --> 03:45:35,180
Yeah.

4394
03:45:35,180 --> 03:45:37,180
Ew, that's disgusting.

4395
03:45:37,180 --> 03:45:42,180
That is, that is the most disgusting part is that these are teenagers and they're partying.

4396
03:45:42,180 --> 03:45:45,180
True.

4397
03:45:45,180 --> 03:45:48,180
Yeah, you know, I, it seems weird.

4398
03:45:48,180 --> 03:45:53,180
The first one you posted and then I click on it and it's like, wow, that is a fucked up looking face.

4399
03:45:53,180 --> 03:45:54,180
Look at those teeth.

4400
03:45:54,180 --> 03:45:56,180
They just keep going.

4401
03:45:56,180 --> 03:45:57,180
Yeah.

4402
03:45:57,180 --> 03:46:00,180
Yeah, they just keep going.

4403
03:46:00,180 --> 03:46:01,180
The other floating hands.

4404
03:46:01,180 --> 03:46:06,180
She has, she has Michael Jackson, like surgery face energy.

4405
03:46:06,180 --> 03:46:15,180
Honestly, I wonder if the, I wonder if that thread was, was like, they deliberately picked pictures that were like a little bit wrong.

4406
03:46:15,180 --> 03:46:31,180
And because I feel like you could, if you really wanted to make it look like the technology is really good, you could find some that like did look almost like undistinguishable from a real photograph.

4407
03:46:31,180 --> 03:46:34,180
You could cherry pick some if you really wanted to.

4408
03:46:34,180 --> 03:46:37,180
They must have known that these don't look quite right.

4409
03:46:37,180 --> 03:46:39,180
Right.

4410
03:46:39,180 --> 03:46:40,180
Yeah.

4411
03:46:40,180 --> 03:46:42,180
Well, like these pictures.

4412
03:46:42,180 --> 03:46:46,180
All of them, all of them have something noticeably wrong with them.

4413
03:46:46,180 --> 03:46:51,180
Maybe they're, they're just being like really, really generous and saying, oh, that's getting so good.

4414
03:46:51,180 --> 03:46:55,180
Like there's only like seven extra fingers.

4415
03:46:55,180 --> 03:46:56,180
Maybe.

4416
03:46:56,180 --> 03:46:58,180
Yeah, it's, it's, it's hard to know.

4417
03:46:58,180 --> 03:47:05,180
There's a lot of people who want to be very generous to AI technology because they stand to profit off it.

4418
03:47:05,180 --> 03:47:17,180
I have, I have seen people talking about it that just clearly have like no sense of aesthetics and no sense, no, like feeling of like when something looks good or not.

4419
03:47:17,180 --> 03:47:19,180
But.

4420
03:47:19,180 --> 03:47:29,180
That's human story being the case that like the point of this thread is that it's meant to get generated engagement by you say that it's good.

4421
03:47:29,180 --> 03:47:37,180
But then the examples you give are like, it's not that it's not really that hard to see that this lady holding the camera has like nine fingers.

4422
03:47:37,180 --> 03:47:43,180
And that one with the two guys, they look like they got the big slicked hair.

4423
03:47:44,180 --> 03:47:50,180
I like the, the twisted Bop it looking thing on the table.

4424
03:47:50,180 --> 03:47:53,180
Yeah, I, I don't know what that is.

4425
03:47:53,180 --> 03:47:57,180
It looks weirdly in focus compared to the out of focus bottles right behind it.

4426
03:47:57,180 --> 03:48:05,180
And that, yeah, that cup is like floating that cup is clearly not on the table.

4427
03:48:06,180 --> 03:48:07,180
Oh, yeah.

4428
03:48:07,180 --> 03:48:10,180
If you look at the background, it's funny, like there's a door.

4429
03:48:10,180 --> 03:48:14,180
And right next to it, there's another door kind of and then.

4430
03:48:14,180 --> 03:48:16,180
Yeah, there's two doors right next to it.

4431
03:48:16,180 --> 03:48:22,180
And there's a really flat, weird door with a dark on the other wall.

4432
03:48:22,180 --> 03:48:26,180
Yeah, it looks like it's around a corner or something.

4433
03:48:26,180 --> 03:48:28,180
The doors are fun.

4434
03:48:29,180 --> 03:48:36,180
Um, anyway, yeah, this is, this is what I was talking about.

4435
03:48:36,180 --> 03:48:40,180
Like it's bad, it's bad at fingers, it's bad at teeth.

4436
03:48:40,180 --> 03:48:49,180
And something about just the face to the eyes are like the eyes and the skin is like a little too focused, but I don't know.

4437
03:48:49,180 --> 03:48:57,180
Some, some bits are fine because like in real life, like if it's in shadow, if somebody's eyes are in shadow because of an overhead light.

4438
03:48:57,180 --> 03:49:01,180
You can't see what their face looks like properly anyway.

4439
03:49:01,180 --> 03:49:09,180
So like, yeah, like AI can make certain parts of images look sort of like they are real.

4440
03:49:09,180 --> 03:49:12,180
It's just not, not that great.

4441
03:49:12,180 --> 03:49:19,180
I mean, on that first picture, the girl on the far right looks pretty much fine.

4442
03:49:19,180 --> 03:49:21,180
No way.

4443
03:49:22,180 --> 03:49:26,180
Looks, yeah, like a couple of, like.

4444
03:49:26,180 --> 03:49:27,180
Oh, her neck.

4445
03:49:27,180 --> 03:49:28,180
Oh, her neck.

4446
03:49:28,180 --> 03:49:29,180
Fine.

4447
03:49:29,180 --> 03:49:30,180
Yeah, yeah.

4448
03:49:30,180 --> 03:49:36,180
Then something's, it's like she has two, she has two, I don't know what you call it.

4449
03:49:36,180 --> 03:49:37,180
Colour bones.

4450
03:49:37,180 --> 03:49:41,180
The little like divot in between the clavicles where the two like neck tendons connect.

4451
03:49:41,180 --> 03:49:42,180
She's got two shoulders.

4452
03:49:42,180 --> 03:49:43,180
She's got two of them.

4453
03:49:43,180 --> 03:49:45,180
She's got two right colour bones and two right shoulders.

4454
03:49:45,180 --> 03:49:47,180
You just can't see him.

4455
03:49:47,180 --> 03:49:52,180
And her dress just doesn't, it just keeps going down.

4456
03:49:52,180 --> 03:49:54,180
Oh, no, you're looking at the one on the left.

4457
03:49:54,180 --> 03:49:56,180
Or no, are you looking at the one on the right?

4458
03:49:56,180 --> 03:49:57,180
On the right.

4459
03:49:57,180 --> 03:50:00,180
Because they're both kind of fucked up in the clavicle regions.

4460
03:50:00,180 --> 03:50:01,180
Yeah.

4461
03:50:05,180 --> 03:50:06,180
Intriguing.

4462
03:50:06,180 --> 03:50:10,180
On the phone or whatever is being held on the left.

4463
03:50:10,180 --> 03:50:13,180
It's just a finger with two like ends.

4464
03:50:13,180 --> 03:50:14,180
Yeah, yeah.

4465
03:50:14,180 --> 03:50:16,180
A finger with two.

4466
03:50:16,180 --> 03:50:17,180
Yeah, that one.

4467
03:50:17,180 --> 03:50:18,180
That's this guy.

4468
03:50:18,180 --> 03:50:21,180
Those fingers are like really.

4469
03:50:21,180 --> 03:50:24,180
Fucking four dimensional hands.

4470
03:50:24,180 --> 03:50:33,180
It's like, it's just like those creatures, the crawl knee in the, what do you call it?

4471
03:50:33,180 --> 03:50:35,180
Frickin, to save her.

4472
03:50:35,180 --> 03:50:40,180
Jennifer Diane writes, pastel defender heliotrope.

4473
03:50:40,180 --> 03:50:43,180
And the other one.

4474
03:50:43,180 --> 03:50:46,180
The ones that are like higher dimensional beings.

4475
03:50:46,180 --> 03:50:49,180
And so like parts of them like don't even connect to each other.

4476
03:50:49,180 --> 03:50:51,180
They're just kind of like floating like blobs.

4477
03:50:51,180 --> 03:50:54,180
Because like they connect through like a different dimension.

4478
03:50:54,180 --> 03:50:55,180
Yeah.

4479
03:50:55,180 --> 03:51:00,180
It's like part, it's like a little portion of it is just peeking out into the third dimension.

4480
03:51:00,180 --> 03:51:09,180
And that's the like disconnected bit of that, that fricking hand that most of a hand and piece of a thumb just floating in the void there.

4481
03:51:09,180 --> 03:51:11,180
Yeah, okay.

4482
03:51:11,180 --> 03:51:18,180
So anyway, the next one is called circumcision.

4483
03:51:18,180 --> 03:51:20,180
My least favorite topic.

4484
03:51:20,180 --> 03:51:23,180
Three, two, one, go.

4485
03:51:23,180 --> 03:51:30,180
Hey, I'm sorry to leave another voicemail like this, but concerning circumcision.

4486
03:51:30,180 --> 03:51:31,180
Yeah, please get away from the mic.

4487
03:51:31,180 --> 03:51:33,180
You're too close.

4488
03:51:33,180 --> 03:51:39,180
On some circumcisions, they take all of the foreskin and other ones, they just kind of fold it back.

4489
03:51:39,180 --> 03:51:49,180
It's pretty disgusting, but um, yeah, in theory, if you like stretched it out, right, like twice as the skin, like twice as normal length.

4490
03:51:49,180 --> 03:51:53,180
Or it's modified length, I guess it's not normal.

4491
03:51:53,180 --> 03:51:59,180
You could have like the foreskin covering the penis again.

4492
03:51:59,180 --> 03:52:06,180
Or at least what's left of it, which would be better, I guess.

4493
03:52:06,180 --> 03:52:11,180
I saw this great presentation by Eric Klopper.

4494
03:52:11,180 --> 03:52:15,180
I think his name is about circumcision.

4495
03:52:15,180 --> 03:52:19,180
I don't know, changed my mind on a couple of things.

4496
03:52:19,180 --> 03:52:25,180
Well, haven't seen it, haven't heard about it.

4497
03:52:25,180 --> 03:52:35,180
I guess, I guess it makes sense that like, I mean, but if the circumcision left some foreskin, then like, why do you need to like, I mean, you just still have some foreskin.

4498
03:52:35,180 --> 03:52:39,180
You don't need to like stretch it, it's still there.

4499
03:52:39,180 --> 03:52:47,180
Once they, you know, tasted the bit of the sun, you know, they got a taste for it, they need more.

4500
03:52:47,180 --> 03:52:49,180
I don't know the expression.

4501
03:52:49,180 --> 03:52:50,180
I guess.

4502
03:52:50,180 --> 03:52:56,180
Was it like Icarus, you flap your toes, gets that sun, gets that tan.

4503
03:52:56,180 --> 03:52:58,180
I don't even know what happens.

4504
03:52:58,180 --> 03:52:59,180
What?

4505
03:52:59,180 --> 03:53:01,180
What do you think the story of Icarus is about?

4506
03:53:01,180 --> 03:53:03,180
What do you think they were trying to do?

4507
03:53:03,180 --> 03:53:05,180
They were trying to get to the sun, I don't know.

4508
03:53:05,180 --> 03:53:08,180
They're trying to fly really high.

4509
03:53:08,180 --> 03:53:10,180
They were trying to escape from an island.

4510
03:53:10,180 --> 03:53:11,180
No, I remember, I remember.

4511
03:53:11,180 --> 03:53:14,180
I think Icarus and his dad were trapped on an island where they tried to fly away from it.

4512
03:53:14,180 --> 03:53:18,180
They were trying to, they were trying to escape and they thought the only way out was through the air.

4513
03:53:18,180 --> 03:53:22,180
They made wings out of birds feathers and wax.

4514
03:53:22,180 --> 03:53:23,180
Yes.

4515
03:53:23,180 --> 03:53:26,180
And they flew, but then he was like, oh, this is great.

4516
03:53:26,180 --> 03:53:30,180
I'm going to fly to really high because I'm so cool.

4517
03:53:30,180 --> 03:53:32,180
I'm rainbow dash and then he got too close.

4518
03:53:32,180 --> 03:53:38,180
The Greeks didn't even know that like he doesn't get hotter when you go up in the sky.

4519
03:53:38,180 --> 03:53:39,180
Yeah.

4520
03:53:39,180 --> 03:53:44,180
Why do they think the birds are not like cooked when they come down?

4521
03:53:44,180 --> 03:53:46,180
They're close to the sun.

4522
03:53:46,180 --> 03:53:49,180
You can close to the sun because hot up there.

4523
03:53:49,180 --> 03:53:51,180
The sun's warm.

4524
03:53:51,180 --> 03:53:54,180
It makes sense, but they just didn't know.

4525
03:53:54,180 --> 03:53:55,180
They didn't understand.

4526
03:53:55,180 --> 03:53:59,180
Maybe they didn't bring candles on mountain expeditions in case they melted.

4527
03:53:59,180 --> 03:54:03,180
And that's why we don't talk about them anymore today because they were outdated.

4528
03:54:03,180 --> 03:54:06,180
Those Greeks, frankly, they're stupid.

4529
03:54:06,180 --> 03:54:09,180
They were so stupid and so embarrassing.

4530
03:54:09,180 --> 03:54:12,180
Nobody likes them.

4531
03:54:12,180 --> 03:54:16,180
Here's another Imgur link for you.

4532
03:54:16,180 --> 03:54:18,180
It's not loading in the chat, but.

4533
03:54:18,180 --> 03:54:19,180
I see it.

4534
03:54:19,180 --> 03:54:20,180
That's okay.

4535
03:54:20,180 --> 03:54:24,180
Ah, the Amazonian cat head, great on a toast.

4536
03:54:24,180 --> 03:54:28,180
See, the trick to these things is.

4537
03:54:28,180 --> 03:54:30,180
Oh, it's the dream.

4538
03:54:30,180 --> 03:54:32,180
It's the dream someone had.

4539
03:54:32,180 --> 03:54:34,180
Oh, from last episode.

4540
03:54:34,180 --> 03:54:37,180
Did someone have a dream that I got bit by a snake?

4541
03:54:37,180 --> 03:54:40,180
Like a cat-eared snake.

4542
03:54:40,180 --> 03:54:41,180
Great on a toast.

4543
03:54:41,180 --> 03:54:45,180
Great on a toast.

4544
03:54:45,180 --> 03:54:50,180
I mean, some people eat snake, I guess.

4545
03:54:50,180 --> 03:54:51,180
That's me.

4546
03:54:51,180 --> 03:54:55,180
Whenever I see any animal, I think that look, that would be delicious.

4547
03:54:55,180 --> 03:54:56,180
That thing looks tasty.

4548
03:54:56,180 --> 03:54:57,180
Get over here.

4549
03:54:57,180 --> 03:54:58,180
You little creature.

4550
03:54:58,180 --> 03:55:03,180
See the trick to these things.

4551
03:55:03,180 --> 03:55:04,180
Hubris.

4552
03:55:04,180 --> 03:55:06,180
I love it.

4553
03:55:06,180 --> 03:55:07,180
Exactly.

4554
03:55:07,180 --> 03:55:08,180
Can't get enough.

4555
03:55:08,180 --> 03:55:09,180
Exactly.

4556
03:55:09,180 --> 03:55:12,180
That's pretty good.

4557
03:55:12,180 --> 03:55:14,180
I got what I deserved.

4558
03:55:14,180 --> 03:55:17,180
Next one is called My Head Cannon.

4559
03:55:17,180 --> 03:55:19,180
Three, two, one, go.

4560
03:55:19,180 --> 03:55:24,180
Babe, babe, I'm sorry, but you can't come over for a while, okay?

4561
03:55:24,180 --> 03:55:31,180
The thing is, I don't know if you saw, but that guy, he gave me a really evil eye when

4562
03:55:31,180 --> 03:55:33,180
we were cooking together.

4563
03:55:33,180 --> 03:55:40,180
I get the feeling he's like the school shooter type that never got the chance to do it.

4564
03:55:40,180 --> 03:55:45,180
I feel like he's going to hurt me if he thinks I'm not a sigma male.

4565
03:55:45,180 --> 03:55:49,180
I think I got to show that I cook on my own as well.

4566
03:55:49,180 --> 03:55:56,180
Then I'll just pretend that I cook for myself all the time, and then he won't hurt me.

4567
03:55:56,180 --> 03:55:58,180
Then you can come back, okay?

4568
03:55:58,180 --> 03:55:59,180
Okay, babe, thanks.

4569
03:55:59,180 --> 03:56:00,180
Sorry.

4570
03:56:00,180 --> 03:56:01,180
Damn, that's true.

4571
03:56:01,180 --> 03:56:02,180
I can't believe.

4572
03:56:02,180 --> 03:56:03,180
That's right.

4573
03:56:03,180 --> 03:56:06,180
I can't believe I fell for it.

4574
03:56:06,180 --> 03:56:08,180
I can't believe a trick worked on me.

4575
03:56:08,180 --> 03:56:09,180
What the fuck?

4576
03:56:09,180 --> 03:56:11,180
Just let him cook, Ben.

4577
03:56:11,180 --> 03:56:12,180
You got to learn.

4578
03:56:12,180 --> 03:56:13,180
You just got to let him cook.

4579
03:56:13,180 --> 03:56:15,180
Well, I just got to let him cook.

4580
03:56:15,180 --> 03:56:17,180
That was my mistake.

4581
03:56:17,180 --> 03:56:18,180
Hang on.

4582
03:56:18,180 --> 03:56:23,180
I was just seeing him breaking bad recently where Walter says, let us cook.

4583
03:56:23,180 --> 03:56:25,180
I thought, is that where it's from?

4584
03:56:25,180 --> 03:56:26,180
I'm not sure.

4585
03:56:26,180 --> 03:56:28,180
Does he say let us cook or does he say let's cook?

4586
03:56:28,180 --> 03:56:30,180
He says, let us cook.

4587
03:56:30,180 --> 03:56:32,180
Like he's telling someone else to just let us cook.

4588
03:56:32,180 --> 03:56:39,180
Yeah, it's like when he kills Gale and he's the only chemist Gus Fring has left.

4589
03:56:39,180 --> 03:56:42,180
He says, come on, Gus, just let us cook.

4590
03:56:43,180 --> 03:56:44,180
We're cooking.

4591
03:56:44,180 --> 03:56:45,180
Yeah, you know, I was thinking too.

4592
03:56:45,180 --> 03:56:49,180
I'm not sure if let them cook is like a breaking bad reference.

4593
03:56:49,180 --> 03:56:53,180
It might be, but it could just as easily not be.

4594
03:56:53,180 --> 03:56:54,180
I'm not sure.

4595
03:56:54,180 --> 03:57:01,180
There is a point later in the show where like Jesse is cooking in Mexico.

4596
03:57:01,180 --> 03:57:05,180
Maybe they say let him cook there because he's...

4597
03:57:05,180 --> 03:57:11,180
Even if they don't actually say it, it could still be like what people think of when they

4598
03:57:11,180 --> 03:57:16,180
say it and it could be part of why it caught on.

4599
03:57:16,180 --> 03:57:19,180
Honestly, someone make a freaking video essay about it.

4600
03:57:19,180 --> 03:57:20,180
Or Google it.

4601
03:57:20,180 --> 03:57:22,180
One or the other.

4602
03:57:22,180 --> 03:57:23,180
Yeah, one or the other.

4603
03:57:23,180 --> 03:57:26,180
Either way, it doesn't matter to me.

4604
03:57:26,180 --> 03:57:33,180
Next one is called Head Cannon Continued 321 Go.

4605
03:57:33,180 --> 03:57:36,180
Oh God, I really have to speak this plan up.

4606
03:57:36,180 --> 03:57:41,180
I really have to make sure that he sees me fucking make my own schnitzel.

4607
03:57:41,180 --> 03:57:45,180
Because, babe, I think he just tried to poison me.

4608
03:57:45,180 --> 03:57:49,180
He put fucking citric acid in my cereal.

4609
03:57:49,180 --> 03:57:53,180
I thought I was going to die.

4610
03:57:53,180 --> 03:57:59,180
What if next time he put cyanide in my milk or something?

4611
03:57:59,180 --> 03:58:05,180
I was going for the cyanide, but I got the citric acid instead.

4612
03:58:05,180 --> 03:58:07,180
This guy's a menace.

4613
03:58:07,180 --> 03:58:08,180
Next time.

4614
03:58:08,180 --> 03:58:10,180
He's probably called Dennis.

4615
03:58:13,180 --> 03:58:16,180
Alright, next one is another Imgurlink.

4616
03:58:16,180 --> 03:58:23,180
Oh, if you want my comic, you can read it, but you'll have to find it first.

4617
03:58:23,180 --> 03:58:25,180
Did I say that this was found?

4618
03:58:25,180 --> 03:58:28,180
Yes, you mentioned on your stream and then I went and found it.

4619
03:58:28,180 --> 03:58:32,180
I went to the site and I read every single one.

4620
03:58:32,180 --> 03:58:34,180
Actually, I read a bunch of them.

4621
03:58:34,180 --> 03:58:37,180
I think there's too many to read.

4622
03:58:37,180 --> 03:58:40,180
Do they continue into the current day?

4623
03:58:40,180 --> 03:58:41,180
I don't even know.

4624
03:58:41,180 --> 03:58:43,180
I didn't actually go and read them.

4625
03:58:43,180 --> 03:58:44,180
There's a bunch.

4626
03:58:44,180 --> 03:58:47,180
There's really, really a lot of funny ones.

4627
03:58:47,180 --> 03:58:55,180
Someone called RustinRobot went and found it and it is called Jennifer's Show.

4628
03:58:55,180 --> 03:59:00,180
J-E-N-N-F-E-R.

4629
03:59:01,180 --> 03:59:06,180
It's the person who makes them calls herself Jennifer J.

4630
03:59:06,180 --> 03:59:12,180
The non-cat girl is Jennifer and I think the cat girl is J.

4631
03:59:12,180 --> 03:59:16,180
Something like that, but anyway, yeah, Jennifer's Show.

4632
03:59:16,180 --> 03:59:18,180
It's just a comic about-

4633
03:59:18,180 --> 03:59:19,180
They have a YouTube channel.

4634
03:59:19,180 --> 03:59:28,180
They have a YouTube channel and it's a comic about these two characters who are in lesbians with each other.

4635
03:59:28,180 --> 03:59:29,180
They're in lesbians with each other, yes.

4636
03:59:29,180 --> 03:59:37,180
And they have huge boobies and it's just wholesome and that's it.

4637
03:59:37,180 --> 03:59:42,180
Sometimes it's funny in an unintentional way and sometimes it's funny in a deliberate way,

4638
03:59:42,180 --> 03:59:48,180
but the joke is very odd and that makes it funny in a different way.

4639
03:59:48,180 --> 03:59:51,180
There was a really good one.

4640
03:59:51,180 --> 03:59:58,180
A spork posted a really good one in my server that was like,

4641
03:59:58,180 --> 04:00:03,180
Jennifer drinking wine and being like, bring the popcorn, honey.

4642
04:00:03,180 --> 04:00:05,180
It's time for the Kiwi Farms.

4643
04:00:05,180 --> 04:00:13,180
Time to watch the movie of our Kiwi Farms thread roasting us again and it was pretty funny.

4644
04:00:14,180 --> 04:00:21,180
It's like being made by someone who is not good at drawing.

4645
04:00:21,180 --> 04:00:28,180
I love how so many spelling errors all the time.

4646
04:00:28,180 --> 04:00:30,180
Yeah, yeah.

4647
04:00:30,180 --> 04:00:35,180
It just makes it seem more like a deliberate parody and it just is not.

4648
04:00:35,180 --> 04:00:39,180
It does seem almost like a deliberate parody.

4649
04:00:39,180 --> 04:00:44,180
Here's the one that I'm talking about.

4650
04:00:44,180 --> 04:00:48,180
It looks like she's drinking iodine or something.

4651
04:00:48,180 --> 04:00:51,180
So basically we found the one piece.

4652
04:00:51,180 --> 04:00:55,180
Yeah, we found it and now I can read it.

4653
04:00:55,180 --> 04:00:57,180
I'm crying in this image.

4654
04:00:57,180 --> 04:01:01,180
Quick, Jen, get the popcorn soda, the drunk movie night,

4655
04:01:01,180 --> 04:01:07,180
goaning to start in Seven Min over at Kiwi Farms Discord page.

4656
04:01:07,180 --> 04:01:10,180
True.

4657
04:01:10,180 --> 04:01:15,180
This person is a little weird.

4658
04:01:15,180 --> 04:01:18,180
Their YouTube channel is a little bit unsettling.

4659
04:01:18,180 --> 04:01:21,180
Yeah, I didn't really watch any of their vlogs.

4660
04:01:21,180 --> 04:01:26,180
Yeah, I didn't really want to watch much of it,

4661
04:01:26,180 --> 04:01:34,180
but it's a couple of very strange videos of her in a huge stuffed shirt

4662
04:01:34,180 --> 04:01:39,180
with some fake glasses that kind of look like the ones she draws,

4663
04:01:39,180 --> 04:01:45,180
big oval pieces of cardboard or construction paper,

4664
04:01:45,180 --> 04:01:54,180
just waving around, just flopping around and looking a bit awkward.

4665
04:01:55,180 --> 04:01:58,180
There was a few that were just like,

4666
04:01:58,180 --> 04:02:02,180
this is like a sweet brown hella Jeff comic.

4667
04:02:02,180 --> 04:02:06,180
It's not even slightly dissimilar.

4668
04:02:06,180 --> 04:02:09,180
It's exactly what a sweet brown hella Jeff comic would be

4669
04:02:09,180 --> 04:02:12,180
just with less NS paint fuckery.

4670
04:02:12,180 --> 04:02:18,180
But the methods of drawing, sometimes with outlines,

4671
04:02:19,180 --> 04:02:25,180
sometimes they'll use a slanted pen that use for calligraphy.

4672
04:02:25,180 --> 04:02:32,180
Sometimes it'll just be with photographs as the backgrounds.

4673
04:02:32,180 --> 04:02:36,180
It's just great.

4674
04:02:36,180 --> 04:02:37,180
I love it.

4675
04:02:37,180 --> 04:02:38,180
It is.

4676
04:02:38,180 --> 04:02:42,180
It kind of is great, but it's definitely done.

4677
04:02:42,180 --> 04:02:45,180
There's no irony to it at all.

4678
04:02:45,180 --> 04:02:49,180
It's not done in a knowing wink wink ha ha way.

4679
04:02:49,180 --> 04:02:51,180
It's meant completely sincerely.

4680
04:02:51,180 --> 04:02:53,180
Yeah, it's amazing.

4681
04:02:53,180 --> 04:02:56,180
It is kind of amazing.

4682
04:02:56,180 --> 04:03:00,180
I actually should probably go and read through some just to see.

4683
04:03:00,180 --> 04:03:03,180
I haven't done that yet, but it's been found.

4684
04:03:03,180 --> 04:03:05,180
Resting Robot found it.

4685
04:03:05,180 --> 04:03:06,180
Appreciate it.

4686
04:03:06,180 --> 04:03:09,180
Mystery solved.

4687
04:03:09,180 --> 04:03:13,180
Good illustration here, though.

4688
04:03:13,180 --> 04:03:14,180
Good joke.

4689
04:03:14,180 --> 04:03:15,180
All right.

4690
04:03:15,180 --> 04:03:18,180
Next one is an Imgur album.

4691
04:03:18,180 --> 04:03:20,180
Let's freaking go.

4692
04:03:20,180 --> 04:03:22,180
Let's freaking go.

4693
04:03:22,180 --> 04:03:29,180
Oh, it's a Mega Man G Fuel blue bomber slushie.

4694
04:03:29,180 --> 04:03:31,180
As an energy drink.

4695
04:03:31,180 --> 04:03:33,180
I've seen this before.

4696
04:03:33,180 --> 04:03:36,180
I think it's just the flavor is called slushie.

4697
04:03:36,180 --> 04:03:38,180
Like it's not actually a slushie.

4698
04:03:39,180 --> 04:03:44,180
I guess you'd need it to be ice in a can.

4699
04:03:44,180 --> 04:03:50,180
I saw this when I was looking for that e-tank cup that I bought to drink out of.

4700
04:03:50,180 --> 04:03:56,180
I did see this and I considered buying some just to see what it tastes like, but it didn't.

4701
04:03:56,180 --> 04:03:59,180
I wonder if this person actually found it in Walmart.

4702
04:03:59,180 --> 04:04:04,180
If this person actually found it in Walmart like in current year, I'd be shocked.

4703
04:04:04,180 --> 04:04:13,180
And I would think that was amazing if it were like still being sold.

4704
04:04:13,180 --> 04:04:15,180
Maybe.

4705
04:04:15,180 --> 04:04:17,180
They're making a new Mega Man.

4706
04:04:17,180 --> 04:04:21,180
They're making a new one with the highest budget ever.

4707
04:04:21,180 --> 04:04:24,180
Who knows what it'll be.

4708
04:04:24,180 --> 04:04:32,180
Next one is called four skin forever or in my case 10 in one half skin.

4709
04:04:33,180 --> 04:04:37,180
Why is it always four skin coming back to the show?

4710
04:04:37,180 --> 04:04:39,180
Wait, it's not playing.

4711
04:04:39,180 --> 04:04:40,180
It's not playing for me either.

4712
04:04:40,180 --> 04:04:43,180
I think it's because they know it annoys me.

4713
04:04:43,180 --> 04:04:45,180
Okay, it's playing.

4714
04:04:45,180 --> 04:04:48,180
Hey, dude.

4715
04:04:48,180 --> 04:04:56,180
I was just listening to your podcast and I heard this funny voicemail about regrowing your four skin.

4716
04:04:56,180 --> 04:05:00,180
You know how dudes like gauge their ears and stuff?

4717
04:05:00,180 --> 04:05:19,180
Well, basically you could gauge your four skin, not with like an ear gauge hole gap, but like a disc that will stretch your skin so that it can basically become longer and more pronounced like how you would with your ear lobes.

4718
04:05:19,180 --> 04:05:22,180
But instead of your ear lobes, it's your four skin.

4719
04:05:22,180 --> 04:05:24,180
Try it out, dude.

4720
04:05:24,180 --> 04:05:27,180
I got a sweet 10 and a half inches right now.

4721
04:05:27,180 --> 04:05:29,180
I mean.

4722
04:05:30,180 --> 04:05:32,180
Congratulations.

4723
04:05:32,180 --> 04:05:34,180
Just keep going.

4724
04:05:34,180 --> 04:05:35,180
Stretching.

4725
04:05:35,180 --> 04:05:40,180
It's like jelking, but just the skin, not the whole dick.

4726
04:05:40,180 --> 04:05:42,180
Yeah.

4727
04:05:42,180 --> 04:05:45,180
You know about jelking, right?

4728
04:05:45,180 --> 04:05:46,180
I think so.

4729
04:05:46,180 --> 04:05:50,180
Is that like a suction pump penis thing?

4730
04:05:50,180 --> 04:05:52,180
No, it's like a thing.

4731
04:05:52,180 --> 04:05:55,180
It's like a technique.

4732
04:05:55,180 --> 04:06:03,180
It's like a thing you do to basically stretch your dick out.

4733
04:06:03,180 --> 04:06:06,180
You basically damage your dick a little bit.

4734
04:06:06,180 --> 04:06:19,180
You fucking squeeze it in a way that causes it to be damaged a little bit and then when it heals, it theoretically lengthens it.

4735
04:06:19,180 --> 04:06:29,180
It's like you like freaking squeeze and stretch it to the point that it like causes harm and then it heals and maybe it gets longer.

4736
04:06:29,180 --> 04:06:30,180
Yeah.

4737
04:06:30,180 --> 04:06:31,180
And that's jelking.

4738
04:06:31,180 --> 04:06:37,180
That's a weird, like I remember seeing it as like a thing discussed, but it looked shady and scary.

4739
04:06:37,180 --> 04:06:39,180
So like I don't want to look at it.

4740
04:06:39,180 --> 04:06:42,180
I've heard people say that, yeah, it's not good for it.

4741
04:06:42,180 --> 04:06:45,180
I think it's an act of desperation.

4742
04:06:45,180 --> 04:06:54,180
It might work to a degree, but like probably at what cost, I think is the question.

4743
04:06:54,180 --> 04:07:06,180
It's just like, if there is like an increase, it would be very minor, like minuscule to the point where it really is not worth the effort.

4744
04:07:06,180 --> 04:07:07,180
I learned.

4745
04:07:07,180 --> 04:07:11,180
You can't gain an inch from like a weird technique like that.

4746
04:07:11,180 --> 04:07:13,180
That just doesn't know how it works.

4747
04:07:14,180 --> 04:07:17,180
I doubt it.

4748
04:07:17,180 --> 04:07:19,180
I learned from Little Joel recently.

4749
04:07:19,180 --> 04:07:20,180
Did you watch Little Joel?

4750
04:07:20,180 --> 04:07:21,180
Oh, yeah.

4751
04:07:21,180 --> 04:07:22,180
Love Little Joel.

4752
04:07:22,180 --> 04:07:27,180
Did you see the one about the lady that cut the guy's dick off?

4753
04:07:27,180 --> 04:07:29,180
Yeah.

4754
04:07:29,180 --> 04:07:30,180
Okay.

4755
04:07:30,180 --> 04:07:34,180
Well, I'll say it for the audience's benefit, I'll say that I learned from that.

4756
04:07:34,180 --> 04:07:42,180
Yeah, that lady that cut her like rapist husband's dick off, he got the dick repaired.

4757
04:07:42,180 --> 04:07:50,180
But then he went back to have her dick surgically enlarged and the dick enlargement surgery destroyed his dick.

4758
04:07:50,180 --> 04:07:51,180
Yeah.

4759
04:07:51,180 --> 04:07:54,180
He wasn't having the dick cut off by his wife that destroyed his dick.

4760
04:07:54,180 --> 04:07:58,180
It was his, what's the word?

4761
04:07:58,180 --> 04:08:08,180
His elective dupenus lengthening surgery, complications from it resulted in total dick destruction.

4762
04:08:08,180 --> 04:08:13,180
Why would you fucking, why would you play with fire after all that?

4763
04:08:13,180 --> 04:08:14,180
I know.

4764
04:08:14,180 --> 04:08:15,180
He was so close.

4765
04:08:15,180 --> 04:08:16,180
He must have felt invincible.

4766
04:08:16,180 --> 04:08:18,180
He was like, haha, nothing can destroy my dick.

4767
04:08:18,180 --> 04:08:20,180
If it lived through that, it can live through anything.

4768
04:08:20,180 --> 04:08:21,180
Foolish.

4769
04:08:21,180 --> 04:08:22,180
Foolish.

4770
04:08:22,180 --> 04:08:29,180
Like you could just take it off and then add another length of different penis and then stick the other one on.

4771
04:08:29,180 --> 04:08:32,180
Like you're building a block tower.

4772
04:08:32,180 --> 04:08:34,180
You got to get a donor.

4773
04:08:34,180 --> 04:08:36,180
You got to find someone with compatible blood type.

4774
04:08:36,180 --> 04:08:40,180
He'll donate most of their penis and you chop your dick.

4775
04:08:40,180 --> 04:08:42,180
Well, that's one way.

4776
04:08:42,180 --> 04:08:48,180
You could find a dick donor to chop off an inch of their dick to insert in yours, in the middle section.

4777
04:08:48,180 --> 04:08:54,180
Alternatively, I mean, why don't they just do, actually, it kind of is what they do.

4778
04:08:54,180 --> 04:08:59,180
When people like, the thing where they put the thing in their leg and it lengthens their leg bones.

4779
04:08:59,180 --> 04:09:00,180
That's kind of like jelking.

4780
04:09:00,180 --> 04:09:02,180
That's kind of like jelking their leg.

4781
04:09:02,180 --> 04:09:03,180
Jelking their bones.

4782
04:09:03,180 --> 04:09:04,180
Why don't they do that with their dick?

4783
04:09:04,180 --> 04:09:10,180
Why don't they put a freaking brace in their dick that they crank it every day and it lengthens their dick?

4784
04:09:10,180 --> 04:09:12,180
Because it's not a bone.

4785
04:09:12,180 --> 04:09:14,180
No.

4786
04:09:14,180 --> 04:09:18,180
It seems like it would actually be even easier to do if it wasn't a bone.

4787
04:09:18,180 --> 04:09:26,180
No, but like it's like soft tissue, soft tissue that stretched to a damaging degree would also heal.

4788
04:09:26,180 --> 04:09:28,180
Well, maybe.

4789
04:09:28,180 --> 04:09:30,180
I kind of feel like that.

4790
04:09:30,180 --> 04:09:36,180
I feel like if jelking works, that would work even better.

4791
04:09:36,180 --> 04:09:37,180
Super jelking.

4792
04:09:37,180 --> 04:09:43,180
A brace on your dick that you crank a little bit, you crank it a little bit every day.

4793
04:09:43,180 --> 04:09:50,180
You do that for like several months and you let it heal and your dick's longer at the end.

4794
04:09:50,180 --> 04:09:51,180
I don't know.

4795
04:09:51,180 --> 04:09:52,180
I don't see.

4796
04:09:52,180 --> 04:09:57,180
If jelking works, if leg lengthening works, why not on the dick?

4797
04:09:57,180 --> 04:10:07,180
Because I think it's the fact that the bone, when it grows back in smaller increments, it's more rigid.

4798
04:10:07,180 --> 04:10:09,180
It's a fixed thing.

4799
04:10:09,180 --> 04:10:16,180
Your bone can't shrink back to the size it was before because there's just more mass there and it's harder.

4800
04:10:16,180 --> 04:10:17,180
It's different.

4801
04:10:17,180 --> 04:10:22,180
I just feel like it's different than your penis.

4802
04:10:24,180 --> 04:10:26,180
That kind of makes sense.

4803
04:10:26,180 --> 04:10:27,180
You might be onto something.

4804
04:10:27,180 --> 04:10:31,180
Because the whole thing with the penis is that it's like a balloon.

4805
04:10:31,180 --> 04:10:35,180
It can shrink and then it can fill with blood.

4806
04:10:35,180 --> 04:10:41,180
Stretching it doesn't necessarily increase the area that the cells.

4807
04:10:41,180 --> 04:10:43,180
Maybe it rips certain things inside.

4808
04:10:43,180 --> 04:10:55,180
I feel like if you very slowly extended it with a brace, then at some point the tension of the stretch would be traumatic.

4809
04:10:55,180 --> 04:11:03,180
But if you very gradually increased that, the trauma would be introduced gradually and then it would heal.

4810
04:11:03,180 --> 04:11:18,180
It would heal itself while in that stretch state and it would heal itself with additional mass or length in order to close up the traumatic micro-fishers.

4811
04:11:18,180 --> 04:11:19,180
I don't know.

4812
04:11:19,180 --> 04:11:21,180
It's so fucked.

4813
04:11:21,180 --> 04:11:24,180
Get me a freaking doctor on the line.

4814
04:11:24,180 --> 04:11:25,180
Get me the freaking patent office.

4815
04:11:25,180 --> 04:11:28,180
Get me the Guinness Book of World Records for longest dick.

4816
04:11:28,180 --> 04:11:29,180
I'm going to have it soon.

4817
04:11:29,180 --> 04:11:30,180
I'm going to use my method.

4818
04:11:30,180 --> 04:11:38,180
Did you know, Ben, that you can apply like a gel, testosterone gel, and that makes your penis grow.

4819
04:11:38,180 --> 04:11:43,180
It's temporary, but they do that sometimes before.

4820
04:11:43,180 --> 04:11:45,180
Testosterone gel.

4821
04:11:45,180 --> 04:11:50,180
Yeah, because it's a hormone-based organ.

4822
04:11:50,180 --> 04:11:58,180
When you take estrogen, it shrinks a little bit and testosterone makes it grow.

4823
04:11:58,180 --> 04:11:59,180
Like how much?

4824
04:11:59,180 --> 04:12:10,180
I don't know how much exactly, but I've heard that before some trans women have the surgery to turn their penis into a vagina.

4825
04:12:10,180 --> 04:12:13,180
Oh, they put testosterone on it to make it bigger so it's easier to-

4826
04:12:13,180 --> 04:12:19,180
Yeah, because it makes more mass in the penis so that when you invert it,

4827
04:12:19,180 --> 04:12:24,180
it's deeper as a vagina because that's what they do.

4828
04:12:24,180 --> 04:12:29,180
Well, but hang on though, then wouldn't it shrink again afterwards?

4829
04:12:29,180 --> 04:12:30,180
I don't know.

4830
04:12:30,180 --> 04:12:37,180
I think once they tear it to shreds, it acts a little differently.

4831
04:12:37,180 --> 04:12:45,180
They cut it into sections and then invert it so that it's the linings of a vagina.

4832
04:12:46,180 --> 04:12:51,180
But like you said, it's a temporary increase, so the amount of mass-

4833
04:12:51,180 --> 04:12:59,180
I could understand if you made it bigger just so it's easier to manipulate surgically the pieces of it.

4834
04:12:59,180 --> 04:13:09,180
When I say it's temporary, I think what they mean is you add the hormone and it responds to the hormone,

4835
04:13:09,180 --> 04:13:13,180
but then it will revert to whatever level it was before.

4836
04:13:13,180 --> 04:13:15,180
I know, but that's what I'm saying.

4837
04:13:15,180 --> 04:13:19,180
Once it's been surgically changed, it no longer reacts to anything, it's just-

4838
04:13:19,180 --> 04:13:23,180
But it's the same tissue.

4839
04:13:23,180 --> 04:13:25,180
I don't know how it works.

4840
04:13:25,180 --> 04:13:31,180
I'm just saying I've heard that that's a thing that is done.

4841
04:13:31,180 --> 04:13:33,180
It makes sense.

4842
04:13:33,180 --> 04:13:41,180
I could see a surgeon just having an easier time chopping and slapping it, so to speak,

4843
04:13:41,180 --> 04:13:43,180
if it's just bigger.

4844
04:13:43,180 --> 04:13:47,180
It's more room to work with or whatever.

4845
04:13:47,180 --> 04:13:51,180
More specifically, I heard it was like changes the depth.

4846
04:13:59,180 --> 04:14:03,180
You don't have to rip it and tear it and crank it.

4847
04:14:03,180 --> 04:14:06,180
Put it in a freaking immersion blender.

4848
04:14:06,180 --> 04:14:12,180
Put it down the freaking garbage disposal.

4849
04:14:12,180 --> 04:14:16,180
I actually don't know what happens when a man takes extra testosterone.

4850
04:14:16,180 --> 04:14:18,180
It's probably not that good for them.

4851
04:14:18,180 --> 04:14:26,180
People do it, like older men do it, to maintain muscle mass, I think,

4852
04:14:26,180 --> 04:14:30,180
because I think when men get older, they produce less testosterone,

4853
04:14:30,180 --> 04:14:34,180
so I think older men supplement with it to keep themselves more muscular.

4854
04:14:34,180 --> 04:14:38,180
That's an old person thing just generally.

4855
04:14:38,180 --> 04:14:40,180
Yeah.

4856
04:14:40,180 --> 04:14:42,180
Just taking testosterone?

4857
04:14:42,180 --> 04:14:44,180
Even women?

4858
04:14:44,180 --> 04:14:48,180
No, I mean hormone production slows, so they need supplements.

4859
04:14:48,180 --> 04:14:50,180
Definitely.

4860
04:14:50,180 --> 04:14:54,180
I think some people do it.

4861
04:14:54,180 --> 04:15:00,180
I don't think it gives you any steroidal benefits.

4862
04:15:00,180 --> 04:15:04,180
I don't think if you just take extra testosterone, you get buffer or anything.

4863
04:15:04,180 --> 04:15:06,180
No.

4864
04:15:06,180 --> 04:15:08,180
Maybe you do that.

4865
04:15:08,180 --> 04:15:12,180
I think some people do take it, but I don't know if it has any benefits

4866
04:15:12,180 --> 04:15:16,180
unless you're already deficient.

4867
04:15:18,180 --> 04:15:20,180
There's one more voicemail.

4868
04:15:20,180 --> 04:15:22,180
Oh my god.

4869
04:15:22,180 --> 04:15:24,180
It's an image.

4870
04:15:24,180 --> 04:15:26,180
Here we go.

4871
04:15:26,180 --> 04:15:32,180
Can I mention the growing you'll be receiving?

4872
04:15:32,180 --> 04:15:36,180
Oh, this is AI upscaled?

4873
04:15:36,180 --> 04:15:40,180
We're just anime-ified.

4874
04:15:40,180 --> 04:15:42,180
These styles are so different.

4875
04:15:42,180 --> 04:15:44,180
These have got to be AI.

4876
04:15:44,180 --> 04:15:46,180
Yeah, yeah.

4877
04:15:46,180 --> 04:15:50,180
They're like four eye face.

4878
04:15:50,180 --> 04:15:52,180
Wait, is it?

4879
04:15:52,180 --> 04:15:54,180
I feel like the second image.

4880
04:15:54,180 --> 04:15:58,180
The second image, I mean, yeah, it's clearly weird.

4881
04:15:58,180 --> 04:16:04,180
Why did it interpret her having an arm pointing to you or the cat?

4882
04:16:04,180 --> 04:16:08,180
It's her tail, I think.

4883
04:16:08,180 --> 04:16:12,180
It's clearly just like struggling to interpret this figure.

4884
04:16:12,180 --> 04:16:14,180
It made it more legible, though.

4885
04:16:14,180 --> 04:16:16,180
It made it more sensical.

4886
04:16:16,180 --> 04:16:18,180
That's funny.

4887
04:16:18,180 --> 04:16:20,180
Yeah, I don't...

4888
04:16:20,180 --> 04:16:24,180
I don't know, the workings of it are mysterious to me.

4889
04:16:24,180 --> 04:16:28,180
Okay, this cake in the bottom,

4890
04:16:28,180 --> 04:16:32,180
I like the weird candy color fruit.

4891
04:16:32,180 --> 04:16:35,180
The blue raspberries?

4892
04:16:35,180 --> 04:16:38,180
It's like neon green something.

4893
04:16:38,180 --> 04:16:42,180
It's extremely fake looking fruits on this cake.

4894
04:16:42,180 --> 04:16:45,180
I want this cake, I want it.

4895
04:16:45,180 --> 04:16:47,180
The hand disappears.

4896
04:16:48,180 --> 04:16:51,180
The hand just disappears into the plate.

4897
04:16:51,180 --> 04:16:54,180
It struggles so much with the hands.

4898
04:16:54,180 --> 04:16:58,180
It works in the middle one because it just didn't bother giving them fingers.

4899
04:16:58,180 --> 04:17:00,180
Yeah.

4900
04:17:00,180 --> 04:17:04,180
How did it interpret me as a cat girl?

4901
04:17:04,180 --> 04:17:09,180
Okay, I think this is just an AI that is designed to turn anything into a cat girl.

4902
04:17:09,180 --> 04:17:11,180
I think that's what this is.

4903
04:17:11,180 --> 04:17:13,180
Yeah, it's odd, I'm not sure.

4904
04:17:13,180 --> 04:17:15,180
I have not seen this before.

4905
04:17:15,180 --> 04:17:19,180
The face in the first one just rules.

4906
04:17:19,180 --> 04:17:21,180
Like both faces?

4907
04:17:21,180 --> 04:17:25,180
In the first one up top, my big polygonal mouth.

4908
04:17:25,180 --> 04:17:27,180
Yeah, that's artistic.

4909
04:17:27,180 --> 04:17:29,180
That's awesome.

4910
04:17:29,180 --> 04:17:33,180
But then the girl is like an alien, like a bug person.

4911
04:17:33,180 --> 04:17:38,180
This is what's good about AI interpolation,

4912
04:17:38,180 --> 04:17:43,180
is when it just makes some fucking weird shit.

4913
04:17:43,180 --> 04:17:45,180
Bizarre.

4914
04:17:45,180 --> 04:17:47,180
I like how on the bottom one,

4915
04:17:47,180 --> 04:17:50,180
they've turned you into a big booby anime lady,

4916
04:17:50,180 --> 04:17:53,180
but they've also, where your hand is, they've just drawn a circle.

4917
04:17:53,180 --> 04:17:55,180
Because they don't know what that is.

4918
04:17:55,180 --> 04:17:57,180
What is that?

4919
04:17:57,180 --> 04:17:59,180
What does it think that is?

4920
04:17:59,180 --> 04:18:01,180
Like another person's head?

4921
04:18:01,180 --> 04:18:04,180
Is that some boob poking out of a hole in the fabric?

4922
04:18:04,180 --> 04:18:06,180
I don't think so.

4923
04:18:06,180 --> 04:18:08,180
Does it just turn my hand into a hole?

4924
04:18:08,180 --> 04:18:10,180
It just turns your hand into a-

4925
04:18:10,180 --> 04:18:12,180
Hand like a hole!

4926
04:18:12,180 --> 04:18:14,180
It turns your soul.

4927
04:18:14,180 --> 04:18:16,180
And it's got a little bit of hair.

4928
04:18:16,180 --> 04:18:18,180
Wait, wait.

4929
04:18:18,180 --> 04:18:20,180
Or is that the hair from the top?

4930
04:18:20,180 --> 04:18:22,180
I think that's just...

4931
04:18:22,180 --> 04:18:25,180
Well, I mean, to me, that just reads as my long hair

4932
04:18:25,180 --> 04:18:27,180
kind of going down my back.

4933
04:18:27,180 --> 04:18:29,180
I like that it...

4934
04:18:29,180 --> 04:18:31,180
Like what is it, that middle cake?

4935
04:18:31,180 --> 04:18:34,180
Where did that middle cake come from?

4936
04:18:34,180 --> 04:18:36,180
I wonder if it's like saying,

4937
04:18:36,180 --> 04:18:39,180
oh, there's cake here, therefore there's cake everywhere.

4938
04:18:39,180 --> 04:18:43,180
Therefore, anything else, we must interpret it as cake.

4939
04:18:45,180 --> 04:18:47,180
Yeah, but why?

4940
04:18:47,180 --> 04:18:50,180
There's nothing under your hand that could be a cake.

4941
04:18:50,180 --> 04:18:52,180
Yeah, there's nothing there.

4942
04:18:52,180 --> 04:18:54,180
There's just a little bit of white, and it's like,

4943
04:18:54,180 --> 04:18:56,180
well, it must be some cake.

4944
04:18:56,180 --> 04:18:58,180
He must be reaching for some cake.

4945
04:19:00,180 --> 04:19:03,180
Also, why is the cat has blue hair in the middle one?

4946
04:19:03,180 --> 04:19:05,180
Why did they give the cat blue hair?

4947
04:19:05,180 --> 04:19:07,180
They gave the cat purple hair.

4948
04:19:08,180 --> 04:19:10,180
There's weird logic at play.

4949
04:19:10,180 --> 04:19:15,180
And it's also weird because the perspective

4950
04:19:15,180 --> 04:19:18,180
is slightly different, and...

4951
04:19:18,180 --> 04:19:20,180
Well, maybe not that different.

4952
04:19:20,180 --> 04:19:22,180
Actually, the lines on the floor are very similar,

4953
04:19:22,180 --> 04:19:25,180
but you, as a cat person, are a lot closer

4954
04:19:25,180 --> 04:19:28,180
than the image of you.

4955
04:19:28,180 --> 04:19:31,180
Why did they notice that you are a figure there

4956
04:19:31,180 --> 04:19:35,180
and then increase your size to be closer?

4957
04:19:36,180 --> 04:19:42,180
Yeah, it's like taking the image

4958
04:19:42,180 --> 04:19:44,180
and it's like recognizing figures,

4959
04:19:44,180 --> 04:19:48,180
and then it's like creating new figures on top of them,

4960
04:19:48,180 --> 04:19:54,180
but in a way that distorts it towards some ideal,

4961
04:19:54,180 --> 04:19:58,180
towards some specific sort of image

4962
04:19:58,180 --> 04:20:01,180
that it wants to make out of anything.

4963
04:20:02,180 --> 04:20:05,180
I don't know.

4964
04:20:05,180 --> 04:20:08,180
It just thinks that the figure should be closer.

4965
04:20:11,180 --> 04:20:12,180
I can't...

4966
04:20:12,180 --> 04:20:14,180
I'm trying to make sense of it.

4967
04:20:14,180 --> 04:20:16,180
Your cat face is so fucked.

4968
04:20:16,180 --> 04:20:18,180
It looks like it's Uboa.

4969
04:20:18,180 --> 04:20:19,180
It's Uboa.

4970
04:20:19,180 --> 04:20:20,180
Uboa?

4971
04:20:20,180 --> 04:20:22,180
Yeah, you know the...

4972
04:20:22,180 --> 04:20:23,180
Hang on.

4973
04:20:24,180 --> 04:20:27,180
From Yumi Nikki.

4974
04:20:27,180 --> 04:20:29,180
Yumi Nikki.

4975
04:20:30,180 --> 04:20:32,180
It's this...

4976
04:20:32,180 --> 04:20:35,180
Oh, yeah, a little bit.

4977
04:20:35,180 --> 04:20:38,180
Yeah, Uboa cat.

4978
04:20:39,180 --> 04:20:41,180
That's me.

4979
04:20:41,180 --> 04:20:44,180
This image is titled Not So Pog,

4980
04:20:44,180 --> 04:20:45,180
but it's a little pog.

4981
04:20:45,180 --> 04:20:46,180
Yeah, it's pretty pog.

4982
04:20:46,180 --> 04:20:49,180
I am pogging a bit, actually.

4983
04:20:50,180 --> 04:20:52,180
Also, okay, the first one,

4984
04:20:52,180 --> 04:20:54,180
look at my eyebrow.

4985
04:20:54,180 --> 04:20:57,180
Look at what it gave me for my eyebrow forehead.

4986
04:20:58,180 --> 04:20:59,180
Yeah, it's like...

4987
04:20:59,180 --> 04:21:01,180
It gave me like a huge caveman brow.

4988
04:21:03,180 --> 04:21:04,180
Perfect.

4989
04:21:04,180 --> 04:21:06,180
You got like curly hair coming down.

4990
04:21:06,180 --> 04:21:07,180
Yeah.

4991
04:21:08,180 --> 04:21:11,180
I kind of look like a Pokemon trainer.

4992
04:21:11,180 --> 04:21:14,180
Yeah, like a Pokemon trainer or a professor.

4993
04:21:14,180 --> 04:21:15,180
Yeah.

4994
04:21:16,180 --> 04:21:20,180
But also with like crazy freaking like color swatches

4995
04:21:20,180 --> 04:21:22,180
for my eye holes.

4996
04:21:23,180 --> 04:21:24,180
I'm having fun.

4997
04:21:24,180 --> 04:21:26,180
This is a fun generation.

4998
04:21:29,180 --> 04:21:30,180
Love it.

4999
04:21:31,180 --> 04:21:32,180
Very confusing.

5000
04:21:34,180 --> 04:21:36,180
Makes me just gotta say...

5001
04:21:36,180 --> 04:21:38,180
All I can do is speculate and wonder why.

5002
04:21:38,180 --> 04:21:39,180
Why did it...

5003
04:21:40,180 --> 04:21:41,180
Why did this have to happen?

5004
04:21:41,180 --> 04:21:42,180
Oh, okay.

5005
04:21:42,180 --> 04:21:43,180
Last thing...

5006
04:21:45,180 --> 04:21:47,180
Yeah, it turned the mall

5007
04:21:47,180 --> 04:21:50,180
into like a traditional Japanese like dojo.

5008
04:21:50,180 --> 04:21:52,180
It's got like the sliding Japanese doors.

5009
04:21:52,180 --> 04:21:53,180
Yeah.

5010
04:21:54,180 --> 04:21:57,180
It's just like making everything into Japanese cat girls, this one.

5011
04:21:57,180 --> 04:22:01,180
Like that must be like specifically what this one is for.

5012
04:22:01,180 --> 04:22:05,180
Maybe this is not just put the image in and it'll interpret it.

5013
04:22:05,180 --> 04:22:11,180
Maybe the person added things like an explanation to go along with it.

5014
04:22:11,180 --> 04:22:13,180
Or maybe just like with the cake, right?

5015
04:22:13,180 --> 04:22:17,180
It recognized that there was cake and so it added more cake in other places.

5016
04:22:17,180 --> 04:22:20,180
Maybe it recognized the cat ears on the one girl

5017
04:22:20,180 --> 04:22:22,180
and so it just gave everyone cat ears.

5018
04:22:22,180 --> 04:22:25,180
Yeah, that's probably what I thought.

5019
04:22:25,180 --> 04:22:29,180
Also, the cat girl in the middle has three ears.

5020
04:22:29,180 --> 04:22:31,180
Yes, I noticed that.

5021
04:22:31,180 --> 04:22:34,180
She's got the two black ones and the one blue one.

5022
04:22:34,180 --> 04:22:37,180
Like it didn't quite know which angle to go with.

5023
04:22:37,180 --> 04:22:39,180
So it just went with both.

5024
04:22:44,180 --> 04:22:45,180
Delightful.

5025
04:22:45,180 --> 04:22:46,180
Yeah.

5026
04:22:46,180 --> 04:22:48,180
That's the end of the voicemails.

5027
04:22:49,180 --> 04:22:50,180
All right.

5028
04:22:53,180 --> 04:22:56,180
Wow, is it nearly, is it nearly fucking February?

5029
04:22:58,180 --> 04:23:02,180
If there's a week and change left.

5030
04:23:02,180 --> 04:23:05,180
When this episode's out, it'll be the 27th.

5031
04:23:05,180 --> 04:23:06,180
That's right.

5032
04:23:06,180 --> 04:23:07,180
Crazy.

5033
04:23:08,180 --> 04:23:09,180
That's 30.

5034
04:23:09,180 --> 04:23:10,180
Yeah.

5035
04:23:11,180 --> 04:23:15,180
I should, you know, I know I said this last month,

5036
04:23:15,180 --> 04:23:18,180
but I should really try to get that book done by the end of this month.

5037
04:23:18,180 --> 04:23:21,180
And I should actually do it this time.

5038
04:23:21,180 --> 04:23:25,180
And every time I say that, it gets more and more likely that it will happen,

5039
04:23:25,180 --> 04:23:27,180
that this will be the month.

5040
04:23:27,180 --> 04:23:31,180
So you're playing the slots, you're rolling the dice again.

5041
04:23:32,180 --> 04:23:34,180
Every single, every single time, every time.

5042
04:23:34,180 --> 04:23:36,180
And one of these days it's going to pay out.

5043
04:23:37,180 --> 04:23:39,180
One of these days it's going to pay out.

5044
04:23:39,180 --> 04:23:40,180
Just like crypto.

5045
04:23:41,180 --> 04:23:42,180
Just like crypto.

5046
04:23:42,180 --> 04:23:46,180
You know, I'm sad to say Bitcoin had a big day yesterday.

5047
04:23:47,180 --> 04:23:51,180
It like jumped up like 30%.

5048
04:23:51,180 --> 04:23:53,180
Jumped up, jumped up and got down.

5049
04:23:54,180 --> 04:23:59,180
It went down a little bit, but like, yeah, it had a big,

5050
04:23:59,180 --> 04:24:01,180
like a 30% jump yesterday.

5051
04:24:01,180 --> 04:24:02,180
And I hate that.

5052
04:24:02,180 --> 04:24:03,180
It makes me upset.

5053
04:24:04,180 --> 04:24:07,180
I got a fucking notification from one of the apps I was using

5054
04:24:07,180 --> 04:24:10,180
that I had put money in a long time ago.

5055
04:24:10,180 --> 04:24:13,180
And it said, you've got like a few days left,

5056
04:24:13,180 --> 04:24:17,180
final chance to take your cash out because the app is not going to exist.

5057
04:24:17,180 --> 04:24:21,180
I'm like, oh, okay, cash out please.

5058
04:24:21,180 --> 04:24:22,180
So that should be...

5059
04:24:22,180 --> 04:24:23,180
Did you do that?

5060
04:24:24,180 --> 04:24:28,180
Well, I hope you did it after this jump.

5061
04:24:28,180 --> 04:24:29,180
That's like 30%.

5062
04:24:29,180 --> 04:24:30,180
It wasn't in Bitcoin.

5063
04:24:30,180 --> 04:24:35,180
I think the app, I had specifically got it to put some in Dogecoin,

5064
04:24:35,180 --> 04:24:38,180
just because Dogecoin at the time was going insane.

5065
04:24:38,180 --> 04:24:39,180
And I just missed it.

5066
04:24:39,180 --> 04:24:40,180
I was like, dang.

5067
04:24:40,180 --> 04:24:42,180
Well, maybe next time and I never happened.

5068
04:24:42,180 --> 04:24:46,180
Well, these cryptos tend to like rise and fall together.

5069
04:24:46,180 --> 04:24:47,180
Like...

5070
04:24:47,180 --> 04:24:48,180
Yeah.

5071
04:24:48,180 --> 04:24:49,180
Yeah.

5072
04:24:49,180 --> 04:24:52,180
Ethereum also jumped up yesterday.

5073
04:24:52,180 --> 04:24:53,180
I just took everything out.

5074
04:24:53,180 --> 04:24:58,180
I think overall, like the money I put in, I think I put 200 pounds in

5075
04:24:58,180 --> 04:25:00,180
and I took out 283 pounds.

5076
04:25:00,180 --> 04:25:03,180
So it's not a big jump, but like it's not a loss.

5077
04:25:03,180 --> 04:25:04,180
So fuck it.

5078
04:25:04,180 --> 04:25:07,180
I'm not paying attention to those apps anymore.

5079
04:25:07,180 --> 04:25:11,180
Dogecoin rose yesterday, but only a little bit.

5080
04:25:11,180 --> 04:25:12,180
Yeah.

5081
04:25:12,180 --> 04:25:15,180
Um, frickin...

5082
04:25:15,180 --> 04:25:18,180
Dick Masterson just came out with like...

5083
04:25:18,180 --> 04:25:20,180
Okay.

5084
04:25:20,180 --> 04:25:21,180
I guess there's...

5085
04:25:21,180 --> 04:25:27,180
He had his like, quote unquote, Patreon alternative, which is just...

5086
04:25:27,180 --> 04:25:30,180
He manages your money for you.

5087
04:25:30,180 --> 04:25:31,180
And he just said...

5088
04:25:31,180 --> 04:25:36,180
He's announced a new one that's like that, but it's crypto.

5089
04:25:36,180 --> 04:25:40,180
Well, and I don't know, it just seems so stupid.

5090
04:25:40,180 --> 04:25:43,180
It just seems like, first of all, he already had one.

5091
04:25:43,180 --> 04:25:46,180
First of all, he already could just do it himself.

5092
04:25:46,180 --> 04:25:50,180
So I don't see what the benefit to this new one is...

5093
04:25:50,180 --> 04:25:53,180
Unless you already are in crypto.

5094
04:25:53,180 --> 04:25:57,180
If you have crypto, it's the same as the old one.

5095
04:25:57,180 --> 04:26:00,180
But if you don't, then it's just the old...

5096
04:26:00,180 --> 04:26:02,180
I think it was called New Project 2.

5097
04:26:02,180 --> 04:26:09,180
It's just that, but you have to invest in crypto before you can participate in it.

5098
04:26:09,180 --> 04:26:11,180
And I just don't fucking...

5099
04:26:11,180 --> 04:26:13,180
I just don't get it.

5100
04:26:13,180 --> 04:26:15,180
What was the idea with New Project 2?

5101
04:26:15,180 --> 04:26:21,180
Well, the idea is that some creators and some people were banned off Patreon and stuff.

5102
04:26:21,180 --> 04:26:23,180
And basically, Dick...

5103
04:26:23,180 --> 04:26:29,180
Pretty much all it was was like, people could just pledge to New Project 2

5104
04:26:29,180 --> 04:26:31,180
instead of pledging to Patreon.

5105
04:26:31,180 --> 04:26:34,180
And that's just the same as sending your money to Dick.

5106
04:26:34,180 --> 04:26:37,180
And then Dick just gives these people...

5107
04:26:37,180 --> 04:26:38,180
He pays them out.

5108
04:26:38,180 --> 04:26:43,180
He's basically functioning as Patreon for these people who were banned from Patreon.

5109
04:26:43,180 --> 04:26:45,180
That's pretty much the gist of it.

5110
04:26:45,180 --> 04:26:49,180
Which is fine, I guess.

5111
04:26:49,180 --> 04:26:53,180
Yeah, and the new one is just that, but crypto.

5112
04:26:53,180 --> 04:26:56,180
Awesome.

5113
04:26:56,180 --> 04:26:58,180
Stupid.

5114
04:26:58,180 --> 04:27:00,180
Crypted.

5115
04:27:00,180 --> 04:27:03,180
More like, more like, crypt off.

5116
04:27:03,180 --> 04:27:05,180
Get it?

5117
04:27:05,180 --> 04:27:06,180
No.

5118
04:27:06,180 --> 04:27:07,180
You get ripped off.

5119
04:27:07,180 --> 04:27:08,180
Oh, crypt off.

5120
04:27:08,180 --> 04:27:09,180
I get it.

5121
04:27:09,180 --> 04:27:10,180
That's good.

5122
04:27:10,180 --> 04:27:12,180
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

5123
04:27:16,180 --> 04:27:19,180
Next week, I won't be depressed anymore.

5124
04:27:19,180 --> 04:27:20,180
Mm-hmm.

5125
04:27:20,180 --> 04:27:21,180
Hello.

5126
04:27:21,180 --> 04:27:23,180
Well, is that true or is that a lie?

5127
04:27:23,180 --> 04:27:24,180
Find out next time.

5128
04:27:24,180 --> 04:27:25,180
Find out next time.

5129
04:27:25,180 --> 04:27:26,180
Find out.

5130
04:27:26,180 --> 04:27:28,180
Only one way to find out.

5131
04:27:28,180 --> 04:27:30,180
Next time, my book will be done.

5132
04:27:30,180 --> 04:27:31,180
That's...

5133
04:27:32,180 --> 04:27:34,180
Yeah.

5134
04:27:34,180 --> 04:27:37,180
It could happen.

5135
04:27:37,180 --> 04:27:41,180
Next time, I make no promises.

5136
04:27:41,180 --> 04:27:43,180
All I'm doing is existing.

5137
04:27:43,180 --> 04:27:47,180
You should make promises and then just break them.

5138
04:27:47,180 --> 04:27:49,180
No, what's the point?

5139
04:27:49,180 --> 04:27:53,180
What's the point of saying, oh, I should work on that and then not doing it?

5140
04:27:53,180 --> 04:27:57,180
Maybe I should just forego the saying, I'll do it.

5141
04:27:57,180 --> 04:27:59,180
Hmm.

5142
04:27:59,180 --> 04:28:04,180
Well, that's not very Sigma grind set of you.

5143
04:28:08,180 --> 04:28:20,180
I feel like something has to change with my, I don't know, situation slash attitude slash mental state.

5144
04:28:20,180 --> 04:28:21,180
Yeah.

5145
04:28:21,180 --> 04:28:26,180
Before I can really, because I don't know.

5146
04:28:26,180 --> 04:28:29,180
This is like Clarissa, that's the thing hanging over my head.

5147
04:28:29,180 --> 04:28:31,180
There's still some other things.

5148
04:28:31,180 --> 04:28:32,180
Mm-hmm.

5149
04:28:32,180 --> 04:28:34,180
I'm like, got to do it.

5150
04:28:34,180 --> 04:28:35,180
Yeah.

5151
04:28:35,180 --> 04:28:36,180
I want it.

5152
04:28:36,180 --> 04:28:39,180
I genuinely don't want to do anything.

5153
04:28:39,180 --> 04:28:52,180
You're saying you need a change in your outlook, mental state, attitude, what have you, before you can get that done is what you're saying.

5154
04:28:52,180 --> 04:28:53,180
I don't know.

5155
04:28:53,180 --> 04:29:02,180
I think it may also be a mistake to be waiting or, you know, hoping for something to change before I do anything.

5156
04:29:02,180 --> 04:29:04,180
To, I don't know.

5157
04:29:04,180 --> 04:29:06,180
I'm just sort of like, I'm numb right now.

5158
04:29:06,180 --> 04:29:09,180
I'm numb to everything.

5159
04:29:09,180 --> 04:29:15,180
I just sort of like enjoying like media and feeling mostly nothing.

5160
04:29:15,180 --> 04:29:17,180
And it's like, you know, whatever.

5161
04:29:18,180 --> 04:29:19,180
Okay.

5162
04:29:19,180 --> 04:29:25,180
I think it was a while ago, and I think I showed it on the show, but I posted, I guess you could call it a meme.

5163
04:29:25,180 --> 04:29:34,180
But it was a bunch of like, it was sort of like art, like it was kind of self-healthy, but not really.

5164
04:29:34,180 --> 04:29:43,180
It was sort of like memes or like jokes about like, it was basically like comparing like two different ways to like look at the same thing.

5165
04:29:43,180 --> 04:29:45,180
And I don't remember what all of them were.

5166
04:29:45,180 --> 04:29:51,180
But do you remember the one, it was like, the artist is like looking at the blank page.

5167
04:29:51,180 --> 04:30:02,180
And in the one panel, he says like, he says like, I'll work on this when I feel better.

5168
04:30:02,180 --> 04:30:06,180
And then in the other one, he says, if I work on this, I will feel better.

5169
04:30:06,180 --> 04:30:08,180
Do you know what I mean?

5170
04:30:08,180 --> 04:30:09,180
Yeah.

5171
04:30:09,180 --> 04:30:14,180
I think if you're troubled, I know it's hard, I know it's hard to get yourself out of a rut.

5172
04:30:14,180 --> 04:30:23,180
But if you're troubled by the fact that you haven't worked on a thing, then probably you might have to simply force yourself to do it, even if you don't feel like it.

5173
04:30:23,180 --> 04:30:29,180
And you might find that in doing so, that that's the only way to push past that.

5174
04:30:29,180 --> 04:30:30,180
Yeah.

5175
04:30:30,180 --> 04:30:33,180
It's just a tip for you.

5176
04:30:33,180 --> 04:30:39,180
It's just a little nudge, because it sounds like what you might need to hear.

5177
04:30:39,180 --> 04:30:48,180
I don't know, because I mean, probably, I'm not discounting that advice.

5178
04:30:48,180 --> 04:30:56,180
But I did try to force myself, I guess it was a few months ago now.

5179
04:30:56,180 --> 04:30:58,180
And I did get a bit of work done.

5180
04:30:58,180 --> 04:31:01,180
And then I immediately was like, that sucked.

5181
04:31:01,180 --> 04:31:03,180
I don't want to do anymore.

5182
04:31:03,180 --> 04:31:06,180
So it didn't make me feel better.

5183
04:31:06,180 --> 04:31:09,180
And I don't know.

5184
04:31:09,180 --> 04:31:13,180
At the moment, I'm just sort of like, what if, you know, fuck everything?

5185
04:31:13,180 --> 04:31:18,180
What if all the things I do, like that doesn't matter?

5186
04:31:18,180 --> 04:31:20,180
Just fuck them.

5187
04:31:20,180 --> 04:31:22,180
I'm genuinely at a point like that.

5188
04:31:22,180 --> 04:31:26,180
And I don't really know how I feel about it.

5189
04:31:26,180 --> 04:31:30,180
Well, I mean, it sounds like you just told me how you feel about it.

5190
04:31:30,180 --> 04:31:31,180
Well, I don't know.

5191
04:31:31,180 --> 04:31:32,180
You're like, fuck it.

5192
04:31:32,180 --> 04:31:34,180
I guess so.

5193
04:31:34,180 --> 04:31:39,180
It's kind of sad though.

5194
04:31:39,180 --> 04:31:42,180
And that's the end of the show.

5195
04:31:42,180 --> 04:31:43,180
No, I get you.

5196
04:31:43,180 --> 04:31:46,180
No, I get you.

5197
04:31:46,180 --> 04:31:48,180
I don't know.

5198
04:31:48,180 --> 04:31:53,180
My light at the end of the tunnel right now is the book is done.

5199
04:31:53,180 --> 04:31:56,180
And I can kickstart it.

5200
04:31:56,180 --> 04:31:58,180
So I mean, I've got that going for me.

5201
04:31:58,180 --> 04:32:03,180
If I didn't have that, I don't know what I would do.

5202
04:32:04,180 --> 04:32:07,180
I would feel very little motivation.

5203
04:32:07,180 --> 04:32:14,180
I guess I'm just sort of feeling like the things I do don't really matter to anyone that much.

5204
04:32:14,180 --> 04:32:21,180
And so like, if I finally get closer to chapter four done, like, it's whatever.

5205
04:32:21,180 --> 04:32:23,180
Like, it doesn't excite me.

5206
04:32:23,180 --> 04:32:25,180
And that's annoying.

5207
04:32:25,180 --> 04:32:29,180
No, I don't feel like anything I'm doing is exciting.

5208
04:32:29,180 --> 04:32:39,180
I definitely feel, I know exactly what you mean, but I don't know what advice I have to offer about that.

5209
04:32:39,180 --> 04:32:48,180
Because I know all too well that, yeah, I don't know.

5210
04:32:48,180 --> 04:32:55,180
I guess you got to just step back and look at the big picture and appreciate.

5211
04:32:55,180 --> 04:32:57,180
I mean, there's one of two options.

5212
04:32:57,180 --> 04:33:03,180
Either the thing is worth doing, in which case you could step back and consider and take a broader perspective and see,

5213
04:33:03,180 --> 04:33:09,180
no, I should do that because it will have, because I will be glad that I did.

5214
04:33:09,180 --> 04:33:14,180
Or, I mean, I guess you might look at it objectively and you might conclude,

5215
04:33:14,180 --> 04:33:16,180
and I'm not saying this about Clarissa.

5216
04:33:16,180 --> 04:33:18,180
I'm just saying this about endeavors in general.

5217
04:33:18,180 --> 04:33:20,180
You might be like, no, that's not worth doing.

5218
04:33:20,180 --> 04:33:25,180
What I'm not excited about it is because it's a waste of time and I should do something else.

5219
04:33:25,180 --> 04:33:30,180
You know, those are the only two possibilities.

5220
04:33:30,180 --> 04:33:35,180
Yeah.

5221
04:33:35,180 --> 04:33:42,180
Yeah, I didn't really want to bring it up earlier because I didn't really have a robust thought about any of it.

5222
04:33:42,180 --> 04:33:49,180
It's just sort of like, wow, I really am in a malaise right now.

5223
04:33:49,180 --> 04:33:52,180
I guess we'll see what happens.

5224
04:33:52,180 --> 04:33:54,180
You know what?

5225
04:33:54,180 --> 04:33:55,180
I mean, yeah, me too.

5226
04:33:55,180 --> 04:33:58,180
I also didn't get too much into it before.

5227
04:33:58,180 --> 04:34:04,180
I kind of just let it go, but it's good.

5228
04:34:04,180 --> 04:34:11,180
Honestly, if you had gotten on this, if you had wanted to talk about your malaise,

5229
04:34:11,180 --> 04:34:16,180
I probably would have started talking about my malaise and then we just would have had a malaise cast.

5230
04:34:16,180 --> 04:34:17,180
Yeah.

5231
04:34:17,180 --> 04:34:18,180
Next time.

5232
04:34:18,180 --> 04:34:19,180
No, next time.

5233
04:34:19,180 --> 04:34:22,180
That's the teaser for the next episode.

5234
04:34:22,180 --> 04:34:23,180
Right.

5235
04:34:23,180 --> 04:34:28,180
I mean, I don't mind.

5236
04:34:28,180 --> 04:34:34,180
Do you want to wrap up or do you want to explore this more deeply?

5237
04:34:34,180 --> 04:34:35,180
I feel like we've gone on.

5238
04:34:35,180 --> 04:34:37,180
We've had a full episode at this point.

5239
04:34:37,180 --> 04:34:39,180
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

5240
04:34:39,180 --> 04:34:41,180
I don't know what I would say.

5241
04:34:41,180 --> 04:34:47,180
I feel like my work has been good generally, like my body of work.

5242
04:34:47,180 --> 04:34:48,180
Yeah.

5243
04:34:48,180 --> 04:34:50,180
But I don't know.

5244
04:34:50,180 --> 04:34:53,180
I don't feel like doing it right now.

5245
04:34:53,180 --> 04:34:55,180
That's it.

5246
04:34:55,180 --> 04:34:57,180
That's where my mind is.

5247
04:34:57,180 --> 04:34:59,180
No.

5248
04:34:59,180 --> 04:35:07,180
If I damn, I wish I knew the solution to that problem because that would help me also.

5249
04:35:07,180 --> 04:35:11,180
And I'm trying to think about it from the point of view of like,

5250
04:35:11,180 --> 04:35:15,180
what would I tell someone else who feels that way?

5251
04:35:15,180 --> 04:35:20,180
Because kind of that's sort of how you have to, when you have a problem,

5252
04:35:20,180 --> 04:35:23,180
sometimes it helps to think about what would I tell someone else that came to me

5253
04:35:23,180 --> 04:35:26,180
and they described a similar problem.

5254
04:35:26,180 --> 04:35:30,180
And what you're describing to me is a similar problem to what I think about.

5255
04:35:30,180 --> 04:35:36,180
And now I'm like, well, can I think of something that I would tell someone with that problem?

5256
04:35:36,180 --> 04:35:38,180
No.

5257
04:35:38,180 --> 04:35:43,180
I have nothing, no solutions to offer.

5258
04:35:43,180 --> 04:35:46,180
But let's think about it.

5259
04:35:46,180 --> 04:35:49,180
Let's contemplate.

5260
04:35:49,180 --> 04:35:53,180
Maybe next week we'll think of something.

5261
04:35:53,180 --> 04:35:54,180
Yeah.

5262
04:35:54,180 --> 04:35:57,180
We'll have the answers.

5263
04:35:57,180 --> 04:35:59,180
All right, you want to wrap up?

5264
04:35:59,180 --> 04:36:01,180
Yeah.

5265
04:36:01,180 --> 04:36:03,180
Do you?

5266
04:36:03,180 --> 04:36:05,180
I don't know.

5267
04:36:05,180 --> 04:36:09,180
It would have been cool if you had the perfect thing to say and I'm like, oh my god.

5268
04:36:09,180 --> 04:36:10,180
I know.

5269
04:36:10,180 --> 04:36:13,180
That would have ruled so much.

5270
04:36:13,180 --> 04:36:17,180
I would have been the man.

5271
04:36:17,180 --> 04:36:22,180
My therapist told me you should try to create something.

5272
04:36:22,180 --> 04:36:25,180
Even if it's not good.

5273
04:36:25,180 --> 04:36:31,180
I think Clarissa, I want it to be good so I'm not doing it because I don't think it's good enough.

5274
04:36:31,180 --> 04:36:33,180
That's one aspect.

5275
04:36:33,180 --> 04:36:36,180
Your therapist said you should try to create something.

5276
04:36:36,180 --> 04:36:40,180
Was that her specific advice for you or in general?

5277
04:36:40,180 --> 04:36:42,180
For me because I'm a creative person.

5278
04:36:42,180 --> 04:36:48,180
I'm obviously in the past have been very passionate about certain things because I'm depressed at the moment.

5279
04:36:48,180 --> 04:36:51,180
I'm sort of closing off.

5280
04:36:51,180 --> 04:36:57,180
I'm not with it.

5281
04:36:57,180 --> 04:37:04,180
If art is fun, creating things is fun, then I should try to do something that I want to do.

5282
04:37:04,180 --> 04:37:11,180
Even if it's bad, even if nobody wants to see it, even if I will never show it to anyone.

5283
04:37:11,180 --> 04:37:13,180
I was like, okay.

5284
04:37:13,180 --> 04:37:15,180
That's some sort of actionable advice.

5285
04:37:15,180 --> 04:37:20,180
Try and work on something that I want to do and then I was thinking about it and I don't want to do anything.

5286
04:37:20,180 --> 04:37:22,180
That was the roadblock.

5287
04:37:22,180 --> 04:37:24,180
I'm like, well fuck.

5288
04:37:24,180 --> 04:37:29,180
I don't have a single thing that I'm interested in doing right now.

5289
04:37:29,180 --> 04:37:33,180
I don't know.

5290
04:37:33,180 --> 04:37:35,180
Yeah.

5291
04:37:35,180 --> 04:37:47,180
If I need to reignite a spark of motivation or passion, I don't know how to do it.

5292
04:37:47,180 --> 04:37:55,180
Sometimes somebody will ask me about the next chapter of the champion or the vapors or something.

5293
04:37:55,180 --> 04:38:09,180
Generally, my answer is like, yeah, in general I'd like to do another one of those, but I don't have a story that's in my head right now that's like, I know what I'm going to do.

5294
04:38:09,180 --> 04:38:13,180
I know what it's going to be and I want to do it.

5295
04:38:13,180 --> 04:38:25,180
It's like, I would need to really have, yeah, like a specific thing I want to make, like a specific story that I want to tell.

5296
04:38:25,180 --> 04:38:29,180
I can't imagine, like to motivate myself to do that.

5297
04:38:29,180 --> 04:38:31,180
I can't imagine.

5298
04:38:31,180 --> 04:38:37,180
You know, mangaka, they're working on a freaking deadline every week.

5299
04:38:37,180 --> 04:38:42,180
Every week they got to come up with some new bullshit for their characters to do or whatever.

5300
04:38:43,180 --> 04:38:45,180
Can you fucking imagine?

5301
04:38:45,180 --> 04:38:47,180
I can't.

5302
04:38:47,180 --> 04:38:50,180
I mean, I can hardly think of anything.

5303
04:38:50,180 --> 04:38:57,180
I can think of that being like a good recipe for like continued ability to work.

5304
04:38:57,180 --> 04:39:00,180
Like if there's a deadline, well, you've got to draw something.

5305
04:39:00,180 --> 04:39:06,180
And if you've got to draw something, then even if you don't have a good idea, you'll just throw something out.

5306
04:39:06,180 --> 04:39:16,180
And that's like a, I don't need to, I don't really need to worry so much about everything being perfect.

5307
04:39:16,180 --> 04:39:18,180
Sometimes a chapter is kind of lame.

5308
04:39:18,180 --> 04:39:28,180
I mean, it doesn't have one piece, but he's very, very well like honed that craft over the decades.

5309
04:39:28,180 --> 04:39:31,180
And he's got a lot of ideas that he's already written down.

5310
04:39:31,180 --> 04:39:36,180
But like for some mangaka, they have off weeks.

5311
04:39:36,180 --> 04:39:39,180
Sometimes you can tell.

5312
04:39:39,180 --> 04:39:44,180
Where it's just, so I don't know.

5313
04:39:44,180 --> 04:39:52,180
I need to maybe just make Clarissa chapter four, even if it sucks and then put it up there and maybe I'll feel better.

5314
04:39:52,180 --> 04:39:58,180
But yeah, no deadline and no like, no nothing.

5315
04:39:58,180 --> 04:40:00,180
This makes it difficult.

5316
04:40:00,180 --> 04:40:05,180
Yeah, this is kind of a depressing thought that I have a bunch of the time.

5317
04:40:05,180 --> 04:40:14,180
But I wonder if like, hey, if I like worked for a magazine or something, if I worked for Shonen Jump or something like that.

5318
04:40:14,180 --> 04:40:21,180
And I was like, okay, I need to make a chapter because I need to fill my quota.

5319
04:40:21,180 --> 04:40:24,180
I need to, because it's my job and I got to do it.

5320
04:40:24,180 --> 04:40:26,180
So I do it.

5321
04:40:27,180 --> 04:40:29,180
I don't know.

5322
04:40:29,180 --> 04:40:32,180
Would I, you know.

5323
04:40:32,180 --> 04:40:35,180
Just makes me wonder like, what would I have done?

5324
04:40:35,180 --> 04:40:38,180
What would I have done if that was my situation?

5325
04:40:38,180 --> 04:40:50,180
Like what work could I have done under those circumstances that I haven't and never will now because that was not true?

5326
04:40:50,180 --> 04:40:55,180
That really makes me sad.

5327
04:40:56,180 --> 04:40:59,180
Well, that's the show everybody.

5328
04:40:59,180 --> 04:41:03,180
What if we made like a like a procrastinator's jump?

5329
04:41:03,180 --> 04:41:17,180
Little little manga magazine, the weekly this and then we would put we would put like a the latest chapter of Clarissa and or any other comic or whatever.

5330
04:41:17,180 --> 04:41:25,180
I don't know if I have the, I don't know if I have the chops to do anything weekly like that.

5331
04:41:25,180 --> 04:41:38,180
I mean, neither do I really, but maybe not weekly, but I think some sort of structure would help me in my situation.

5332
04:41:38,180 --> 04:41:50,180
Yeah, the moment it's it feels like the the barriers to Clarissa existing are my own feeling that what I'm doing is for a good reason.

5333
04:41:50,180 --> 04:41:53,180
Like people care about Clarissa and want to see and I know people do.

5334
04:41:53,180 --> 04:41:59,180
People have told me they want to see, but like, I want it to be good.

5335
04:41:59,180 --> 04:42:05,180
And so, yeah, I don't feel like I'm good enough.

5336
04:42:05,180 --> 04:42:13,180
But I don't know what if I had a deadline, what if I had to make it?

5337
04:42:13,180 --> 04:42:18,180
I mean, that's how I made the first few bunches of pages because of the Tezuka thing.

5338
04:42:18,180 --> 04:42:20,180
It was a very hard deadline.

5339
04:42:20,180 --> 04:42:23,180
You had to have the comic ready by this time.

5340
04:42:23,180 --> 04:42:29,180
Otherwise, it would not be submitted.

5341
04:42:29,180 --> 04:42:33,180
True.

5342
04:42:33,180 --> 04:42:35,180
You're on you're on to something.

5343
04:42:35,180 --> 04:42:46,180
You're probably right.

5344
04:42:46,180 --> 04:42:56,180
What would you contribute to a weekly one piece, a weekly manga magazine on the procrastinators brand?

5345
04:42:56,180 --> 04:43:01,180
God.

5346
04:43:01,180 --> 04:43:06,180
Obviously, you got different types of projects.

5347
04:43:06,180 --> 04:43:10,180
That's genuinely like a scary question.

5348
04:43:10,180 --> 04:43:19,180
That would be if like, I feel like I would be going over a cliff to like hard commit to doing any such thing.

5349
04:43:19,180 --> 04:43:24,180
This feels like I'm asking to fail.

5350
04:43:24,180 --> 04:43:27,180
I mean, yeah, it's going to suck.

5351
04:43:27,180 --> 04:43:28,180
Yeah.

5352
04:43:28,180 --> 04:43:34,180
The only thing that is like makes sense to me is that if I try, if I try to make it, it's going to be bad.

5353
04:43:34,180 --> 04:43:37,180
Well, it's I know that I'll be able to make it.

5354
04:43:37,180 --> 04:43:41,180
It'll just be bad and people will say, oh, this sucks.

5355
04:43:41,180 --> 04:43:44,180
They'll spit upon my grave, but at least I'll make it.

5356
04:43:44,180 --> 04:43:46,180
It would be it would be Biscopades.

5357
04:43:46,180 --> 04:43:54,180
I would pick up Biscopades again and finish and go do that until it was done.

5358
04:43:54,180 --> 04:43:57,180
Yeah, that's actually it's an easy answer.

5359
04:43:58,180 --> 04:44:00,180
Yeah, we should make we should make a little.

5360
04:44:00,180 --> 04:44:01,180
What's the name?

5361
04:44:01,180 --> 04:44:02,180
What's a good name?

5362
04:44:02,180 --> 04:44:05,180
Shonen Jump.

5363
04:44:05,180 --> 04:44:13,180
We don't really want to copy jump, but yeah, something.

5364
04:44:13,180 --> 04:44:20,180
I'm trying to think of like a pun with PCP or procrastination.

5365
04:44:20,180 --> 04:44:22,180
Pro comics.

5366
04:44:22,180 --> 04:44:26,180
Pro comics publication.

5367
04:44:27,180 --> 04:44:28,180
Based.

5368
04:44:29,180 --> 04:44:31,180
Epic win.

5369
04:44:34,180 --> 04:44:36,180
You there?

5370
04:44:36,180 --> 04:44:38,180
No, I'm just thinking.

5371
04:44:38,180 --> 04:44:40,180
No, that was my serious.

5372
04:44:40,180 --> 04:44:41,180
My serious answer.

5373
04:44:41,180 --> 04:44:42,180
PCP.

5374
04:44:42,180 --> 04:44:46,180
Wait, wasn't that like a thing in like that's the whole like backman thing.

5375
04:44:46,180 --> 04:44:47,180
The pro crime.

5376
04:44:47,180 --> 04:44:49,180
Yeah, well, the perfect crime party.

5377
04:44:49,180 --> 04:44:50,180
Yes.

5378
04:44:50,180 --> 04:44:51,180
Yes.

5379
04:44:51,180 --> 04:44:53,180
Perfect comic park tea.

5380
04:44:53,180 --> 04:44:54,180
Perfect.

5381
04:44:54,180 --> 04:44:57,180
Honestly, yeah, perfect comic party is not bad.

5382
04:44:57,180 --> 04:44:59,180
We're the procrastinators.

5383
04:44:59,180 --> 04:45:03,180
We have a show called the PCP in a comic called the PCP.

5384
04:45:03,180 --> 04:45:05,180
No confusing at all.

5385
04:45:05,180 --> 04:45:08,180
And our acronym is TPC.

5386
04:45:14,180 --> 04:45:15,180
All right.

5387
04:45:15,180 --> 04:45:20,180
I feel like that's worth submitting to the board.

5388
04:45:20,180 --> 04:45:22,180
I feel like honest, you know what?

5389
04:45:22,180 --> 04:45:24,180
Honestly, you know what?

5390
04:45:24,180 --> 04:45:31,180
Honestly, it's a little bit scary, but I could honestly, I could do.

5391
04:45:31,180 --> 04:45:33,180
I feel like that'd be better.

5392
04:45:33,180 --> 04:45:34,180
Something like that.

5393
04:45:34,180 --> 04:45:35,180
I don't know.

5394
04:45:35,180 --> 04:45:37,180
It would need a little bit of infrastructure, but I would feel better doing it like that

5395
04:45:37,180 --> 04:45:40,180
than just fucking posted my shit on Twitter.

5396
04:45:40,180 --> 04:45:43,180
Posting Biscopades on Twitter was like depressing.

5397
04:45:43,180 --> 04:45:47,180
This shitty platform for such a thing.

5398
04:45:47,180 --> 04:45:51,180
But I have like no audience on like Tapas or Webtoon.

5399
04:45:51,180 --> 04:45:53,180
So that was even shittier there.

5400
04:45:53,180 --> 04:45:55,180
Yeah.

5401
04:45:55,180 --> 04:45:56,180
Okay.

5402
04:45:56,180 --> 04:45:57,180
This is cute then.

5403
04:45:57,180 --> 04:45:58,180
We can have a little cute little comic.

5404
04:45:58,180 --> 04:45:59,180
It is cute.

5405
04:45:59,180 --> 04:46:06,180
I guess we'll draw the comics and then put them together in like a PDF or some sort of

5406
04:46:06,180 --> 04:46:10,180
way people can read it and then link the PDF.

5407
04:46:10,180 --> 04:46:11,180
It's like, oh, it's the new episode.

5408
04:46:11,180 --> 04:46:13,180
It's the new thing.

5409
04:46:13,180 --> 04:46:17,180
Maybe fans could like write articles.

5410
04:46:17,180 --> 04:46:24,180
Maybe the, what's the RFCK news?

5411
04:46:24,180 --> 04:46:26,180
Where'd that go, huh?

5412
04:46:26,180 --> 04:46:29,180
Oh, the Slime Times?

5413
04:46:29,180 --> 04:46:30,180
Slime Times.

5414
04:46:30,180 --> 04:46:32,180
You could have a Slime Times article.

5415
04:46:32,180 --> 04:46:34,180
Just spitballing.

5416
04:46:34,180 --> 04:46:36,180
Obviously, initially, it'll just be me and you.

5417
04:46:36,180 --> 04:46:42,180
I think we'd better, on the one hand, like a downloadable PDF is cuter.

5418
04:46:42,180 --> 04:46:44,180
But I mean, Beescapades is GIFs.

5419
04:46:44,180 --> 04:46:46,180
Beescapades was like in a GIF format.

5420
04:46:46,180 --> 04:46:49,180
So it couldn't exist as a PDF.

5421
04:46:49,180 --> 04:46:51,180
Yeah, that's the truth.

5422
04:46:51,180 --> 04:46:56,180
Although, I guess it wouldn't have to be GIFs.

5423
04:46:56,180 --> 04:46:59,180
This is not that essential a part of it.

5424
04:46:59,180 --> 04:47:03,180
Maybe you could just link like, hey, this new episode.

5425
04:47:03,180 --> 04:47:07,180
Could just be an HTML website.

5426
04:47:07,180 --> 04:47:09,180
Just be a web page.

5427
04:47:09,180 --> 04:47:12,180
A web page.

5428
04:47:12,180 --> 04:47:15,180
Like, I want it to be cute.

5429
04:47:15,180 --> 04:47:17,180
It could better just be a zip file.

5430
04:47:17,180 --> 04:47:19,180
Could you be a zip file with images in it?

5431
04:47:19,180 --> 04:47:21,180
It could be.

5432
04:47:21,180 --> 04:47:27,180
I just like the cute little idea of it having a cover with a barcode

5433
04:47:27,180 --> 04:47:32,180
and all those things they have on a comic book you would buy.

5434
04:47:32,180 --> 04:47:38,180
And the big old title, name of comic but cool looking

5435
04:47:38,180 --> 04:47:41,180
with our characters doing like a shonen jump.

5436
04:47:41,180 --> 04:47:45,180
Oh, look, this one's got Clarissa in it and Beescapades.

5437
04:47:45,180 --> 04:47:47,180
Oh, my God.

5438
04:47:47,180 --> 04:47:52,180
My two favorite characters, Clarissa and Beescapades.

5439
04:47:52,180 --> 04:47:55,180
His name is the Beast Hustler.

5440
04:47:55,180 --> 04:47:59,180
If I even remember correctly, and I do.

5441
04:47:59,180 --> 04:48:03,180
And it could be like a little weekly comic.

5442
04:48:03,180 --> 04:48:06,180
I could do a Redman comic for it as well.

5443
04:48:06,180 --> 04:48:08,180
Oh, right.

5444
04:48:08,180 --> 04:48:10,180
Redman.

5445
04:48:10,180 --> 04:48:11,180
Yeah, that's the funny.

5446
04:48:11,180 --> 04:48:15,180
So that's the funny is at the end.

5447
04:48:15,180 --> 04:48:17,180
Do you have still have a bunch of Redman queued up

5448
04:48:17,180 --> 04:48:19,180
or did you finish those?

5449
04:48:19,180 --> 04:48:20,180
I finished those.

5450
04:48:20,180 --> 04:48:22,180
I could just make border.

5451
04:48:22,180 --> 04:48:23,180
True.

5452
04:48:23,180 --> 04:48:25,180
I think I prefer making it on the spur of the moment

5453
04:48:25,180 --> 04:48:28,180
and posting it rather than making a ton of them in one go

5454
04:48:28,180 --> 04:48:30,180
and then queuing them because like some of the jokes

5455
04:48:30,180 --> 04:48:34,180
just don't land when I write a bunch of them in one go.

5456
04:48:34,180 --> 04:48:37,180
Although sometimes that is how I wrote them

5457
04:48:37,180 --> 04:48:41,180
because I just thought of something funny until I had a good one.

5458
04:48:41,180 --> 04:48:45,180
But yeah, I could do a Redman comic.

5459
04:48:45,180 --> 04:48:47,180
Those don't take much.

5460
04:48:47,180 --> 04:48:52,180
I would just need to finish the next Clarissa gun smoke.

5461
04:48:52,180 --> 04:48:55,180
I wonder how long, I wonder how I could do,

5462
04:48:55,180 --> 04:48:58,180
maybe if I said like one day a week aside,

5463
04:48:58,180 --> 04:49:01,180
I could do a few panels of Biscopades a week

5464
04:49:01,180 --> 04:49:06,180
and it probably wouldn't even be that hard.

5465
04:49:06,180 --> 04:49:09,180
You know, I feel pretty good.

5466
04:49:09,180 --> 04:49:12,180
I really did want to finish that,

5467
04:49:12,180 --> 04:49:15,180
but I've just had so many other things that I have popped up

5468
04:49:15,180 --> 04:49:17,180
that I've been like, I have to do this first,

5469
04:49:17,180 --> 04:49:19,180
I have to do that first.

5470
04:49:19,180 --> 04:49:21,180
I think this is good because...

5471
04:49:21,180 --> 04:49:24,180
I have to spend five months making a Mega Man video.

5472
04:49:24,180 --> 04:49:33,180
I think this is good because it pulls on those collaborative strings,

5473
04:49:33,180 --> 04:49:35,180
those collaborative heart strings,

5474
04:49:35,180 --> 04:49:41,180
that got me so into like making videos, like pony videos.

5475
04:49:41,180 --> 04:49:42,180
That's what I was going to say.

5476
04:49:42,180 --> 04:49:43,180
No, I was working with people,

5477
04:49:43,180 --> 04:49:46,180
but I was working with people in tandem

5478
04:49:46,180 --> 04:49:50,180
to make a review of the new My Little Pony episode.

5479
04:49:50,180 --> 04:49:52,180
That's what I was going to say.

5480
04:49:53,180 --> 04:49:55,180
And so like instead of...

5481
04:49:55,180 --> 04:49:57,180
Like I have to deliver.

5482
04:49:57,180 --> 04:50:00,180
Yeah, but instead of making the same comic,

5483
04:50:00,180 --> 04:50:07,180
we're making those same product in the magazine.

5484
04:50:07,180 --> 04:50:08,180
You know what?

5485
04:50:08,180 --> 04:50:09,180
I kind of like it.

5486
04:50:09,180 --> 04:50:10,180
Using our comics.

5487
04:50:10,180 --> 04:50:15,180
The more I think about it, the better an idea I think it is.

5488
04:50:15,180 --> 04:50:20,180
The perfect comic party.

5489
04:50:20,180 --> 04:50:22,180
I like that.

5490
04:50:22,180 --> 04:50:24,180
It's a callback.

5491
04:50:24,180 --> 04:50:25,180
It's a callback.

5492
04:50:25,180 --> 04:50:27,180
All the way back to the roots.

5493
04:50:29,180 --> 04:50:30,180
Then...

5494
04:50:30,180 --> 04:50:31,180
Okay.

5495
04:50:31,180 --> 04:50:34,180
We should call it one piece.

5496
04:50:36,180 --> 04:50:38,180
That's the one place.

5497
04:50:38,180 --> 04:50:41,180
All the comics are in one place.

5498
04:50:41,180 --> 04:50:44,180
I left all of the good comics in one piece.

5499
04:50:44,180 --> 04:50:47,180
It's exactly like that Imgirlink.

5500
04:50:48,180 --> 04:50:49,180
You can read my comic,

5501
04:50:49,180 --> 04:50:51,180
but you'll have to find it first.

5502
04:50:53,180 --> 04:50:58,180
We add like a comic from Jennifer and Jen.

5503
04:50:59,180 --> 04:51:03,180
We should just steal...

5504
04:51:03,180 --> 04:51:04,180
Yeah, we should just steal that.

5505
04:51:04,180 --> 04:51:06,180
We should just steal Jennifer's show

5506
04:51:06,180 --> 04:51:08,180
and just put it in and pretend she's a contributor

5507
04:51:08,180 --> 04:51:11,180
and not tell anyone.

5508
04:51:13,180 --> 04:51:14,180
Yeah.

5509
04:51:15,180 --> 04:51:16,180
I dig it.

5510
04:51:17,180 --> 04:51:19,180
I think I'm in.

5511
04:51:19,180 --> 04:51:21,180
And we could put Fana,

5512
04:51:21,180 --> 04:51:24,180
that appears on the Progress Natives podcast.

5513
04:51:24,180 --> 04:51:26,180
Oh, true.

5514
04:51:26,180 --> 04:51:28,180
Or Fana just appears.

5515
04:51:28,180 --> 04:51:30,180
Where would we publish it?

5516
04:51:30,180 --> 04:51:33,180
Well, we have a Twitter account for the channel.

5517
04:51:33,180 --> 04:51:35,180
We can put it on the freaking...

5518
04:51:35,180 --> 04:51:37,180
We have a freaking WordPress.

5519
04:51:37,180 --> 04:51:38,180
Oh, we do.

5520
04:51:38,180 --> 04:51:39,180
Yeah.

5521
04:51:39,180 --> 04:51:40,180
Which I've been meaning to update

5522
04:51:40,180 --> 04:51:42,180
and I keep telling people I'll update,

5523
04:51:42,180 --> 04:51:44,180
and I haven't done it in like three months,

5524
04:51:44,180 --> 04:51:45,180
maybe longer.

5525
04:51:46,180 --> 04:51:47,180
Well...

5526
04:51:48,180 --> 04:51:50,180
Okay, so making a PDF

5527
04:51:50,180 --> 04:51:52,180
is something that I know how to do,

5528
04:51:52,180 --> 04:51:54,180
I think, pretty simple.

5529
04:51:54,180 --> 04:51:57,180
But with Biscopay's GIFs,

5530
04:51:57,180 --> 04:51:59,180
do you want to make a version of Biscopay's

5531
04:51:59,180 --> 04:52:01,180
that would appear in the magazine,

5532
04:52:01,180 --> 04:52:03,180
or do you not like the PDF idea?

5533
04:52:07,180 --> 04:52:10,180
Because otherwise it's like a series of web pages

5534
04:52:10,180 --> 04:52:12,180
that you click through to the next one.

5535
04:52:12,180 --> 04:52:14,180
That's like PDF better.

5536
04:52:14,180 --> 04:52:16,180
It's a file.

5537
04:52:17,180 --> 04:52:19,180
Honestly, I don't...

5538
04:52:20,180 --> 04:52:22,180
I don't really care that much about

5539
04:52:22,180 --> 04:52:26,180
discarding the GIF format.

5540
04:52:26,180 --> 04:52:28,180
Maybe...

5541
04:52:28,180 --> 04:52:31,180
Maybe if there's like something I really wanted to animate,

5542
04:52:31,180 --> 04:52:33,180
I could just have like a clickable link in the PDF

5543
04:52:33,180 --> 04:52:35,180
that would link to a website

5544
04:52:35,180 --> 04:52:37,180
that displays the GIF or something.

5545
04:52:37,180 --> 04:52:39,180
Yeah, I think if you can do that,

5546
04:52:39,180 --> 04:52:41,180
if you can have links in PDFs,

5547
04:52:41,180 --> 04:52:43,180
then you can just link to where...

5548
04:52:43,180 --> 04:52:45,180
You can host it on St. Connex,

5549
04:52:45,180 --> 04:52:47,180
and you can just link from the PDF to it.

5550
04:52:47,180 --> 04:52:48,180
Yeah.

5551
04:52:48,180 --> 04:52:49,180
Maybe the same for me.

5552
04:52:49,180 --> 04:52:50,180
Yeah.

5553
04:52:50,180 --> 04:52:52,180
But I'll also put it in the PDF.

5554
04:52:56,180 --> 04:52:58,180
Alright, fuck it, I'm in.

5555
04:52:58,180 --> 04:52:59,180
Alright.

5556
04:52:59,180 --> 04:53:01,180
This is fun.

5557
04:53:01,180 --> 04:53:02,180
Yeah.

5558
04:53:02,180 --> 04:53:04,180
We'll post it on the WordPress.

5559
04:53:04,180 --> 04:53:06,180
I'll update the WordPress.

5560
04:53:06,180 --> 04:53:08,180
I'll get it up to date.

5561
04:53:08,180 --> 04:53:09,180
Yeah.

5562
04:53:09,180 --> 04:53:11,180
We'll think of a logo.

5563
04:53:11,180 --> 04:53:13,180
Maybe some...

5564
04:53:13,180 --> 04:53:15,180
Maybe we can steal...

5565
04:53:15,180 --> 04:53:17,180
We can steal someone's logo.

5566
04:53:17,180 --> 04:53:19,180
Someone submits a flag.

5567
04:53:19,180 --> 04:53:21,180
Someone submits a purple and green flag.

5568
04:53:21,180 --> 04:53:23,180
It's got to be purple and teal,

5569
04:53:23,180 --> 04:53:25,180
and it's got to have a skull.

5570
04:53:27,180 --> 04:53:28,180
And that's it.

5571
04:53:28,180 --> 04:53:30,180
Jump Comics, PCP,

5572
04:53:30,180 --> 04:53:31,180
Perfect Crime Party.

5573
04:53:31,180 --> 04:53:34,180
We just copied their logo

5574
04:53:34,180 --> 04:53:37,180
that they used for the fake...

5575
04:53:37,180 --> 04:53:39,180
One of these.

5576
04:53:39,180 --> 04:53:41,180
Do they have a logo? Let me see.

5577
04:53:41,180 --> 04:53:43,180
Oh, that's just letters.

5578
04:53:43,180 --> 04:53:45,180
That's dog shit.

5579
04:53:45,180 --> 04:53:46,180
Yeah.

5580
04:53:46,180 --> 04:53:48,180
It sucks.

5581
04:53:48,180 --> 04:53:50,180
I mean, we could just take that

5582
04:53:50,180 --> 04:53:53,180
and make it better and make the colors

5583
04:53:53,180 --> 04:53:55,180
fascinating.

5584
04:53:55,180 --> 04:53:56,180
I like...

5585
04:53:56,180 --> 04:53:57,180
I just...

5586
04:53:57,180 --> 04:53:59,180
It's amusing seeing them hold a phone

5587
04:53:59,180 --> 04:54:01,180
saying PCP like they're listening to it.

5588
04:54:01,180 --> 04:54:02,180
They are listening to the...

5589
04:54:02,180 --> 04:54:03,180
Excuse me, darling.

5590
04:54:03,180 --> 04:54:06,180
I'm listening to the PCP right now.

5591
04:54:06,180 --> 04:54:08,180
It's so interesting.

5592
04:54:10,180 --> 04:54:12,180
It's just so funny how many times

5593
04:54:12,180 --> 04:54:14,180
it says PCP on this cover.

5594
04:54:16,180 --> 04:54:18,180
PCP. PCP.

5595
04:54:18,180 --> 04:54:20,180
PCP. Yeah, three times.

5596
04:54:20,180 --> 04:54:22,180
Perfect Crime Party in the back.

5597
04:54:27,180 --> 04:54:29,180
We can have guest contributors.

5598
04:54:29,180 --> 04:54:30,180
Yeah.

5599
04:54:30,180 --> 04:54:32,180
People can contribute if they're...

5600
04:54:32,180 --> 04:54:34,180
Maybe Cheesy wants to put one of their comics

5601
04:54:34,180 --> 04:54:36,180
in the magazine.

5602
04:54:36,180 --> 04:54:37,180
Sure.

5603
04:54:37,180 --> 04:54:39,180
A new alien girlfriend.

5604
04:54:39,180 --> 04:54:40,180
Sure.

5605
04:54:40,180 --> 04:54:41,180
Or just...

5606
04:54:41,180 --> 04:54:43,180
I mean, I was just thinking like...

5607
04:54:43,180 --> 04:54:45,180
Any old fucking idiot

5608
04:54:45,180 --> 04:54:46,180
sends this shit.

5609
04:54:46,180 --> 04:54:48,180
Any old fucking loser.

5610
04:54:48,180 --> 04:54:49,180
Any fucking loser.

5611
04:54:49,180 --> 04:54:50,180
I mean, it would...

5612
04:54:50,180 --> 04:54:51,180
Little scribbler, little scribe.

5613
04:54:51,180 --> 04:54:53,180
It'd have to be a little bit good.

5614
04:54:53,180 --> 04:54:55,180
It'd have to be decent, but...

5615
04:54:55,180 --> 04:54:57,180
Nah, we'll do it like the voicemails.

5616
04:54:57,180 --> 04:54:59,180
Any old shit.

5617
04:54:59,180 --> 04:55:01,180
You know what? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5618
04:55:01,180 --> 04:55:02,180
You're right. You're right.

5619
04:55:02,180 --> 04:55:04,180
Open it up in submissions.

5620
04:55:04,180 --> 04:55:05,180
No submit...

5621
04:55:05,180 --> 04:55:06,180
No approval process.

5622
04:55:06,180 --> 04:55:07,180
Just anyone...

5623
04:55:10,180 --> 04:55:11,180
It has to be a comic.

5624
04:55:11,180 --> 04:55:13,180
That's the only rule.

5625
04:55:14,180 --> 04:55:15,180
Okay.

5626
04:55:17,180 --> 04:55:18,180
Single panel comics.

5627
04:55:18,180 --> 04:55:19,180
Based.

5628
04:55:19,180 --> 04:55:21,180
Like Beast Capades are allowed.

5629
04:55:22,180 --> 04:55:23,180
Yeah.

5630
04:55:24,180 --> 04:55:25,180
Cause you got like...

5631
04:55:25,180 --> 04:55:27,180
A panel and then text under.

5632
04:55:27,180 --> 04:55:28,180
My...

5633
04:55:29,180 --> 04:55:31,180
Page size...

5634
04:55:31,180 --> 04:55:33,180
The Clarissa and Beast Capades

5635
04:55:33,180 --> 04:55:35,180
have different page sizes.

5636
04:55:35,180 --> 04:55:36,180
But...

5637
04:55:36,180 --> 04:55:38,180
I mean, whatever.

5638
04:55:39,180 --> 04:55:41,180
Yeah, I was assuming it'd be like...

5639
04:55:41,180 --> 04:55:42,180
Two...

5640
04:55:42,180 --> 04:55:44,180
Two panels per page or something.

5641
04:55:45,180 --> 04:55:47,180
Yeah, you could figure that out.

5642
04:55:47,180 --> 04:55:49,180
Figure it out, yeah.

5643
04:55:51,180 --> 04:55:52,180
Hey, that feels good.

5644
04:55:52,180 --> 04:55:53,180
Hey.

5645
04:55:53,180 --> 04:55:54,180
It's good.

5646
04:55:54,180 --> 04:55:55,180
Feeling good about it.

5647
04:55:55,180 --> 04:55:56,180
Yeah.

5648
04:55:56,180 --> 04:55:57,180
Shuffed.

5649
04:55:57,180 --> 04:55:58,180
Nice job.

5650
04:55:58,180 --> 04:55:59,180
Hey, nice job.

5651
04:55:59,180 --> 04:56:00,180
Nice job.

5652
04:56:00,180 --> 04:56:01,180
Thanks.

5653
04:56:01,180 --> 04:56:03,180
Hey, thanks for offering solutions.

5654
04:56:03,180 --> 04:56:05,180
Instead of just wallowing.

5655
04:56:06,180 --> 04:56:07,180
Yeah, it's funny.

5656
04:56:07,180 --> 04:56:08,180
Cause like I feel...

5657
04:56:08,180 --> 04:56:10,180
I feel in the same like...

5658
04:56:11,180 --> 04:56:13,180
Area of depression.

5659
04:56:13,180 --> 04:56:15,180
But I don't feel like wallowing.

5660
04:56:15,180 --> 04:56:16,180
I just feel like nothing.

5661
04:56:16,180 --> 04:56:19,180
But this was like easy to think of.

5662
04:56:19,180 --> 04:56:20,180
Like yeah, that could be fun.

5663
04:56:20,180 --> 04:56:21,180
Wow.

5664
04:56:21,180 --> 04:56:22,180
Yeah, let's fucking do it.

5665
04:56:22,180 --> 04:56:23,180
It's very impressive.

5666
04:56:24,180 --> 04:56:25,180
I'm so smart.

5667
04:56:25,180 --> 04:56:26,180
You're very smart.

5668
04:56:26,180 --> 04:56:27,180
Thank you.

5669
04:56:27,180 --> 04:56:28,180
You did a great...

5670
04:56:28,180 --> 04:56:29,180
You did a good job.

5671
04:56:31,180 --> 04:56:33,180
But I mean it though.

5672
04:56:34,180 --> 04:56:35,180
Alright, let's do it.

5673
04:56:35,180 --> 04:56:36,180
Let's make it happen.

5674
04:56:36,180 --> 04:56:37,180
We'll work on it.

5675
04:56:37,180 --> 04:56:38,180
We'll workshop it.

5676
04:56:39,180 --> 04:56:41,180
And that's the episode of the

5677
04:56:41,180 --> 04:56:42,180
Procrastinators podcast.

5678
04:56:42,180 --> 04:56:44,180
That's the episode of the Procrastinators podcast.

5679
04:56:44,180 --> 04:56:45,180
Become a patron.

5680
04:56:45,180 --> 04:56:46,180
Wait, shit.

5681
04:56:46,180 --> 04:56:48,180
We should make a patron exclusive.

5682
04:56:48,180 --> 04:56:50,180
Oh, but I don't want to.

5683
04:56:50,180 --> 04:56:52,180
No, I don't care about that.

5684
04:56:52,180 --> 04:56:54,180
I'm gonna make my comic...

5685
04:56:54,180 --> 04:56:57,180
I'm gonna make my comic like free anyway.

5686
04:56:57,180 --> 04:56:58,180
Ah, fuck.

5687
04:56:59,180 --> 04:57:00,180
Yeah, me too.

5688
04:57:00,180 --> 04:57:01,180
This is a motivational tool.

5689
04:57:01,180 --> 04:57:03,180
This is not a money-making scheme.

5690
04:57:04,180 --> 04:57:05,180
Yeah.

5691
04:57:06,180 --> 04:57:07,180
Fine.

5692
04:57:08,180 --> 04:57:09,180
Alright.

5693
04:57:11,180 --> 04:57:12,180
I'll make...

5694
04:57:12,180 --> 04:57:14,180
I'll have to make money some other way.

5695
04:57:14,180 --> 04:57:15,180
Like a chump.

5696
04:57:16,180 --> 04:57:17,180
Maybe...

5697
04:57:17,180 --> 04:57:18,180
Alright, how about this?

5698
04:57:18,180 --> 04:57:20,180
Patron exclusive benefit.

5699
04:57:21,180 --> 04:57:25,180
You get to be one of the supporters in the comic.

5700
04:57:25,180 --> 04:57:26,180
In the magazine.

5701
04:57:26,180 --> 04:57:27,180
Yeah, that's true.

5702
04:57:27,180 --> 04:57:28,180
Support a page.

5703
04:57:28,180 --> 04:57:29,180
See, that's true.

5704
04:57:29,180 --> 04:57:30,180
A thank you page.

5705
04:57:30,180 --> 04:57:31,180
You know, why not?

5706
04:57:31,180 --> 04:57:33,180
We can do thank you pages.

5707
04:57:34,180 --> 04:57:36,180
It's not a bad idea.

5708
04:57:36,180 --> 04:57:37,180
Yeah, okay.

5709
04:57:37,180 --> 04:57:38,180
That makes sense.

5710
04:57:38,180 --> 04:57:41,180
The coolest members are...

5711
04:57:41,180 --> 04:57:42,180
This guy.

5712
04:57:42,180 --> 04:57:43,180
This guy.

5713
04:57:43,180 --> 04:57:45,180
They will be ranked in terms of money.

5714
04:57:45,180 --> 04:57:46,180
Yeah.

5715
04:57:46,180 --> 04:57:47,180
Yeah.

5716
04:57:47,180 --> 04:57:48,180
Alright.

5717
04:57:48,180 --> 04:57:49,180
Good.

5718
04:57:49,180 --> 04:57:51,180
It's all coming together.

5719
04:57:51,180 --> 04:57:53,180
I don't know how to make a PDF.

5720
04:57:54,180 --> 04:57:55,180
That's okay.

5721
04:57:55,180 --> 04:57:58,180
I'll be in charge of making the PDF.

5722
04:57:58,180 --> 04:57:59,180
Okay.

5723
04:57:59,180 --> 04:58:03,180
We should work together on the logo and stuff.

5724
04:58:03,180 --> 04:58:04,180
Alright.

5725
04:58:04,180 --> 04:58:05,180
I'll think about it.

5726
04:58:05,180 --> 04:58:06,180
I'll work on it.

5727
04:58:07,180 --> 04:58:08,180
Yeah.

5728
04:58:08,180 --> 04:58:09,180
Alright.

5729
04:58:09,180 --> 04:58:10,180
Sick.

5730
04:58:10,180 --> 04:58:11,180
Sick.

5731
04:58:11,180 --> 04:58:12,180
Exciting.

5732
04:58:12,180 --> 04:58:13,180
Exciting stuff.

5733
04:58:15,180 --> 04:58:20,180
It's all work on the next chapter to get it ready in time.

5734
04:58:21,180 --> 04:58:23,180
Not necessarily for next week.

5735
04:58:23,180 --> 04:58:24,180
Do you have a deadline?

5736
04:58:24,180 --> 04:58:31,180
I think it would be cool if this could be a February thing.

5737
04:58:31,180 --> 04:58:33,180
We'd launch it in February.

5738
04:58:33,180 --> 04:58:34,180
Hmm.

5739
04:58:34,180 --> 04:58:37,180
We got new chapters of the thing and it's the first episode.

5740
04:58:37,180 --> 04:58:38,180
Probably.

5741
04:58:38,180 --> 04:58:40,180
Issue one of the perfect comic party.

5742
04:58:42,180 --> 04:58:45,180
I'm sure I could do something by February.

5743
04:58:46,180 --> 04:58:47,180
Alright.

5744
04:58:47,180 --> 04:58:48,180
Alright.

5745
04:58:48,180 --> 04:58:49,180
Sounds good.

5746
04:58:49,180 --> 04:58:50,180
Base.

5747
04:58:50,180 --> 04:58:51,180
Base.

5748
04:58:52,180 --> 04:58:53,180
Alright.

5749
04:58:53,180 --> 04:58:54,180
Let's end the episode here.

5750
04:58:54,180 --> 04:58:55,180
Right now.

5751
04:58:55,180 --> 04:58:56,180
Yeah.

5752
04:58:56,180 --> 04:58:57,180
Anna.

5753
04:58:57,180 --> 04:58:58,180
Anna.

5754
04:58:58,180 --> 04:58:59,180
Become a patron.

5755
04:58:59,180 --> 04:59:02,180
You'll be in a thank you page of that thing we just talked about.

5756
04:59:02,180 --> 04:59:03,180
Probably.

5757
04:59:03,180 --> 04:59:05,180
That's the end of the episode.

5758
04:59:05,180 --> 04:59:06,180
Yeah.

5759
04:59:06,180 --> 04:59:07,180
Goodbye.

5760
04:59:07,180 --> 04:59:08,180
That's the end of the episode.

5761
04:59:08,180 --> 04:59:09,180
Goodbye.

5762
04:59:09,180 --> 04:59:10,180
Send in speak type stuff.

5763
04:59:10,180 --> 04:59:11,180
Yeah.

5764
04:59:11,180 --> 04:59:12,180
Whatever.

5765
04:59:12,180 --> 04:59:13,180
Link in the description.

5766
04:59:13,180 --> 04:59:14,180
Whatever.

5767
04:59:14,180 --> 04:59:15,180
Bye.

5768
04:59:15,180 --> 04:59:16,180
Goodbye.
