00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,840
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:54,640
I am the best guy ever, and today we're joined by Lethal Aurora Mage.

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:20,680
Today's PCP is brought to you by My Burning Rage, aka Fighting.

4
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,000
That's what the topic is.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,480
My deep frustration at the female gender for not condescending to have sex with me.

6
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,640
I will fight them for this.

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Where is it?

8
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Why is it?

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
What could it be?

10
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
You're the worst.

11
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,320
You're so bad at intro-ings, topics that you didn't think was good.

12
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,800
This is a real shit.

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,640
What do you mean where is fighting?

14
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,200
Let's just fight about this right now.

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Where did it go?

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,440
Why is fighting not a thing we can just do in society?

17
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,440
It sounds like you want to fight about it.

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,440
Why are we all trying to be fucking civilized and advanced?

19
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,400
Why aren't we supposed to address the previous episode thingy segment, or do we do it?

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
Actually, that happens after our main section here.

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,360
We do the whole big topic and then we do that thing.

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Now I have to remember for like an hour.

23
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,600
Is there something special you want to mention though?

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
We could do it.

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Yes.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Is something important you want to bring up?

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,240
Yeah, because I was contacted by a concerned Lithuanian because of the last episode and

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,040
he was concerned that I painted a poor image of Lithuania.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,400
What do you mean poor?

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,560
It sounds like a fallout for Radioactive, awesome.

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,800
I just want to clarify, you know, that was, I'm picturing Mad Max basically, like Mad

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Max, Lithuania.

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,320
I haven't seen Mad Max, so I can't confirm.

34
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,560
People can use their imaginations.

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,760
Yeah, just keep in mind that was back when I was a little kid and I was born just a year

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,160
after Lithuania got its independence.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,800
So it was kind of a little bit in chaos and I'm not sure maybe in the capital it was

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,680
better than it was where I lived, but those experiences, you know, those are, that's

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
how I lived.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,480
I lived in a poor family in a poor neighborhood and that was my experience.

41
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,200
However, I want to make note that like today, Lithuania has done a lot of work to be a lot

42
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,120
more presentable and it's all pretty and nice and even where I live now, it's like

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
super nice.

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
I even see tourists.

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,920
That's so weird.

46
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Tourists.

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Imagine that.

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
My little town.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,140
That's so weird.

50
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,480
This was before they came to see all the fighting.

51
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
That's what they came to see.

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Yeah.

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,120
They want to see the roaming gangs.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,120
This is before Mage, quote unquote, painted the town purple, if you will.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,360
I was going to say, the Lithuania was independent and then its new savior was born to bring

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,760
it into a new age of purple and greatness.

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,600
The Lithuanian warrior who would bring the super predators to heal, the violent violence,

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
if you will.

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Well, the rebels.

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Oh my God.

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
The violent violence.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Dude.

63
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
That's fighting.

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
Fighting guys is real and here it is.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
What is fighting?

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,760
I'm going to tell you.

67
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,240
In some countries such as South Korea, fighting is used as words of cheer.

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,400
The meaning of fighting is similar to the meaning of let's go or do your best or good

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
luck.

70
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Oh my God.

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Fight on.

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
This is like, you ever see an anime when like you'll see like sexy anime girls will

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,000
like be cheering on their friends and they'll go, fight all, fight all.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,240
I think that's, and that just means like do, like do your best, do some, do some work.

75
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Urban dictionary.

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,520
This is actually the worst definition you've ever forced me to read.

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,200
I'm going to beat the shit out of this master and work.

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,640
Yeah, I was going to say definitely.

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
And it's holding a gun to your head.

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Here's a better one.

81
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
Here's a better one.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Definition two, fighting, physical contact, or in other cases arguing or disagreeing with

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,640
others, including teammates like dance groups, soccer clubs, what the fuck.

84
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
I don't know why it brought these up.

85
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,240
It's such a weird way to put it.

86
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,920
Like fighting is like a disagreement between human beings such as dance groups.

87
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Yes.

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,080
Like, are you aware of these types of groups of, are they just like really a big, big fan

89
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,440
of like fucking like dance off movies or something and they're just like, yeah, yeah.

90
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Okay.

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
It's like, bring it on.

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Bring it on or something.

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Yeah.

94
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
I mean, okay.

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Okay.

96
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
All right.

97
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
We're fucking entries on Urban Dictionary.

98
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
That's a little terrible.

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Yeah.

100
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
The right kind.

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Man.

102
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
All right.

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
I want to start.

104
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Okay.

105
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Go for it.

106
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Go for it.

107
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,880
I want to start by saying the, the fights that I've had in my youth and adult life, which

108
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,920
are like innumerable.

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,440
I kill everyone I see.

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,840
No, it's actually, it's actually, I've never really had a proper fight.

111
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,760
I've been in lots of like little boy scuffles in the playground where you sort of push

112
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,000
each other and sort of grab at things, but you don't really do anything and, and you

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
know, kick.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,840
But like, um, I've never punched someone in, in the jaw, like a good old fisticuss, except

115
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,680
for that one time D'Vu asked us all to do that to him for a, for a, for a meme, a rad

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
car.

117
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,680
And I was like, one of the most uncomfortable moments of my entire life, I remember that.

118
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,320
The way I saw it was like, Oh, D'Vu, are you sure?

119
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,040
Because I want to do that.

120
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,080
Not because it's you, but because I just want to know what it feels like to really punch

121
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
someone in the jaw.

122
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
And he was like, yeah, go on, go on, do it.

123
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,360
And I'm like, all right, this is going to be cool.

124
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,120
And I did it.

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
And now I know what it means to be a fighter.

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm a fucking UFC champion.

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
How hard did you hit him?

128
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,560
Um, I didn't go like as hard as I possibly could because you did not clean his clock.

129
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,320
No, I didn't actually want to hurt him, but like, I wanted to make him like, because he

130
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,440
was saying explicitly, I wanted to make him regret this decision.

131
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
And he explicitly said, no, as hard as you can, I'm like, all right, I'll hit you hard

132
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
then.

133
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
I will hit you hard.

134
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Well, that's because he's a madman.

135
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Yeah.

136
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,880
And so I, you know, I put pretty, you know, I've never punched someone.

137
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
So I don't know whether it was actually a strong punch or not.

138
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Probably wasn't.

139
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah.

140
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,880
But like, yeah, that's, that's my, that's my, it feels satisfactory.

141
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,720
Was your curiosity sated by this blow?

142
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,400
Um, I mean, if you crave more bloodshed, you want to wake in the beast within, you know,

143
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
what it did.

144
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,840
And I pushed everyone in the chin every single day.

145
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,680
Hand shakes are just too beta now.

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,720
It's a punch in the jaw.

147
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,200
That's how you say hi.

148
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,640
I distinctly remember that.

149
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,320
Uh, and I, if who asked me to do, I mean, you know, everyone who was there did ride

150
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
con too.

151
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,760
Uh, I gave him like the lightest of taps because it was just so, just strange situation

152
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
to be in.

153
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,400
Uh, but anyway, but anyway, getting away from that, um, I also have never, ever been in

154
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
a proper fight.

155
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,360
But when I was young, I did do, I took like a handful of karate classes.

156
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,880
I, I'm pretty sure I did that.

157
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
I might even be wrong.

158
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,560
No, no, I'm pretty sure I did.

159
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,480
Um, I went there and we like grappled a little bit.

160
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,920
I mean, because I was like really young when I did it, like, like 10, maybe.

161
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,280
I can remember 10 years old.

162
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,560
10 years old was when I started my Pokemon journey and I've never stopped ever since.

163
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,920
I do remember playing Pokemon.

164
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,360
I remember a D this made me want to fight.

165
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,200
I remember the deep frustration I had at not being able to figure out how to leave the

166
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,080
first house in Pokemon red, because you have to walk down on the carpet on the bottom

167
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
of the house.

168
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,560
Why the hell would that mean you have to leave?

169
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,800
And to that day, I've hated Pokemon forever.

170
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,520
Well, I mean, that took me all of like 15 seconds to figure it out.

171
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Well, fuck you.

172
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
It didn't make any sense.

173
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,120
I know the feeling because I think I made that mistake as well in Pokemon blue.

174
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Bad conveyance.

175
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Bad conveyance.

176
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
That's what it was.

177
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Get out of here.

178
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
You go after it.

179
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Um, yeah, exactly.

180
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,400
I, I know I was, I went to karate classes.

181
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I played Pokemon at the karate classes.

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
I went there all the time.

183
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
We did sparring.

184
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
It was cool.

185
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,120
And I fought and it was sick and it's, and it was like with pads and stuff.

186
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,560
I got into one fight in school and it was the, the, the, I didn't, I didn't get to hit

187
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,720
anybody, but I did have an awesome shown in the anime moment.

188
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,920
Um, so, so the whole, the reason there was like backstory to this fight is that there

189
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,280
was this kid who constantly picked on me and gave me shit.

190
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,960
And I was like a fat tubby beta bitch back in the day.

191
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Okay.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,920
So I would just like fucking roll over and let this guy steam roll over me and it pissed

193
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
me off more and more.

194
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,840
Like, and this went on for like two or three years.

195
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,000
He would like steal all my stuff and like all this crazy shit.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,400
And then one day just like in gym class, I forget something, something happened, something

197
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,640
snapped and we got into like a legitimate like fight and, and, and, and I just like

198
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,440
got up in his face and I do just fucking leave me alone.

199
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
I'm sick of this shit.

200
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,120
And he just cold cocked me right in the face and I can fucking like my lips started bleeding

201
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
and everything.

202
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
And it was like, everything froze for a second and everybody stopped and I just stood there

203
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,280
like totally unfazed by his blow and just wiped the blood away.

204
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,640
And then he immediately ran like fucking bolted.

205
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,440
And so he was much faster than me.

206
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,840
So I could not catch up to him, but, um, he ran.

207
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,600
I thought you ran.

208
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, I was ready to fucking lay this guy out because like I'm a big fat

209
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,040
guy. So I'm twice his size, but he's twice as fast.

210
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,760
So I'm trying to chase after him and he's running away.

211
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,440
And then the gym teacher breaks us up right as I'm about to lay into him because he like

212
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,400
got to the door and was too scared to open the door.

213
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,240
And I was about to fucking unload.

214
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,480
And then we got sent to the principal's office and I got suspended too.

215
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,920
If we're getting punched in the face, that's so strange the way that works.

216
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,480
That seems to be like how it works.

217
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,840
Like when there's a fight, they suspend both people, even if one like is the obvious

218
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,880
aggressor, I guess it's because.

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,680
Well, they think you're a fucking pussy.

220
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,400
I mean, I don't actually know.

221
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,960
I don't know if it does happen to me when I hear something funny.

222
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,720
Yes. OK, so like in my childhood, there was

223
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,800
a kid that I would fight a lot with and he was a cubby boy as well.

224
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,240
And his name was Tom. Oh, oh, oh, my God.

225
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,400
You cold cocks me and J-Class mage, mage.

226
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,960
And then you ran away to Lithuania.

227
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,040
This is what was a purple blur. I never knew.

228
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,520
Deep floor.

229
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,720
I was a boy then, apparently, as well.

230
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,360
Jesus.

231
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,840
Damn, well, that's fascinating.

232
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,800
We've had trans representation of the PCP this entire time.

233
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,200
That's true. That's true.

234
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,960
For all of our horrible comments.

235
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,720
Well, I'm a trans anime girl.

236
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,560
But beyond that, like, Tom, did you?

237
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,080
So like, do you remember at all what sparked that?

238
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,440
Like, what finally made him hit you?

239
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
I think I think it was just some stupid, like, bullshit about whatever we were

240
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
doing in gym class.

241
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,760
But it was like, it was it was just like a thinly veiled excuse for everything

242
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,160
that had been building up over these last two or three years to finally.

243
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,040
The straw that broke the camel's back. Correct.

244
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,520
So that's that's how that's how it happened.

245
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,760
And you know what?

246
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,920
That that is that, you know, that it's very interesting.

247
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,040
There was a similar story that did not happen to me,

248
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,760
but happened to one of my close friends.

249
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's call him a rocket.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,520
I've decided I want to start not saying people's actual names.

251
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,240
OK, so. So rocket raccoon was your buddy.

252
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,400
Basically, yeah. OK.

253
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
So so so rocket here.

254
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,520
There was this guy.

255
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,960
We were, you know, this was a freshman year in college, as I recall.

256
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,640
And I got to know this guy like halfway through freshman year.

257
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,040
And we became great friends.

258
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,800
But like later on in freshman year, there was this guy.

259
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,400
I believe his name. I'm going to say his name.

260
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,680
I believe his name was Rishi. I believe his name was Rishi.

261
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,960
He was like an Indian name or something.

262
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't remember.

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,880
But it was something like that Rishi.

264
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,160
And so this guy was just like an IRL shit poster

265
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,200
who would do things like you'd be getting food with the guy.

266
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,920
And he'd say something.

267
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,160
He'd be like, oh, man, I really want like vanilla ice cream.

268
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,960
And you'd be like, oh, yeah, I really like vanilla.

269
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,360
He'd be like, haha, I hate vanilla. It sucks. It's shit. Got you.

270
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,520
And then you're like, oh, OK.

271
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,840
No, it was things along that line.

272
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,920
Like he would simply like just say falsehoods

273
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,200
and then catch you in believing his lies.

274
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,080
Just a very mundane things like that.

275
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,720
Just and I guess it gave him some sort of jolly, some sort of thrill.

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,320
But so the point is just like he would he did this like for this

277
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,080
for the whole year.

278
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,120
He lived on the same floor as Rocket.

279
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,480
And Rocket is this short Jewish kid,

280
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,240
whatever, like good friend of mine.

281
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,480
But the thing is he had done Krav Maga, I believe was Krav Maga.

282
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,880
I might just be saying that because he's Jewish,

283
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,400
but I'm pretty sure it was Krav Maga.

284
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,960
What is that?

285
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,920
And so he knew he knew his shit.

286
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,320
He knew how to handle himself.

287
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
Oh, Krav Maga is like the Israeli martial arts.

288
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
They do the army gets trained.

289
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,720
So it's it's serious.

290
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,680
It's like this is how Gal Gadot took out those Palestinian children.

291
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,400
Krav Maga.

292
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,640
So we're talking about the serious shown in shit.

293
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,880
All right.

294
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,240
And so what one day Rishi, just for whatever reason,

295
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,760
to be the hilarious madman that he was simply stood in front of of Rocket's

296
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
door with his hands like across like blocking the door and just said,

297
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,360
ha, ha, you can't come into your room like Rocket's room.

298
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,320
Rishi, who did not live with him, was just standing there

299
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,960
saying you can't come into your room.

300
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,560
And Rocket is is is is a is a small, calm, peaceful creature.

301
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,720
But at this something snapped, something snapped at this moment.

302
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,480
He had simply had enough.

303
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,920
So so my boy Rocket just calmly lifts his fucking leg,

304
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,360
twist himself sideways and just fucking donkey kicks him right in the fucking

305
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,120
chest and sends him a hurdling across the fucking room, crashing into a pile

306
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,520
on the other side of the fucking room and has vacated the doorway now.

307
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's go.

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,480
That's how you handle problems.

309
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,240
That's how you handle fucking people giving you shit.

310
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,760
And so Rishi just stands up, goes, what the fuck, dude?

311
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,720
And then just runs away and that's that's what it was.

312
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,480
That that's what that kind of leads me into something I wanted to bring up

313
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,680
and kind of you're a hero rocket.

314
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,600
But God, the main reasons I decided to be on this episode.

315
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,440
Do you think?

316
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,520
Because I do think I think that we have we have unjustly banished fighting

317
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,160
from our our culture.

318
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,360
I think absolutely.

319
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,440
I think I think it's I think there's just something primal in us

320
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,120
that like physical conflict can solve problems and strengthen bonds and make

321
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,480
and clear things up quickly and efficiently through physical combat.

322
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,640
And I think exercising that for more sophisticated means of conflict

323
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,680
resolution has made us worse as a species.

324
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,040
Yeah, I definitely agree.

325
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,720
I just think I definitely I feel like you know what's interesting,

326
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,600
mate, I was going to say, I bet this issue is a very male, female divide.

327
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,880
I was everybody.

328
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,400
I kind of I kind of agree with that, mate.

329
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,840
It's just the way the brains work and stuff.

330
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,640
I feel like there's definitely male bonding that I've never truly experienced

331
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,360
by eating a shit out of somebody and then coming to resolution.

332
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,560
I think I think we're all going to have to fight at RAGCon four.

333
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,720
So we're going to strengthen our bonds.

334
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,000
Mage versus the world.

335
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,880
I tell this for a while in the way that, yes,

336
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,640
it is more of like a female thing to not use violence.

337
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,360
But people are like generally scared of violence because you could get a medical

338
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,880
bill if you get hurt badly and it's like, oh, I don't want to be responsible

339
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,120
if I could go to jail.

340
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,040
But it's like it's turned like most men into like weak soy boy

341
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,960
pussies who don't do anything like they like not to make fun.

342
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
We are not immune from this.

343
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,760
We are just as guilty as we don't like not to like belittle women necessarily.

344
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,600
It is just like the other women are weak in the way that they don't fight.

345
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,720
But like fighting does like.

346
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,360
I don't know.

347
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,600
Is there's like a biological primal?

348
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,920
Yeah, there's a biological reason that like it's self preservation.

349
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,960
Like males used to fight for dominance, for attention,

350
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,280
whatever females have to preserve themselves because they bear children

351
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,320
and harm to them, harm to the whole, you know, species.

352
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:19,920
Yeah.

353
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,320
And it's like a lot of people.

354
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Well, yeah, but like men, they they they they fight like that

355
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,800
and they communicate through physical violence and grandstanding

356
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,160
and being like, oh, look at me, I've got ripple dabs and giant penis.

357
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
And I'm really tall and I'm a snushew.

358
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,720
Yeah, yeah, we got to communicate so much back to the ancient Greeks.

359
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,960
We got to just strip naked and go into the arena.

360
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,560
But like, yeah, but what I'm getting at is like

361
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,560
men aren't as good at expressing emotions in other ways with with like speech.

362
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,600
It's like a lot of enemies, a lot of guys just, you know, fight it out

363
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,160
and then become best friends.

364
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,680
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

365
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,320
That speaks to something inherent in our brains.

366
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,560
And it's not like every man has to be like that.

367
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,440
But every man at the moment is like forced to be like that

368
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,120
because if you do anything, you're going to jail and nobody wants that.

369
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,000
So nobody ever works anything.

370
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,680
And it's like, I mean, fuck, you know what it is.

371
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,880
There's been a trend these days.

372
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,640
And this is a real fact that it's a real fact that these days

373
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,080
women do much better than men in like the school system.

374
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,720
Oh, and I was having at least a little conversation with a friend about this.

375
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

376
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,400
And like the reason that people bring up a lot, you know, this has been said a lot,

377
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,240
but that we we have sort of catered our educational system

378
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,600
to cater to girls because girls are more peaceful.

379
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,800
They are like more calm.

380
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,680
They learn model student, you know, and they say boys are treated as defective girls.

381
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,040
Yeah, I feel like I feel like you watch the same videos I did.

382
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,000
Probably. Probably. I've seen quite a few about this.

383
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,880
Well, I mean, like even like, you know, back in like the 80s and shit,

384
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,760
if you got into a fight in school, like the gym teacher would ref it

385
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,560
and then you just fucking hash it out.

386
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,960
And then when you're done, like you just parted ways.

387
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,160
Like, you know, you know what it is?

388
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,080
That's how shit used to get settled, man.

389
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,320
It's also that's the thing.

390
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,480
It's also the helicopter parents as well.

391
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,280
Like, you know, they don't want their kids to get hurt.

392
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Right. Right.

393
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,560
That's exactly what I was going to say.

394
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,040
It's just it seems to me it's it's this it's a risk aversion

395
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,760
that I think is the is the main like driving factor here.

396
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,480
It's that, like, if you're like the baby boomer generation was a

397
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,560
generation that had like they had like a million siblings.

398
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,520
And that was still that was like right after World War Two.

399
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,360
And those guys were like, like the times hadn't changed it.

400
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,000
But with the baby boomer generation, with like all the civil rights

401
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,120
stuff happening and like the way the world's changing and everything's

402
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
becoming like safer and more like organized and neat.

403
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,400
I feel like the baby boomer generations because this is definitely

404
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,880
my experience with my parents.

405
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,360
My parents are maybe it's just the world like the way the media has changed

406
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
things, the way we were aware of so much stuff that's happened.

407
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,440
For example, like child like like kidnapping, you know, like rape,

408
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,920
molestation, all that stuff has plummeted.

409
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,840
And yet concerned from parents is that an all time high and and like

410
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,280
parents don't want their kids like it feels like it's bigger than ever

411
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,640
because we get more coverage for the small events that do happen.

412
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,360
Exactly. And just like in the same way that this gives us a blind spot

413
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,680
with stuff like that, like you'd be very safe, much safer than you've ever

414
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,360
been in history to let your kids play outside, even at a young age.

415
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,720
But like it we don't we don't perceive it that way.

416
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,600
Exactly because we hear more about the same things that does happen.

417
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,760
Like I said, like last episode, I was just like it's the last episode,

418
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,640
you know, when I was like six, five, six years old, and I was allowed

419
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,440
to go play alone in the neighborhood, even though, as I said, toxic dump.

420
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,880
Yeah, you said like the neighborhood was terrible with like lots of terrible people.

421
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,000
But, you know, I wasn't looked after.

422
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,200
But like nowadays, my sister has a child that's my nephew.

423
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,200
And she probably wouldn't let him go play without supervision,

424
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,240
even even though the neighborhood is very small and very easily monitored.

425
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,800
And the weird thing is, though, like if you if you are the one parent

426
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,200
who like breaks this trend and decides to let their kid run around outside

427
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,640
like in America, you get fucking arrested or like neglect or something.

428
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,160
It's the whole culture is shifting a huge way.

429
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,200
The thing it's the same as like as like, you know,

430
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,520
letting your kids like fall over and graze their knees or like bruise themselves

431
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,320
or and do all this sort of stuff.

432
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,440
You're supposed to let them, you know, catch colds and and run around in mud

433
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,560
occasionally, not all the time.

434
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,600
You're not supposed to encourage it.

435
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,480
But like if you let them make mistakes like that, they then learn by themselves

436
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,760
instead of being told and you can't go outside in the woods.

437
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,000
It's it's full of bugs and bugs are scary.

438
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
You are scared of bugs.

439
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,360
And then it like it it ends up with like, you know, people my age

440
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,920
are like, they're so sheltered that they like a bug.

441
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,160
I can't I can't deal.

442
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,760
I mean, I know people can't deal with bugs, but like so many people can't deal

443
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,160
with any bugs and in any capacity.

444
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,400
And I'm like, yeah, you are an adult and you are a hand for my friends with them.

445
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,880
It's like like we have a bunch of adults who are like need babying.

446
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,920
They they are a handful and I can't imagine like getting along with them.

447
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,400
Yeah. And you know what?

448
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,280
This reminds me, I think the real problem here is utopian thinking.

449
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,560
And it reminds me of like my current like favorite phrase in the world.

450
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
It's a popular one, but it's still my favorite.

451
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,600
It's the perfect is the enemy of the good.

452
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,880
And this is what like society, I think we would all agree would be better off

453
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,000
if we are a little bit less helicopter parenty over our kids.

454
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,880
But the thing is, though, if you are less helicopter parenty

455
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,640
and you are the one in a million parent who gets your child kidnapped

456
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,320
and like killed or whatever, then like even if on a utilitarian perspective

457
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,240
that the greater good has gained more than has been lost by this one child

458
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,000
who was just, you know, by freak coincidence happened to be the one

459
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,920
who was kidnapped and like destroyed and fucking destroyed in a game of Pokemon Smash.

460
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,360
Then, you know, like then you'll feel like, oh, no, like this was a huge mistake.

461
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,640
What I have done and it's a risk aversion.

462
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,480
That's why I keep saying it.

463
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,920
And like our perfect society, everyone wants like the utopia

464
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,640
where no one's ever hurt.

465
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,040
Everyone's perfect all the time.

466
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,520
We all grow up into perfect people and there's never any suffering.

467
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,040
But that's not real life.

468
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,000
Suffering is an inevitable, unescapable part of being a human.

469
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,240
I think we should we need to be exposed to it to toughen us the fuck up.

470
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,160
The thing is, though, a lot of these laws and enforcements of this sort of behavior

471
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,040
is because people look at like the worst case scenarios.

472
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,000
And if we are even more lenient than the people who are actually terrible

473
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
to their children and stuff would get away with it.

474
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,400
And that's what we're trying to prevent, but in doing so,

475
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,360
we're also enforcing the sort of helicopter parenting.

476
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,520
It's kind of sad because like if you if it's a group

477
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,280
we're trying to prepare kids for a perfect world, you know,

478
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,000
you want to give them that perfect world, you want to give them that perfect life.

479
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,680
And because you're sculpting them for this like kind of utopian life,

480
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,080
they're too free to deal with what actually is.

481
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,360
But if you prepare them for what actually is a world where like you're going to get hurt

482
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,560
and you're going to get fucked up, you're going to be better equipped to deal with the world.

483
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,040
And you will have a better life.

484
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,440
So like it's counterintuitive.

485
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,920
But like you got to like let your kids know that shit's not going to work out all the time.

486
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,120
You really do.

487
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,760
Like there's a there's a fantastic episode of Star Trek The Next Generation.

488
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,760
I can't remember the name of fans, one of the most famous.

489
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,560
But the premise is just that I know this is fiction,

490
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,480
but it's that Cap'n Picard gets to relive a moment in his life.

491
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,400
One of his defining moments where he he got stabbed through the heart.

492
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,880
And I mean, he got he was saved because they live in the future

493
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,040
and they had technology to save him.

494
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,440
But he got his fucking heart stabbed and he almost died.

495
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,320
And like he gets he goes back and he changes that history so that that never happened.

496
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,560
And what it made what it did to him was it made him like much more of a pussy

497
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,800
and like much less like he had never been exposed to that kind of danger and like overcome it.

498
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,800
So he just was more of a pussy.

499
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,080
And so he was like instead of being like a fucking badass captain that everyone loves,

500
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,480
a philosopher god king, he is like just some pussy researcher

501
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,560
who like he has a fine life, but it's nowhere near as like amazing

502
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,880
or as like beneficial to the world or the universe as like the Captain Picard

503
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,160
that did exist who went through this like it was a it was a dumb thing he did.

504
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,440
He like fought a guy in a bar.

505
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,760
He got fucking stabbed through the heart.

506
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
And like if he had lived in the past, he would have died.

507
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,280
But it's those experiences that made him like such a fucking badass.

508
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,280
And you know, like that's really just what we're talking about here.

509
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,400
And it reminds me that.

510
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,920
Oh yeah, go on, go on.

511
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm absolutely convinced that if I grew up in a more like

512
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,080
not necessarily a violent world, but like a world that allowed expression

513
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,480
through physical stuff rather than speech,

514
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,880
I would like be a much more confident, you know, person in general.

515
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,000
Because as a shy boy, talking is always like my least favorite thing to do.

516
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But like action wise, I'm always the sort of person who would like,

517
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,760
you know, if there's something that everybody notices,

518
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,080
but nobody wants to do anything about it because they're like,

519
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,080
I would be the one who just does the action to get things rolling.

520
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,280
Like at the airport just recently, there was like a big old,

521
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,880
when you go through security, you got all the trays and stuff,

522
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,920
and they keep piling up.

523
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,520
And I just like, I get involved and I want this thing to move,

524
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,200
not just for me, but for everyone.

525
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,720
I grab the empty trays and I stack them in the thing

526
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,000
so that everybody can move along.

527
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,840
And I'm just, I work it like, I do more through my actions

528
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,360
than I could ever do through my words, because I'm not a talkative person.

529
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,560
Doing podcasts has turned me into somewhat of a talkative person.

530
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,640
But in real life, I would just rather,

531
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,440
I would rather be like, I would rather not be able to talk.

532
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,840
You know, it's the sort of like, I'm so much more physical.

533
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,120
It doesn't come across at all in my YouTube work, obviously.

534
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,360
But like, I'm so much more physical than I am vocal.

535
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
And in a world where-

536
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,320
Ibsby's talk is let's get physical, the little facts.

537
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,440
But like, in a world where like, I could, you know,

538
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,280
if a bully was fucking roughing me up and I couldn't like,

539
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,240
there was no system in place to tell him off.

540
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,120
Or like, if it wasn't scary for the bully to try and attack me

541
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,880
because he doesn't want to get detention.

542
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,920
I mean, obviously you would get in trouble if you try to fight someone.

543
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,680
But like, there was never any like, proper fighting

544
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,160
or like, resolving of conflict.

545
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,960
It was all sort of, you know, people yelling at me.

546
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,920
And I'm like, I don't want to yell back because I don't do that.

547
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,880
I would rather they punch me so that I can know for sure.

548
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,200
How they feel about me so that I can punch them.

549
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,960
And I'm like, I wouldn't love that.

550
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,800
But I never had any opportunity like that to like-

551
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,000
For you, for you, the ideal world would be to be like that manga called Gone.

552
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,040
Are you familiar with that one?

553
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,120
Yeah, the guy.

554
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,560
It has no words.

555
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,880
And you're just a badass little dinosaur guy,

556
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,240
just like going about world, kicking ass and just being cool.

557
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,240
I mean, yeah, it's, I'm sure like a lot of shy boys love Shonen

558
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,760
for this escapist fantasy of-

559
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,520
Doing violence to do, you know, to do anything.

560
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,320
For me, it's a little difficult to really say either way,

561
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,560
because like, for my story, as you could tell,

562
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,520
I was a very extroverted, very sort of fight person.

563
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,960
Mange did fight people.

564
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,080
She didn't fuck around.

565
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,880
I was very extroverted.

566
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
Like I said, I greeted strangers.

567
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I fought with people when I needed to.

568
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,920
I wasn't afraid of anything.

569
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,120
But then I got a bully.

570
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,560
And the thing is, up until that point,

571
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,960
all my fights were more or less fair.

572
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,240
It's usually one-on-one.

573
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,720
Someone else maybe was watching, maybe not.

574
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,320
It's just, it's, you know, it felt fair, winner-lose.

575
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,280
But with this bully, she always, she was, I think, my age,

576
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,280
but she looked older due to makeup and clothes and stuff.

577
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,080
And she always hung around with guys much older than her.

578
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,920
Like, I was like 13 or so when I first met her,

579
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,680
but the guys hanging around with her were like 18 or so, probably.

580
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,080
Okay.

581
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,440
Much taller, much bigger.

582
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,880
Was she fucking, was she fucking them?

583
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,280
I'm just curious.

584
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,600
I don't know, but she probably was,

585
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,760
because why else would they hang around with her?

586
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,040
That's true.

587
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,800
No, but seriously.

588
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,160
My fellow big towels, hell yeah.

589
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,760
Again, it's a little hard to talk about this,

590
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,120
because it was very defining.

591
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,920
Hard in my life.

592
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,240
But yeah, she, it was never a fair fight.

593
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,280
She always had them around and she mentally harassed me,

594
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,680
I guess, verbally abused me before fighting.

595
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,760
But the thing is, I didn't have a chance to necessarily fight back.

596
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,120
I did try once, but that didn't end well.

597
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,520
And I was scared because those guys were around,

598
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,880
and even if I were to defeat her, you know, they're gonna beat me up.

599
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,440
And she was never alone.

600
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,800
And the thing is, she was-

601
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,920
Well, my guess is that, I'm guessing those guys never actually beat you up,

602
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,440
but it was that the threat was there.

603
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,520
Yeah, well, I was a little kid, I didn't know.

604
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,520
And I fought with guys before, I never really had the mentality,

605
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,840
oh, they're not gonna beat me up just because I'm a girl.

606
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,080
You know, I fought with everyone who would fight.

607
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,440
So yeah, and the thing is, she wasn't in my school,

608
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,720
she wasn't in my neighborhood.

609
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,960
She was kind of like the neighborhoods,

610
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,440
well, not even the neighborhoods, the town's boogeyman for me.

611
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,280
I didn't know where she would pop up, but if she did,

612
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,040
and if I was alone, I'm screwed.

613
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,560
And even if I was with a friend,

614
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,400
I couldn't really trust my friends to help me out because the first,

615
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,880
maybe I think the first and second time I met with her,

616
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,560
I was with a friend, the same one as well.

617
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,960
She wasn't really helpful, let's say.

618
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,200
And because of her, because of the unfairness and injustice,

619
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,400
I became very reclusive and shy.

620
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,680
And I think because of her, in a way,

621
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,680
because of the whole situation started just avoiding outside

622
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,320
and started being scared of people, strangers mostly,

623
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,040
I became very self-conscious, just fearing people.

624
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,240
And now I became the weenie I am today.

625
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,440
That's very interesting.

626
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,240
I mean, I can totally see why it would lead to that.

627
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,840
I mean, for me, my experience was definitely more like Gibbs.

628
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,400
I mean, I think it is an interesting phenomenon.

629
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,680
You know, they say that, what's the generation after millennials?

630
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,120
Gen Z, is that what they call them, right?

631
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,680
I have no idea.

632
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,560
Is that the right one?

633
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,720
The last one, the last generation before we all care.

634
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,800
The munchies, the Christ consciousness generation.

635
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,720
Yeah, whatever it is, whatever it is they call it.

636
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,520
The post jobs, the one after millennials.

637
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,480
They say that that generation is much more conservative.

638
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,360
That's what they say.

639
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,440
And I think I know why.

640
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,400
I think that, in America, the political landscape is divided

641
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,960
in such a way that the Democratic party just owns a set of ideas,

642
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,560
the liberal side of things, and then the more conservative,

643
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,880
including the Republicans, I guess the libertarians,

644
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,480
and that sort of group, that encompasses a different batch of ideals.

645
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,240
And going back to, so there was the greatest generation

646
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,120
who fought in World War II, then there was the baby boomers

647
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,040
who were their kids, our parents.

648
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,320
And the baby boomers were the free love movement

649
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,280
in response to their hard ass World War II fighting parents

650
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,600
who were the most badass people ever.

651
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,080
And so our parents, they rebelled against that.

652
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,000
And they felt like, no man, it's all about freedom

653
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,120
and treating people great and everyone being equal.

654
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,320
And everyone's a winner, everyone gets a gold sticker.

655
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,800
Exactly, because their parents were such hard asses

656
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,440
in the changing world of all this new technology,

657
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,240
and radio, well radio had been a while,

658
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,400
but all this new stuff that was happening.

659
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,880
And then our generation is the children,

660
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,440
the millennials, the children of those baby boomers.

661
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,760
And so most millennials were coddled, without a doubt.

662
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,040
We're the coddled ones who were raised by,

663
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,600
are caring and protective parents.

664
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,720
Yeah, and it's not just a normal generation switch

665
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,520
where you rebel against the previous generation

666
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,800
because it's just how it is.

667
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,400
But with the internet coming in and connecting the world,

668
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,240
it's sort of combined with people being soft.

669
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,000
It just sort of made it so that there was no way to become tough.

670
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,360
That's true.

671
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,960
Because you could hide it at home,

672
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,240
and laws will pass when people bruise their knees

673
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,920
or cut themselves on a piece of glass.

674
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,560
Like no more glass in the city, like what are you talking about?

675
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,240
Like all these weird things are coming up.

676
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,640
And it's like, if we had the capacity to rebel

677
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,520
against our soft parents, we would have.

678
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,720
But we just got sort of trapped.

679
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,080
Your kids, you can't do shit.

680
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,280
All you can do is become an adult.

681
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,400
All you can do is just sort of put on a balaclava

682
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,160
and say, Antifa, and be a big old crazy,

683
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,640
throwing rocks, molotov cocktails.

684
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,920
But like, there's so much police, they're so big.

685
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,200
They got truncheons and guns.

686
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,560
What are you going to do about it?

687
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,600
The problem is that we get involved.

688
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,120
They're going to slice us in half,

689
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,160
and we're going to die.

690
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,600
To me, the problem is seriously

691
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,960
that we've involved the government

692
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,000
in so much of what should just be private interactions.

693
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,240
Yeah, like small towns are now, you know, worldwide.

694
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,440
The whole state, it's fucking crazy.

695
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,240
Yeah, and it's kind of just a natural consequence

696
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,040
of globalization and just the increased reach

697
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,960
of through fucking telecommunications.

698
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
It's just a psychological reaction to the fact

699
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,280
that we're so hyper aware of all the minutiae of bad

700
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,880
that it feels like it's on our doorstep,

701
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,080
even if it's half a world away.

702
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,560
That's for sure.

703
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,040
But I think that the Generation Z,

704
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,800
or whatever it is, after the millennials,

705
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,640
those guys, and the reason they're conservative,

706
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,240
or getting more conservative, I think, is because-

707
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
The parents are all pussies and they hate it.

708
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,360
Yeah, they are the reactionary generation

709
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,640
who have recognized the damage that's been done by-

710
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,360
Mom, why are you so goddamn gay?

711
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,720
Yeah, why are you so gay, mom?

712
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,280
What the hell?

713
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,120
Mom and mom.

714
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,800
Like, it's just that, and it's that the right owns,

715
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,960
like the right just owns the ideas of freedom.

716
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,800
And the ideas of personal responsibility.

717
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,160
Those are just ideas that belong to the right in America.

718
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,560
And because of that, the whole generation

719
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,320
has been pulled in that direction.

720
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,560
And you see that with the whole, like, I don't know,

721
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
like the whole anti-feminists on YouTube and the-

722
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,760
How did this get political?

723
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,920
Or are we just gonna have to talk about fighting?

724
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,560
Well, it's all real.

725
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,600
I mean, fighting is quite-

726
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,120
I'm just talking about generational issues.

727
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,960
Politics is all about fighting,

728
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,440
but it's like the most boring kind with outlets.

729
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,760
But speaking of politics being fighting.

730
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,280
I've been in so many fights, dude.

731
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,600
I like Quarter Circle and Hadouken, so I'm the best fighter.

732
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,000
It's fucking sick.

733
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,320
I was gonna say, that's a good one too,

734
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,560
but speaking of political being a fight,

735
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,440
let's talk about like verbal online badass,

736
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,640
you know, urban warfare on Twitter fighting.

737
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,800
Before we do that, I wanna say a very quick story,

738
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,640
because I didn't get to talk much about my fighting days this episode.

739
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,320
A fun thing that happened that I had completely forgot,

740
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,400
but I remembered for this episode,

741
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,840
that used to happen is like,

742
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,960
my neighborhood would have fights with another neighborhood.

743
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,080
So it was kind of like-

744
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,280
Gang warfare!

745
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,960
The cop killers versus the rowdies!

746
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,840
The violent violence and her gang going against the fucking interlopers.

747
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,800
No, no, I was-

748
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,240
The indigo interlopers.

749
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,720
Violent violence versus the indigo interlopers.

750
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
The war of purple, which hue is best?

751
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,480
Fan art now, get on it.

752
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,760
Young mage with a fucking spiked baseball.

753
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,400
The fucking magenta mobsters.

754
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Was there a leader of the opposition, mage?

755
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,360
Your indigo parallel?

756
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,240
I wasn't even the leader, guys.

757
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,400
I don't believe you.

758
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,880
No, revisionist history, you were definitely the leader.

759
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,680
Continue, please.

760
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm sorry, mage, please.

761
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,360
I never really met the leader.

762
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,920
I saw, you know, I think our neighborhood won,

763
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,400
just because of the-

764
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,280
Who a shadowy figure.

765
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,400
The neighbors, because numbers, we had the numbers on our side.

766
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,040
The neighborhood was a lot smaller than ours,

767
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,400
so, you know, we had more people.

768
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,760
We still had fun with the fights.

769
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,520
I barely got to participate, because I didn't won.

770
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,480
I was still, I think, six or seven when they were going around.

771
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,080
The fights were mostly between teenagers, like 14 and up,

772
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,040
so I only got to participate in a few of them.

773
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,080
What kind of fights?

774
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,560
Are we talking weapons or just fist fights?

775
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,800
It was like, now I have to, like, dig back in my memories.

776
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,360
How was it?

777
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,760
Broken bottles.

778
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,920
They're just like, literally, shooting each other.

779
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,200
Just fucking gunfights.

780
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,960
Oh, wait, when the craze happened with the, like,

781
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,040
the, what do you call, those P-shooters or something,

782
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,600
those guns?

783
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,280
Like a BB gun or something?

784
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,680
Yeah, I didn't own those, so I didn't participate in those.

785
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,320
Those happened later.

786
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,240
But they used BB guns against each other?

787
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,440
Yeah, they used BBs.

788
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,840
Dude, this is sick.

789
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,360
That's pretty serious, all right.

790
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
The age was literally in a shonen anime.

791
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,240
This is insane.

792
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,840
But before that, but before that, I remember, like,

793
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,440
I was part in one where we were, like, devised a plan.

794
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,840
It was like, okay, guys, you take this route

795
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,160
and you guys take this route and we're going to surround them

796
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,000
and we're just going to beat the shit out of them.

797
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,640
And like, oh, they have, like, people watching over there,

798
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,400
so be careful, they'll see you coming.

799
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,000
Kind of striking for real life.

800
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,800
So this is, like, a lot of tactics for, like, little kids.

801
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,560
Yeah, and it's like, ah, we'll lead them

802
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,880
into our neighborhood's old Soviet minefield,

803
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,840
and we'll have them in there.

804
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,240
The closest my life ever came to stuff like that

805
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,480
was, like, snowball fights, which is lame.

806
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,160
I mean, it's kind of cool.

807
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,280
We're talking about how millennials

808
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,520
are all fucking pussies, but Mage over here,

809
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,960
six years old, was drafted into a conflict.

810
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,760
Child soldiers.

811
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,040
She's the real child soldier.

812
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,240
Fuck, Munchy, it's Mage.

813
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,680
It's fucking Mage.

814
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,200
We're not giving Mage enough credit.

815
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,880
The violent violence is fucking on the prowl.

816
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,800
You know, I just, when I was young,

817
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,880
like, the closest thing I had to anything like that

818
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,560
was when I was at summer camp,

819
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,840
I know I told the story last time,

820
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,040
but, like, my mom would roll up

821
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,400
and she'd find me, like, with, like, dual-wielding sticks

822
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,640
and, like, having pine cones in my belt as grenades

823
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,760
and, like, ready to fucking kill.

824
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,520
I, like, I don't know what we would do.

825
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,040
We would divide up into teams,

826
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,960
and this is at the YMCA summer camp in the woods.

827
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,520
It was fucking sick.

828
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,080
This is instantly less impressive than Mage's.

829
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,120
I know, I know.

830
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,720
Like, we didn't even really fight.

831
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,840
We just, like, got geared up and then just, like, felt cool.

832
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,360
Like, that's what we did.

833
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,480
Well, that sounds like the American equivalent

834
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,560
of fucking war-torn Lithuania.

835
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,880
Who wants to hear a story of how I got banished

836
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,840
from my own neighborhood?

837
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,520
Oh, I do.

838
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,920
How did that, how is this possible?

839
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Okay, so...

840
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,640
Their own leader.

841
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,600
My neighborhood.

842
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,280
I wasn't the leader, oh my god.

843
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,520
That's what you say now.

844
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,200
My neighborhood got together to, like,

845
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,480
build a little base for, for itself,

846
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,160
like, a little house or whatever,

847
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,360
and they were building nearby my house,

848
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,600
because there was a really good spot,

849
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,520
and it was sort of like, it wasn't necessarily...

850
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,280
When you say neighborhood,

851
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,600
do you mean, like, all the kids and teenagers from around?

852
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,640
Yeah, it's like...

853
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,040
Just like...

854
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,040
I can't really describe it.

855
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,400
It's like, I live in this area that's like, it's sort of like...

856
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,800
There's a group of houses,

857
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,320
and they're kind of surrounded by streets,

858
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,920
or like, the city centers, or stuff like that,

859
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,120
and like, it has its own little area

860
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,520
that's kind of disconnected from other areas,

861
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,200
so I call that the neighborhood.

862
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,520
It wasn't like, you know, blocks or whatever.

863
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah.

864
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,120
It's a little hard to describe.

865
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,640
Oh, so like a cul-de-sac or something?

866
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,560
Is it like, like a road,

867
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,600
like one road that goes in and out?

868
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,880
Road street, home.

869
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,920
I guess kind of, it could maybe something like that.

870
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,680
It's, I mean, whatever I can describe...

871
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,360
A similarly kind of like...

872
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,680
Okay.

873
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:08,200
I don't think it's anything equivalent to American layout of houses or whatever.

874
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,880
Okay, that's fine, but how did you get banished?

875
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,520
I need to know.

876
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,480
Yeah, so yeah, so they came off the group project

877
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,680
for that little base and stuff,

878
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,720
and they were building near my house, near to my house,

879
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,360
and the thing is, I was really excited about it,

880
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,800
because, you know, I was sort of part of it,

881
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,000
and I was, you know, very excited.

882
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,280
Oh, hey, a base.

883
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,320
It's neat.

884
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,840
And the problem was, though, they were making a lot of noise,

885
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,720
so I think it was my parents or someone living above,

886
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,080
like, somewhere from my house,

887
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,280
because we didn't own a house,

888
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,400
we were living in an apartment,

889
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,000
and they were like, you know, sort of,

890
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,120
somewhere from that area,

891
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,560
complained and had all the progress sort of like,

892
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,560
told them to take it down,

893
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,360
but then like, for some reason,

894
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,920
the neighborhood kids, some of them,

895
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,400
got this idea that I was responsible for it,

896
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,160
like, I complained to my parents or something.

897
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,280
Oh, they thought you were a rat.

898
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,640
Yeah, they, yeah, and they blamed me.

899
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,520
An adult informant.

900
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,720
And they blamed me for it,

901
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,040
even though I was super excited about the whole project,

902
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,680
and they were like, you're not allowed to like,

903
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,120
go into the neighborhood for a month,

904
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,280
and if we see you, we're gonna beat you up.

905
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,680
And also, oh, Jesus, all right.

906
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,800
So I had to sneak around to go see my friends and stuff.

907
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,680
So you still went, you risked it all?

908
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,160
I wouldn't mind fighting the younger kids,

909
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,080
but like, the teenagers were a bit tougher,

910
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,480
especially since they never went around alone.

911
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,720
Fucking, now this is Metal Gear solo.

912
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,080
This is still famous, well.

913
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,440
This is like the main character gets fucking ostracized arc

914
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,560
of like a shonen manga,

915
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,320
where it's just him against the world for a while.

916
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,800
Mage is going through all the motions.

917
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,560
Mage, you should definitely make a manga about your life.

918
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,840
My life is a great idea.

919
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,160
It wasn't even all that exciting.

920
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,000
But you made it exciting for the narrative.

921
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,560
Yeah.

922
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,800
Mage, right now you're just like hiding,

923
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,600
you're in hiding just like being like the hermit weeaboo.

924
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,120
We're in the middle of a time skip.

925
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,320
So in like two or three years,

926
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,440
the time skip's gonna end,

927
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,120
and like you're gonna come out of hiding

928
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,640
more powerful than you ever were.

929
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,160
Mage knows, the Geneva boys, the fucking UN,

930
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,320
will convict her for crimes against humanity

931
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,800
if they find out that the leader of the violent violets

932
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,720
is in fact still alive and not dead.

933
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,840
Like, you know, as the Osama bin Laden ally

934
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,720
that she is in real life, you know, don't,

935
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,400
so she's gotta lay low, gotta lay low.

936
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,880
Yeah, I'm picturing you as solid snake violets

937
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,520
on top of Metal Gear Rex, shirtless, bare knuckle boxing,

938
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,200
like a snake, you know, who's the indigo,

939
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,920
what is it, ingrate, the indigo ingrate,

940
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,360
that's what his name is, that's what I'm calling him.

941
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,920
Beautiful.

942
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,640
Just like this,

943
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,840
Mage with this long flowing purple bandana,

944
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
the exact hesitalism of value we need.

945
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,480
Okay, so since we're really, like,

946
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,640
since you guys seem to like this narrative,

947
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,080
I'll tell you one more thing.

948
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,440
From the opposing, like, the neighborhood guys, people,

949
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,200
this was before I went to school,

950
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,920
and so when I started going to school,

951
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,240
I had this classmate and I had a crush on him

952
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,520
and it turns out he was from the opposing neighborhood.

953
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,800
Oh, my head hits all the beats!

954
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,080
Fuck!

955
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,760
Dude, how did it go?

956
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,560
What happened?

957
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,760
He didn't go well, he liked to-

958
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,800
You had to kill him in the end.

959
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,160
No, he had to murder her.

960
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,120
I actually confessed to him that he liked another girl

961
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,600
in the class that everyone liked, so-

962
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,160
Oh, but you knitted out-

963
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,320
Disgusting.

964
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,600
So he had to die.

965
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,480
No, I'm just joking.

966
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,840
Now he's dead.

967
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,440
Hell yes, that's fucking awesome.

968
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,440
Incredible, incredible.

969
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,760
Fucking, the rat is in cop killers embarrassing,

970
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,640
not even real.

971
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:41,880
No.

972
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,480
The violets and the indigos.

973
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,960
Clearly not even, like, we have a whole

974
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,720
untapped potential lore over here

975
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,080
that we've never even touched on.

976
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,720
It's true.

977
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,880
We need a dramatic retelling

978
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,240
of your entire childhood mage.

979
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,280
I want a graphic novel on my desk on Monday,

980
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,000
monochromatic purple, start to finish, go.

981
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,840
Yeah, you should re-tool the bot that's in your Discord

982
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,720
to make it turn it into, like, Endless War 2,

983
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,920
but, like, purple version.

984
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,400
Yes.

985
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,240
No.

986
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,280
The Violet Violets.

987
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,000
I don't like fighting anymore, though.

988
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,760
That's so sad.

989
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,880
You need to be reawakened.

990
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,320
Like, you're, like, basically,

991
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,840
literally Unohana from Bleach,

992
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,280
which I think is what you said last time.

993
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,320
I know, I know.

994
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,920
But that's pretty much exactly it.

995
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,600
You just need to reawaken your bloodlust.

996
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,040
No, I was gonna say, I was gonna say,

997
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,480
she's more like Simone right now,

998
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,160
because she's had a traumatic experience

999
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,200
that has made her sheltered.

1000
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,400
She needs someone to come along

1001
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,800
and reawaken her vigor for life.

1002
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,840
Fair enough, fair enough.

1003
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,840
Hey, I like drawing.

1004
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,640
Yeah, just like Simone,

1005
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,960
like staying in his room and sculpting communes.

1006
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,160
But we all know Mage,

1007
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,680
because the things you draw

1008
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
are always, like, super creepy and bloody.

1009
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,600
We know what's really down deep inside.

1010
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,800
There's a killer that lives.

1011
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,960
You just need some super sexy anime chick

1012
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,160
to come into your life and, like,

1013
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,440
worship you, and you'll feel so much better.

1014
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,800
She needs a commune.

1015
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,600
A new commune.

1016
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,600
Commune 2, aka Nia.

1017
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,960
All right, anyway, hey, hey.

1018
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,200
Let's talk about fighting on the Internet

1019
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,000
with people who give you shit.

1020
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,280
No, it's lame.

1021
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,320
No, that's good.

1022
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,680
But that's how most fighting is done in the world.

1023
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,080
Can we talk about how that is not real fighting

1024
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,600
and it is gay and it's stupid?

1025
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,240
Okay.

1026
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,440
I want to say before we go on to that,

1027
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,360
just one little thing.

1028
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:18,680
Sure.

1029
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,000
I went to, like, I forgot to say this.

1030
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,800
I went to Taekwondo practice once,

1031
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,160
and I thought it was really lame.

1032
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,800
And I realized then that I don't care

1033
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,480
about, like, being able to fight.

1034
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,560
I just like being in danger.

1035
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,120
It's so cool to be in a dangerous situation,

1036
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,040
like, to do something you're not allowed to do,

1037
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,040
to jump over a fence, to get a ball,

1038
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,240
when there's the possibility of a CCT camera getting you.

1039
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,480
And then you're getting put in jail,

1040
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,280
and when you're a little kid,

1041
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,000
that's what you think can happen.

1042
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,640
Yeah, doesn't that mean you thrive in our current society?

1043
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,040
Because literally everything has a risk of punishment now,

1044
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,680
because everything's stated off.

1045
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,600
Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, not really.

1046
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,440
But, like, when I was young, and I thought,

1047
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,680
I would go, like, there was this time a ball

1048
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,640
went over the school fence, and I was like,

1049
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,000
it was after school, and the school was closed.

1050
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,080
And I jumped over it, even though I knew

1051
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,120
that there was a camera there,

1052
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,120
and that I could get in trouble next day.

1053
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,240
And nothing happened.

1054
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,560
But I was like, nobody's going to get this ball.

1055
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,360
Everyone's scared.

1056
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,760
But I'm the guy who would, like, silently do the cool thing.

1057
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,200
And then everybody would be like, whoa.

1058
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,400
That's why talking sucks.

1059
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,120
I like jumping over fences and punching people.

1060
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,400
I want to be a fucking gremlin.

1061
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,800
I want to be a fucking real-life gremlin man.

1062
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,200
And I'm not allowed to, and it sucks.

1063
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,040
Speaking of Taekwondo, going to a practice and sucking,

1064
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,320
it's definitely true that martial arts is so much

1065
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,800
about the fundamentals that do not look cool.

1066
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,000
And fighting really, even the coolest UFC matches,

1067
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,800
look pretty basic and not anime, which is unfortunate.

1068
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,200
But I've been watching a lot of Joe Rogan's podcast

1069
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,960
for the last, I don't know, a couple years at this point.

1070
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,080
And he's obviously a fighter, a trained fighter,

1071
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,040
and he still has UFC people on all the time,

1072
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,520
because that's one of his jobs to commentate or whatever.

1073
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,960
And it's given me an appreciation.

1074
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,560
I haven't watched any of the fights,

1075
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,080
other than the really big ones,

1076
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,280
of CM Punk getting his ass handed to him several times

1077
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:12,840
at this point.

1078
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,440
But it's just cool to hear an expert like him talk about it.

1079
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,960
And just on a technical level,

1080
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,360
to describe getting people into fancy holds and arm bars

1081
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,800
and get their fucking neck in a chokehold or some shit,

1082
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,600
it's cool.

1083
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,920
And I'm sure for the people watching,

1084
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,560
it doesn't look that cool to just watch two people like Bob

1085
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,520
and weave and throw out a jab and then run away.

1086
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,560
But that's just how a soccer game doesn't look cool

1087
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,760
until they get a goal.

1088
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,760
But once you understand it more,

1089
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,520
you get that every little thing is part of a grand plan

1090
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,880
to conserve energy.

1091
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,320
Only you expend as much as you need.

1092
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,880
I watch so much anime that when I watch UFC,

1093
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,560
it eventually just turns to a ground game.

1094
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,760
And it's two guys in swim trunks fucking each other.

1095
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,920
And it's just too gay for you.

1096
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,600
It's just like gay porn and not fighting.

1097
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,320
I'm sure all the coolest things I've ever thought I've done

1098
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,200
looked terrible and really cringy.

1099
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,920
But the feeling of doing them was the main thing.

1100
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,720
The feeling of other men's ballsack against my face.

1101
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,080
The highest form of art is the male form.

1102
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,040
So did you all try to take martial art classes?

1103
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,760
I went for a while.

1104
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,000
I went to a Taekwondo class

1105
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and I just didn't like it immediately.

1106
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,520
That's not bad, Tom.

1107
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,400
That's cool, Tom.

1108
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,480
I only went to one class.

1109
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,640
I don't even remember which martial art it was.

1110
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,280
It was in the sort of gym.

1111
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,800
So there were a lot of other activities

1112
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,760
that other people were doing.

1113
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,880
I didn't like my class.

1114
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,800
So I just kind of pissed off to go lift weights.

1115
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,520
Because I like lift weights.

1116
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,520
So I've done that.

1117
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,320
That's what I've done.

1118
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,720
Yeah.

1119
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,760
It's a lot easier.

1120
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,040
If someone's going to kill me, then what am I going to do?

1121
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,040
All you need is a gun and any amount

1122
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,480
of martial arts training I've got.

1123
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,240
I mean, yes, you could be smart

1124
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,560
and maybe just harm them or something.

1125
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,320
My dad's like a trained fighter.

1126
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,880
He knows all this crazy shit.

1127
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,120
And he's just like, martial arts is great.

1128
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,320
But at the end of the day, you really

1129
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,200
have to know how to like a street fight is totally different.

1130
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,280
And all the forms and condoms and shit you learn

1131
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,320
don't really mean things.

1132
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,640
You have to know how to fight for real.

1133
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:21,960
Sure.

1134
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,280
The fact that policemen can fail to stop a guy

1135
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,200
from getting them, even though they have a gun,

1136
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,400
is just sort of like, even if they're trained in martial

1137
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
arts or hand-to-hand, something or other.

1138
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,280
Policemen have very low standards for physical combat,

1139
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,520
which is why they go straight to the gun every time,

1140
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:38,840
which is unfortunate.

1141
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,720
Maybe in America.

1142
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,440
I don't know how it is.

1143
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,320
Yeah, OK.

1144
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,000
I mean, in America, we have lots of guns,

1145
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,360
so it's different from, you know.

1146
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,640
Yeah, there's no guns in the UK except for special types

1147
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,480
of policemen who are allowed to have them.

1148
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:49,720
Really?

1149
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,240
So even your normal policemen don't

1150
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,160
have, normally, don't have guns?

1151
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,840
I think they have like stun things and batons and whatever.

1152
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,640
OK, we have a baton.

1153
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,800
But like, pathetic.

1154
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,520
And, but like, they're trained to use the hands

1155
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,720
and to say, stop, or stop doing that really loud.

1156
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,160
I mean, that's how it should be, you'd think.

1157
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,240
Yeah, yeah.

1158
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,120
Do you think?

1159
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,760
I don't, I don't want to say something.

1160
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,960
Well, I mean, OK.

1161
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,560
I shouldn't have said this.

1162
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,360
OK, if you're like robbing a thing.

1163
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,480
I retract my statement.

1164
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:15,880
You're right.

1165
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,600
Let's move on.

1166
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,520
OK, fine, fine, fine.

1167
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,640
Yo, Twitter is lame.

1168
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,440
Twitter is dumb.

1169
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,160
Everything that happens on there is a waste of time

1170
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:25,720
and a problem.

1171
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,560
Do you want, do you want to know why Twitter is a problem?

1172
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,920
Why it's gay and why it's dumb?

1173
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,160
It's because all of us have this urge

1174
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,640
to settle our conflicts physically and we can't.

1175
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,800
So this is how we get it out of our system,

1176
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,640
inefficiently and pathetically.

1177
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,720
You know, I definitely agree with that.

1178
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,120
But and I was also going to say that I don't think Twitter,

1179
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,200
like when you're man to man with someone,

1180
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,560
you're a face to fucking face.

1181
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,240
And you've got a grievance.

1182
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,680
Like all I'm going to say is that like it's so different

1183
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,760
than like tweeting with somebody back and forth.

1184
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,000
There is a threat of physical violence.

1185
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,480
Yeah, there's no threat of physical repercussions on Twitter.

1186
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,120
You can say whatever you want.

1187
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,760
And it's because of this.

1188
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,680
If you go have your coffee and nobody gives a shit.

1189
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,600
Because Twitter is so immediately,

1190
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,360
Twitter is consequence free.

1191
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,120
Things can really snowball

1192
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,360
and like they can get way out of proportion

1193
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,880
and especially because the fucking media and like I get why.

1194
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,840
But people take tweets as like gospel

1195
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,840
and they like if you use a word on Twitter,

1196
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,320
that's offensive or whatever, like, I don't know, faggot,

1197
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,600
then like, oh, well now you are officially a homophobe

1198
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,080
because you use the word faggot on Twitter.

1199
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,560
And like maybe you are a homophobe.

1200
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,200
Maybe you're not.

1201
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,360
But like the Twitter shouldn't be the arbiter

1202
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,400
of whether you are or not.

1203
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,280
You know, I agree.

1204
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,080
And like I hate that we use Twitter as like a,

1205
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,800
it's like the official, it's like we treat someone's Twitter.

1206
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,360
The same as we treat like a published book they've written.

1207
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,440
They're like equally valid a representation

1208
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,880
of like the arguments of this person.

1209
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,920
You know what it is?

1210
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,000
It's like being a homophobe is only like,

1211
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,440
I mean, I don't think being a homophobe is illegal at all.

1212
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,920
So like the only thing that people have

1213
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,960
to like leverage that like, oh, I don't like homophobes.

1214
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,880
Like what are they, what can they do?

1215
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,520
They can't punch you because everyone's a fucking pussy on Twitter.

1216
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,200
Nobody's gonna actually beat you up.

1217
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,760
The actions are illegal, but the stance,

1218
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,480
the personal thoughts in your head so far

1219
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,920
have yet to become illegal.

1220
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,440
So far, so far.

1221
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,800
There's a lot of thought policing been going on.

1222
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,840
But yeah, but like since people can't like,

1223
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,520
if somebody says yes, I think because I'm, you know, maybe,

1224
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm a Christian and I think gay people are wrong.

1225
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,120
Like that guy, everybody know, like he's saying it outright

1226
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,800
and people are like, oh, I hate that guy.

1227
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,840
He's a homophobe.

1228
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,360
What can I do to fuck with him?

1229
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,480
I can't punch him.

1230
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,320
I can't like physically do anything.

1231
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,680
You fucking don't shop at his place.

1232
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,320
That's what you do.

1233
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,000
Well, you know, yes, that, of course,

1234
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,200
but like people don't do that.

1235
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,040
They sit on Twitter and try to ruin people's lives in other ways.

1236
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,280
Yeah.

1237
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,800
Well, like, for example, like that guy,

1238
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,240
because they have, they have, they have like, you know,

1239
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,160
an urge to fight, but they have no way to actually relieve the stress.

1240
00:52:59,160 --> 00:52:59,640
Right.

1241
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,360
So your first, your first reaction in your body

1242
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,160
is to physically lash out when you see something that embrages you.

1243
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,960
Like how many times have you got a really retarded comment

1244
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,320
and the first, your first reaction is like,

1245
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,920
I just want to lay this person out.

1246
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,480
That's just, it's biologically ingrained in us.

1247
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,680
I mean, that's, that's true.

1248
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,040
Just want to punch shit, dude.

1249
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,360
We have to appear to our better angels and recognize

1250
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,520
that like when you get a really mean comment,

1251
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,240
it's more than likely this person was at their worst

1252
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,760
when they wrote that comment.

1253
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,240
And, you know, I mean, it's just to your benefit

1254
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,840
to try not to flip out.

1255
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,560
You know what I mean.

1256
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,000
But what I am, what I was getting at is that people,

1257
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,000
they, they, they're lobbying, no, not lobbying,

1258
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,160
I don't know the word, but like they're trying to get

1259
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,960
like more and more restrictions put on what people can say.

1260
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,680
So that they're making things more and more illegal,

1261
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:46,920
you know, for like less and less things.

1262
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,360
Because people think the fucking government

1263
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,040
should dictate personal interaction

1264
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,760
instead of just like, if you don't like a guy,

1265
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,640
don't shop at his place.

1266
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,680
They want, they want to be able to ruin this person's life

1267
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,840
for doing this thing that makes them upset

1268
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,440
because they can't fight them.

1269
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,800
So they have to make it illegal somehow.

1270
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
But of course, the tool that put, yeah.

1271
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,440
The, you know, the, the more it is just,

1272
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,560
it just leads to like, where does the line get drawn

1273
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,680
for like what a person can be.

1274
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,720
And that's the problem.

1275
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,680
Because these people go and jail at birth.

1276
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,560
Yeah. And like, when you, when you make a speech,

1277
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,200
like fucking criminalized or whatever, like, okay,

1278
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,240
we've outlawed saying like, you know, racist stuff.

1279
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,840
So like, you can't say that like, I hate all, you know, Hispanics.

1280
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,680
Like that, that is like racist or something.

1281
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,520
Okay. But apparently it is legally acceptable

1282
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,440
to say like, I hate all white people.

1283
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,920
And it's like, okay, let now logically speaking,

1284
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,840
that doesn't make sense why you can do that.

1285
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,480
But it seems to be sort of, it's just like, okay,

1286
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,080
if the government institutes a policy where like,

1287
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,680
you can't discriminate based on race

1288
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,520
to stop people from being racist or Hispanics,

1289
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,680
then like, let's assume a right wing government

1290
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,720
takes over later.

1291
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,880
Well, now you've given them the ability,

1292
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,960
especially if you ignore that previous thing about like,

1293
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,920
you didn't criminalize when people said that,

1294
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,440
you know, like white people are all bad or whatever.

1295
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,640
Like now you've put a system in place where like,

1296
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,200
the attorney or whatever, the district attorney or whatever,

1297
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,760
can like, choose to now we can criminalize people

1298
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,040
who say they hate all white people.

1299
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,840
And let's just let off people who say they hate all Hispanics.

1300
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,680
Like the problem is that we put any of these rules into place.

1301
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,680
You just need to let people sort out amongst themselves.

1302
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,160
And that's exactly what the Supreme Court itself said

1303
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,480
when they just fucking put that decision down.

1304
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,400
And they said that that guy who didn't,

1305
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,760
that serious Christian,

1306
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,120
who didn't want to make that wedding cake

1307
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,720
for the gay couple or whatever,

1308
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,920
they could not compel the him to make that cake.

1309
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,720
And damn right.

1310
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,600
Cause fuck though, that would be such a fucked up precedent.

1311
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,240
I want to say something about that case.

1312
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,840
You have to force people to do shit like that.

1313
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,840
Now, this could be just a rumor.

1314
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,680
I don't remember where I heard this,

1315
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,040
but these people who, you know, asked for the cake,

1316
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,600
they deliberately went around every single cake shop,

1317
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,560
cake shop, looking for someone who would refuse them.

1318
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,520
So they were out looking for trouble rather than like.

1319
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,000
That is interesting context as well.

1320
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,880
No, I heard, I heard from DeVoo.

1321
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,120
Like I saw a video he posted,

1322
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,800
he was talking about this on Twitter a while ago,

1323
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,480
where the lady who was like being charged said

1324
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,200
that she knew the guy who asked for the cake and like very well.

1325
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,560
And he was, he was okay with it,

1326
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,320
but it was like the, you know, one of his friends

1327
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,880
that made it a thing that became viral

1328
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,160
and then everybody got outraged and neither party,

1329
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,000
like the guy who tried to buy the cake

1330
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,360
and the person who was selling the cake,

1331
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,720
they were on good terms,

1332
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,720
but it was like it blew up on the internet

1333
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,400
and then she was like fucked over by the government,

1334
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,720
which is the reason it's so fucking terrible.

1335
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,080
Even assuming that's completely true,

1336
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,440
which I would believe that's true.

1337
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,800
I, you know, I haven't looked it up myself,

1338
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,240
but like assuming that's all true,

1339
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,600
I don't even care because I totally believe you should,

1340
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,000
if you just are a sincere racist

1341
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,280
and you don't want to make cake for whatever race you hate,

1342
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,480
you 100% should be allowed to not do it

1343
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,080
because you just don't want to.

1344
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,040
There was no, I see no reason to force people to do that.

1345
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,480
And just as everyone else is trying to think

1346
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,680
you're a fucking douchebag

1347
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,880
and you get all the social consequences that come with it.

1348
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,640
Exactly, because what you do is,

1349
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,160
you tell everybody that he did that

1350
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,520
and then you stop shopping at his place.

1351
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,720
And you know what, you know what,

1352
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,560
I would prefer a world where somebody could like punch you

1353
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,440
in the face for you being a bigot,

1354
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,560
then go to jail over something that goes viral.

1355
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,600
About the whole,

1356
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,680
because you know what, going to jail does nothing to fix.

1357
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,560
It does not fix the person's racism at all.

1358
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,160
It doesn't do anything to fix it.

1359
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,920
Whereas if you punch the guy in the face

1360
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,840
and you have a man-to-man moment about like,

1361
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,360
oh shit dude, I guess the Hispanics can punch good.

1362
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,640
I respect you now.

1363
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,760
Then you've maybe, maybe this person

1364
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,280
is not ever as simple as that.

1365
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,560
I mean, I mean, something like.

1366
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,240
This is, yeah, yeah, but like I just wanted to quickly say

1367
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,640
about the whole, you know, not,

1368
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,320
if you don't want to sell to these people,

1369
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,280
you're free to do.

1370
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,000
I think that only for like maybe personal businesses,

1371
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,680
like for like, I don't know, like what do you guys have?

1372
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,840
Like we have ASDA, you guys have like, what sort of like.

1373
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,200
I'm not following that.

1374
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,080
Yeah, yeah, Walmart.

1375
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,960
Like a Walmart or something.

1376
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,920
Oh yeah, okay.

1377
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,200
ASDA is owned by Walmart, I think.

1378
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,840
Oh, is it?

1379
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,960
Okay, well now I know.

1380
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,000
Well, yeah, like shops like that should, you know,

1381
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,320
accommodate all people of all walks of life.

1382
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,840
I only like.

1383
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,480
I kind of disagree.

1384
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,760
I mean, I kind of disagree.

1385
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,560
Well, yeah, I would say that there should be no restrictions

1386
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,320
in place about that.

1387
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,800
But like, obviously, if you are a supermarket

1388
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,880
and you don't let a certain amount of people in,

1389
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,720
that's a certain amount of customers you're not getting

1390
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,240
and money runs everything.

1391
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,520
So like, why would you not?

1392
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,720
There's no reason as a big corporation to like deny

1393
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,440
a certain group.

1394
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,280
If there's no motive for a corporation to do it.

1395
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,120
That's just less money for you.

1396
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,320
That's just all that it does.

1397
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:48,360
Like a big corporation, like you have this chain sort of

1398
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,400
places and stuff like that, you're everywhere.

1399
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,400
It's not just one person having their own private little shop

1400
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,000
of their own private little things.

1401
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,520
So I think.

1402
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,160
I think it's the same thing though.

1403
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,280
I feel like both the corporations and the personal people

1404
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,160
should be able to choose whether or not they sell to anyone.

1405
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,000
You can definitely have a situation where like,

1406
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,960
let's say a Walmart comes into like a small ish town

1407
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,840
and because Walmart can undercut the prices of all the mom

1408
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,160
and pop shops, like they all go out of business.

1409
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,920
Let's say like they were all ruled, you know,

1410
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,280
by fucking Mexican people who, you know,

1411
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,680
live in America, whatever, Mexican, you know,

1412
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,520
historically, their ancestors.

1413
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,280
And like, so all those shops closed down.

1414
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,480
There's only Walmart.

1415
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,920
Oh, and by the way, Walmart refuses to sell to Mexican people.

1416
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,320
Like I get why that's a problem.

1417
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,800
That makes sense to like be wary.

1418
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,960
But what I would like is that the Mexican community or whatever

1419
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,840
makes their own grocery store that does sell to Mexican.

1420
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,000
And then they like, because they're such a large population,

1421
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,040
they make all the money.

1422
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:46,760
I mean, hopefully.

1423
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,720
It sounds like a terrible like idea to have, you know,

1424
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,360
just Walmart that only Mexicans can't eat.

1425
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,360
And it's like, well, what the fuck are we gonna do?

1426
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,480
And it's not necessarily possible for them to just suddenly

1427
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,800
make a rival supermarket chain.

1428
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,400
But like in like, hypothetically, they would make that

1429
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,240
and then they would get so much like,

1430
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,440
like a hundred percent of the Mexican profit from that area.

1431
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:10,920
Right.

1432
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,160
It's just, when you think about what it means,

1433
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,440
like what we're saying is we are going to force people

1434
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,880
in businesses to do what the government tells them to do.

1435
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,800
We are, and like Walmart doesn't owe its customers anything.

1436
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,360
Walmart existing is a pure boon to you.

1437
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,040
Walmart could close down and leave today from anywhere it wants.

1438
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,080
And like they were 100% in their rights to do so.

1439
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,160
So like you're asking Walmart to basically like give you

1440
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,960
something it doesn't have to give you if you're, you know,

1441
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,600
like imposing.

1442
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,160
The thing to understand about Walmart is that you can't,

1443
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,320
you can't have a one Walmart decide,

1444
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,400
I'm just not going to sell to Mexican people.

1445
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,720
Like Walmart has a corporate policy that every Walmart has to abide by.

1446
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,400
So if Walmart decided tomorrow they're not going to sell to Mexicans,

1447
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,960
every Walmart would have to fucking abide by that.

1448
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,600
Well, yeah.

1449
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,720
Walmart corporation would not survive a move like that.

1450
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,480
Like the backlash from social media would tank the entire company.

1451
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,160
Capitalism is absolutely shown.

1452
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,320
The whole point of capitalism is to get as much money

1453
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,920
from as many people as possible.

1454
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,640
So it's a great engine to fight against that stuff.

1455
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,080
And also imagine that Walmart tried, like they said,

1456
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:17,960
they had that policy.

1457
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,160
No Mexicans allowed.

1458
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,120
And then the entire country of Mexico is like,

1459
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,240
they can't build there anymore.

1460
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,280
That's like.

1461
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,040
They just lost a country worth of revenue.

1462
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:26,360
Yeah.

1463
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:26,760
Yeah.

1464
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,680
It's like, it's just, it makes no sense.

1465
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,360
And it doesn't seem like it would ever happen.

1466
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,400
But in the hypothetical that a company did decide to do that,

1467
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,240
I would let them.

1468
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,320
I wouldn't be like, I mean, I would hate them.

1469
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,760
I think that was the stupidest and most horrible thing you could do.

1470
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,640
What the fuck?

1471
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,080
You know, it'll be all in the news.

1472
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,960
But like, I don't think there should be a law that says

1473
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,400
you have to cater to every person that comes in.

1474
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,120
That's what I think.

1475
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,840
That's what I think.

1476
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,240
And I'm totally for, I got no problem with any race

1477
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,160
or any social group or whatever, sell to everybody.

1478
01:01:55,160 --> 01:02:00,120
But if like, if I really believe in a principled way in freedom,

1479
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,680
and I believe in, you know, being consistent here,

1480
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,080
I think it is morally wrong to compel someone's labor

1481
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,480
at the point of a gun as the state does.

1482
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,080
And by that same token, like as much as I think

1483
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,440
it's stupid and retarded, I would say the exact same thing

1484
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,960
to like, you know, those small businesses that charge white people

1485
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,280
more for things to try and like redistribute wealth

1486
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,880
for like black communities and stuff.

1487
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,760
They're like small businesses that do that.

1488
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,640
I wouldn't shop there.

1489
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,120
That's fine.

1490
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:26,440
I mean, of course.

1491
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,800
It just makes sense to not shop there.

1492
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,040
Yeah.

1493
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,040
Like, I'm not going to do it because like,

1494
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,800
why would I shoot myself in the foot like that?

1495
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,920
But like, you're free to do that.

1496
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,600
If you want to discriminate against me, that's fine.

1497
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,080
But I'm never going to buy a coffee.

1498
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,280
Or you know what, there was a,

1499
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,040
like, I heard something on the news recently

1500
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,160
about like a business that like, they just had like,

1501
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,080
something like a reparations day.

1502
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,640
But like, all it was was they just collected money

1503
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,760
and then just like gave to like the local African American community.

1504
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,360
But like, this was just their money.

1505
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,480
So like, that's fine.

1506
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,520
That's no problem at all.

1507
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,440
They just wanted to give money to people.

1508
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,920
That's totally cool for whatever fucking thing they wanted their money.

1509
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:57,880
Yeah.

1510
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:58,360
Exactly.

1511
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,640
I just believe in freedom, man.

1512
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,440
That's all.

1513
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,120
I mean, we're kind of on a huge tangent here.

1514
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,400
I forget how we got here.

1515
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,800
But no, we're talking about Twitter fighting, dude.

1516
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,840
Fighting, fighting.

1517
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,800
That's the problem right there.

1518
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,320
Uh-huh.

1519
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,080
Disagree with the whole.

1520
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,880
I mean, I believe in, you know, in the whole freedom.

1521
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,240
Maze doesn't believe in freedom, guys.

1522
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,080
I don't believe in freedom.

1523
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:23,160
I just, I don't see a reason not to sell to a group of people things.

1524
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,440
But Maze, you see what you're doing there.

1525
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,440
As you're saying that you don't see a reason,

1526
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,800
you're imposing your thought process on other people

1527
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,120
by saying that because you don't see a reason,

1528
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,800
everyone should do what you think they should do.

1529
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,160
No, I never said that.

1530
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,360
I'm just saying I'm so...

1531
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,400
Well, you're implying it.

1532
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,520
I'm explaining what that's implying.

1533
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,240
Well, no, I'm not.

1534
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,000
I want to say, I want to say, I like this, this, this, this,

1535
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,520
this is a difficult topic.

1536
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,440
And I, I've yet to set my opinion in any which way.

1537
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,360
It's just, it doesn't sound right to me.

1538
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,360
So I'm just like, I'm, I'm mildly disagreeing.

1539
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,080
But I'm not, I'm not, I'm not agreeing.

1540
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,120
It doesn't sound good to say.

1541
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,440
I'm not agreeing with the opposite side either.

1542
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,080
That's the thing.

1543
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,840
I'm just sort of like on the fence, I guess.

1544
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,560
I'm not sure.

1545
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,920
I think, I think the problem is that like to hold the position

1546
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,280
that we're talking about is letting the opportunity

1547
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,640
for horrible things to happen.

1548
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,040
Oh, yes.

1549
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,280
And like that's, that is, that is the price you pay to let,

1550
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,360
to, to, to be 100% free.

1551
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,520
It's like, you have to give people the opportunity

1552
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,960
to do fucking terrible things, like offensive things,

1553
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,360
but they also get to reap all the rewards

1554
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,720
of doing those terrible things,

1555
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,120
which is to piss off everybody who's not a fucking retard.

1556
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,200
I feel like there should be some sort of solution,

1557
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,520
like a middle ground, like a golden mill between these,

1558
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,560
but I can't find it.

1559
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:40,040
The middle ground is that people have money,

1560
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,640
and the more people you are nice to,

1561
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,840
the more money you will get from your people buying stuff.

1562
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,080
Yeah.

1563
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,240
So like the more palatable you are,

1564
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:51,080
the more, you know, open you are to anyone and everyone,

1565
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,200
the more money you'll make.

1566
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,080
So there's an incentive to be nice in a,

1567
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,520
in a world where you can do that.

1568
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:57,800
Yeah.

1569
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,520
So that, we would, one would hope that that is the compulsion.

1570
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,840
By the way, that is the compulsion that a lot of these

1571
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,320
huge companies like Walmart are absolutely driven by.

1572
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,720
Walmart wants to get money from everybody.

1573
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,880
So that's, that's the policy they've adopted.

1574
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,840
Seems that way to me anyway.

1575
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,520
Anywho, that's my point.

1576
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,800
Well, okay, issues noted, issues noted.

1577
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,760
Um, all right.

1578
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,480
Any, what else do we have to fucking say

1579
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,520
about fighting and shit?

1580
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,320
Why don't you just die if you fight me?

1581
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,040
That's what I have to say.

1582
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,160
I, I don't want to punch you.

1583
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,440
I just want you to fall down.

1584
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,880
Um, I, I've had like a number of like little boy fights.

1585
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,160
Like when I was just, you know, I didn't know how to,

1586
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,960
because people would, you know, how kids, they,

1587
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,840
everyone's scared of actually doing anything

1588
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,520
when they're the same age, same height, you know,

1589
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,320
they're not bullies, they're just being brats to each other.

1590
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,640
And they're like, you know, they say mean things

1591
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,440
because they want you to do the first move

1592
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,440
because then you're the one who gets in trouble.

1593
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,800
And I'm like, I, I don't have a diss track.

1594
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,280
I don't know how to say fuck you in any other way.

1595
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,080
Or like if I was a rapper, I would just say fuck you

1596
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,280
as the, my diss track.

1597
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:10,600
And then bam, bam, you know, that's, that's all it would be.

1598
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,760
It was just like, I just want to deck here

1599
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,280
because that's all I need to say.

1600
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,960
And that's, I didn't really like have like the,

1601
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,400
the gumption to do it a lot at school.

1602
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,080
But I would always like resort to shoves and like, you know,

1603
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,760
being like a weirdo.

1604
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,640
I guess it was just like, I was a shovy boy.

1605
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,840
I was a weirdo.

1606
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,560
I would be like excessively violent at sports.

1607
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,040
Like in soccer, like I was, I loved playing defense

1608
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,080
because I could kick people.

1609
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,080
I think I've said this a bunch of times, like.

1610
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,400
See, we're all looking for an outlet, dude.

1611
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:49,400
We all have, you know, we need, we need to bring back duels,

1612
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,840
but they just have to be non-lethal.

1613
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,160
We have to have like, on the book, duels.

1614
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,720
I'd love to slap a guy with a fucking glove

1615
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,600
and say duel right now.

1616
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,880
I'd challenge you to a duel.

1617
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,440
And then it's, it's, you get, there's like regulation for it.

1618
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,240
There's like a way that it's, it's, it's, it's designed to be done.

1619
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,240
And we can just fucking throw down with people.

1620
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,760
And then it's decided to be legal.

1621
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,000
Oh, that's a good one.

1622
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,800
Ring top hats.

1623
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,120
Yes.

1624
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,520
Radcon for dual.

1625
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,400
Literal duels.

1626
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,240
All right, all right.

1627
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,640
We should literally kill each other in the ring.

1628
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,000
Yeah.

1629
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,080
Dude, Radcon four should be, we should hire out

1630
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,080
like a wrestling ring and just do that.

1631
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:23,320
Oh man.

1632
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,360
Like easy to wrestling.

1633
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,920
If we can have some sort of IRL wrestling thing.

1634
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,160
Guys, you're missing the most of, we need to,

1635
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,880
we need to have Radcon four be in Lithuania

1636
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:36,280
in mage's hometown so we can join the violent violence and fucking throw down.

1637
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,520
Like I said, it's a lot nicer now.

1638
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,440
Yeah, we're going to bring it back.

1639
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,480
As tourists.

1640
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,920
We're going to bomb it the fuck out.

1641
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,720
So you can bring back.

1642
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,680
Mage, our arrival is going to be the end of your time skip.

1643
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,840
And that's going to be the next chapter in your manga.

1644
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,240
Yeah.

1645
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:49,880
That's good.

1646
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,600
When the B cash.

1647
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,400
So it's all, it's all nice, it's all nice and presentable now.

1648
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,760
But when we're there, well, things are going to go down.

1649
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:03,000
You said you weren't much of a, like a verbal fight boy.

1650
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,440
You just, you wanted to get physical.

1651
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,920
I would, I would scowl and like want to kill them.

1652
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,800
And that's all I would do.

1653
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,760
That's understandable.

1654
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,560
I was definitely more of a like, I was never good at it.

1655
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,560
And I would get really sweaty and nervous and uncomfortable whenever someone like

1656
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,360
dissed me via verbs as a young man.

1657
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,520
And still to this day, like if somebody comes up to me and starts talking smack.

1658
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,360
Oh, get a little hot under the collar when I realized the shit is going down.

1659
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,800
And now girls are watching and I need to impress them with my, with my responses.

1660
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:38,760
It's just like, I don't know, I've enjoyed those in history and it feels really good

1661
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,400
when you're able to like bring a sick comeback like George Costanza and just like, you know,

1662
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,920
defeat someone through a verbal confrontation like that.

1663
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,120
I like those.

1664
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,080
I enjoy those on the, on the occasions they happen.

1665
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,280
But they were unfortunately rare.

1666
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,320
A linguistic kill shot.

1667
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:53,800
I was.

1668
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,280
Oh, guys.

1669
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:54,600
That's right.

1670
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:00,200
Speaking of stuff like that, what do you think about like the phrase, be the bigger man?

1671
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:06,840
Like in terms of like not resorting to violence and just letting people shit on you.

1672
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,520
The thing about being the bigger man is I never really liked that.

1673
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:15,240
It's useful up to a point, like because there is a time if you just continue to be the bigger

1674
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:20,120
man forever, then you're just being a pussy and you're letting people like steamroll you.

1675
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,320
So that's no good.

1676
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,840
Like, but the thing, I would, I would argue that the idea of being the bigger man,

1677
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:30,040
like we all recognize that at a certain point, like if some dude like punches your sister

1678
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:35,320
and you are the bigger man and don't like confront and you're like, oh, he's not even worth.

1679
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,160
Well, at that point it's like, well, now you're just like being a bitch.

1680
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,480
Being, being the bigger man is also, it's like a subset of choosing your battles.

1681
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,280
It's, it means don't swing wildly for no reason.

1682
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,440
But sometimes you do swing.

1683
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,640
Sometimes it is a problem.

1684
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,320
Sometimes you gotta swing.

1685
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:56,120
I was, I was sort of taught that eventually because like I said, I was, I was the tallest

1686
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:59,240
kid around usually in my age group.

1687
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:04,680
So, you know, for me, like for onlookers, it just looked like I was beating up little kids.

1688
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,520
Yeah, that's true.

1689
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,640
It's tough to be a big boy because you always look like the bully in a situation.

1690
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,080
And it's, it's weird.

1691
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,880
It seems like there's a pattern of like small, skinny kids, like bullying, larger,

1692
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,320
generally fat kids.

1693
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,600
It seems like a pattern.

1694
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,480
And then I don't know, maybe it's cause like, I don't know.

1695
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:27,240
I've seen this, like there's that one famous video of like the skinny kid,

1696
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,160
like bullying this like bigger, fatter, taller guy who was just like quiet and timid.

1697
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,160
And then he fucking like, he like, he picks him up and he like slams him on the ground

1698
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,840
because he just had enough finally and it's awesome.

1699
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:45,480
I mean, the reason that happens is I'm sure is because like the young, the small weak kid

1700
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,840
is too scared to actually fight the people who are like the real problem.

1701
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,000
So they go for, they go for the easier target.

1702
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,320
So it's like, it's easy to say someone's fat when they are fat and that's what they do.

1703
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,320
I have two more stories I can tell.

1704
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,960
Okay, shoot.

1705
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:10,440
Quickly in the neighborhood, like a lot of the fights I noticed I would have like consensual,

1706
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,680
like it wasn't like no one was bullying anyone.

1707
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,400
We were just fighting because it was cool and fun and we sort of picked fights with each other.

1708
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,120
You just wanted to fight.

1709
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,160
You kind of, yeah.

1710
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:19,960
Literally a show.

1711
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:25,320
We were not being, you know, watched by any parents or anything and fighting was a past

1712
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,040
time I guess.

1713
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:33,080
But anyway, like I think we used to do, the guys of the neighborhood would pester the girls,

1714
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:37,160
but like this is sort of like, it's a, it was an agreement between us.

1715
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,360
It was like a sudden agreement.

1716
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,080
We all knew this.

1717
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:42,760
We'd never really talked about this, but the guys would pester us.

1718
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,000
They would call us names, a specific name actually.

1719
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,520
They called us tigers.

1720
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,800
I'll explain that later.

1721
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,960
And whenever they would do that, the girls would chase after the guys and if they caught

1722
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:57,080
up to the guys, they would beat the guys up and they would come back for more later.

1723
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,960
So, you know, it's not like, you know, we were bullying them or anything.

1724
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,680
They specifically sought us out to be beat up.

1725
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,040
Damn, maybe it was like a fetish thing for them.

1726
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:06,440
They were into it.

1727
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,560
And the reason they...

1728
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,240
That opens up a lot of doors, mage.

1729
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:09,640
I'm very...

1730
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,360
Yeah, it's true.

1731
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,720
That's interesting.

1732
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:19,160
And the reason we would call tigers, it wasn't like, it seemed a lot less weird than it does

1733
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:24,440
now is because like, in a way it was for them to tease us.

1734
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:29,240
And but at the same time, we sort of accepted the name and whenever we would like, hear that

1735
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:34,040
and like, sort of like, to signal that we're about to chase them, we would let out a growl.

1736
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,280
And so, you were literally a purple tiger.

1737
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,720
Kind of, I guess, yeah.

1738
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,520
Later on...

1739
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,480
So, I'm just...

1740
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,920
There's a character in one piece who's called the purple tiger, Fujitora.

1741
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,360
I think you are that guy.

1742
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,200
I don't know how they look like, but...

1743
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,080
That's what I have to say.

1744
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:51,400
Okay.

1745
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,640
He's an old man who's blind.

1746
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,440
Yes, that's me.

1747
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,800
Uh, that's it.

1748
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,760
Yeah, sounds right.

1749
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,560
Sounds about right.

1750
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:03,480
Yeah, one of my friends got a different name later on because there was a TV series about

1751
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,240
like, Xena warrior princess.

1752
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:11,560
And she could do like a similar kind of jump that she did and also the noise she did,

1753
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,600
like the work writhing.

1754
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,240
And because of that, she got started being called Xena.

1755
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,920
The rest of us stayed just tigers.

1756
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,800
That's pretty sick, dude.

1757
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,320
And the last...

1758
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,000
That's so funny.

1759
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,080
Like, I just really like that.

1760
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,040
How young were you when you were doing that sort of stuff?

1761
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,400
No, it was definitely before Xena.

1762
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:33,960
Before eight.

1763
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,440
Because like around...

1764
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:41,320
So yeah, it's just sort of a really cute, like child kids running around saying tiger,

1765
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,800
because as like a, as like a known, um, initiation of like, let's play...

1766
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,080
Yeah, like, let's play tag and then you get to beat me up if I lose.

1767
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,040
How do you say tiger in Lithuania?

1768
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:52,760
Tigris.

1769
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,120
But that's like the male version.

1770
01:13:54,120 --> 01:14:00,040
So the, um, uh, and the general version for the tiger, but we were called Tigris.

1771
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,360
That's the plural of tiger for females.

1772
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:04,600
Cool.

1773
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,760
And that's...

1774
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,640
Yeah, like...

1775
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,800
So next time we get to Radcon and Major doesn't show up, we just got to Skype her

1776
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,680
and be like, and just call her out and she'll come running and like three hours,

1777
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,600
four hours later, she'll be on the plane and then in the middle of the night,

1778
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,480
she'll jump across the ocean.

1779
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:27,480
You call me and then you call me tiger and I hang up and like 12 hours later,

1780
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,640
you all get punched out of nowhere.

1781
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,360
Yeah, exactly.

1782
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,560
Out of nowhere.

1783
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,640
The violent violence comes through town.

1784
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,200
Yeah, exactly.

1785
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,960
Just fucking wretches all our shit.

1786
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,680
Oh, yeah.

1787
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,320
Good to know.

1788
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,760
Yeah, I stopped fighting around 12, 13 years old, by the way.

1789
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,200
That's when I got bullied, uh, just for the reference.

1790
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,120
So all these fighting stories was roughly 10 or younger.

1791
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,200
I see, I see.

1792
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:56,280
Yeah, one story, uh, it was around the time I sort of stopped liking to fight.

1793
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,360
Around 12 years old, I think.

1794
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:05,720
I think one of my last battles, I guess, so to speak, was in my friend's neighborhood.

1795
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,440
The friend was like, she was the daughter of my mom's friend.

1796
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,240
So we were friends just because our moms were friends,

1797
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,000
but she was like six years younger than me.

1798
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:19,320
And we were playing outside and she got bullied by these group of guys.

1799
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,680
And so I stood up for her because, you know, she was a little kid and they were like,

1800
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,800
sort of my age, a little bit younger, I think, you know, one or two years off.

1801
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,760
So there were three of us girls and three of those guys,

1802
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:37,080
but those two girls just watched, thanks.

1803
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,480
And so it was supposed to be one-on-one with me and a guy.

1804
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,760
And I remember, you know, throwing punches and punches,

1805
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:50,360
and he sort of blocked by doing like an X in front of him with his arms

1806
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,280
because he saw it in Dragon Ball Z.

1807
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,000
And remember, specifically, he said, it's like,

1808
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,360
hey, guys, this actually works.

1809
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,040
And they punched him in the gut while he was distracted.

1810
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,400
Why? What? Oh, because he was blocking like too high?

1811
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,520
Yeah, he was, yeah.

1812
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:08,760
And then like, because, yeah, because he kind of sort of moved his arms or something like that.

1813
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,400
I remember I punched him in the gut because he got distracted.

1814
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,840
So I was winning the fight, but then the other guys sort of started hitting me from behind.

1815
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,040
But they were all being a little bit chicken about it.

1816
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,720
They didn't like pile on top of me.

1817
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,760
They just like hit me and then like went back again.

1818
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,800
So I wouldn't hit them.

1819
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:27,640
That's even worse.

1820
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:27,960
That's even worse.

1821
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:28,440
I know.

1822
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:32,680
And like, I wasn't getting any sort of backup from my friend or her friend's friend.

1823
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,400
I hope they're dead.

1824
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,120
Fuck.

1825
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:34,840
No, it's okay.

1826
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:35,960
But I...

1827
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:36,600
Disgusting.

1828
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,560
But yeah, like, I think I eventually did win the fight.

1829
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,680
I don't remember how, but I remember I won the fight.

1830
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,320
And then I told him to leave us alone.

1831
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:50,680
And I told my friend I'm going home, well, her home because I was in her neighborhood.

1832
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,960
And as I was walking up the stairs, I started crying.

1833
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,800
Even though I won.

1834
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,280
You did or...

1835
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,080
I did.

1836
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,040
I started crying.

1837
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:58,760
Were you just...

1838
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,480
Did it just hurt or something?

1839
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:05,880
No, I was sort of frustrated mostly because I won all that fight all by myself.

1840
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,480
And, you know, those girls didn't help me win any...

1841
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,480
You know, at all they were just there watching.

1842
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,440
They didn't even go...

1843
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:12,840
Betrayed.

1844
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,120
They didn't even go ask for help from like our parents or anything.

1845
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,360
And, you know, it could have gotten a lot worse.

1846
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:23,000
I was happy I won, but I was mostly frustrated that I wasn't helped.

1847
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,920
But that was usually the case whenever I did fight and I had friends with me.

1848
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,560
My friends never intervened, even though the guys would sometimes...

1849
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,160
Bitches be trifling, man.

1850
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,280
Bitches be trifling.

1851
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:34,920
But yeah.

1852
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,080
Well, what a world.

1853
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:38,920
What a life.

1854
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,360
What a life.

1855
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,080
And now it's over.

1856
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,480
And we've got a new anime life lying before us.

1857
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,360
Uh, well guys, I'm out of fucking stories.

1858
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,840
How about we just get to the next fucking part?

1859
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,160
How about we just fucking fight right now?

1860
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,440
Let's just fight.

1861
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,720
I'm punching my microphone.

1862
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,440
Die.

1863
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,080
Die.

1864
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:57,960
I'm killing you all.

1865
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,840
Fucking idiot.

1866
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,120
I'm not his microphone.

1867
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,240
All right, let's get the fuck out of here.

1868
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:07,160
Okay, so we're done with the main thing.

1869
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:07,880
That was good.

1870
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,600
That was good.

1871
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,000
Let's...

1872
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
So we're in our next little section here.

1873
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Anything to say about our last episode?

1874
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,520
So everybody listen out there.

1875
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,200
When you're here in this...

1876
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:20,840
So we recorded this two days after the last episode came out.

1877
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,200
And we did this.

1878
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,080
The way we changed the whole schedule was so that we have time

1879
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,480
to like look at the fucking comments of the last episode,

1880
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,600
see what people are saying,

1881
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,480
and just see if there's anything to be revisited

1882
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,400
with that little extra window.

1883
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,560
So what the fuck was last week's episode?

1884
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,280
I can't even remember.

1885
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:36,840
Childhood?

1886
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,320
PCP.

1887
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,760
It was the one with all the stuff.

1888
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,560
Childhood.

1889
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,040
That's the one.

1890
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,000
Childhood, yes.

1891
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,920
Which I think everybody loved and was great.

1892
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,720
Not a lot of people because I think...

1893
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,640
I saw a few people be complaining

1894
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,640
because we had a lot of people on again, but...

1895
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,480
That's true.

1896
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,040
That's true.

1897
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,040
We might be slightly overdoing it.

1898
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,120
But there were people who were saying that they liked the fact

1899
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,360
that there's a rowdiness when there's a lot of people.

1900
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,440
A lot of people, yeah, you can't please all of them.

1901
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,480
So I'm sorry, you know, people sometimes

1902
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,480
are gonna have a few episodes where there's a lot of us

1903
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,760
and sometimes we'll have episodes like this.

1904
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,800
Well, you know what I would say, though?

1905
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,720
I would say that it is...

1906
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,000
It's more accessible.

1907
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,960
Like the people who are gonna listen

1908
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,760
will listen anyway because they like the PCP.

1909
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,480
But we should cater to the possible outsider

1910
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,800
and do the thing that the outsider would like

1911
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,320
because we've already entrapped the general reader.

1912
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,840
But it's bringing new audience members is the priority.

1913
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,480
You don't think so?

1914
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,040
I mean, I agree that that is a priority.

1915
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,640
I think that there's no reason to never do a big thing again

1916
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,400
because clearly people do like that.

1917
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:40,840
And if we stop doing that for the benefit of the normie crowd

1918
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,000
coming in, then the people who did like that

1919
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,160
are just gonna be pissed off and annoyed that we're not doing it.

1920
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,120
Personally, I like the idea that a few episodes are like,

1921
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:51,000
you know, just four of us and a few episodes are like,

1922
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,600
you know, most of us.

1923
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:56,120
I like the variety, I like the randomness.

1924
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,800
PCP is like a box of chocolates.

1925
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,440
You never know what you're getting.

1926
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,960
You never know whether it's got...

1927
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,160
You look at the labels and talk and you know exactly what you're getting.

1928
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,280
Well, I mean, you know, if you're in the PCP fan discord, you know...

1929
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,360
It's true.

1930
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:09,880
Give us your money.

1931
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,600
PCP is like a box of chocolates.

1932
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,640
You never know whether it's too expensive or not,

1933
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,240
and you don't want to buy it really.

1934
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:17,960
Hey, here's the thing.

1935
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,560
Here's a comment that somebody left.

1936
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,400
EatSumoListless left this.

1937
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,320
This is mildly amusing.

1938
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:23,880
This guy says,

1939
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,960
I got your Christian names here, fam.

1940
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,960
So this is in response to the whole like middle name

1941
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,400
that you guys named with your Christian.

1942
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,000
Let's see, Nate, not a cog in the machine.

1943
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,880
Best man.

1944
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:34,200
Good.

1945
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:34,680
Yes.

1946
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,560
Digi played with sticks until 17, bro.

1947
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,400
Uh, Mage...

1948
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,800
Christianity is a fairy tale.

1949
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,200
Purple.

1950
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:42,760
It is.

1951
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,480
Mage purple.

1952
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,320
Or it was a fairy tale, whatever.

1953
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,720
Ben, daddy watched me on cameras.

1954
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,560
I like that one the most.

1955
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,120
Munchy cartoons weren't cool until My Little Pony, Tiny Hats.

1956
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,560
The dad raised us to be happy.

1957
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:57,960
Davoo.

1958
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,560
That's a strange one.

1959
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,120
And hippo school was fun.

1960
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:02,600
Correct.

1961
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,920
Why is everyone, everyone you have like your username sort of divided up

1962
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,200
that mine has purple?

1963
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,200
I mean, I'm not complaining about the purple part,

1964
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,400
but he could have had like...

1965
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:11,720
I don't know, dude.

1966
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,640
Lethal or at the end or something.

1967
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,280
I guess because he would have had to start with lethal

1968
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,440
and then put like something, something Aurora Mage,

1969
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,280
and he wanted the Mage to be like the first part.

1970
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:20,680
No, no, no, no.

1971
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,160
He split up someone else oddly enough as well.

1972
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,800
Well, he split up the Davoo weird the,

1973
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,720
then like middle name Davoo.

1974
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:29,320
I don't know.

1975
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,560
In any case, like I'm not complaining about the purple.

1976
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,520
It's a good enough word to use for me.

1977
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,000
Just, I just found it as weird.

1978
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,320
Indeed.

1979
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,520
And instead of that was episode 111,

1980
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,720
I see the memes, I see the ones spammed in chat.

1981
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,760
They have been noted, observed, appreciate.

1982
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,600
I kind of don't like that sometimes.

1983
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,040
Because I feel like some people didn't give actual comments

1984
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,400
because they wrote a one comment.

1985
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,560
Well, maybe, but this is episode 111.

1986
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,560
It's, if there was ever a time to spam that one in chat,

1987
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,160
it had to be this time.

1988
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,240
And what about the 1111?

1989
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,600
Well, we'll get there one of these days.

1990
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,160
That'll take eight years, I think, or is it 10 years?

1991
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,200
10 years, actually.

1992
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:08,920
It'll take to get there.

1993
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,240
Hey, maybe the potty cuss will be over by then.

1994
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,520
Maybe, it might be.

1995
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,000
We'll see.

1996
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:14,840
All right.

1997
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,440
I mean, I got nothing to say about that episode.

1998
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,160
Yeah, let's just move on.

1999
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,360
Let's move the fuck along.

2000
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,720
Let's go, let's do questions.

2001
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,400
It's time for the questions, everybody.

2002
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,040
It's time.

2003
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,400
Let me, let me go to this whole, this whole Twitter over here.

2004
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:27,880
All right.

2005
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,440
What do we got?

2006
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,080
What do we got?

2007
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,640
Questions, please give us a good fucking question.

2008
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,880
Um, here we go.

2009
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,040
At Captain Thought One asks, uh,

2010
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,840
what's the cure for cynicism, my boys?

2011
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,360
That's a thought-provoking question.

2012
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,040
Uh, cure for cynicism.

2013
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,800
Season one and two of My Little Pony.

2014
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,720
There you go, guys.

2015
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:48,760
Oh, he's right.

2016
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,160
Oh, he's right.

2017
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:52,360
I'm trying to think, cynicism, like, in what sense?

2018
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,800
Well, okay, let me think.

2019
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,920
Like, is that, um, like a nihilist sort of cynicism?

2020
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,880
Yeah, like, I'm interpreting this the way that I understand it,

2021
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,160
but it's like, okay, let's say you've been watching anime for a million years

2022
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,680
and you get older and you're like, uh, anime isn't good anymore.

2023
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,960
How do you, how do you enjoy, how do you love anime again?

2024
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,960
Or, or insert media of your choice here?

2025
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:16,040
I mean, according to Ratatouille, you gotta just go back to your past

2026
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,360
and remember why you started, what you started.

2027
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,280
Like, what, what, how did I get here?

2028
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,800
Why do I do anything?

2029
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,200
You know what?

2030
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,080
You're right.

2031
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:27,000
That was the message of, of yesterday's new My Hero Academia,

2032
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,160
the fucking hypest moment ever.

2033
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,560
Was it the manga or the, the anime episode?

2034
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,000
It was the anime episode.

2035
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,480
Okay.

2036
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,400
Well, why would I have actually read most of that?

2037
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,440
Was it when the, the big guy jumped around and he smashed the guy

2038
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,920
and he said, fuck you, bitch.

2039
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,160
And then everyone was like, whoa, he's so strong.

2040
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,280
And that, I agree.

2041
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:44,920
Help me out, Tom.

2042
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,480
What happens?

2043
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,600
I've actually read most of that.

2044
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,720
Well, what, which episode was that?

2045
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,280
This was the episode with the United States of Smash,

2046
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,080
when All Might has to remember his past and where he came from

2047
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,680
to fucking beat all for one.

2048
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:55,160
It was fucking insane.

2049
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,880
Is that, did he, so he'd just beat, uh, what was it?

2050
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,520
It's all for one.

2051
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,240
All for one, right?

2052
01:23:59,240 --> 01:23:59,640
Yeah.

2053
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,720
He just beat those the last episode.

2054
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,280
That is like the best moment in the fucking series.

2055
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:04,360
It is.

2056
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,120
Dude, they animated it so well.

2057
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,160
Oh, it was delicious.

2058
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:07,560
Oh, it was great.

2059
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,800
I kind of want to watch My Hero Academia.

2060
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,200
Like I've read the manga mostly, uh, but-

2061
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,160
It's fucking great.

2062
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:13,880
It's a lot of episodes.

2063
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:14,920
It's, dude, it's like-

2064
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,440
I hear it's animated so well, though,

2065
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,120
that I kind of want to watch it just for that alone.

2066
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,240
Have you, have you watched any of it?

2067
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,960
I've seen like a couple, like, what do they call it?

2068
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,920
Saka burros.

2069
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,000
Like that one moment where like Ice Fireman,

2070
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,680
like snaps his fingers, there's some sparks

2071
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,520
and then like a big explosion of flame.

2072
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,280
It's like the best anime thing I've ever seen

2073
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:30,920
in my fucking life.

2074
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,560
The whole show is like that, dude.

2075
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,680
This is so fucking good.

2076
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:32,920
Like, like-

2077
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,040
Well, it sounds incredible.

2078
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,440
The anime, the anime is better than the manga.

2079
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,120
Like, it is unquestionably a better experience.

2080
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,160
Have you read the manga, too?

2081
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,120
Yes, I'm caught up.

2082
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:42,840
Well, shit, dude.

2083
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,000
Uh, I mean, that's a pretty good fucking sell.

2084
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,560
Why don't we go to start My Podcast Academia?

2085
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,240
My Podcast Academia?

2086
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,920
Dude, um, no.

2087
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,880
That could be the, that could be the Tom show on the PCP.

2088
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:56,760
That's a terrible idea.

2089
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,480
That's a humble bring on people and talk about that show.

2090
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,560
I like, mechademia.

2091
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,840
I can't wait to talk about how mediocre I find that show to be.

2092
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,680
Well, I will hate you forever.

2093
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,960
We'll have to fight about it if that's the case.

2094
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,160
We will fight about it.

2095
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:09,560
That's true.

2096
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,160
I mean, I might be on that as well

2097
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,600
because I generally, everything I see about my hero academia,

2098
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,960
I'm like, ehh.

2099
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,080
That's pretty much how I feel.

2100
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,680
And I read like the whole thing.

2101
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,600
Uh, but the anime, the anime is just better.

2102
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,560
I mean, that's a plus.

2103
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:24,040
The anime is better.

2104
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,800
Okay, whatever, enough about bullshit anime.

2105
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,600
It doesn't meander.

2106
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,960
It's just like, every fight is like.

2107
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:28,760
Okay, well that's good.

2108
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,680
Until you guys get like murdered for saying that the anime is better.

2109
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,960
I haven't read, so I-

2110
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:37,560
I'm on record as talking about how mediocre I find the series overall.

2111
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,080
Like, mostly to be.

2112
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,360
I mean, Nate, you're full of terrible opinions.

2113
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,360
So I'm not surprised there's another one on the table.

2114
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,560
Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.

2115
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,400
Um, what else we got?

2116
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,640
I mean, here's a question for me, but let me put it at everybody.

2117
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,480
At Diploid39 just asks,

2118
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,280
Nate, oh, I forgot.

2119
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,880
These are the pity questions on the Twitter.

2120
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:54,840
So this will be our last one.

2121
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:59,400
Hashtag asked PCP to at TP Crasnators.

2122
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,920
That's the Twitter, but just use the hashtag, whatever.

2123
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,120
Nate, how would you want the world to end?

2124
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,880
How would you want-

2125
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,000
Wait, didn't we answer that before?

2126
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,640
I think we did.

2127
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,080
Did we?

2128
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:09,560
I don't know.

2129
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,440
I- Meteor, smashing into the planet just blows the whole thing up.

2130
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:13,640
That's definitely what I would want.

2131
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,800
If I could just choose any of them.

2132
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,520
That's the coolest-

2133
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,120
Yeah, we definitely answered this before.

2134
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,040
But whatever, maybe other people are here.

2135
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,320
Any other good ones?

2136
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,400
Frozen solid instantly in a block of ice.

2137
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:23,960
That's also a pretty good one.

2138
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,000
Heat death of the universe.

2139
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,840
We should make it all the way to the end.

2140
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,000
Oh, but that's like a slow, scary way to die.

2141
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,680
I'd rather just explode all at once in my face, and then it's over.

2142
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,160
Think of how-

2143
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:34,920
Actually, a different kind of heat death.

2144
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:38,440
I would rather it blink out of existence, and I feel no pain.

2145
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,240
Then it doesn't matter.

2146
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:39,560
That's what I want.

2147
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,320
If it's a heat death of the universe, not going to be our problem.

2148
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,200
That, I mean, yeah, yeah.

2149
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,840
But like, the reality of the heat death of the universe happening-

2150
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,400
Think of how far beyond Starfleet we could get to,

2151
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,480
if we get all the way to the heat death of the universe.

2152
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:51,960
Well, sure.

2153
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,200
But the people who are alive then will be really scared,

2154
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,800
and then they'll all die, and they'll be really sad,

2155
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:55,880
because they won't-

2156
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,080
That's welcome.

2157
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,200
Yeah, fair point.

2158
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,000
Mage, how would you want the world to end?

2159
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,080
I said this before.

2160
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:09,560
Meteor, quick, quick, quick, and destroy everything.

2161
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,360
Okay, we definitely answered this.

2162
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,960
All right, give just to reiterate.

2163
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:19,080
I want a big space dog to come up and just take a bite out of the earth.

2164
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,520
And then the core will be exposed,

2165
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,000
and then it'll crumble into nothingness.

2166
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,480
Okay.

2167
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,680
That'll be pretty cool.

2168
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,400
Well, fuck you.

2169
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,360
Space dog.

2170
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,440
Fuck you, Diploid, for asking an old question,

2171
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,960
making me read it like an asshole.

2172
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,680
Fuck you.

2173
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,160
All right.

2174
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,920
And he has a fucking micro-academia fucking icon.

2175
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,280
What a fucking shock.

2176
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,680
I have a good question from the patron-

2177
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:41,560
Typical brainwrit.

2178
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,280
Yeah, okay.

2179
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,640
From Happy D.

2180
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,440
He says, when you were a child slash young adult,

2181
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,360
did you ever get in any really big fights with your parents or close relatives?

2182
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,960
Not generally.

2183
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,520
I, one time, I kicked Ben in the stomach for no reason,

2184
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,280
and my dad got really mad,

2185
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,480
but that wasn't really if, like, he just yelled at me for doing that.

2186
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,200
I got screaming master with my mom a lot.

2187
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:06,840
Yeah.

2188
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,560
I was very...

2189
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:08,680
About what topic?

2190
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,200
Just, just, just everything.

2191
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,040
We still butt heads to this day, so.

2192
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:12,520
Yeah, okay.

2193
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,880
I just realized that I forgot to...

2194
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:19,880
Non-confrontational, so I never fought with anyone in my family.

2195
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:21,480
All right.

2196
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,400
You got it all out on the streets.

2197
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:23,880
That's true.

2198
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:28,440
I am, I didn't talk about this,

2199
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:32,200
but, like, I did have fights with my brothers, like physical fights,

2200
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,640
and since I was the oldest one,

2201
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,680
I was kind of always the wrong guy,

2202
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,520
even though, even though they would do, like,

2203
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,160
the classic little brother thing of being an annoying piece of shit,

2204
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,560
because they knew that if I fought back,

2205
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,560
they would get me in trouble, for sure.

2206
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,040
Yeah, they do all that stuff, but, like,

2207
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:54,440
man, I, I was not a good brother sometimes.

2208
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,400
Sometimes I was kind of a terrible and evil.

2209
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,040
How so?

2210
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:58,520
How so?

2211
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:04,360
Um, I mean, it's not like they, it was out of nowhere.

2212
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:05,880
Like, I wouldn't just come home from school

2213
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,560
and then punch my brother in the face.

2214
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,760
It wouldn't be like that,

2215
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,400
but it would be like, we would be arguing about something,

2216
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,840
and, you know, maybe one of my brothers had had a bad day,

2217
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:15,800
and I had had a bad day,

2218
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,320
and then we'd argue about something,

2219
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,080
and then it would turn into, like, a scuffle,

2220
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,120
and then a punch, and then a throw things across the room,

2221
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,200
and then screaming, and it's like, oh, God.

2222
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,680
Oh, not good.

2223
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:27,960
That sounds hilarious.

2224
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:32,520
I mean, it, we are, like, really close now, because, you know, we're just...

2225
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,280
Brothers get closer, they get older, I think.

2226
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,280
And I think a part of it is because we had fights.

2227
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:40,760
If we never talked to each other and we just kept to ourselves,

2228
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,600
we'd probably be like some of those weird, like,

2229
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:47,640
estranged siblings sort of deals where, like, nobody talks to each other.

2230
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,000
Like, I've seen that in media, and I'm like,

2231
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,040
that doesn't make any sense.

2232
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,360
My brothers are in a mere fucking tight...

2233
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,920
Like, Ben and I fought, and, you know, I didn't think of this either.

2234
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,120
Ben and I definitely fought sometimes.

2235
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,720
We had, like, these trampoline battles

2236
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,960
where we'd, like, do flips onto each other and stuff.

2237
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:00,920
Those are pretty cool.

2238
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,680
Oh, that's funny fighting.

2239
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,840
Yeah, that's not, like, rage fighting.

2240
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,040
Only once in a while.

2241
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,600
Like, Ben historically was known...

2242
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,880
Or my sister historically was known to, when aggressed,

2243
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:15,000
curl into a ball on the floor and just, like, lie there

2244
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,080
and attempt to just, like, you know...

2245
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,320
Like, when she did that, like, you couldn't hit her

2246
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,920
because, like, she's being too pathetic.

2247
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:25,400
So you couldn't punch her no matter how bad you wanted to.

2248
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,320
And I wanted to a lot all the time.

2249
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,880
You know, it's where my addiction to beating women

2250
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,080
really kicked into high gear.

2251
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,880
You know, it's just, like...

2252
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,200
And Ben and I, the thing was, it was mostly passive-aggressive

2253
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,240
in my family.

2254
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:44,280
Like, the biggest grievance I have with my family growing up

2255
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,120
was that, like, I was sad we didn't, like,

2256
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,480
do more stuff together.

2257
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,240
And I was, like, lonely in my room.

2258
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,360
That's, like, my biggest, like, I don't know,

2259
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,800
thing I didn't like about growing up

2260
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,320
that I remember the least fondly.

2261
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:57,960
Like, I wish we'd gone out and, like, done more stuff together.

2262
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,520
So, like, would that just create this, like,

2263
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,120
weird passive-aggressiveness of, like,

2264
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,240
everyone would be in their room,

2265
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,480
and I'd just be, like, lonely, sitting in mine,

2266
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:07,560
like, wishing we could, like, hang out and do stuff.

2267
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,680
But, like, when you're, like, a kid,

2268
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,920
and, like, your older brother is, like, doing his own stuff,

2269
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,600
it's, you know, it's just, like, of course,

2270
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,040
he's gonna be hanging out with his friends,

2271
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,080
not his little brother.

2272
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:15,800
That's gay.

2273
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,600
You know, I'm sure I felt the same way

2274
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,720
about my little sister, too.

2275
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,200
So the cycle continues, and will continue forever.

2276
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,240
So...

2277
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,720
But occasionally, Ben and I would get mad,

2278
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,960
and I remember running from Ben while he chased me

2279
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,840
quite a few times.

2280
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,280
And, you know, just doing whatever I could

2281
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,400
to avoid this rain of blows.

2282
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,520
Imagine that today.

2283
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,040
Nate running from Ben.

2284
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:36,520
I know.

2285
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,840
Now Ben has learned to fear me and laugh.

2286
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,240
Yeah, that's all I got.

2287
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,480
I just remembered in terms of talking

2288
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,440
about the fighting thing.

2289
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,840
I think I've heard this, again, not confirmed to be true,

2290
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,000
but little kids don't feel pain quite as much as adults do,

2291
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,240
because I'm guessing it's because, you know,

2292
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,960
they're in the stage of, like, learning and whatnot.

2293
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,800
So, you know, they're supposed to, like,

2294
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:03,720
get scuffs and scrapes and whatnot.

2295
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:07,080
So pain isn't registered so much,

2296
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,520
or at least it's not that big of a deal to little kids.

2297
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,400
That's why I was so...

2298
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,760
Maybe.

2299
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,480
Maybe that's why I was so rowdy when I was a little kid,

2300
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,720
because pain didn't scare me as much.

2301
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,360
Mages confirmed for a row.

2302
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:26,920
Listen to this question from AJ Shoup.

2303
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,120
All right, get ready for this one.

2304
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,480
Brace for impact.

2305
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,240
You're fighting a dude slash gal

2306
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,920
who is evenly matched with you,

2307
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,720
and they straight up poop on their fucking hand,

2308
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:38,840
smear it in, and get back into fighting form.

2309
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,240
Do you continue with the shit show,

2310
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,240
or choose to lose the fight?

2311
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,200
What do you do?

2312
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,200
It depends entirely on the stakes.

2313
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:47,660
Yeah.

2314
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:50,280
The smart man would run, or, like, just...

2315
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,880
No, like, I don't...

2316
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:55,880
Okay, like, sometimes it's okay to admit defeat.

2317
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,240
I don't want poopy on my hand.

2318
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,440
I don't want poopy on my face.

2319
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,080
Right.

2320
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,120
No way.

2321
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:00,920
No, sir.

2322
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:01,320
I feel...

2323
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:02,680
Did this come from personal experience?

2324
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,160
Is this, like...

2325
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,960
This is an oddly specific question.

2326
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:08,600
I'm just saying.

2327
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:09,960
It is quite specific.

2328
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,360
I feel like he might be the aggressor in this case as well.

2329
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,800
I can say that I would...

2330
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:17,160
I would basically do anything to avoid contact

2331
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,160
in this situation.

2332
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,160
I would not let that happen.

2333
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,920
That is so disgusting.

2334
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:23,640
Oh, my God.

2335
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,480
All right, I now know how to beat all of you in a fight.

2336
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:28,280
Noted.

2337
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:28,920
That's true.

2338
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:29,480
That's true.

2339
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,200
Like, I mean, could you live down the fact

2340
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,880
that you pooped in your hand to win?

2341
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,560
Depending on what I needed to get done,

2342
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,720
and how badly I need to beat you,

2343
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,680
I might have to...

2344
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,240
Mistakes might have to be made.

2345
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,360
Do you remember that...

2346
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,120
This reminds me, like, it's like a game of chicken.

2347
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,600
You remember that fight in, like, the last season of Game of Thrones,

2348
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,240
where Theon, like, is exerting dominance?

2349
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,720
And, like, this big boy, this big other, you know,

2350
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:53,160
Iron Islands guy, like, he's trying to, like, take over.

2351
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,920
Theon's trying to become a man at last.

2352
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:55,880
And so this guy, like, punches him.

2353
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:56,360
He falls down.

2354
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,000
He gets back up.

2355
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,760
The dude's, like, stay down, punches him.

2356
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,720
He falls back down again.

2357
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:00,440
Theon gets back up.

2358
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,240
He won't stay down.

2359
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,360
He keeps getting up.

2360
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,240
Imagine if the man had dropped Trow, pooped on his hand,

2361
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,480
and then said, like, what now, Theon?

2362
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,040
What now?

2363
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,080
Theon would have wilted, like, a fucking flower, you know?

2364
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,280
Like, a flower in winter.

2365
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,320
But no, he didn't take it to that level.

2366
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:17,480
Theon probably would have done that, though,

2367
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,400
because he would do whatever it takes.

2368
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,880
He doesn't have much further to fall at this point, you know?

2369
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,520
That's true.

2370
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,240
That's very true.

2371
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,800
Okay, done with that.

2372
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,680
Next question.

2373
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,160
You know what?

2374
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,640
This is kind of just a public service announcement, actually.

2375
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,240
Oblivion Fall here.

2376
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,040
This is, okay, says,

2377
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,160
Is there a deadline for the PCP intro contest?

2378
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,760
I've had something written for a while,

2379
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,400
but I'm having trouble getting musicians together,

2380
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,640
and Fiverr is giving me trouble with PayPal.

2381
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,080
I don't want to miss out.

2382
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,240
This guy is getting serious about this shit.

2383
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:47,240
I feel like if there is a deadline,

2384
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:48,600
I want to give him an extension,

2385
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,760
just because I want to see where this madness leads.

2386
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:51,640
I feel the same way.

2387
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:52,840
I don't know.

2388
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,840
I don't really want to put a deadline into place,

2389
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,600
but I feel like it would actually be helpful to do that.

2390
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,400
I feel like we definitely should put a deadline.

2391
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,360
We'll just get answers for everything.

2392
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,640
But it shouldn't be soon.

2393
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,000
It wouldn't be soon.

2394
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,960
Maybe like a month?

2395
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,240
Like a month?

2396
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:05,720
From today?

2397
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:06,120
From now?

2398
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,120
Maybe a month when this episode goes live.

2399
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,400
The end of the summer?

2400
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,520
I mean, just have it be like a summer?

2401
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,720
End of the summer.

2402
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,280
You know, I really don't want to make it stretch out too long.

2403
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,480
Like maybe we could say,

2404
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,240
what if we said the end of July,

2405
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,680
which is a month and a half basically?

2406
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,400
I'm chill with that.

2407
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,240
Okay, that's fair.

2408
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,760
All right, guys, you heard it.

2409
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,760
We are assigning a deadline right now.

2410
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,520
July 31st is the final date.

2411
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,920
That is the last day we are accepting applications.

2412
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,280
If you send something,

2413
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,600
August 1st, it will not be accepted.

2414
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,200
We will not put it in the ranking.

2415
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,320
It will not win.

2416
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,720
July 31st, there's your fucking deadline.

2417
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:38,680
It's in stone.

2418
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,120
Don't forget to actually post it.

2419
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:40,520
There you go.

2420
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,960
Because, you know, some people...

2421
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,000
Don't forget to post it.

2422
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,640
If you send it,

2423
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,320
if you've finished it July 1st,

2424
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,640
and you forget to send that shit till August 1st,

2425
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,280
you're banned.

2426
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,720
And don't forget to use the hashtag.

2427
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,800
Use that hashtag PCP theme, people.

2428
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:52,760
You've got to use that so we can see it.

2429
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,960
That's how we're looking for them.

2430
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,360
So if you don't hashtag it, we don't see it.

2431
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,880
Nate, Nate, I meant you.

2432
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:00,040
Don't forget to post it on Twitter and stuff.

2433
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,240
Because, you know, some people might want...

2434
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,280
Yeah, if you posted to Twitter,

2435
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:04,680
hashtag PCP theme, you got to do that.

2436
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,040
You got to get it to do it in some way.

2437
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,320
So, I mean, you could even...

2438
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,040
Don't email me.

2439
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,240
Give me a link on Twitter.

2440
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:09,800
Do that.

2441
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,760
That's what's helpful.

2442
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,800
Some people actually did, like, email me links,

2443
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,320
and I just asked them to post it on Twitter.

2444
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:15,800
And then they did.

2445
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:16,760
But speaking of which...

2446
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,200
It's that way all of us can see it.

2447
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:19,400
That's right.

2448
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:20,680
And so we can easily use it here.

2449
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,360
Plus, like, if you give me an MP3, again,

2450
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,560
like, we can't listen to one on the show,

2451
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,080
you got to give me a link to listen to it

2452
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,440
so we can all listen on the show.

2453
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:27,160
And speaking of which,

2454
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,200
do we want to do any more questions

2455
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,240
or shall we go to our...

2456
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,680
I've got a pretty good one.

2457
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,800
All right, let's wrap it up.

2458
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:35,240
By Axelran, what is your favorite anime fight?

2459
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,120
Oh, for fuck's sake.

2460
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,280
That's almost as bad as what's your favorite anime.

2461
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,240
Rock Lee vs. Kara is a classic.

2462
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,640
You might say it's supposed to be that.

2463
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,320
I mean, it's not...

2464
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:46,520
It's not a traditional...

2465
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,240
I mean, I don't know,

2466
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,160
like, the final moment of Gurren Lagann

2467
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:50,040
is sort of a battle.

2468
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,120
Like, that's one of my favorite moments of all time.

2469
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:52,840
Sort of a battle.

2470
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:53,800
It's definitely a battle.

2471
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:54,600
Okay, it's definitely a battle,

2472
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,880
but it's not like a normal, like,

2473
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,040
slug fest shown in Naruto-style battle.

2474
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,640
It's like a mech, you know,

2475
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,560
doing something at the size of the fucking universe,

2476
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,240
like, continually being broken down

2477
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,080
as, like, a guy, like, keeps plunging forward

2478
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:05,800
through the other carriers.

2479
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,920
Yeah, it's a hell of a time for shit.

2480
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,440
I mean, it's, like, the coolest thing ever.

2481
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,920
But I think I'm actually gonna say it if I want, though.

2482
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,440
It is basically the coolest thing ever.

2483
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:16,200
Like, Bellamy vs. Luffy in one piece

2484
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,880
is definitely one of the greatest...

2485
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,600
And again, that's also kind of a subversion of a fight,

2486
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,720
but it is one of the most...

2487
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,920
Like, I've read so many shounen,

2488
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,360
and seen so many shounen fights,

2489
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,920
that the subversion with the Bellamy moment

2490
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,160
is, to this day, one of the most amazing moments

2491
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,120
in all of one piece.

2492
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,560
It's unfortunately...

2493
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:32,920
Well, no, I'm just gonna say

2494
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,120
that it's one of the best moments ever.

2495
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:34,920
That's all.

2496
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:35,160
It's great.

2497
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,440
I don't like fights in media.

2498
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,280
Like, it's not like, I don't...

2499
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,360
It's not like I'm not against them, it's just...

2500
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,200
Nate, you've said that yourself multiple times.

2501
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,480
No, it's just like...

2502
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,120
I don't like...

2503
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:50,040
I don't like watching the fights.

2504
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,880
Like, I don't find them entertaining.

2505
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,000
I guess that's what I mean.

2506
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,040
You want to be there.

2507
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,560
Yeah, she's frustrated.

2508
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,800
She can't actually be killing someone right now.

2509
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,720
My brain just starts tuning out.

2510
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,480
If it drags on for too long,

2511
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:03,400
I stop paying attention to what's happening

2512
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,280
because I'm just...

2513
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:04,840
I don't...

2514
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,400
I don't...

2515
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,840
I don't know why I just don't.

2516
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,520
I can't pay attention too long.

2517
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,360
As Tom was saying, I actually sort of agree

2518
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,040
because the thing with fights that I always say

2519
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,320
is that anime fights,

2520
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,520
or any fights in any...

2521
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:17,960
including like Game of Thrones, whatever,

2522
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:21,240
I don't really care about the fight.

2523
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,480
I care about who is won at the end.

2524
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,480
That's like, narratively what matters.

2525
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,240
It doesn't really matter how they got there.

2526
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:31,640
But like, fights are just like fun in anime a lot of the time.

2527
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,080
I'm like torn on it because like,

2528
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,920
I definitely like the spectacle pieces

2529
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:37,240
of like really crazy choreographed fights.

2530
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,080
But at the same time, like there's...

2531
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:40,520
I have like a hard limit, you know?

2532
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,280
Because eventually, like Dragon Ball Z,

2533
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,440
I don't know how I made it through Dragon Ball Z as a kid.

2534
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,320
Like, it's so hard.

2535
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:45,560
How did I...

2536
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,200
I don't...

2537
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,400
How did I...

2538
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,760
Wow, it's sorry.

2539
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,440
Realization just hit with me.

2540
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:52,280
That's what I like about my girl.

2541
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:52,920
Did you watch Dragon Ball Z, bitch?

2542
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,800
I watched Dragon Ball Z.

2543
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:59,960
I cried when they stopped airing it on TV.

2544
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:03,000
I put the date on my phone that I don't have anymore,

2545
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
exactly the date that they stopped airing,

2546
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,600
and I cried and I said,

2547
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,600
every year I'll cry on this day.

2548
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,560
Damn, dude.

2549
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,520
That's incredible.

2550
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:13,560
That's hardcore.

2551
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,000
That's so anime.

2552
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,440
That is so anime.

2553
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:21,880
My favorite anime fight is from Dragon Ball.

2554
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:26,120
Tension Hand, as it's written in the manga.

2555
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,240
No, versus Goku.

2556
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:29,880
Yeah, okay.

2557
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,080
But when, you know, Tension Hand was still like a villain,

2558
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:34,440
and Goku was a little boy,

2559
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:38,280
that fight between them is like one of the most...

2560
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:38,920
Like, it's...

2561
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,040
I've never seen a reddit.

2562
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:40,920
I gotta do that, man.

2563
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,520
You gotta read it.

2564
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,200
It is better than Dragon Ball Z in every way.

2565
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,720
Dragon Ball, I believe, is infinitely better than DBZ.

2566
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,800
Like, by a titanic margin.

2567
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:48,600
Okay, quickly.

2568
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,160
The thing is, like, with the fights...

2569
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,440
Fuckin' general blue as well.

2570
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:53,160
Holy shit.

2571
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:53,800
I'm gonna Google him.

2572
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,520
I don't know who he is.

2573
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:55,640
Yeah, I don't...

2574
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,080
Like I said, I don't like watching the fights,

2575
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,760
but I do like certain fights,

2576
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,680
like, aren't necessarily just pure action.

2577
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,600
Like, you know, they pause,

2578
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,800
and like, maybe, you know,

2579
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,040
have a narration of what's going on,

2580
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,560
or something that will what it means,

2581
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,920
what this means, and stuff like that.

2582
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,840
It's a little hard to explain what exactly.

2583
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,120
Do you mean like an ongoing struggle?

2584
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,080
I guess, kind of, like...

2585
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:19,640
I guess a fight I like,

2586
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:20,680
not necessarily my favorite,

2587
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,040
but one I can actually remember,

2588
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,440
was the last few episodes of this anime.

2589
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,960
Now I don't remember how The Enemy was called.

2590
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,640
It was this anime where, like,

2591
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:32,120
creations came into the real world,

2592
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:35,800
and sort of fought the Hatsune Miku of that world.

2593
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:37,000
What?

2594
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,480
Wait, are you talking about...

2595
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,360
Is that the one with Saiyan the Cat girl?

2596
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,040
You know, no one talking about?

2597
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,040
Show by Rock?

2598
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:46,840
No, no, no, no, no.

2599
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:50,120
The anime was like these characters

2600
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,760
from animes, mangas, and games, and stuff like that.

2601
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:56,600
They were brought into the real world, quote, unquote.

2602
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,200
Is that Gate? Is that Gate?

2603
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:58,760
Is that the one?

2604
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,280
Not this and something.

2605
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:00,840
Okay, I don't know.

2606
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:01,880
I'm just fucking guessing.

2607
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,760
I don't have any fucking idea.

2608
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,720
But yeah, the main antagonist was sort of like

2609
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,600
the representation of Hatsune Miku.

2610
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,520
Because of the backstories,

2611
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,600
and a lot of the characters are resemblance

2612
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:17,480
of other anime characters, or several anime characters.

2613
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:21,480
It was like this little boy that had like a huge mech.

2614
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,640
It was like a huge mech pilot,

2615
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,320
and there was this girl with red hair,

2616
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,600
and she also had a mech,

2617
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,200
but she came to the world without the mech.

2618
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:31,160
And it was such a fun anime.

2619
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:32,520
It was an original anime as well.

2620
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:33,720
It doesn't have a manga,

2621
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:37,240
but I think the manga is going to be published.

2622
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,920
But yeah, it was a really fun.

2623
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:40,120
It was a really nice anime.

2624
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:40,760
I quite liked it.

2625
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,280
The pacing was a little bit off,

2626
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:45,640
but I think it dragged on someplace.

2627
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,480
I liked the final battle,

2628
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,480
because in the end,

2629
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,160
like the Hatsune Miku,

2630
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:53,240
she was like all-powerful,

2631
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:57,000
and they tried to defeat her,

2632
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,920
but they couldn't,

2633
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,200
and they tried different ways,

2634
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,120
and they had all these plans built up,

2635
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:04,360
and the way she got defeated,

2636
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,880
in a way, it felt like a cop-out,

2637
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:08,360
at the same time, it felt fitting.

2638
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:10,760
I quite liked it.

2639
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:15,160
I liked the whole segment of them fighting against her,

2640
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,080
and losing, and it's just,

2641
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:18,680
I don't know, it was neat.

2642
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,760
Fucking Hatsune Miku,

2643
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,880
god-level power.

2644
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:24,600
That sounds pretty cool.

2645
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:25,320
I want to watch this,

2646
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:25,960
whatever it is now.

2647
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:26,360
You've been treating me.

2648
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,480
She's a god-level meme in real life.

2649
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,920
It has my husband in it,

2650
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,080
so it's like my husbando,

2651
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:32,840
my guy food.

2652
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:35,400
I liked episode three of Kill La Kill,

2653
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,680
Satsuki versus Ryuko.

2654
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:38,280
It was one of those fucking things.

2655
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,560
There are so many good fights.

2656
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,640
I'm such a sucker for anime fights.

2657
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:42,440
They make me so happy.

2658
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,400
I mean, they're so good.

2659
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:45,640
They're really just the coolest thing ever.

2660
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:48,440
I mean, I guess just some off the top of my head,

2661
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,440
I really like the ending to Guren Lagin.

2662
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:55,400
G Gundam, that shit was hype as fuck.

2663
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:56,280
I love G Gundam.

2664
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,600
I really like, I mean, I've watched this one,

2665
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:00,200
I rewatched the most recently,

2666
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,560
is the All Might versus No Move Fight from the first season

2667
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,280
of My Hero Academia.

2668
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:04,840
It's so fucking hype.

2669
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,680
You just punched him so many times, dude.

2670
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,880
It's only three minutes.

2671
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:08,680
It's three minutes,

2672
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,360
and it's exactly as long as it needs to be.

2673
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:11,000
It's so nice.

2674
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,480
If you want to rewatch the Frieza fight,

2675
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,520
it's like seven hours.

2676
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:15,960
You rewatch the All Might versus No Move,

2677
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:16,760
it's three minutes,

2678
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,000
and it's fucking tight, and it works, and it's dope.

2679
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:23,880
Oh, and one last one for me, Bellamy versus Luffy.

2680
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:24,200
Indeed.

2681
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:24,760
In the Jaya arc.

2682
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,640
So you agree with me.

2683
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:26,760
So that was my, that's why I said it.

2684
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:28,120
Recreators, there we go.

2685
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:28,760
Oh, did you say that?

2686
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,520
I did say that exact one, yes.

2687
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:33,240
Sir, and guys, recreators, that's the anime.

2688
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,040
Recreators, oh, okay.

2689
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,640
I've heard people say that was good.

2690
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,000
Also, people say that was shit, but fair enough.

2691
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,880
No, it's just as good.

2692
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:42,520
It has my husband in itself, of course it's good.

2693
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:43,320
So it must be good.

2694
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,120
Makes sense to me.

2695
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:47,320
By the way, I just want to say that when you mentioned

2696
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:50,920
that General Blue was like the best fight ever, Gib,

2697
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,320
I googled General Blue,

2698
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,240
and I think that you must definitely be right,

2699
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,360
because look at this image.

2700
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:57,800
Please edit this in, sir.

2701
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:58,600
It's in the main chat.

2702
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,760
Look at what's happening at this moment

2703
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,920
between these two heroic characters.

2704
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,480
This is clearly the best shonen fight of all time.

2705
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,520
I like where this is going.

2706
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:08,920
This is one of his,

2707
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:12,680
I mean, this is when guns were still useful in Dragon Ball.

2708
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,480
Yeah, yeah.

2709
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,600
Would that have killed Goku?

2710
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,960
Because he's like resistant bullets, isn't he?

2711
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:17,800
That's a shotgun to the face.

2712
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:20,680
He probably would have been hurt, I'm not sure.

2713
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,360
Pull the fucking trigger, General Blue.

2714
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,200
I want to see a boy die.

2715
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,240
Don't quote me on this.

2716
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,160
This is during the Red Ribbon Armour, right?

2717
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:27,960
Yeah, that's right.

2718
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,920
Yeah, this is the Red Ribbon in general.

2719
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:31,240
Well, at this point, isn't Goku tanking like rocket launchers?

2720
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,160
Yeah, yeah, don't quote me on this,

2721
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,960
but I think Goku did take a shotgun to the head

2722
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,120
and it hurt him like a peace shooter.

2723
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:39,320
Bullets hurt him.

2724
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:40,760
Oh, you know what?

2725
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,560
He may have shot it,

2726
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,400
and then his head was knocked back

2727
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,120
and then he moved his head back like, ow, my nose.

2728
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,440
Yeah, like bullets, he feels bullets,

2729
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:51,960
but it's like when we get smacked.

2730
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,640
Don't overanalyze it.

2731
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,480
Just enjoy it for what it is.

2732
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:58,600
No, no, no, no, this is a serious analysis

2733
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:02,200
of this one frame of Dragon Ball episode 240, whatever.

2734
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,880
What a fucking badass, I have to,

2735
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,080
I need to go read Dragon Ball.

2736
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,200
I've been meaning to for like a fucking decade.

2737
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,800
All you gotta do is change his hair to brown.

2738
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:08,680
It's basically you.

2739
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:13,320
Okay, so moving on from there, we're done with questions.

2740
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:17,960
It's time for the PCP theme contest portion of our program here.

2741
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:21,000
So as we said before, hashtag PCP themes,

2742
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,600
send us on Twitter using that shit.

2743
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:25,560
I mean, that's really the only way that we'll get them.

2744
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,600
If you're in the fucking Discord, the fan Discord,

2745
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:30,600
or the patron Discord, you can submit them there

2746
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:33,640
in like the fan art section, but the Twitter is even easier.

2747
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,040
And you gotta give us a link to either a SoundCloud

2748
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:38,680
or a YouTube link, and maybe something else,

2749
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,680
but we can't play anything else on the show.

2750
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:43,240
So SoundCloud or YouTube, please, sir.

2751
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,560
We got a couple that weren't that, and they had to fix them.

2752
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,080
So just letting you know.

2753
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:48,920
All right, so let's see what we got here.

2754
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,640
Our first one up here, let's see who's first.

2755
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:55,080
Okay, first is from John J. Renz.

2756
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:58,760
This is a theme called Let's Jack Off.

2757
01:45:59,400 --> 01:45:59,960
It's the name of it.

2758
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:00,920
Wait, okay, hang on.

2759
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,760
Okay, all right.

2760
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:09,320
And here, we fucking, hang on, go.

2761
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,120
Whoa.

2762
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,480
You know, this is my genius.

2763
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:24,120
Wait.

2764
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:33,880
Oh, shit.

2765
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:40,440
This is great.

2766
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,720
This is an excellent shit.

2767
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:44,680
Oh my god.

2768
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,720
Jesus Christ.

2769
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,120
I mean, this is, this is pretty great.

2770
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,840
I mean, it is.

2771
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:16,040
It's, I feel like his words are like indecipherable.

2772
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,120
Oh my god.

2773
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,600
Okay, that was incredible.

2774
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,920
John J. Renzel.

2775
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:27,240
But like, I really couldn't fucking tell what you were saying.

2776
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,640
He did include the lyrics in his SoundCloud link.

2777
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:32,360
So if you, if you go to that here, I'll just paste in the thing here.

2778
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,440
You can see like what they were.

2779
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,600
I, this was clearly like mostly based on,

2780
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,800
wait, I pasted the wrong chat.

2781
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,640
This is mostly based on the like, the Jesse's theme that he made.

2782
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:42,040
Correct.

2783
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,640
I could tell that much.

2784
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:45,160
I mean, that sounded cool.

2785
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:49,960
There was a lot going on there, but like the fucking,

2786
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,760
like, are you a native English speaker, sir?

2787
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,040
I love the piano like diddly doodly.

2788
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:54,840
What was that good one?

2789
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:58,760
I love the, the, the, you know, the sort of like, you know,

2790
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:03,160
what's the word to describe the haphazard piano doodly.

2791
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:03,400
Yeah.

2792
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,200
Yeah.

2793
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:04,840
That was great.

2794
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:12,280
I'm kind of at a loss for words, uh, after listening to that.

2795
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,720
That was so much like fighting.

2796
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:16,440
You can't really respond to that with words.

2797
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:16,920
It's true.

2798
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,480
That would act.

2799
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,280
It's true.

2800
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:21,640
I mean, could you hear that like being at the beginning of the show?

2801
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:22,280
I think I could.

2802
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:23,240
Good question.

2803
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:26,680
I mean, I'm, I mean, that is pretty good.

2804
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:31,960
I'm leaning towards no personally only because it's so strange.

2805
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:33,160
I like the music.

2806
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:35,880
Like it's really, dude, just like us.

2807
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:36,760
Oh my God.

2808
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,040
That's like perfect and stuff.

2809
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,800
Uh, I mean, I prefer it to a generic rock beat.

2810
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:42,920
It certainly has personality.

2811
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:43,640
I mean, I agree.

2812
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,920
I agree with that.

2813
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:46,840
I'll give you this.

2814
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:49,160
It's definitely better for the next one to be a generic rock beat.

2815
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:54,440
That's way better than like, uh, just the, one of these like boring, like no words.

2816
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,120
Like there was way more heart in that.

2817
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:01,800
Um, but it was like kind of just strange and hard to understand what the hell was going on.

2818
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:07,400
And also, I mean, this is totally subjective, but it didn't sound like to me the kind of tone

2819
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,560
I would want to like kick off a show.

2820
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:12,680
That's, uh, that, that, that is what I have to say about it, I guess.

2821
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,480
But like, none of these are getting like ruled out immediately.

2822
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,480
We'll like confer on these just as time goes.

2823
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,640
And after we reach the deadline and we'll like listen back.

2824
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:22,600
When we get closer to the deadline, we'll be like, uh, so what are the contenders?

2825
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,960
Yeah, we'll probably make a fine.

2826
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:24,920
We'll go over them.

2827
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:25,480
Yeah.

2828
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:29,160
We'll, we'll do something where we like talk about like the final ones and review all the

2829
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,800
finalists and stuff and see what was, what's the best one.

2830
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:35,000
Um, and then completely ignore all of them.

2831
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:35,800
Definitely possible.

2832
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:39,960
As just like Digi drops some fire and makes his own theme.

2833
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:41,560
Yes.

2834
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,040
Well, okay.

2835
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:43,400
I mean, that's it for that one.

2836
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:43,800
Okay.

2837
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,840
Next one is what the fuck is it?

2838
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,320
All right.

2839
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:47,640
Themes.

2840
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:48,040
Here we go.

2841
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,080
Fucking.

2842
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:51,400
All right.

2843
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:51,720
Hang on.

2844
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:52,600
Okay.

2845
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:53,000
Here we go.

2846
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,680
Next theme is from, uh, Das Exemptionist Biggles.

2847
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:02,440
Oh, he's an exceptionist like, like made famous by the PCP in that episode of pyramid schemes.

2848
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:03,960
Remember that one?

2849
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:04,760
I remember that one.

2850
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:05,240
I don't.

2851
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:05,480
I don't.

2852
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,000
PC, hashtag, PCPermits scheme.

2853
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,200
Still, still in effect.

2854
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:08,920
It's still in effect.

2855
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,120
Still give us all your money.

2856
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:10,920
Uh, patreon.com.

2857
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,200
Slice the burqrassinators.

2858
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:12,440
Uh, okay.

2859
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:12,920
Here we go.

2860
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:19,160
Okay.

2861
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:25,800
This is an art house, uh, film.

2862
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:28,040
I like it.

2863
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:29,960
Oh, it's called a Das article.

2864
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:30,920
Is the name of the song.

2865
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,800
It's German.

2866
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:33,880
Yeah.

2867
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,000
Definitely a German boy.

2868
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:38,760
Hmm.

2869
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:40,520
This.

2870
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:41,080
It's interesting.

2871
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:43,720
Oh, is it already going?

2872
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,920
It's fading out now, I think.

2873
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:47,800
Oh.

2874
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,360
No, it's just getting quiet.

2875
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:50,760
All right.

2876
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:51,880
It's just getting quiet.

2877
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:52,680
That's part of the theme.

2878
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:55,000
It's fading to the words, I guess.

2879
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:56,840
Whoa.

2880
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:58,200
Um, okay.

2881
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:01,000
That was a little, that was a little scribbly scrably for me.

2882
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,200
Uh, I agree.

2883
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:02,920
I agree.

2884
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:03,880
It was definitely a little.

2885
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:05,080
Yeah, go on.

2886
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:08,520
Fucking out there, but it also kind of felt PCP-ish to me.

2887
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Like that, that.

2888
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,800
No, not for an intro to the, to the episode.

2889
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,520
It's just, it doesn't want to have this intro, but it definitely,

2890
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:19,080
I felt like it kind of hit on our eclectic.

2891
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,600
I do like all these people having.

2892
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,400
I definitely like that.

2893
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:26,520
Interpretating the PCP in music and having their own takes on

2894
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:28,680
how the PCP sounds is music.

2895
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:28,840
Me too.

2896
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:29,640
It's really fun.

2897
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:30,440
That's pretty dope.

2898
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:31,400
Yeah.

2899
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,600
This, this one definitely felt like like an, an RT like

2900
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:38,200
noise experimental animation or something.

2901
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:38,520
Yeah.

2902
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:41,080
Like I could see like squares and lines like moving across

2903
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:42,600
and going all bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

2904
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:44,520
I, yeah, definitely.

2905
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,760
Uh, but I, I, I've been generally with, I liked it,

2906
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,440
but I'm not sure it works as a theme.

2907
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:49,240
That's, that's what I'm saying.

2908
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,520
Uh, okay.

2909
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,040
Let's do, let's do one or two more here.

2910
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:54,920
Uh, one's from at Captain Thought One.

2911
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:57,400
Captain Thought One, or whatever, Captain Thought.

2912
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:00,840
Uh, this is one called, uh, this is called Cursed Video.

2913
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,000
Cursed, or Cursed Videos.

2914
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,720
Okay, here we go.

2915
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:05,480
Let's see what you got, Captain Thought.

2916
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,680
Welcome to the PCP.

2917
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:11,160
Grab your boys and grab some beans.

2918
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,720
Hope nobody interrupts me.

2919
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,800
Ben is always squeaky clean.

2920
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:18,840
Is that it?

2921
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:20,840
Okay.

2922
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:21,800
Just said prep training.

2923
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:25,160
I did like that, to grab some beans.

2924
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:25,800
Now the old, okay.

2925
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,840
Here's what I'll say about that.

2926
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:31,080
If you, if you, if you mentioned specific things about like

2927
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:34,520
individual members of the PCP, I immediately have a problem.

2928
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:37,720
If you only mentioned like two people and nobody else,

2929
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,760
you know what I mean?

2930
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:41,720
It's like, I feel like there should either be like

2931
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:45,960
group references, uh, or it should be like everyone gets a mention.

2932
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:46,840
You think, you know what I mean?

2933
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:49,720
You think of like the anime openings, like you always have

2934
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:53,000
all the characters come across, uh, with their face at least once,

2935
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,880
at least a little bit.

2936
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:55,720
That's, yeah, that's how I feel about that.

2937
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:00,520
Also, that was definitely, uh, not hype enough to be an intro theme song.

2938
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,120
But, uh, I appreciate the work.

2939
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:02,760
Thanks, buddy.

2940
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:04,200
Let's see.

2941
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:05,800
Tom, any thoughts?

2942
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:06,360
Any thoughts?

2943
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:08,200
Uh, plus one for bean reference.

2944
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,120
But yeah, I agree with what you said about it.

2945
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,200
But that, I did like beans.

2946
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,240
Beans are good.

2947
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:13,960
Okay.

2948
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,200
You know what?

2949
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:14,760
There's three more.

2950
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:15,480
I'm having a great time.

2951
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:17,080
Let's just listen to the next three.

2952
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:17,800
Let's fucking go for it.

2953
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,120
Yeah.

2954
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,160
Let's go for it.

2955
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:19,560
All right.

2956
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,680
Let's, let me pull this up.

2957
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:20,920
Okay.

2958
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:23,480
This is from Augie Main.

2959
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:25,400
And it's called, I just want to die.

2960
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,040
Same.

2961
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:26,680
Oh God.

2962
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:29,400
This is a PCP theme, not my theme.

2963
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:29,640
What the fuck?

2964
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:30,360
Yeah, I know, right?

2965
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:31,720
Okay.

2966
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,280
Here we go.

2967
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:35,320
Play now.

2968
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:41,080
Okay.

2969
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:41,960
It's like Ape Escape.

2970
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:43,640
Is that what that is?

2971
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,680
No, it's, it sounds like an Ape Escape song.

2972
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:53,000
Maybe a bit chiller than Ape Escape.

2973
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,440
This is quite chilly.

2974
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,640
Ooh, I gotta put on a sweater.

2975
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,320
Okay.

2976
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:10,760
Hilarious.

2977
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:13,400
And then he died.

2978
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,200
I loved it.

2979
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:15,240
Then he died at the end.

2980
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:15,880
I liked it.

2981
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:16,840
I liked it too.

2982
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:19,320
I feel, I feel, I feel kinship to it.

2983
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:20,520
Yeah.

2984
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:20,920
Yeah.

2985
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:21,800
I mean, I liked it, but you know.

2986
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:22,760
It's like hype enough.

2987
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:24,680
The hype, not what I'm looking for,

2988
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,880
not what I'm looking for.

2989
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:28,280
And that could be like the intro to like,

2990
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:30,600
hello and welcome to the suicide cast.

2991
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:31,560
That's true.

2992
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:32,040
That's true.

2993
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:32,520
That's tall.

2994
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:36,040
I'd use that as an outro theme for Wine Chamber.

2995
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:36,680
Makes sense.

2996
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:37,400
Yeah.

2997
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:37,880
That'd be good.

2998
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,920
That'd be good.

2999
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:39,560
Yeah, definitely.

3000
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,400
I wonder if these guys would mind if we just like

3001
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,160
use these for other stuff.

3002
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:43,720
Probably not.

3003
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:44,280
I don't know.

3004
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:45,400
Ask me if that's okay.

3005
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:45,880
I love the creativity here.

3006
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:47,000
Yeah.

3007
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:50,280
I mean, I think I said something about like,

3008
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,600
we don't have to use any of these if we don't like them.

3009
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,040
We should also add a clause to like,

3010
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:55,960
but we can use them for whatever we want.

3011
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,160
They, oh, we own them now.

3012
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:58,040
I do.

3013
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,480
If you tweet us with that hashtag, it's over.

3014
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,120
You signed away all your rights by using the hashtag.

3015
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:03,160
That's right.

3016
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:06,040
They signed their rights away as soon as they opened Episode 1.

3017
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:06,840
They just haven't realized it yet.

3018
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:07,320
That's true.

3019
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,200
That's definitely true.

3020
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:12,200
I did love that one, but it was more of an outro than an intro.

3021
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:12,520
Yeah.

3022
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:14,120
Yeah.

3023
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:16,200
Well, I definitely thought that was cool and chill.

3024
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:16,760
I like it.

3025
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:17,880
I do like it.

3026
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:19,240
For a theme, for an opening theme.

3027
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:22,600
It sounded like a Steven Universe song playing in the distance.

3028
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:23,240
Whoa.

3029
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:23,880
Yeah, it did.

3030
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:25,000
That is on point.

3031
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:25,640
Yes.

3032
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:26,440
Totally true.

3033
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,920
You know those meme videos that are like,

3034
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:31,480
Redbone, but it's playing one room over.

3035
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:33,240
And it's all like muffled sounding.

3036
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:33,960
I remember that.

3037
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,080
It's kind of like, I love that.

3038
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:37,960
It's like, it's like Steven listening in on his dad saying,

3039
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:40,120
oh, just from a guy like, dad, no.

3040
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:42,280
Okay.

3041
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:43,400
What do we got here?

3042
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,960
Another one from Robert J. Lazarus.

3043
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:49,000
And this is called PCP Theme RJL.

3044
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:50,680
All right then.

3045
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:51,720
Here we go.

3046
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:52,920
What do you got for us, Rob?

3047
01:55:59,160 --> 01:55:59,480
Okay.

3048
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:08,840
By the way, wait, what?

3049
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,880
Do you say Ben's usually wrong about most things?

3050
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:19,160
Because if you notice, the album cover for this is Ben's face with the words PCP just all around it.

3051
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:19,640
Amazing.

3052
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:20,600
Oh, amazing.

3053
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:24,120
If you go to the Robote Nazi Techno state thing where I'm playing all the bots,

3054
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:26,120
you can see the album covers for like each of these.

3055
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:27,720
They're pretty.

3056
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,160
Maybe we should edit these in.

3057
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:29,880
I don't know.

3058
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:30,760
I did last time.

3059
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:31,480
I'll edit them in.

3060
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,040
Oh, you did?

3061
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:32,680
Oh, that'd be cool.

3062
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:33,400
That'd be cool then.

3063
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:35,320
This Ben, I really love this Ben's face.

3064
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,280
This whole thing is excellent.

3065
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,120
What an expression.

3066
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:42,440
What a face of disdain.

3067
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:44,600
I'm not going to bullshit it, Rob.

3068
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:48,360
That was a little amateurish for a professional operation like the PCP here.

3069
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:51,400
We're looking for a little bit higher standards.

3070
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:53,400
I mean, I could tell that was the point.

3071
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,640
Just like, Ben sucks.

3072
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:56,280
Like that was the thing.

3073
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:56,600
Yeah.

3074
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:57,960
I mean, I did love that.

3075
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:59,880
Message received, man.

3076
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:00,680
Message received.

3077
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,000
Hardly agreed with.

3078
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:04,280
Okay.

3079
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,880
And we got one more here.

3080
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:09,960
And this guy submitted actually 36 minutes after we started recording.

3081
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,240
Oh, this is some cool album cover.

3082
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:12,680
It's like, oh fuck, stop, stop.

3083
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:15,560
This is like, I mean, you'll see when I paste it there.

3084
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:18,360
It's like this blue version of the PCP boys.

3085
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:20,040
Oh, I think you actually redrew them.

3086
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:20,600
Okay, whatever.

3087
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:21,320
Let me paste this shit.

3088
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,560
So this is from Artur.

3089
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,320
Artur, I believe his name.

3090
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,560
And this is PCP theme demo.

3091
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:28,440
All right.

3092
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:28,920
Here we go.

3093
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:31,400
Begin.

3094
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:36,360
Oh.

3095
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:39,160
Ooh.

3096
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:41,160
Okay.

3097
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:53,160
Yeah.

3098
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:07,160
Okay.

3099
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:07,880
All right.

3100
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,120
I did not understand a single word.

3101
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:12,040
But that was hype.

3102
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:12,760
That was hype.

3103
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:14,440
I want to go back and look at the words.

3104
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:16,840
They're not posted on the SoundCloud, but that was pretty sick.

3105
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:17,880
That's yeah.

3106
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,240
And I like the mixing.

3107
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:22,200
I like the voice, how it sounded compared to the guitar.

3108
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:23,000
And I like the thumbnail.

3109
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,280
This guy put some work into this.

3110
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:27,080
Yeah.

3111
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:27,400
Good.

3112
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:27,880
Yeah.

3113
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:33,000
If I knew the lyrics, I mean, I don't really care to know what the lyrics are,

3114
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,120
as long as it sounds pretty cool.

3115
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:34,760
I'm serious though.

3116
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,600
But I would like them to be like, understand them.

3117
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:37,400
Yeah, I'm a lyric.

3118
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:37,960
That is true.

3119
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:41,320
He says this is a demo, so he might be able to like, make it better.

3120
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,120
That's true.

3121
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:48,040
If I have any criteria at all for like the opening, what I always look for like,

3122
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:52,200
it wouldn't be startling and it wouldn't hurt people's ears.

3123
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:54,280
That's what I usually look for.

3124
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:57,160
And this is both startling and with

3125
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:00,120
probably be a little obnoxious to listen to.

3126
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:04,840
I mean, I like the way it sounds, but like as soon as it starts playing,

3127
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:09,080
I feel like if I was a listener, I would just probably want to click away.

3128
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:14,680
We shouldn't forget that the PCB is a cold-blooded capitalist engine.

3129
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:18,440
It's a cold machine for profit exclusively.

3130
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:22,200
So we're looking to appeal to that mass demographic on a wide audience.

3131
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:26,200
If that's our game plan, we've got a lot of adjustments we're going to make.

3132
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:28,040
It's true.

3133
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:30,520
We're going to have to fire everyone.

3134
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,520
All of us will be fired immediately.

3135
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:33,880
Only the logo will live on.

3136
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,840
Yeah, well, I don't know.

3137
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:40,760
I liked it, but I do think, I mean, this is a demo.

3138
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:42,280
I don't know if there was an updated version.

3139
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:45,160
I don't know if I'm alone in this,

3140
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,960
but I would be interested in hearing an instrumental version as well.

3141
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,120
Yeah.

3142
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:54,680
Well, I mean, my favorite part about this is like the difference between like the guitar

3143
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:55,480
and the voices.

3144
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:55,720
You work well together, too.

3145
01:59:58,120 --> 01:59:58,680
I like it.

3146
01:59:58,680 --> 01:59:59,240
I'm curious.

3147
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,120
It's well produced or whatever the word is.

3148
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:03,640
I want some more development on this.

3149
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:05,560
I want some dialogue.

3150
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,600
I want some refinements.

3151
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,320
I want the demo dropped, and I want the final dropped in,

3152
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:11,400
and I want to check back and want to see how it goes.

3153
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:16,920
I want some diagetic music that is like it's real.

3154
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,160
And we are singing it every time.

3155
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:22,040
Every time we record, it's like it's...

3156
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:22,920
A catchy melody.

3157
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:25,400
And this didn't put much emphasis on the melody,

3158
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:27,400
you know, as a hip hopper type track.

3159
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:30,600
It does feel a bit like a digi thing,

3160
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,920
or like not as a digi.

3161
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:35,240
I mean, I don't even mind this.

3162
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:37,800
Like I could see myself using something along these lines,

3163
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:38,680
but I don't know.

3164
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,320
It's pretty good.

3165
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:41,480
Pretty good.

3166
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,200
That's what I say.

3167
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:42,680
Pretty good.

3168
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:43,560
That is pretty good.

3169
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:46,440
I'll definitely keep this one in mind as we progress.

3170
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:47,880
All right.

3171
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:48,600
You got one more?

3172
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:50,280
That was the last one.

3173
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:51,320
Oh, that was the last one.

3174
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,200
All right, we're good.

3175
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:52,600
We're fucking...

3176
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:52,840
We did it.

3177
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:55,160
So we're all done with the fucking PCP themes.

3178
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,760
So we'll keep them coming, people.

3179
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:59,320
July 31st, Harry Potter's birthday.

3180
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:00,840
That's on purpose.

3181
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:02,680
That's the finale.

3182
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:04,040
Voldemort killed Harry on that day.

3183
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:07,480
Who will be the PCP boy who lived?

3184
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:08,040
And their theme?

3185
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:08,520
Exactly.

3186
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,040
Only one of you get to live.

3187
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:11,320
It's the one we choose to put the theme.

3188
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:13,720
The rest of you are murdered by Voldemort, a.k.a.

3189
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:14,600
Much.

3190
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:15,320
A.k.a. Davoo.

3191
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:15,880
Mage.

3192
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:16,680
Oh, right, Mage.

3193
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:17,160
That's true.

3194
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:18,280
All right.

3195
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:20,120
Well, the last part of our fucking show here

3196
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,720
is due to the little fan art corner.

3197
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:23,560
So let's see what we got here.

3198
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:25,800
Let's take a look over at our fucking fan art.

3199
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,800
We got a couple good ones.

3200
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,320
We got this first one by Link's.

3201
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:29,960
Oh, yes.

3202
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:34,360
Now, Davoo asks us to read a statement regarding this.

3203
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:40,680
Davoo says that this depiction of him is in his top 20

3204
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:42,920
of Davoo depictions, and he really likes it.

3205
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,080
And this art style is cool.

3206
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:46,040
And I agree with Davoo.

3207
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:47,800
It is very fucking sick.

3208
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:49,880
Yeah, it's got a good aesthetic.

3209
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:50,760
I do like it.

3210
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:51,640
I do like it.

3211
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:54,520
I like how Munch is sort of like doing a weird stance

3212
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,280
and wistfully looking off into the distance.

3213
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:57,880
It feels very album-focused.

3214
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:58,360
Oh, yeah, it does.

3215
02:01:58,360 --> 02:01:58,840
It does.

3216
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:00,120
Now that you mention it, yeah.

3217
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:02,760
I wonder if it's based on, oh, maybe not.

3218
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:04,280
Also, I love the Kirby face.

3219
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,320
It's just kind of floating there.

3220
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,920
I like how the Kirby face is so happy,

3221
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:11,800
as opposed to everyone else looking so mellow.

3222
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:12,120
Right.

3223
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,720
Everyone else is very melancholy.

3224
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:16,520
That album cover, Disinterest, Don't Want to Be Here,

3225
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,440
but Buy Your Shit kind of thing.

3226
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:21,560
Gibbs Lyons being there is looking pretty good as well.

3227
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,840
It's pretty dope.

3228
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:23,800
Oh, yeah.

3229
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,720
That's a zero out of 10, because I'm out there.

3230
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:27,320
Oh, no.

3231
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:29,240
All right.

3232
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:29,640
What do we got?

3233
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,880
Now, we got one that was just munchy,

3234
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:33,880
but it was just munchy, so banned.

3235
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:35,640
Remember, people, it's got to be either,

3236
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:36,840
like, if it's one of us,

3237
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,080
it's got to be PCP-related in some way

3238
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,600
that's clearly communicable.

3239
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:43,160
Like, maybe Munchy and his gesture outfit

3240
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:45,400
that he wore at his lecture, that I could see.

3241
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:47,160
If it's just munchy, though.

3242
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:49,800
What if we just got all fanartididgy?

3243
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:51,480
You know, like, nobody wants that.

3244
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:52,600
Nobody wants that.

3245
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:55,160
Or me, or Gib, or anybody.

3246
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:57,800
PCP, PCP themes.

3247
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:58,360
That's the thing.

3248
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:00,360
But so, look at this one.

3249
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:03,560
From I'm a Big Boy Yeah, Caleb Adams.

3250
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:06,120
Okay, now, these are fascinating.

3251
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:08,760
So, it's me and Munchy, drawn individually,

3252
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:11,240
only it's drawn on those weird,

3253
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:15,000
like, children magnetic-filling draw paths.

3254
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,280
The, yeah.

3255
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:18,600
I don't know how those work.

3256
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:19,640
I don't know whether it's, like,

3257
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:20,280
iron filings.

3258
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:20,920
It probably isn't.

3259
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:23,320
It's sort of, like, you push down,

3260
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:25,480
and, like, the contact of the top layer

3261
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,840
and the bottom layer creates a line.

3262
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:27,160
Yeah.

3263
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:29,720
But, like, you have to, like, shake the thing,

3264
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:31,560
to, like, make them go away, or something like that.

3265
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:32,280
Right, yeah.

3266
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:32,840
It's pretty...

3267
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:32,920
I mean...

3268
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,080
No, no, I think what it is,

3269
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:37,960
it's one of those, like, it's, like, a vacuum almost,

3270
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:39,480
and then you, like, twist a knob and it lets air in.

3271
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,000
No, it's not a vacuum. They have, like, a little handle

3272
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,520
with the magnet thing, and it wipes it clean.

3273
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,440
Like, you, like, you swoop, you squish it down,

3274
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:45,560
and it wipes it away.

3275
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:46,120
Oh, yeah.

3276
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:46,920
Yeah, I think he's right.

3277
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:47,400
I think he's right.

3278
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:47,880
Yeah.

3279
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:48,600
Yeah.

3280
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:49,320
Well, whatever, man.

3281
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,200
I don't fucking know.

3282
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:51,000
They're fucking sick.

3283
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,720
It's all bad.

3284
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:53,320
I know that I'm looking at angry as fuck,

3285
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:55,720
probably for excellent reason.

3286
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:57,240
Someone has wronged me this day.

3287
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:58,520
Maybe Ben looked at me,

3288
02:03:58,520 --> 02:03:59,960
and I, he challenged my authority.

3289
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:00,920
I mean, I have to destroy him.

3290
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,920
The fact that he drew both you and Munchie,

3291
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:05,720
it seems to be, like, you got mad at Munchie,

3292
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:06,360
and then crucified it.

3293
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,000
I crucified it.

3294
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:07,480
No, he's dead.

3295
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:09,960
I think Munchie crucified himself to save us all.

3296
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:11,160
That's what I think happened.

3297
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:14,120
And, like, how, like, square, and, like,

3298
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,760
it's all sharp and pointy your images,

3299
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:19,480
but, like, Munchie's, like, a soft, round boy.

3300
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:21,240
Munchie's just all wiggly wobbly.

3301
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:24,200
I think this is an angry, distraught,

3302
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:28,280
Nate looking at his life companion,

3303
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:31,800
Munchie J. Trump, on the cross,

3304
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:33,720
and he's put his shades on

3305
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:35,480
to hide his single tear of regret.

3306
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:37,240
Oh, you know, you're probably right.

3307
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:38,200
You're probably right.

3308
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:42,120
And again, I just love the fucking gizomed

3309
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,760
of Munchie crucified on the cross

3310
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,680
with that happy-smiling Kirby shirt.

3311
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:48,680
It's truly transcendent.

3312
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:49,880
I absolutely love it.

3313
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:51,080
It literally is.

3314
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:54,120
Well, team, I think we've reached the end

3315
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:55,240
of our show for today.

3316
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:57,720

02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:01,160

Keep fighting the fight.

3322
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:08,280
Like, giving us money.

3323

Anime.

3327
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:11,320
Do that.

3328
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,640
Please give us money.

3329

$1 in your fucking discord

02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,120
with all the cool guys.

3331
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:17,000
That's a good place to be.

3332
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,440
You get the TPC feed,

3333
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:19,800
which is an extremely convenient way

3334
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:22,200
to keep track of everybody's posts in the PCP.

3335
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:23,560
It's actually like the best way to do it,

3336
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,200
in my opinion.

3337
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:27,080
Except for me, because I'm still not on there.

3338
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:28,200
But everybody else is good.

3339
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:28,520
No.

3340
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:30,280
Well, tell fucking who is it.

3341
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,120
Vindi or, I don't know.

3342
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:33,960
I have enough to change, but that's okay.

3343
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,800
We'll get it someday.

3344
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:36,440
One of these days.

3345
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:37,720
One of these days.

3346
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:38,440
And let me see.

3347
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:39,160
What else the fuck is it?

3348
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:40,440
Oh, a $5 pledge.

3349
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:42,200
You get access to all bonus episodes.

3350
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,680
There are like 15 of those motherfuckers out now.

3351
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:45,640
And they're all gold.

3352
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:47,480
The last one, they're all delicious.

3353
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:49,560
Last one's sitcoms, it was incredible.

3354
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:50,360
It was the best one.

3355
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:52,200
The best episode of the PCP, basically.

3356
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:53,560
In terms of editing, for sure.

3357
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:54,200
Yeah.

3358
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:55,240
Divu went crazy.

3359
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:57,000
He edited like a sitcom.

3360
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,280
It was so good.

3361
02:05:58,280 --> 02:05:59,240
It was so good.

3362
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:01,160
Audience laughter and all that cool stuff.

3363
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:01,640
Oh, God.

3364
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:03,240
What a great job he did.

3365
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:05,400
Beyond that, die.

3370
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:19,000
And that's it.

3371
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:19,800
And that's it.

3372
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,000

See you next time.

3374
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:23,480
Goodbye.

3375
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:24,280
Bye.

3376
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:24,920
Goodbye.

3377
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:25,480
Goodbye.

3378
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:25,960
Bye.

3379
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:26,360
Yeah.

3380
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:33,400
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3381
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:39,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3382
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,800
But I'm not working.

3383
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:44,360
I'm doing nothing.

3384
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:47,080
My dick, I'm jerking.

3385
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:49,720
Myself, I'm sucking.

3386
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:52,440
I am an asshole.

3387
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:55,080
I am a stupid.

3388
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:57,720
I've got a deadline.

3389
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,800
Don't want to do it.

3390
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:10,760
What the hell is wrong with me?
